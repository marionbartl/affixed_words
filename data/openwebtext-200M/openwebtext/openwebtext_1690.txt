Red Bull Racing says it has a drawn a line under the crash between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber in Turkey following a meeting in its factory on Thursday .
In a statement issued today , Red Bull said Webber and Vettel met with team boss Christian Horner , tech chief Adrian Newey and consultant Helmut Marko at the factory today in Milton Keynes .
" It was a positive meeting , which draws a line under the incident that happened on lap 40 of the Turkish Grand Prix .
The team is now fully focused on next week 's Canadian Grand Prix , " said the statement , which included a photograph of Vettel and Webber taken at the factory and captioned ' S*** happens ' .
" The team had got us into a great position and it was n't good for them what happened - so I 'm sorry for them that we lost the lead of the race , " said Vettel .
" Mark and I are racers and we were racing .
We are professionals and it wo n't change how we will work together going forward .
We have a great team and the spirit is very strong .
I 'm looking forward to Canada . "
Webber added : " It 's a shame for the team , as we lost a good opportunity to win the race .
It 's sport and these things can happen , but it should n't have done .
" I feel for everyone at Red Bull , at the factory and everyone involved .
Seb and I will make sure it does n't happen again and will continue to work openly together , no problem .
We have talked enough on it now , it 's done , we 're looking ahead and I 'm focused on the race in Canada next week . "
Image caption The Green Revolution brought major gains in rice yields , feeding millions
The Green Revolution of the 1960s raised crop yields and cut hunger - and also saved decades worth of greenhouse gas emissions , a study concludes .
US researchers found cumulative global emissions since 1850 would have been one third as much again without the Green Revolution 's higher yields .
Although modern farming uses more energy and chemicals , much less land needs to be cleared .
The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Converting a forest or some scrubland to an agricultural area causes a lot of natural carbon in that ecosystem to be oxidized and lost to the atmosphere , " said Steven Davis , from the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University in California .
" What our study shows is that these indirect impacts from converting land to agriculture outweigh the direct emissions that come from the modern , intensive style of agriculture . "
Hunger tackled
The researchers constructed alternative scenarios for how global society might have developed since the 1960s had the new , high - yielding Green Revolution varieties of rice , maize and other crops that raised crop yields in Asia and South America never existed .
Image caption Non-intensive agriculture would mean much greater land clearance
These new varieties turned countries such as India , which imported food in the best of times and needed emergency aid in the worst , into major exporters .
Without the new crops - but with the growth in the human population and all the other socio-economic trends seen since the 1960s - feeding the world at current levels would mean the use of more than twice as much land as is currently used for agriculture , the researchers found .
Farming this way would have required less energy and use of chemicals such as fertilisers , whose production involves emissions of CO2 and whose use generates nitrous oxide , another greenhouse gas .
However , additional emissions from the extra land clearance , releasing carbon stored in trees and soil , would have been the more important factor by far .
Meeting extra food demand this way would have released about 160 Gigatonnes ( billion tonnes ) of carbon ( GtC ) over the decades - which , the researchers note , " corresponds to 34 % of the total 478 GtC emitted by humans between 1850 and 2005 " .
" That 's about 20 years of fossil fuel burning at present rates , " observed Dr Davis .
Modern gains
Modern intensive agriculture is often criticised over its relatively heavy use of chemicals , which can impact insects , larger animals and plant life in the vicinity of the farm .
In addition , the run-off of excess fertiliser into rivers and lakes can generate blooms of algae and " dead zones " of water where nothing can survive .
However , strictly from the point of view of greenhouse gas emissions , intensive farming appears to be significantly the better option .
" Our results dispel the notion that industrial agricultural with its petrochemicals is inherently worse for the climate than a more ' old - fashioned ' way of doing things , " said Dr Davis .
He and his team suggest that policymakers keen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should look towards further increases in crop yields , which they say might be more economical than other innovations .
Existing research shows that curbing production of meat - which is an inefficient user of land and water - would by itself have some impact on emissions , though by precisely how much is debated .
And …Boom : Apple Worth More Than Microsoft
“ We have to let go of the notion that for Apple to win , Microsoft needs to lose . ” — Apple CEO Steve Jobs , August 1997
And there it is .
Today Apple , not Microsoft is the world ’s most valuable technology company .
As I write this Apple ( AAPL ) shares are trading at $ 244.87 , giving it a market capitalization of $ 223.1 billion .
Meanwhile , shares of Microsoft ( MSFT ) are trading at $ 24.79 and the company ’s market cap sits at $ 217.78 billion ( see table below ; click to enlarge ) .
And so Cupertino has finally surpassed Redmond in total value .
The only American company with a market cap greater than Apple is Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) .
UPDATE : Apple closed the day well ahead of Microsoft .
Its market cap : $ 222.07 billion ; Microsoft ’s : $ 219.18 billion .
PREVIOUSLY :
CHICAGO — Residents of a small city in eastern Nebraska voted Monday to banish illegal immigrants from jobs and rental homes , defying an earlier decision by the city ’s leaders and setting off what is all but certain to be a costly and closely watched legal challenge .
In Fremont , a meat - packing town of about 25,000 people , unofficial results from The Associated Press late Monday showed that 57 percent of voters approved a referendum barring landlords from renting to those in the country illegally , requiring renters to provide information to the police and to obtain city occupancy licenses , and obliging city businesses to use a federal database to check for illegal immigrants .
Opponents of the new law , including some business and church leaders , had argued that the City of Fremont simply could not afford the new law , which is all but certain to be challenged in court .
In a flurry of television commercials and presentations by opponents in the final days before Monday ’s vote , opponents said paying to defend such a local law would require a significant cut in Fremont city services or a stiff tax increase — or some combination of the two .
“ There were a lot of tears in this room tonight , ” said Kristin Ostrom , an opponent who gathered with others in an old V.F.W. building to await the results .
“ Unfortunately , people have voted for an ordinance that ’s going to cost millions of dollars , and that says to the Hispanic community that the Anglo community is saying they are not welcome here .
They thought they were coming to a small - town community with small - town values . ”

We have been publishing articles about CSS3 for a while now , and we keep receiving angry e-mails from some developers who complain that it does n’t make sense to use CSS3 today .
Yes , Internet Explorer does n’t support most CSS3 properties .
And yes , CSS3 vendor prefixes are bad for maintainability ( and this is why we recommend extracting vendor prefixes in a separate CSS3 file ) .
But it ’s OK to accept that Web is a dynamic medium , and it ’s OK to create rich , interactive , beautiful designs for those who are already using a modern browser or will be using one soon .
It just does n’t make sense to keep looking back , beiDang afraid of looking forward and therefore avoid experimenting and learning about new CSS3 properties today .
And this is why we keep publishing articles about CSS3 .
In this post we present an extensive round - up of CSS3 techniques , tools and resources that will help you learn how to use CSS3 in your designs right away .
We have grouped most useful articles by the corresponding properties , described what browsers support what properties , presented alternative JavaScript - based approaches and workarounds for Internet Explorer and added a couple of links to useful CSS3 generators and tools in the end of the post .

The series also contains many examples and code snippets .
Very useful .
CSS3 Examples and Best Practices
The CSS3 trend is getting more and more popular .
In fact CSS3 new features open a lot of new possibilities .
Check out my previous post on “ CSS3 Animation Demos ” to see the things that you can do with it .
However , do n’t get too excited so soon because it is not fully supported by all browsers yet .
But this does n’t mean you should n’t use it at all .
So , when should you use CSS3 new features ?
Well , continue on this post to see some excellent examples .
CSS of the Future : How CSS3 can Optimize Design
The design blogosphere has been buzzing about the improvements level 3 of Cascading Style Sheets will bring .
Although still a ways off from official recommendation status by the W3C , some browsers are already supporting pending features .
I want to highlight a few of the CSS3 features I ’m excited about that will not only add flexibility to the design process , but that will aid with search and conversion optimization as well .
Practical Uses of CSS3
A user is not going to pull up your site in two different browsers to compare the experience , so they wo n’t even know what they are missing .
Just because something is not fully supported , that does not mean that we ca n’t use it to an extent .
In this article I ’ll show you some practical uses for CSS3 .
You Can Use CSS3 Right Now
CSS3 makes a designer ’s work easier because they ’re able to spend less time hacking their CSS and HTML code to work in IE and more time crafting their design .
It is the future of web design and can be used today .
This article will hopefully show you to care a little less about making everything pixel perfect in IE .
It will inspire you to spend more time making your designs exquisite in the rest of the browsers while serving up a working and perfectly accessible website for IE .
CSS3 + Progressive Enhancement = Smart Design
Progressive enhancement is a good thing , and CSS3 is even better .
Combined , they enable designers to create lighter , cleaner websites faster and easier than ever before .

Canonical , the lead commercial sponsor behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution , is gearing up to launch a new series of support and services offerings for enterprise desktop and server users .
Canonical overhauls its Ubuntu Linux OS support services with the new Advantage solution , which offers legal indemnification , support and management services .
On Monday , Canonical is set to officially announce its Ubuntu Advantage program , which combines support , legal indemnification and management into a cohesive services offering .
The Ubuntu Advantage rollout comes as Canonical is growing its commercial enterprise push with a new Long Term Support ( LTS ) release and Landscape management server .
“ Ubuntu Advantage replaces other support offerings .
It is now our primary services offering , ” Fern Ho , Canonical ’s Ubuntu Advantage product manager , told InternetNews.com .
“ We do however still offer technical consulting and training services in addition to Ubuntu Advantage . ”
Ho added that Ubuntu Advantage is a support and services offering for any standard or LTS version of Ubuntu within its lifecycle .
A key part of the Ubuntu Advantage program is the inclusion of the Canonical Landscape management offering as an integrated part of the solution .
Canonical recently upgraded Landscape to provide improved cloud and provisioning capabilities .
Prior to the Advantage release , enterprises could have chosen to purchase Landscape separately from the support offering , but that ’s now changing .
“ There is actually no longer the option to purchase Ubuntu support and Landscape separately , ” Ho said .
“ As these two services are together critical in ensuring efficient use and management of the Ubuntu platform , we decided to bring them together in a single offering for simplicity . ”
Ubuntu Advantage customers will also receive the assurance of indemnification from Canonical protecting them against any potential legal issues .
The legal indemnification is the same that Canonical had previously been making available to its paying support customers .
Rival Linux distributions Red Hat and Novell also both provide their enterprise customers with legal indemnifications .
“ We have maintained this offering because we understand that it provides an important level of comfort and eases in the adoption of Ubuntu for many organizations , ” Ho said .
Another key component that Canonical is including as part of Ubuntu Advantage is support for Windows integration .
Canonical recognized that Ubuntu is often deployed into networks where there are existing Microsoft Windows assets , which created additional complexity for its customers .
“ This can be tricky to integrate so we help them overcome this integration hurdle with support and advice on best practices integration , making it even easier for all organizations to adopt Ubuntu as an alternative platform , ” Ho said .
The Ubuntu Advantage support offering is all part of Canonical ’s larger efforts to grow its commercial business .
Ho noted that with Ubuntu Advantage , Canonical is not specifically aiming for feature parity with Red Hat or other enterprise Linux vendors .
“ What we were aiming for with Ubuntu Advantage is to give enterprises an added edge in their use of the Ubuntu platform , ” Ho said .
“ To continue to support the position of Ubuntu as an alternative Linux platform , we wanted to provide businesses with all the necessary tools , knowledge and services in order for them to effectively and comfortably use Ubuntu to support business - critical workloads .
We wanted to do this as simply as possible for businesses , so we created Ubuntu Advantage as a single service that provides all these things . ”

Devo's " Something For Everybody , " out today , is the geek band 's first studio album in 20 years , and it 's like a blast of 80s nihilism .
After a decade of emo murk in pop , Devo 's brand of apocalyptic insincerity is refreshing .
The conceit behind the new album is that Devo has become so commercialized that they are now only making music that has been " focus grouped " and sponsored by brands .
America has become so de-evolved that there 's no point in protesting it anymore .
Devo is just going to embrace it , and produce a perfect pop album for money .
Like their 1980s work , the music on " Something For Everybody " is a satire of the mind - numbing drudgery of everyday life .
But Devo does n't care if your life sucks - in fact , if you 're choking on the American Dream , it 's probably because you deserve it .
Advertisement
Songs like " Fresh " are all about the awesomeness of commercial brands and doing meaningless work .
The thing is , Devo is n't exactly subtle about the sarcastic message they 're sending .
Lurking in the fake sunshiney blankness of a song like " Fresh , " or " What We Do " ( below ) is a frantic anxiety , mirrored in the twitchy synths on songs like " Mind Games . "
They may be robotic workers , but they 're also freaking out about it .
Devo makes fun of commercial culture by embodying it .
In this way , they are probably best understood as the unexpected precursor to acts like Lady Gaga - right down to the weird headgear .
Lady Gaga also makes fun of fame - obsessed pop culture by embodying it and taking it to an extreme .
Maybe Lady Gaga 's popularity is a sign that Devo 's time has come again .
We 've come full circle , past the sincerity of popular acts like Wilco , and returned to an aesthetic of theatrical sarcasm .
Back in 1970s , Devo emerged from a collision between punk and techno sensibilities .
As a group of nerds from Ohio , their cultural touchstone was n't working - class rage like punk acts from the UK - instead , it was suburban America , a world where consumerism and pop culture verged on propaganda .
Early Devo's style was spastic and angry .
They filled their music with references to commercial jingles and science fiction .
They acted like robots on stage , called themselves mutants , and explained to anyone who would listen that the world was " de- evolving " into violence , apathy , and marketing .
Advertisement
The problem was that they criticized commercial culture in a way that was catchy and marketable .
And so this group of five twitchy young men who wanted to make fun of mainstream culture became the new mainstream .
I can remember vividly when it happened .
The song Whip It , Devo's big crossover hit , became popular when I was in the sixth grade .
We heard it so often on the radio in my little suburban California town that it went from weird teen anthem to annoying pop pablum .
By the time I was in seventh grade , it was as despised as disco .
When the DJ put on Whip
It at a school dance , we chanted " DEVO SUCKS ! " at the top of our lungs for at least a minute until he relented and put on Adam and the Ants instead .
Devo would have loved being at that dance .
There was nothing they wanted more than for people to reject pop culture .
They claimed in interviews that Whip
It went mainstream because people misunderstood its message .
Though it was supposed to be a parody of the work ethic , people thought it was about S&M .
Given that the Whip
It video shows Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a startled - looking model , it 's easy to see why audiences were confused .
But that was always Devo 's charm - they liked to fuck with your mind .
If they did something you liked , they 'd turn around and tell you that it was wrong to like it .
They were punk nerds , and being adored was not part of their agenda .
About halfway through this great live show from 1980 , you can see a perfect distillation of Devo 's stance .
In a skit , they 're approached by a very sincere woman who calls them " so techno , so 80s , " and then pitches them an idea for a country - western song .
They stand stiffly , staring at her from under their plastic masks .
Mothersbaugh finally says , in a robot voice , " You are a warm and beautiful human .
That is really how I feel . "
How does this kind of act work on " Something for Everybody , " whose sound is exactly like the band 's previous work ?
Advertisement
Now that they 're visibly middle - aged , there 's an authenticity to Devo 's protest against drudgery that they lacked when they were hot little twenty - somethings screeching about conformity .
When they sing " Later Is Now , " they mean it .
They are , as one of them jokingly put it on NPR , " geriatrics . "
They 're growing old in a world where mindless work is still regarded as everyone 's super nifty destiny , and they 've done a fair amount of highly commercial work themselves ( Mothersbaugh , for example , works scoring TV and movies in Hollywood now ) .
The Devo boys have seen de-evolution in action , and they 've returned angrier and nerdier than ever .
That 's what makes " Something For Everybody " terrific - it 's catchy and mean - spirited like the best Devo songs always have been .
Buy it at your local Wal - mart or Starbucks if you can .
And when you do , smile robotically and say , " These songs make me feel so good when I 'm working , and when I go to the gym ! "
That 's the Devo spirit .

Nearly Good shooter Metro 2033 is to recieve a sequel , Metro 2034 .
If you missed the first 2032 Metro games , I suspect it ’s a bit too late to catch - up now .
Where have you been ?
So yes , a sequel to last year ’s impressively moody but slightly annoying under - tunnel shooter .
THQ’s Danny Bilson said so , and that they could make it cheaply .
That is all .
That is all .
Seriously .
I have literally no more information about the game , so frankly I do n’t know why you ’re still reading .
You ’re still here ?
Really ?
How long are you going to stick this out ?
Do you genuinely think I ’m going to say something else useful about the game ?
Honestly ?
What ’s wrong with you ?
Oh , alright .
It ’s in 3D , as in the silly bollocks with the glasses and the special ( i.e. expensive ) monitors / televisions .
I love technology , me .
But I really could n’t give a monkey ’s surly uncle about 3D .
Is this because a ) I have a mild stigma that prevents me from seeing 3D as acutely as others do b) I ’m a sulky idiot or c ) honestly , c’mon , 3D ?
Oh , alright once more .
Honestly , I know nothing at all about Metro 2034 bar its intended existence , but when I spoke to Bilson myself about Homefront a month or so back , he was incredibly bullish about every forthcoming THQ game being mega - blockbuster territory , and there being no room to not be successful .
No B - list games allowed , essentially .
So , regardless of Metro 2033 ’s pulled punches and general weirdness , I suspect this follow - up will be production - valued up to the nines , aimed at the massest of mass audiences there is .
My money would , in fact , be on this being a reboot / relaunch of the IP rather than a straight sequel as such .
In 1962 an exposed vein of coal in an abandoned strip mine caught on fire on the eastern side of Pennsylvania and it burned under ground for ...
... what is it today ?
2010 ?
For 48 years .
For 48 years the vein burned , getting its oxygen from an abandoned coal mine .
And it burns today , still venting noxious , toxic gasses out of the earth , bleaching trees , killing the vegetation and wildlife , creating sink holes when the underground coal is turned to ash .
And here we come to the fate of the once quaint town of Centralia , Pennsylvania , which stands right atop the burning vein .
Settled in 1841 , the city 's population hovered near 2000 for much of its existence .
Now just 9 people live there .
In the year 2002 the US Post Office revoked its zip code .

In a software project as large as NetBSD the interactions between different software components are not always immediately obvious to even the most skilled programmers .
Tests help ensure that the system functions according to the desired criteria .
Periodic automated runs of these tests with results visible on the web ensures both that tests are run in a regular fashion and that the results are available to all interested parties .
This short article explains the NetBSD test strategies and provides a brief overview of the enabling technologies .
It also details how effortless it is to run the test suite and why doing so is in every developer 's , patch submitter 's and system administrator 's best interest .
The intended audience is people with a keen interest in testing and quality assurance , and a desire to reduce personal headache .
The article is written against NetBSD - current as of June 2010 and applies to what will eventually become NetBSD 6 .
The tests can be run with the atf - run command in the appropriate subdirectory for a partial set of tests or on the top level of /usr / tests for the entire NetBSD test suite .
Since the output of atf - run is meant to be post - processed by other tools , the idiomatic command for creating a human - readable report includes a pipe to the report generator :
atf - run | atf - report
Summary for 25 test programs : 83 passed test cases .
0 failed test cases .
0 expected failures .
2 skipped test cases .
Automated NetBSD Installation and Test Application ( anita )
This gives a verdict for all the tests .
Also , a summary like the following one is presented : Further documentation for running the tests and controlling the report format is available from the ATF manual pages , specifically atf - run and atf - report
The Automated NetBSD Installation and Test Application ( anita ) is a tool written by Andreas Gustafsson .
When anita is run , a URL to release set binaries is given as an argument .
Anita downloads the release sets , creates a disk image , boots the downloaded release in a virtual machine and installs the release .
For example , the following command will download and install NetBSD / i386 5.0.2 , and boot the resulting installation to a command prompt :
anita interact ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-5.0.2/i386/
Currently , anita supports only QEMU and the i386 port , although there has been interest in adding support for other virtual containers and NetBSD ports .
Since installation is done in a virtual machine , the environment is theoretically the same regardless of the host the command is run on .
This is both a blessing and a curse : different anita runs are comparable regardless of where they are executed , but features specific to certain machine configurations are not exercised .
Nevertheless , if an anita install is successful , there is reasonably high confidence that the release it was executed for works .
What makes anita especially effective for testing installation is that it uses " screen scrape " with the sysinst installer .
This means the display output of sysinst is read and interpreted by anita , and commands are given as response to the output .
This tests that the installation works like a human would be doing it and sets it apart from testers which use various machine scripts to perform test installations .
Test Reports On The Web
In addition to anita , Andreas has written a set of tools which fetch the current sources from cvs , build a release , and use anita to install the release and run the ATF tests .
The results are currently available on his website .
The source revisions committed between each build / install / test run are available behind the " Details " links on the page .
Furthermore , if the system build is broken , the tools make an effort to hunt down the exact guilty commit before publishing the result as to when the build was broken .
If despite testing efforts a regression does slip through , the logs from the runs make it easy to track down which commit introduced the regression , even days after it was introduced -- although hopefully it will not take so long to correct things .
Once enough logs have been accumulated , they can also provide a source to figure out what breaks often , due to what , and for how long .
This information can be used to prevent similar problems for occurring in the future .
Running The Test Suite With Anita
The results mentioned in the previous section are used as a reference point to determine the current health of NetBSD .
Developers and users submitting patches are encouraged to repeat the anita test run to make sure changes do not have unwanted side - effects .
Additionally , developers are committed to not causing long - term regressions in the anita test runs -- a clean test report for a submitted patch may further convince that the patch was sufficiently tested and should be included in NetBSD .
Nevertheless , common sense is allowed as to when this is necessary .
Although writing tests is not covered in this article , it is also highly recommended that new features are submitted with the relevant tests in the same package .
This is also to the advantage of the submitter since , as mentioned above , developers are required to make sure [ future ] changes do not cause existing tests to fail .
Anita can be found in pkgsrc under misc / py - anita .
As of writing this , pkgsrc - current ( and what will become pkgsrc - 2010Q2 ) is required .
Also , QEMU version 0.12nb3 or later is required due to a bugfix in the CPU emulation -- test runs will hang indefinitely without this bugfix .
A full anita install / boot / test cycle including the ATF test report is accomplished by using the test option .
For example , when build.sh is used to build release sets into / objs / obj.i386/releasedir/i386 , the following command would be used to run an install / boot / test cycle :
anita test / objs/ obj.i386/releasedir/i386 /
If the development host runs NetBSD and is sufficiently up - to - date , it is possible to simply run the ATF tests there .
However , due to reasons already mentioned , the results might or might not reflect the anita run .
The recommended " no brains necessary " method to make sure that a change does not cause a regression in the anita run is to do an anita run .
Since it does not require additional hardware or even disrupting current work due to having to reboot , there is little excuse for not doing so .
On the flip - side , the anita run does not test the system configuration of the development host , so ultimately the best choice is to run the tests in both environments .
This arguably doubles the amount of necessary command lines from one to two , but still leaves little excuse for not executing both .
Conclusions
This short article presented NetBSD testing options and provided a brief introduction to the tools to make it happen .
NetBSD testing is done periodically with results available from a web page , but manual execution , either piecemeal or wholesale , is possible and highly recommended .
Ultimately tests help ensure the quality of NetBSD , and it is in everyone 's personal interest to run tests on their local machines and to include test cases along code submissions .

The Skull of Doom By Jane MacLaren Walsh
The Mitchell - Hedges crystal skull : Fact , fiction , and the creation of myth
Crystal skulls have long had a fringe following , and the most famous of them is one named for the explorer - author Frederick A. Mitchell - Hedges ( see " Legend of the Crystal Skulls " ) .
Mitchell - Hedges claimed to have found the skull somewhere in Central America in the 1930s , but his adopted daughter Anna later said she found it under a fallen altar or inside a pyramid at the Maya site of Lubaantún in British Honduras ( now Belize ) some time in the 1920s .
Neither of their contradictory accounts is true .
In fact , like all the other crystal skulls thus far examined , it is a modern creation , despite its nearly mythical place in the minds of devotees .

I have had two opportunities to examine the Mitchell - Hedges skull closely and to take silicone molds of carved and polished elements of it , which I have analyzed under high - power light and scanning - electron microscopes .
I have also evaluated the documentary evidence , newspaper stories about Mitchell - Hedges , his memoirs Land of Wonder and Fear ( 1931 ) and Danger My Ally ( 1954 ) , and a file of letters and documents that Anna Mitchell - Hedges sent to Frederick Dockstader , the director of the Museum of the American Indian in New York City , which I recently found .
The microscopic evidence presented here indicates that the skull is not a Maya artifact but was carved with high - speed , modern , diamond - coated lapidary tools .
The historical record shows it first appeared in London in 1933 and was purchased a decade later by Mitchell - Hedges , who claimed the crystal skull was an authentic pre-Columbian artifact .
The newly found archival evidence suggests Anna was later involved in the evolution of tall tales about the skull 's origins , providing a fascinating look at the creation of a popular mythology in service of a profitable business venture .
Conclusion
Analysis of the Mitchell - Hedges crystal skull using SEM leaves little doubt that this object was carved and polished using modern , high - speed , diamond - coated , rotary , cutting and polishing tools of minute dimensions .
This technology is certainly not pre-Columbian .
I believe it is decidedly 20th century .
The similarities between the Mitchell - Hedges skull and the British Museum skull suggest that the former is an improved copy of the latter .
The recently published SEM study of the British Museum skull additionally suggests it was probably carved within a decade of the date it was first offered for sale in 1881 ( Sax , Walsh , et al. 2008 : p. 2759 ) .
It is not unreasonable to conclude that the Mitchell - Hedges skull , which first appeared in 1933 , was also created within short time of its debut .

Frederick A. Mitchell - Hedges began an association with a California art dealer named Frank Dorland in the 1950s to promote and sell an icon he called the Black Virgin of Kazan , which later turned out to be a copy .
Anna Mitchell - Hedges continued this relationship after her father died in 1959 , ultimately agreeing to Dorland 's proposal to " launch a program about the [ crystal ]
Skull and get your price " ( 11/25/1963 ) .
A number of wildly speculative publications resulted from this promotion .
One , Phrenology ( 1970 ) , suggested the skull had belonged to the Knights Templar and was taken to British Honduras by Mitchell - Hedges .
Another , Ambrose Bierce , F.A. Mitchell - Hedges and the Crystal Skull ( 1973 ) , claimed that Bierce , a journalist who disappeared in Mexico in 1913 , and Mitchell - Hedges had stolen the skull when they were both fighting alongside Pancho Villa .
Later , Dorland hired the novelist Richard Garvin to write The Crystal Skull that had Anna Mitchell - Hedges herself discovering the skull inside of a Maya pyramid at Lubanntun .
Eventually , I believe that Anna attempted to legitimize this object through its exhibition in a respected museum — the Museum of the American Indian .
Using microscopic analyses and newly discovered archival documents , Smithsonian anthropologist Jane Walsh has revealed the Mitchell - Hedges skull to be a modern creation about which a mythology was deliberately spun .
( James Di Loreto / Courtesy Smithsonian Institution )
The correspondence between Frederick Dockstader , director of the Museum of the American Indian , and Anna Mitchell - Hedges clearly demonstrates how the process of legitimizing objects with potential mass appeal but dubious authenticity and provenience works .
In their letters , each seemed to flatter the other to achieve their own separate , though similar , ends : to increase visitation to the museum and to enhance the status of the crystal skull .
Despite the Museum of the American Indian director 's long - held suspicions about the skull , not to mention the warnings from well - meaning colleagues , the Mitchell - Hedges skull was , in fact , exhibited in New York for an extended run .
That exhibition endowed the skull with a legitimacy that it had not had previously .
Following the exhibition and the publication of the Garvin book in 1973 , the Skull of Doom 's owner launched her long career as keeper of the ever more mysterious object , whose extraordinary powers , like her father 's claims and collections , grew and grew and grew .
In Danger My Ally , Frederick Mitchell - Hedges warned that the skull was " the embodiment of all evil " and that " several people who have cynically laughed at it have died , others have been stricken and become seriously ill " ( 1954 : p. 240 ) .
Clearly , we should not believe everything we read , and , ultimately , we must be brave and tell the truth .
The Mitchell - Hedges crystal skull is not ancient ; not even very old .
It was probably made in Europe in the 20th century , and was not polished for five generations .
It is not powerful , not scary and not at all what it purports to be .

To anyone who watched the G20 circus , the headline is n’t much of a hyperbolic stretch .
Here was a country , which spent nearly $ 1 billion on security measures — greater than any summit ’s security budget in the history of the world — and yet footage of burning police cars and shattered store windows played on loop throughout the week on Canadian television .
Where were the cops ?
How were a handful of fringe protesters able to create this — admittedly limited — havoc ?
Naomi Klein proposes an interesting explanation .
The state and cops had received widespread criticism for the tremendous amount of cash being dumped into security for this single event ( 78 percent of Canadians believed that the cost was unjustified , ) and when some anarchists lit up their police car , they may have decided to take a long lunch break just to teach everyone a lesson .
So , what happened on Saturday , when you saw those burning cop cars and windows breaking , was what I can only describe as a cop strike .
Essentially , they were just letting it happen .
And people were watching this , not understanding why , for hours , the same police car was just allowed to burn .
I mean , these guys had just bought themselves a brand new water cannon , and yet they could n’t seem to find themselves a fire extinguisher .
Now , while that was happening , media outlets were getting press statements .
And I ’ll just read you one .
This is from the Toronto Police Department : “ All you have to do is turn on the TV and see what ’s happening now .
Police cars are getting torched , buildings are being vandalized , people are getting beat up , and [ so ] the so - called ‘ intimidating ’ police presence is essential to restoring order . ”
In other words , the police were playing public relations , overtly .
They were saying , “ OK , you ’re telling us our price tag was too high .
We ’re getting in political trouble for our outrageous demands .
So now we ’re going to show you this huge threat that we ’re up against . ”
And so , we have a police commissioner named Julian Fantino , who ’s now started to talk about activists as organized crime .
He says it ’s not enough to call them thugs , they ’re organized criminals .
So , what ’s dangerous here is that in order to justify their own unjustifiable actions , they need to overinflate a threat .
Here , Klein clearly explains how the state justifies its own actions by exaggerating a threat ( as she points out , Canada is used to seeing more violence during hockey riots – during one such riot , sixteen cop cars were set on fire ) .
Any rational person should be able to understand that the “ problem ” of protesters is fully manageable , and a “ black bloc ” of anarchists ( some of who are real , and some of who may be agent provocateurs ) does not justify spending $ 1 trillion during a global recession .
Okay , so if the police were n’t using all that money to protect stores , or even their own vehicles , what were they doing ?
Oh , right .

And this :
Deaf restaurant kitchen worker Emomotimi Azorbo was granted bail Saturday after being charged the previous day with assaulting Toronto Police at a downtown G20 protest .
Friends claim he was not a demonstrator .
Azorbo , 30 , stumbled into several bicycles after getting into a shoving match with officers at a bicycle barrier set up to stop the progress of yelling , screaming marchers . …
“ He was in the wrong place at the wrong time , ” Gary Malkowski , advisor to the president of the Canadian Hearing Society , said in an interview .
… Malkowski said Azorbo was crossing the intersection to buy a bottle of water at a variety store and could not understand police orders .
He is charged with three counts of assaulting police plus resisting arrest .
So I guess Canadian citizens can take comfort in the knowledge that they collectively shelled out $ 1 billion to ensure the world ’s elite could dine in peace , and not be bothered by protesters singing their nation ’s anthem , quizzical journalists , or deaf people .

British homeopaths are celebrating Homeopathy Awareness
Week , yet it seems to me there is very little for them to celebrate .
Earlier this year , a report from the Commons Science and Technology Committee concluded that the principles of homeopathy are implausible and that the evidence fails to show that it works better than placebo .
The MPs also criticised homeopaths for trying to mislead the public by providing inaccurate information .
Their recommendation to government was to stop funding homeopathy on the NHS .
Then the Prince of Wales 's Foundation for Integrated Health , a staunch supporter of homeopathy in the NHS , folded in the midst of a police investigation for fraud and money laundering .
Last month , the British Medical Association described homeopathy as " witchcraft " and called for an end to all funding on the NHS .
A streak of bad luck ?
Not really .
Homeopathy 's fortunes have been crumbling for quite some time .
The evidence to suggest that it has effects beyond those of a placebo has become less and less convincing .
In 2005 , The Lancet even pronounced " the end of homeopathy " .
As a result , one of the five NHS - funded homeopathic hospitals had to close .
After assessing the science , its NHS trust found that the evidence did not justify any further funding .
Faced with increasing criticism , UK homeopaths become more and more desperate .
My team has found that the Society of Homeopaths even appears to have been in breach of its own code of ethics in attempting to promote homeopathy .
On the society 's website , numerous statements about efficacy were made that were not backed by science and so were not allowed under its own regulations .
The society 's chief executive commented at the time , in November 2009 , that she was grateful to me for highlighting these issues and that the society would investigate and make amendments where appropriate .
The website has since changed but many , perhaps even most , members of that organisation continue to make claims that violate their society 's ethical standards .
This is not a trivial or academic point .
Recently Simon Singh won the libel case that the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) had brought against him .
Singh had alleged that the BCA made unsupported claims .
When the case was brought , several bloggers and sceptics then went through the claims made by UK chiropractors with a fine - tooth comb and subsequently reported around 600 of them to their regulator for violating the rules that regulate their practice .
These are serious allegations that cannot be swept under the carpet .
Perusing this number of complaints in an orderly fashion will be extremely costly .
The expense could turn out to be unaffordable for chiropractors and thus bankrupt their organisations .
So even as homeopaths celebrate their " awareness week " , bloggers and sceptics – enthused by their success on the chiropractic front – might already be considering action against any unsubstantiated claims made by UK homeopaths .
This could truly be the end of homeopathy .

Nine missing as S Korean boat sinks in warship search
Divers have been involved in a complex rescue operation
At least one person has died and eight are missing after a fishing boat sank during the search for a South Korean warship , officials say .
The South Korean boat was one of a number of private vessels searching for the warship , which sank last week near the maritime border with North Korea .
One official said the boat appeared to have collided with a freighter .
South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said one of the 46 sailors missing from the warship was found on Saturday .
The fishing boat lost contact with the coastguard after sending a distress signal when it left the search area late on Friday .
" We 've captured the Taiyo 1 , a Cambodian - registered 1,472 - ton freighter , which was apparently involved in the collision , " an Incheon Maritime Police spokesman told AFP news agency .
If the fishing boat is confirmed to have sunk , it will add to the sense of shock that many South Koreans are feeling following the loss of the warship , the BBC's John Sudworth reports from the South Korean capital , Seoul .
He says the press is full of speculation about the possible causes of the explosion that sunk the Cheonan , including a deliberate attack by North Korea - a possibility not yet ruled out by the South .
Last week a navy diver was killed while taking part in the rescue operation .
The blast sunk the Cheonan , a 1,200 - tonne corvette , after tearing it in half near Baengnyeong Island , close to the maritime border with North Korea .
Rescuers have been continuing their search for sailors missing on board the ship .
Officials have said some people could have been trapped alive in watertight sections of the vessel .
On Friday , South Korea 's defence minister renewed speculation a torpedo could have caused the blast that sank the ship .
Kim Tae - young , who had previously said a sea mine could have caused the blast , called it a " likely possibility " the Cheonan had been hit by a torpedo .
Shortly after the sinking , Seoul said it did not believe North Korea had fired on the ship .
Pyongyang has made no official comment about the incident .

Seattle , Washington ( CNN ) --
If the choice was take the money or run , " barefoot burglar " Colton Harris - Moore 's decision apparently was to keep running .
A surrender deadline for Harris - Moore , who faces at least a dozen counts of burglary , identity theft and evading law enforcement , passed Tuesday without word from the fugitive .
Had he chosen to end his two years on the lam , Harris - Moore would have received $ 50,000 from a " concerned , anonymous donor " said attorney Jim Johanson , who announced the offer last week .
Johanson said he had offered to defend Harris - Moore , who has become an Internet folk hero as he continues to run from police , often without shoes .
Harris - Moore has been sought by authorities since 2008 , when he allegedly escaped from a youth home while serving a three - year sentence .
He had pleaded guilty to three counts of home burglary .
In addition to the charges he faces , the San Juan County Sheriff 's office has also called Harris - Moore a suspect in four thefts of small airplanes .
They were recovered after " hard landings " that in several cases resulted in thousands of dollars in damage to the planes .
In June , the San Juan County Sheriff 's Office also said Harris - Moore was a suspect in the recent theft of a fishing boat .
Harris - Moore has not been charged in the boat or plane thefts .
But the alleged escapades have won him a Facebook page with over 20,000 fans and profiles in magazines such as Rolling Stone , Maxim and Time , which called him " America 's most wanted teenager . "
A movie titled " Taking Flight : The Search for a Young Outlaw " is also reportedly in the works .
For authorities chasing Harris - Moore , his growing fame has been an annoyance .
Police believe the attention on the young fugitive is wrongly focused .
" It should be about the apprehension of an adult felon criminal and not so much about making this person into a Robin Hood or cult hero , " said Mark Brown , the sheriff of Island County , Washington , where Harris - Moore grew up .
In his home county , Harris - Moore faces charges of burglary , identity theft and running from a stolen car that he allegedly crashed into a restaurant .
In March , police descended on nearby Orcas Island with helicopters , search dogs and SWAT teams in response to a reported Harris - Moore sighting .
But a day spent combing the island failed to uncover his trail .
" It 's just a matter of time before someone -- Colt , a police officer or private citizen -- gets hurt , " said attorney Johanson .
The $ 50,000 his client put up for Harris - Moore 's surrender was placed in a private trust , Johanson added .
His client " wants a peaceful resolution .
There have been some pretty close calls , " the attorney said .
There is no way of knowing if Harris - Moore is even aware of the offer .
A telephone number for his mother was disconnected and messages left by CNN for an attorney she reportedly hired were not returned Wednesday .
For at least one of the fugitive 's so - called fans , turning down the money and chance to surrender was a no - brainer .
" Do n't take the money !
Your name and reputation is worth WAY more than 50 k , " said a recent posting on Harris - Moore 's Facebook page .

I was bumbed when I found out there was already a blog post about The Word Fine , but I 'll take a kill shot at it anyway .
“ Hey , how are you ? ” “ I ’m fine . ” “ Fine ?
What ’s wrong ?
” “ Nothing is wrong .
I said I ’m fine . ” “ … ” Can we form together and release this horrid adjective that punches babies in their sleep , rips the very soul from your body and burns it into ash , slashes your tires , and defines the entire world violent ?
Please ?
“ Hey , hon .
Do you care if go out with the guys today ?
” “ Well , we had plans to eat at my mom ’s house .
But , that ’s fine .
” “ Oh , well we had been talking about going to this new golf course … ” “ It ’s fine , really .
” “ I can reschedule .
” “ No , it is fine . ” “ … ” According to Dictionary.com , there are eighteen different meanings of the adjective ; just the adjective .
Not to mention different meanings for the verb ( with and without object ) , adverb , noun , and an idiom .
Seriously , why ?
With this many different meanings for one word , there is nothing left but puzzlement and ambiguity ; ambiguity for God sakes .
“ Hey , I just finished painting this .
What do you think ?
” “ Oh , it ’s fine .
I like what you did with the watercolors .
” “ What do you mean by fine ? ” “ Nothing , it ’s fine .
I like it .
” “ By fine do you mean average , okay , or shit ?
I do n’t understand .
” “ No , no .
It ’s fine , really .
” After reading the blog above , I did come to realize that it is more of a conversation starter than an actual answer .
Someone asks you how you are , to avoid embarrassment from a stranger ; you say that you ’re fine .
Clean cut , in and out , finished .
In all honesty , I do n’t want to know about your marital problems , whether or not you have herpes , or your dog played dead .
I do n’t even give a shit about the weather .
So , fine , there you go .
You now know more about me and hopefully more about the word fine .

Moral of the story : Do n't Do Drugs !
Pakistan ’s powerful intelligence agency not only funds and trains Taliban insurgents fighting U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan , but also maintains its own representation on the insurgency ’s leadership council , claims a new report issued by the London School of Economics .
Assertions that Pakistan ’s intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence , continues to nurture links with the Afghan Taliban are not new .
But the scope of that relationship claimed by the report ’s author , Matt Waldman , is startling and could prove damaging to the fragile alliance Washington is trying to foster with Pakistan , its military establishment , and its weak civilian government led by President Asif Ali Zardari .
Waldman , a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University , based his assertions on interviews with nine Afghan Taliban commanders as well as with Afghan and Western security officials .
The report claims that it is official Pakistan governmental policy to support the Taliban ’s insurgency in Afghanistan , and that the ISI has a strong voice on the Quetta shura , the Afghan Taliban ’s leadership council , named after the southern Pakistani city believed to serve as the council ’s haven .
The report states that , based on the interviews , “ the ISI has representatives on the Shura , either as participants or observers , and the agency is thus involved at the highest level of the movement . ”
The report also alleges that Zardari , long regarded as a close ally of the Obama administration in the war on terrorism , had met with captured senior Taliban leaders in Pakistan and had vowed to ensure their release as well as to support their efforts in Afghanistan .
The report ’s claims drew vehement denials from Islamabad , which characterized the research as speculative and unsubstantiated .
“ I consider this a highly speculative and provocative report , ” said Pakistani military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas .
“ I question the authenticity and credibility of this so - called research . …
It ’s not worthy of any response . ”
Pakistan ’s links to the Afghan Taliban have been among the thorniest issues complicating the U.S. - Pakistan relationship and the ongoing effort to uproot Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist organizations in the region .
Though Islamabad insists that it does not support Taliban insurgents battling Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s government and Western troops , U.S. diplomats and military commanders have long suspected that Pakistani officials , particularly in the intelligence community , have never severed ties with the Afghan Taliban .
Many observers maintain that Pakistan continues to support the Afghan Taliban behind the scenes as a way of countering attempts by its nuclear archrival , India , to expand influence within Afghanistan and with the Karzai - led government .
Earlier this year , Pakistan arrested several high - ranking Taliban leaders that had sought refuge in Karachi and other Pakistani cities , including the insurgency ’s second - in - command , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .
However , analysts suggested that the arrests , which were welcomed by the U.S. , may have been aimed at ensuring Pakistan ’s seat at the negotiating table whenever the West , Karzai and the Taliban embarked on peace talks .
Pakistan ’s calibrated approach toward dealing with the Taliban is especially evident in the country ’s largely lawless tribal areas along the Afghan border .
There the Pakistani military aggressively pursues Taliban insurgents that have targeted security installations and civilians , but insurgents that focus principally on Afghanistan , such as the Haqqani network in North Waziristan , are left alone .
Appearing on Al Jazeera television , Waldman defended his research , saying that in addition to speaking to Afghan Taliban field commanders , he spoke to several officials from Western governments who concurred with his findings .
“ These are not erratic allegations , ” Waldman said .
“ They ’re not without foundation , without a lot of support from analysts around the world . ”

( CNN ) --
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against Wal - Mart for the termination of a Michigan employee whose doctor verified his illness qualified for medical marijuana use .
Wal - Mart , the nation 's largest retailer , fired Joseph Casias in November 2009 after he failed an on - the - job injury - related drug test .
Casias suffers from a rare form of cancer in his nasal cavity and brain , and he relied on his doctor 's medical marijuana prescription to alleviate the daily pain .
Casias is one of about 20,000 legal medical marijuana users in Michigan .
" Medical marijuana has had a life - changing positive effect for Joseph , but Wal - Mart made him pay a stiff and unfair price for his medicine , " said Scott Michelman , staff attorney with the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project .
" No patient should be forced to choose between adequate pain relief and gainful employment , and no employer should be allowed to intrude upon private medical choices made by employees in consultation with their doctors , " Michelman said .
Wal - Mart officials say they are sympathetic to Casias ' condition , but the company needed to put the safety of its customers and associates first .
" As more states allow this treatment , employers are left without any guidelines except the federal standard , " wrote Lorenzo Lopez , a director of media relations at Wal - Mart , in an e-mail to CNN .
" In these cases , until further guidance is available , we will always default to what we believe is the safest environment for our associates and customers . "
The ACLU 's lawsuit , filed in Calhoun County Circuit Court in Michigan , comes at a time when the controversy over medical marijuana is still being debated in many states .
To date , 14 states have laws allowing the use of medical marijuana , which protect legal users from criminalization .
But the laws are murky when it comes to protecting users from termination by their employers in some states .
Casias told CNN in March that he never arrived at work high and used the medical marijuana only outside of his work hours .
Michigan is an at - will employment state , which means employers can terminate a worker for any reason except for being in a federally protected class such as race , gender and religion .
The ACLU is arguing legal medical marijuana users should also be protected under a Michigan law .
" I was angry they did this to me because I always tried my best , " Casias said to CNN in March .
He had worked for Wal - Mart for nearly five years to support his wife and two young children .
He started at the company as a grocery store stocker in 2004 before moving up to become an inventory control manager .
He earned an Associate of the Year Award at Wal - Mart in 2008 , a year before his termination .
He has battled with his cancer for more than a decade .
The lawsuit says the medical marijuana was able to provide him with pain relief .
A few years ago , when I was buying magazine ad space for my table planner software , I was told by an ad salesman that customers need to see an advertisement seven times before it is effective .
How very convenient for his commission .
I have heard variants of this “ advertising rule of 7 ” quite a few times since , but I have never been able to find out where it originally comes from .
I have now taken to asking people that quote it what evidence they have to back it up .
So far no - one has been able to point me at a paper , study or any other form of credible evidence .
I have just searched google for see “ ad seven times ” and I found lots of mentions of the “ advertising rule of 7 ” .
Here are some of them that appeared high in the search results :
But again , no links , references or citations to back it up , even from the people that said it was based on “ statistics ” , “ surveys ” or “ research ” .
What statistics / surveys / research ?
Is it based on some form of scientific study that can be reproduced , is it a rule of thumb that has been given more credit than it deserves or is it total bullshit made up by a crafty ad salesman ?
I suspect the latter , but I would love to know .
If you know the origin of this “ rule of 7 ” , please post a comment below .
** Update 09 - Jun -10 **
I have had some useful feedback from this post , particular in the private ASP forums [ 1 ] ( always a great resource ) .
David Trump posted a link to this paper :
THE REPETITION / VARIATION HYPOTHESES CONCEPTUAL AND METHOLOGICAL ISSUES [ Schumann & Clemons ]
I used references and keywords in this paper to find 3 other relevant papers :
Beyond Effective Frequency : Evaluating Media Schedules Using Frequency Value Planning [ Cannon & Leckenby ]
The shape of the advertising response function [ Simon & Arndt ]
The Shape of Advertising Response Functions Revisited : A Model of Dynamic Probabilistic Thresholds [ Vakratsas , Feinberg , Bass & Kalyanaram ]
These papers talk about an ‘ advertising response function ’ .
This is a curve plotting the number of exposures to an ad against the customer likelihood of being influenced .
Some theorise that there is a threshold below which ads do n’t have an effect , a saturation point above which exposures may have a negative effect and a sweet - spot in between .
This ‘ S ’ shaped response function could provide some support for ‘ you have to see an ad 7 times ’ , except support for the presence of a threshold effect seems to be weak to non-existent .
Only one of the papers [ Vakratsas , Feinberg , Bass & Kalyanaram ] cited any evidence and that seemed less than convincing from my quick reading .
For effective frequency to be valid , advertising must be subject to a threshold effect , reflected in an S - shaped advertising response curve ( Stankey 1989 ) .
But research suggests that , in actual advertising situations , response curves tend to be concave , characterized by Continually diminishing returns ( Simon and Arndt 1980 ; Schultz and Block 1986 ; Zielske 1986 ) .
[ Cannon and Leckenby ]
In brief , then we are satisfied that the field experiments as a group show no solid evidence for increasing returns over operating ranges .
…
Taken together , the studies using physical and monetary variables add up to the conclusion that there are not increasing returns to advertising — that is , no S - shaped response function - over the normal operating range .
[ Simon & Arndt ]
Futhermore , some of the papers mention a theory that a customer might have to see an ad 3 times , but none of them mention 7 times .
Krugman ( 1972 ; 1977 ) captured the imagination of the industry with his three - exposure theory , which described an intuitively appealing sequence of consumer responses to television advertising that appeared to be consistent with a communication threshold .
He suggested that the first exposure causes consumers to ask , “ What is it ? ”
The second causes them to ask , “ What of it ? ”
The third exposure is both a reminder and the beginning of disengagement . …
The magic number “ three ” came to be a commonly accepted industry standard ( Lancaster , Kreshel and Harris 1986 ) .
[ Cannon and Leckenby ]
Al Harberg pointed out that those claiming a “ 7 times rule ” might be confusing the ability to recall information ( where 7 has been shown experimentally to be the “ magic number ” for short term memory ) with the number of ad exposures taken to influence someone .
Two completely different things .
So please shout “ bullshit ” very loudly next time you hear the “ advertising rule of 7 ″ mentioned .
Especially if it is by someone trying to sell you ad space .

Coca -Cola to Glenn Beck : We Wo n’t Be Back !
And that ’s entertainment …
Ah , the sweet fizz of justice on a Friday morning .
Yes , Coca - Cola , that all - American – dare I say REAL American ?!
– beverage company has decided that it is not right for their image to advertise on Tea Party leader and chalk board aficionado Glenn Beck ’s Fox TV show .
While Coke is just one of many advertisers who have rejected Beck ’s TV show , and it may not have been the first time Coke announced their repudiation , it was the shunning dismissal of the Crying Clown that really stung .
This is most upsetting since Glenn Beck is nothing but an entertainer for God ’s sake , you over sensitive Lefty !
Advertisements
StopGlennBeck reports :
“ We kindly requested that they follow the responsible action of well over 100 other former advertisers and refrain from advertising on Glenn Beck ’s show .
Well , your tweets and messages paid off .
Today , Coke advised that their ads will no longer be run on Glenn Beck ’s program .
Statement from Coca - Cola sent to the StopBeck effort :
Hey , you ’re correct , our 10 second ad did run there once …
You wo n’t see us there again … Thanks for bringing it to our attention … Best ! ”
When mainstream America starts rejecting Glenn ’s message to this extent , it suggests that some people do n’t find Glenn all that entertaining .
But how can that be ?
It used to be that advertisers were clamoring to grab the Right ( like TLC chasing after the Domionist Home Schooling crowd by selling Sarah Palin as an animal lover ) , an untapped market which Rupert exploited very successfully .
But by golly , there ’s always room for more exploitation !
And so it ’s odd , is n’t it , to see Coca - Cola shunning the Crying Clown .
Or maybe not .
Glenn
Beck has a long history of hate , misogyny , bigotry , and racism .
Or as the Right calls it , “ entertainment ” :
~~ “ Palin / Beck ?
Ridiculous … I was just thinking , what I ’m gonna take backseat to a chick ?
While you ’re at it , go shoot a bear !
Make some stew !
I ’m hungry in here . ”
~~Responding Gloria Steinem ’s discussion of sexism in American politics , Glenn Beck said : “ You self - centered , self - righteous , socialist , out - of - control , dangerous , man-hating bitch .
Shut your mouth .
We might have bought into this crap in the 1960s because too many people were doing LSD .
We ’re not on LSD anymore .
You need to start making sense . ”
~~ Or , in Glenn Beck ’s distant past , where he called a rival radio DJ ’s wife , who had just suffered a miscarriage , and proceeded to mock her for it live on the air .
Entertainment !
Oh , yes , entertainment !
Why does Coca - Cola hate entertainment ???
It must be the lamestream media ’s fault for messin ’ with the message of entertainment !
~~ Glenn Beck : OK .
No offense , and I know Muslims .
I like Muslims .
I ’ve been to mosques .
I really do n’t believe that Islam is a religion of evil .
I — you know , I think it ’s being hijacked , quite frankly .
With that being said , you are a Democrat .
You are saying , “ Let ’s cut and run . ”
And I have to tell you , I have been nervous about this interview with you , because what I feel like saying is , “ Sir , prove to me that you are not working with our enemies . ”
Oh , yes , entertainment !
I do n’t know why the Left is so outraged .
Those mean old libertards got nothing better to do than get their stupid panties in a bunch !
Relax , it ’s ………. Entertainment !
~~ “ This president has exposed himself , I think , as a guy , over and over and over again , who has a deep - seated hatred for white people , or white culture .
Adding … “ I ’m saying he has a problem .
He has a , this guy is , I believe , a racist . ”
Oh , yes , that ’s hysterical !
My God , it ’s just the kind of fun you want to invite the neighbor ’s kids over for , eh ?
Gosh golly , let ’s all gather around the Family Values pit and see what other minorities we can pick on for fun .
Ohhhh !
What about those pesky Indians ?
Must n’t let the brown colored ones get off too easy !
~ ~” Beck implied that there are no quality medical schools in India ; implied that medical care in India is a shoddy imitation of real health care ; implied that the entire nation is an undeveloped backwater without even so much as indoor plumbing ; and compared the Ganges River , a holy body of water for one of the world ’s oldest and largest religions , to a disease . ”
Yeah , this is all good clean entertainment !
I do n’t know why Coca - Cola is listening to a bunch of Soros Lovin ’ FEMA camp directin ’ birth certificate lackin’ Lefties !
What is this country coming to ?????

15 Gründe für den Prügel - Präsidenten : Jetzt wird es Ernst ( August ) !
Wulff ?
Vergessen Sie's !
Es kann keinen idealeren Bundespräsidenten geben als Ernst August Prinz von Hannover .
15 Gründe , warum er Staatsoberhaupt werden muss .
1 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist Chef des Hauses Hannover , und Hannover hat ja nun derzeit offensichtlich einen guten Lauf - Lena , von der Leyen , Wulff und die Scorpions hören endlich auf .
2 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt gehört nicht , wie zu Guttenberg , zum dahergelaufenen Landeier - , sondern zum Hochadel - worüber sich gerade Monarchisten und Nostalgiker freuen dürften , die noch immer ihren " Kaiser Wilhelm wiederhaben " wollen .
3 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt gilt als ausgesprochen feierlich und feierfest - unter ihm würde es in Schloss Bellevue jedenfalls mehr Partyanlässe geben als nur das übliche " Sommerfest des Bundespräsidenten " .
4 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist Welfe , gehört damit , nach Aussterben der Merowinger , zum ältesten Adelsgeschlecht in Europas .
Dennoch hat er als moderner Fürst profunde Erfahrungen mit der absoluten politischen Machtlosigkeit eines Bundespräsidenten .
5 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt hat nicht nur einen britischen , sondern auch einen deutschen Pass .
Die doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft eines Staatsoberhauptes wäre ein gesellschaftspolitisches Novum , dass ihn auch für progressive Linke wählbar machen würde .
6 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt könnte König von England werden !
Zwar verlor er , der 398ste in der Thronfolge , durch die Heirat mit einer monegassischen Katholikin alle Ansprüche auf den Thron .
Ungewiss ist aber , ob die Ehe so lange hält , wie es dauert , die 397 Thronfolger vor ihm aus dem Weg zu räumen .
7 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist alles andere als eine mimosenhafte Memme , die schon beim leisesten Gegenwind zu Boden ginge .
Im Gegenteil : Der Mann gilt als ausgesprochen durchsetzungsfähig , zupackend und handgreiflich .
8 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist von erstaunlicher Volksnähe , unvergessen seine legendär - symbolische Pinkelpause am türkischen Pavillon auf der Expo in Hannover .
9 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist ein direkter Nachfahre von Kaiser Barbarossa , der der Sage nach in einer Höhle des Kyffhäuserbergs schläft , um eines Tages zu erwachen , das Reich zu retten und es wieder zu neuer Herrlichkeit zu führen .
Wenn nicht jetzt , wann dann ?
10 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt wird keine ewigen " Ruck " - Reden halten und dann mal gucken , was passiert .
Von unserem nächsten Staatsoberhaupt wirds stattdessen gleich was auf die Fresse geben .
11 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt würde mit Caroline von Monaco eine First Lady mit ins
Amt bringen , die das klassische " Damenprogramm " auf internationales Niveau heben würde : Zirkus !
Formel 1 ! Spielbank !
Glamour !
Gutes Wetter !
12 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt wäre nicht nur ein " unbequemer " , sondern voraussichtlich sogar der allerunbequemste Bundespräsident , den dieses Land seit Johannes Rau hatte .
Schließlich dient Unbequemlichkeit vor allem dem Übertünchen eigener Machtlosigkeit .
13 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt ist offen für Neues und würde daher den Kampf gegen Drogen mit ungekannter Konsequenz und Opferbereitschaft so lange führen , bis alle Drogen endlich verbraucht wären - von ihm , versteht sich .
14 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt nennt die Bild - Zeitung eine " Scheißzeitung " .
15 Unser nächstes Staatsoberhaupt entstammt einer Familie , die auf rund 1.300 Jahre diplomatischer Aktivitäten zurückblicken kann - mit Vorfahren , die sich vor den Mauern von Akkon , Askalon oder Jerusalem aktiv in den Nahostkonflikt einbrachten , bevor es den Nahostkonflikt überhaupt gab .
A team of MIT researchers has found a novel way to mimic the process by which plants use the power of sunlight to split water and make chemical fuel to power their growth .
In this case , the team used a modified virus as a kind of biological scaffold that can assemble the nanoscale components needed to split the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of a water molecule .
Splitting water is one way to solve the basic problem of solar energy :
It ’s only available when the sun shines .
By using sunlight to make hydrogen from water , the hydrogen can then be stored and used at any time to generate electricity using a fuel cell , or to make liquid fuels ( or be used directly ) for cars and trucks .
Regierung vor dem Bruch ?
Peter Nowak
Streit , Mobbing und Intrigen : Das Theater der schwarz - gelben Koalition
Streit unter den Kabinettsmitgliedern ist unter der schwarz - gelben Bundesregierung nun wirklich nichts Neues .
Doch in den letzten Tagen scheint sich Endzeitstimmung in Berlin breit zu machen .
Nicht nur in den Medien wird offen über ein Scheitern der Bundesregierung gesprochen .
Auch der FDP - Politiker Jörg - Uwe
Hahn droht offen mit einem Ende der Koalition , wenn Merkel nicht endlich Kanzlerin einer bürgerlichen Regierung wird .
Allerdings ging
Hahn auch mit seinen eigenen Parteichef heftig ins Gericht :
Guido Westerwelle war ein hervorragender Oppositionsführer . (...)
Leider wurde in dieser Zeit ein bisschen vergessen , an den Tag nach dem Wahlsieg zu denken .
Hahn steht damit in der FDP nicht allein .
Der Kreisverband Limburg - Weilburg fordert gar die Einberufung eines Sonderparteitages im Herbst .
In der Begründung heißt es :
Die Lage in der Partei ist dramatisch .
Die Führung der Partei auf Bundesebene hat es mit einer beispiellosen Anhäufung von Fehlern in konzeptioneller , strategischer taktischer und handwerklicher Hinsicht fertig gebracht , die Partei von einem grandiosen Wahlsieg in eine existentielle Krise zu führen .
Klientelpolitik für Steuerbürger
Seit die Umfragen der Partei , die bei den letzten Bundestagswahlen noch im Höhenrausch war , wieder in der Nähe der 5 Prozent Hürde sehen , wächst der parteiinterne Druck auf Westerwelle und die FDP - Minister , endlich die Klientel - Politik für die Steuerbürger zu machen , die sie vor den Wahlen versprochen haben .
Dass Merkel nach der desolaten NRW - Wahl das Lieblingsprojekt der FDP , die Steuersenkung , beerdigte , haben die Liberalen noch längst nicht verwunden .
Dass sie jetzt gar Steuererhöhungen zustimmen sollen und auch die Kopfpauschale eigentlich schon tot ist , sorgt bei vielen Liberalen die Sehnsucht nach einer konsequenten bürgerlichen Opposition .
Das wäre mit einem Rechtsruck der Partei verbunden .
Anlässe für einen Koalitionsbruch gibt es an so vielen Punkten , so dass heute niemand voraussagen kann , welcher Konflikt zum Bruch führt .
Am letzten Donnerstag sahen manche die Koalition schon vor dem Scheitern , nachdem Bundeswirtschaftsminister Brüderle Staatsbürgschaften für Opel mit der Begründung ablehnte , das Pendel müsse wieder mehr Richtig Markt schlagen und Merkel erwiderte , das letzte Wort sei in dieser Frage noch nicht gesprochen .
Doch sie knickte ein , nachdem Brüderle Rückendeckung aus seiner Partei bekommen habe .
Dieser Machtbeweis der FDP zeigte sich auch beim Sparpaket , wo die FDP die Erhöhung des Spitzensteuersatzes verhinderte , was sogar vom CDU - Wirtschaftsrat kritisiert wurde .
Denn der fürchtet um die Akzeptanz in der Bevölkerung , wenn erneut bei den Erwerbslosen gespart wird und die Reichen ungeschoren davon kommen .
Ihr neues Machtbewusstsein will die FDP auch im Gesundheitsbereich ausspielen .
Sie will ihren Gesundheitsminister nicht weiter von der CSU desavouieren lassen .
Ob die Partei sich aus der Regierung zurückzieht , wenn auch der nächste Gesundheitsreformplan bei den Koalitionspartnern zerrissen wird ?
Oder dann , wenn das Parlament doch noch für Steuererhöhungen votiert , wozu Bundesfinanzminister Schäuble indirekt Sympathie gezeigt hat .
Das würde aber bedeuten , dass sich dort eine Mehrheit ohne und gegen die FDP zusammenfindet .
Selbst die bisher eher unauffällige Bundesjustizministerin hat sich in der Frage der Neufassung der Regelung zur Sicherheitsverwahrung nun auf einen Konflikt mit ihren Unionskollegen eingelassen .
Unruhe auch in der Union
Die ständige Zoff in der Koalition hat auch Auswirkungen auf das Klima innerhalb der Union .
Dort werden die Zweifel an einer Bundeskanzlerin lauter , die entweder nicht in der Lage den Streit zu beenden oder daran gar kein Interesse hat .
Schon nach der NRW - Wahl warnte Josef Schlarmann , wichtiger Exponent des CDU - Wirtschaftsflügels , vor dem Ende von Schwarz - Gelb :
Die Gefahr besteht , dass das schwarz - gelbe Projekt im Bund nach nur sieben Monaten schon wieder vor dem Ende steht .
Bemerkenswert ist , dass er damals die Aufgabe der Steuersenkungspläne als wichtiges Indiz für dieses Scheitern sah , während jetzt der CDU - Wirtschaftsrat selber für begrenzte Steuererhöhungen eintritt , um deutlich zu machen , dass auch die Vermögenden sich an der Haushaltssanierung beteiligen .
Damit wird auch deutlich , dass es in Zeiten der Wirtschaftskrise auch scheinbar feststehende wirtschaftspolitische Positionen recht flexibel den aktuellen politischen Ereignissen angepasst werden und nur die FDP das Banner des Wirtschaftsliberalismus hochhält .
Im letzten Jahr gab der damalige Bundeswirtschaftsminister Karl Theodor Guttenberg den Brüderle , sprach sich gegen staatliche Hilfen an Opel aus , nur konnte er sich nicht durchsetzen und blieb trotz Rücktrittsgedanken im Amt .
Streit unter Merkels potentiellen Erben
Nun werden wieder Gerüchte lanciert , Guttenberg könnte auch seinen Posten als Verteidigungsminister niederlegen .
Der offizielle Grund ist eher kleinkariert .
Das Kanzleramt lässt ohne sein Wissen ein Gutachten über Guttenbergs Rechte im Untersuchungsausschuss zum Militärschlag in Kunduz erstellen , wo er aussagen muss .
Der Minister spricht von Mobbing und Intrigen aus dem Kanzleramt .
Die Presse will von einer Männerfeindschaft zwischen Guttenberg und dem Merkel - Vertrauten und Kanzleramtschef Roland Pofalla erfahren haben .
Diese Geplänkel könnten ein Vorgeschmack auf die Machtkämpfe in der Nach - Merkel - Ära sein .
Da wichtige innerparteiliche Konkurrenten andere Posten angenommen haben oder ganz aus der Politik ausgestiegen sind , wird der Kampf unter Politikern aus der zweiten Reihe ausgetragen .
Solange keine klare Alternative zu Merkel erkennbar ist , muss sie innerparteilich keinen Putsch fürchten .
Doch auch aus der Union könnten einige bei den Bundespräsidentenwahlen ihr Kreuz bei Gauck machen und so ihre Unzufriedenheit mit Merkel ausdrücken .
Auch in der FDP mehren sich die Stimmen , die den Konservativen aus dem Osten dem Exponenten von Schwarz - Gelb vorziehen .
Sollten sie Gauck zum Erfolg verhelfen , hätte Merkel ein großes Problem , aber deswegen wäre die Bundesregierung noch nicht automatisch gescheitert .
Sollte es dann doch zum Bruch mit der FDP kommen , wird Merkel versuchen , erneut eine Regierung mit der SPD zu bilden .
Ihre fast beschwörende Mahnung , die SPD in NRW möge sich doch in den schwierigen Zeiten nicht einer Koalition mit der CDU verweigern , könnte so auch durchaus Werbung in eigener Sache sein .

' Follow the Islamic way to save the world , ' Prince Charles urges environmentalists
Prince Charles yesterday urged the world to follow Islamic ' spiritual principles ' in order to protect the environment .
In an hour - long speech , the heir to the throne argued that man 's destruction of the world was contrary to the scriptures of all religions - but particularly those of Islam .
He said the current ' division ' between man and nature had been caused not just by industrialisation , but also by our attitude to the environment - which goes against the grain of ' sacred traditions ' .
Outspoken : Prince Charles speaks to Islamic studies scholars at Oxford .
He argued that man 's destruction of the world was particularly contrary to Islam
Charles , who is a practising Christian and will become the head of the Church of England when he succeeds to the throne , spoke in depth about his own study of the Koran which , he said , tells its followers that there is ' no separation between man and nature ' and says we must always live within our environment 's limits .
The prince was speaking to an audience of scholars at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies - which attempts to encourage a better understanding of the culture and civilisation of the religion .
His speech , merging religion with his other favourite subject , the environment , marked the 25th anniversary of the organisation , of which he is patron .
He added : ' The inconvenient truth is that we share this planet with the rest of creation for a very good reason - and that is , we can not exist on our own without the intricately balanced web of life around us .
' Islam has always taught this and to ignore that lesson is to default on our contract with creation . '
Bored :
Not everyone in the audience was as interested as Prince Charles though
Image caption Mr Booth wants to carry out his dead father 's duty
A Paralympian whose false legs were stolen days before his sister 's wedding has appealed to thieves to return them so he can walk her down the aisle .
Anthony Booth , 33 , has been practising for four months to walk without sticks to give away his sister Angela at her wedding on Saturday .
His artificial legs and wheelchair were in his car , which was stolen from outside his Manchester home on 12 June .
Anthony , a wheelchair athlete , lost his legs to meningitis when he was nine .
There 's no sign of the legs Anthony Booth
The father - of - three from Brixworth Walk , Blackley , said : " I 've been practising now for quite a long time to prepare for this day .
" I 've been using sticks to walk , but I 've finally managed to walk without the sticks and this is what I 've prepared for , but there 's no sign of the legs . "
He said a friend had lent him a wheelchair so he can attend the ceremony at Manchester Town Hall in front of 150 guests , but Mr Booth still hopes the thieves who stole his black Astra will hand in his legs .
His sister had wanted him to walk her down the aisle since the death of their father 12 years ago .
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said that the car containing the legs and wheelchair was driven away after the thief took Mr Booth 's keys from inside his house .
The former wheelchair ice hockey athlete , who competed in the 1998 Winter Paralympics in Japan , is hoping to take part in the wheelchair races at the London 2012 Games .
It ’s been GSoC season for over a month now and I have n’t blogged , so now I ’m going to try to fix that .
After last year ’s Multilevel playlist sorting project , one of my proposals has been accepted again for GSoC 2010 : I ’m going to implement on - the - fly transcoding in Amarok .
Amarok is a music player and manager built around very general concepts of tracks and media sources .
The collection tries to decouple the format from the data itself and presents the music as tracks ( with metadata ) rather than files .
In other cases , music is n’t even stored in local files .
These concepts , and others , allow one to truly rediscover music through seamless internet sources and media devices integration , and the user in fact does n’t have to care where the actual data comes from .
The many sources at one ’s fingertips are accessible in a consistent way and playable from the playlist .
However , even in this day and age of stuff in the cloud , there are situations in which the user still has to worry about media formats , e.g. when acquiring new music , or copying existing music from one collection to another or from the collection to a portable music player .
That ’s where transcoding kicks in .
For example , one might have a quantity of Windows Media Audio files that should be transcoded to a more Free format in order to be usable in the future , or a quantity of Monkey ’s Audio files , which , while lossless , are not well supported everywhere , especially in PMPs .
And then of course , even if someone has a collection full of FLAC files , which is a reliable and Free codec , a conversion into a lossy format such as Ogg Vorbis or MP3 might be necessary for use with a PMP simply for reasons of storage capacity .
So my idea is this : whenever the user can copy files , give him or her the choice to either just copy , just transcode or transcode with custom options .
That way , we cover both of the following use cases :
“ I ’m running late for a 4 hour train ride and I have n’t updated the music collection on my portable player , I need to quickly copy over my tunes while making sure they will compatible with the portable player ”
“ if I tweak the quality rating of the Vorbis encoder exactly the way I want it I ’m going to save 1 % of the space on my portable music player and still get the audio quality my sensitive ears deserve ” .
The current situation is that the transcoding operation ( in the strictest possible sense ) works , so the next thing I have to do is integrate it nicely with Amarok ’s existing collections framework .
The current implementation uses FFmpeg , but I ’ve placed FFmpeg - specific stuff in a wrapper class so something else could quite easily be used in the future if need arises .
The following screenshot represents the current state of the still quite unfinished transcoding GUI .
On a somewhat unrelated note , I ’ve been to the KDE Multimedia + Edu sprint in Randa , Switzerland .
It was a lot of fun and very productive too .
I wish to thank the whole organizers team .
Special thanks go to Mario Fux for his mad organizational skills , to the cooking team which I had the pleasure to share the kitchen with while preparing vegan stuff and to Knut Yrvin for arranging a much needed meeting with the Brisbane office of Nokia , Qt Development Frameworks regarding QtMultimedia and the future of Phonon .
Finally , thanks Anne- Marie Mahfouf for a gift she gave me which allowed me to taste again something I like very much but have n’t been able to eat because of nickel allergy .
England Captain Rio Ferdinand : We Will Only Be Happy If We Win The World Cup
United defender believes there is much to improve on before tournament begins
The Three Lions are one of the favourites to win the tournament and Fabio Capello ’s squad are hoping to be crowned the World Cup champions when the final is played July 11 .
The Manchester United defender was a part of the last two World Cup teams that were eliminated in the quarter - finals in 2002 and 2006 and the new England captain will only be satisfied if he lifts that trophy this summer .
“ We 're not going into the tournament thinking ' get to the quarter - finals , semi- finals or final and we 've done our job , ” Ferdinand told The Sun .
" We will only do ourselves justice by winning a tournament .
We are going there strictly to try and bring this trophy home .
" No one gets remembered for finishing in the semi- finals or quarter - finals , that is why we are training so hard .
" We 've had great preparation at our training base in Austria and hopefully that will serve us well at the tournament . "
Despite earning a 3 - 1 victory over Mexico at Wembley on Monday , Ferdinand believes that England must improve as the Three Lions were far from their best .
" But I also I think there is a bit more reality how we are approaching things .
We had a good reality check against Mexico on Monday .
" I remember going into the last tournament and we beat Jamaica by six goals at Old Trafford and Peter Crouch got a hat - trick .
" Sometimes that kind of thing papers over the cracks .
This time we 've had a game we 've won 3 - 1 against Mexico , but there is still a lot of stuff to work on . "

Inspired by The Programmer Dress Code , and a lady friend of mine in the field of computing , I present the programming women ’s dress code .
Here is a list of seven famous women programmers and their pictures to illustrate their style of fashion .
The only child of Lord Byron , Ada Lovelace was born in London in 1815 .
She wrote an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers using Charles Babbage ‘s mechanical computer , the analytical engine .
This makes her the world ’s first computer programmer .
The programming language Ada is named after her .
Adele Goldberg
Adele Goldberg wrote several books on Smalltalk - 80 .
In the 70’s Adele worked on the Xerox Alto , the first computers to have a GUI and use a desktop metaphor .
Steve Jobs requested to see a demo of the Xerox Alto and Adele refused to show him .
Her superiors at Xerox ordered her to show Jobs a demo , and naturally Apple copied all of their best ideas .
Erna Schneider Hoover
Erna invented the computerized telephone traffic switching system at Bell Labs in the 70s .
It was one of the first software patents ever .
Mary Lou Jepsen
Mary was the founding CTO of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
She invented the laptop ’s sunlight - readable display technology and co-invented its ultra - low power management system .
She left OLPC in 2008 to found her for profit company Pixel Qi which focuses on display technologies .
Mary is in the 2008 “ TIME 100 . ”
Shafi Goldwasser
Shafi is a professor at MIT and the Weizmann Institute of Science where she researches computational complexity theory , cryptography and computational number theory .
She ’s won two prestigeous Gödel Prize awards on her work in theoretical computer science .
I ca n’t even begin to understand what this means in English , but it sounds impressive does n’t it ? :p
Jeri Ellsworth
Jeri is a self taught chip designer and hacker extraordinaire .
Remember Christmas 2004 when all the shopping malls had those joysticks that plugged directly into your TV loaded with tons of Commodore 64 games ?
You can thank Jeri for that .
The C64 Direct - to - TV is her creation .
“ Amazing Grace ” Hopper
I saved my favorite for last . 🙂
Rear Admiral Grace Hopper ( nicknamed “ Amazing Grace ” ) served in the United States Navy for over 40 years and was awarded the highest non-combat award possible when she retired .
With a masters in mathematics and physics from Yale university , Grace developed the first compiler , and conceptualized machine - independent programming languages , ala COBOL .
Grace is sometimes called “ the mother of COBOL . ”
You ’ve probably heard the old story of how a moth got caught in one of those old massive computers , causing it to crash .
Grace remembers that story , she was there !
She ’s the one that popularized the phrase “ debugging . ”
Grace Hooper is also responsible for one of my most frequently used quotes , “ It ’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission . ”
And if you ’re still not impressed , the US Navy named the destroyer ship USS Hopper ( DDG - 70 ) after her .
The majority of Grace ’s retirement was spent speaking and lecturing about technology at computer events , where she always wore her full military dress .
Grace is kind of my hero .
So , what have we learned about the woman programmer ’s dress code ?
Unlike the men ’s dress code , beards are not in fashion , and long hair is optional .
Fine Victorian era gowns are in , as are military uniforms .
But , with the exception of a rare few , it seems that neither male nor female programmers give a rat ’s ass about fashion .
and that ’s why we still have fish …
The only argument creationists have against speciation is deploying arbitrary taxonomical semantics .
Chances are that somewhere right now , a creationist is bitterly trying to prove that evolution is wrong and that the fossil record does n’t actually provide any evidence for the theory because it wo n’t show how one species becomes another .
Then , after either thinking that he ’s triumphantly defeated modern biology or sighing heavily because those evolutionist heathens wo n’t heed his wise words , he leaves science writers and scientists to deal with his assertion .
And here ’s the funny part .
Our creationist in question is absolutely right .
Fossils do n’t show how one species becomes another .
If they did , then much of what we know about evolution would have to be drastically revised to explain how a species could suddenly change its distinguishing features .
To show how biologists today explain the flow of evolution , here again is David Attenborough for the BBC ’s Tree of Life .
Creationists heavily rely on the notion of separating all life into a neat , tidy box they label as kinds and we tend to label as species .
The most progressive ones may even accept that within any particular species there is a level of genetic churn and outward change .
But what they do n’t understand , or do n’t want to understand , is the nature of how we label living things .
Our taxonomy is fairly arbitrary and when we really start digging down to a bone by bone analysis of the fossil record , we find a lot of overlap , and incomplete segments become hard to classify because they could belong to multiple species .
That ’s because in nature , species are related and as time goes on , the offspring of species A can accumulate so many genetic changes and settle in environments so inhospitable to their ancestors that they interbreed , increase the number of genetic changes they have , and eventually , their progeny could be classified as species B in a few million years or so , as the mutations keep on building with each generation even more removed from the population that gave birth to their parents .
And eventually , as their genetic changes accumulate thanks to natural selection , they ’ll keep mating with each other and if they ’re good enough survivors , they may even spawn species C , which will continue to repeat the cycle of speciation as long as the habitat permits it .
Here ’s an example of this speciation going on right now in the Arctic .
Zoologists had a pretty good idea that polar bears and grizzlies were evolutionary relatives , sharing a distant ancestor which gave rise to a species well suited to hunt and forage in forests , and another that was able to live in the icy plains , hunting for seals .
Normally , the two want nothing to do with each other and grizzly bears normally try to scare away any polar bear that comes too close to their territories .
But today , as grizzlies are venturing further north , they ’re not just bumping into polar bears for a growling contest .
Instead , the bears are mating and producing huge , powerful offspring known as grolars .
And should the grolars survive over a long enough period of time and start interbreeding , they ’ll become a new species .
Once again , nature shows how genetic mutations and natural selection shape life on our planet and how instead of one species turning into another , speciation relies on one species becoming two , and maybe even three .
So how does a creationist expect rare , often incomplete fossils to show how one species turns into another , or how that change happens when speciation requires new species branching off from established ones ?
If nature worked the way creationists think , Tiktaalik and well , every other fish would have to be part of one and the same species and be walking on land as amphibians , rather than just father the ancestors of amphibians which emerged out of the water and fathered the ancestors of reptiles .
According to the theory of evolution , the original species can stick around for as long , or even longer then their novel descendant .
That ’s why there are still fish in the oceans ( although not the same fish we had 400 million years ago ) , and modern Tiktaaliks are still appearing .
According to the creationists ’ quasi-Lamarckian view of evolution , that ’s not how nature has to work and since they see themselves as the pinnacle of life on Earth , they ’ll demand that biologists show them how a “ lower form of life becomes a higher form , ” a meaningless , pseudoscientific notion of those who got their idea of evolution almost solely from Rudolph Zallinger ’s March of Progress .
So the next time creationist zealots devoted to disproving evolutionary science ask you to provide evidence for speciation as they believe it happens , you ’ll know you ’re dealing with someone who has n’t the faintest clue of what he ’s talking about , so much so that he ’s arguing against potential evidence that would be a major shock to modern biologists and put some of the core concepts behind evolutionary theory into question .
And if you ’re the kind of creationist who likes to use this throwback to Lamarckism , you should now know that you ’ve been trying to prove to people that gravity does n’t exist by asking them why they do n’t just suddenly float into space , all while telling them that floating is the highest form of locomotion according to your holy books .

Event Guide for free Events in Greater Dublin
The " Dublin Event Guide ( for Free Events ) " is Dublin 's most popular event magazine that focuses on the vast amount of cultural events for no admission charges .
For more than 11 years it was a weekly e-mail magazine that listed , described and recommended 170 - 200 free cultural events in Dublin City and in the Greater Dublin area .
Gigs , Festivals ,
Talks , Lectures , Exhibitions and much more for all age groups were included .
After 600 editions , the Dublin Event Guide was semi-retired and now continues in a new format .
The Dublin Event Guide is a non commercial initiative and is published by Joerg Steegmueller , it has more than 24,000 readers .
Instead of a weekly e-mail , there is now an e-mail only when significant events happen and you can subscribe for free on the right here -->>
This site contains the newest edition below and is updated as soon as it is completed ( check the date ! ) .
But even if there is no new edition here , you probably find some event information on the Dublin Event Guide Facebook Page at www.facebook.com/DublinEventGuide!
The newest Dublin Event Guide ( for Free Events ) below was posted on 26 September 2020 :
Dublin Event Guide 675 : Glimmer of hope in Covid Times !

And also : Food Markets , Botanic Garden Walks , Dublin Theatre Festival
26 September 2020 – No 675 Subscribers : 24,000
Glimmer of hope in Covid Times !
–
And also : Food Markets , Botanic Garden Walks , Dublin Theatre Festival Hi all !
Some of you know that I am involved with the Gardiner Street Gospel Choir in technical capacity .
Until March we sang every Sunday at a Gospel Mass in Gardiner Street Church .
On 08 March we had our 20 year anniversary gig in the Button Factory and then it all stopped !
Standing close together as 25 - 30 people choir is NOT an option at the moment and singing is currently seen as one of the most riskiest hobbies .
How times have changed !
So what can we do ?
How can we get together again and sing as a choir in a totally safe way ?
We tried Zoom and it did n’t work , we tried other online platforms and they were unsuitable , but we did n’t want to give up .
We worked hard on this idea and last week we ran a trial to see if the concept that we came up with could work .
The great new is that it did work !
And we are now planning for a full choir rehearsal in a totally safe way .
For me that is a glimmer of hope in the current times .
Maybe even more than a glimmer !! ;-)
And this is what we did ( more details can be provided if you want to know ) :
Every choir member is on their own in their own car , their own safe cocoon , in which they can sing without endangering anybody else .
Every choir member has a microphone and all microphones are connected to a mixing desk .
The output from that mixing desk is fed back to the car radios so that everybody can hear all other singers .
There is no delay and ( unlike via online platforms ) singing together works perfectly .
We are now looking for a roofed / underground car park that would let us do a weekly rehearsal and if you have a suggestion , please let me know via dublineventguide@gmail.com .
Ideally there would be a power socket in that car park .
We do n’t need anything else .
We might even do a gig around Christmas !
Watch this space !!
Do you also have a story that gives some hope ?
Send it to me and I will post a few interesting ideas in the next few weeks . :-)
Right now , we have less innovation regarding events than in March an April , but there is nothing to say that we ca n’t develop new ideas again or go back – for a while – to what was done a few months ago .
And whatever I find out , I will report back to you in the form of the best free events that I can find !
Week after week !
To do this effectively , there are some cost and so we have found this deal : I do the work and you help me pay the bills through donations .
As long as this works , I will continue .
If I have to do the work AND pay the bills , I will stop .
Fair ???
I think so !
I am not asking for a lot , but I think one or two Euro per MONTH is a very fair suggestion .
So for the year , this would be 12 Euro or – for people you can afford a bit more – just 24 Euro per year !
That is ONLY 23 or 46 cent per Dublin Event Guide edition !
An amazingly low cost for the great value that you get every week ! :-)
Please donate via www.paypal.me/DublinEventGuide
or for Revolut users among you just via 0872931571 .
And if 12 Euro is too much for you , then it would be great if you bought one or two or even three virtual coffees for the Dublin Event Guide and you can do that on the “ Buy Me a Coffee ” page here www.buymeacoffee.com/DublinEventG
And come over to www.DublinEventGuide.com to check out some of the ads and click on the ones that you find interesting , that also helps !!
Thank you very very much !
The EPIC Zone
“ EPIC – The Irish Emigration Museum ” ( www.epicchq.com) are currently sponsoring the Dublin Event Guide and this section of the weekly newsletter will contain relevant information about events in general or about EPIC - related news and happenings .
“ EPIC – The Irish Emigration Museum ” is based in the CHQ Building in the IFSC area of Dublin on Custom House Quay .
CHQ , formerly known as Stack A , or the Tobacco Store , was built between 1817 and 1820 to store cargoes of tobacco , tea and spirits .
And the building was made famous when it hosted the Crimean War Banquet in 1856 , celebrating the return of 3,000 Irish soldiers .
—
In the early 2000s the building was restored by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and after trying life as a shopping destination in the Docklands , the CHQ was bought by Irishman Neville Isdell , former Chairman and CEO of Coca - Cola , in 2013 , with the intention of developing it into a tourist destination at the social heart of Dublin ’s Docklands .
—
In 2015 , a strategic advisory group was assembled to create “ EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum ” and in May 2016 , this very modern and highly interactive museum that tells the story of the 70 million Irish people around the world , opened its doors .
++ EPIC is currently closed , but they will be back as soon as possible and in the meantime I want to tell you a bit more about EPIC : “ EPIC – The Irish Emigration Museum ” is based in the CHQ Building in the IFSC area of Dublin on Custom House Quay .

You want for more events and suggestions ?
I found a few more things to keep you going or that you might find interesting : 1 ) CHRISTMAS 2020 – TALK TO YOUR CHILD ! ;-)
Oh , I know !
September and I am already talking about Christmas .
But you know , we are going into the last quarter of this strange year and there is no avoiding of the fact that the next big stop on our path is Christmas .
But there is a very good reason for me mentioning it :
My local Lidl ( and without a doubt many other supermarkets as well ) have shelves stocked with Christmas chocolates and cookies and Christmas events are starting to sell their tickets to Santa Experiences ( minus meeting Santa due to Covid !!!)
—
With all that , the first ( smart ;-) ) children have started to wonder ( and worry ) if Santa will maybe not come this year because of Covid !
So you have to take action and maybe pro-actively talk about it and take your children ’s / grandchildren ’s / nephews ’ / nieces ’ worry away !
—
I do n’t have any children , but I have a wonderfully curious nephew and niece and this is what I would say :
“ This year Christmas will be very different than in other years and we do n’t even know yet what the difference will be , but one thing is certain : Santa will definitely bring some presents and you do n’t have to worry about that !
He lives in the same household with all the reindeers and helpers , so they are allowed to work together and the reindeers can pull the sledge .
And because he brings his own sledge , he is ALSO allowed to fly into Ireland and all other countries without being tested , but to make sure that he will stay healthy , he might not come into the house this year to have milk and cookies , instead he will just drop the presents in the chimney and then move to the next chimney .
This way Santa will stay safe , but you will still get your presents ! ” ;-)
Let me know if it helps ! :-)
Here is the British view : www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-53055224
2 ) MARITIME MUSEUM , Dun Laoghaire
Do you remember that a few months ago I regularly posted links to virtual / online tours ?
The Maritime Museum in Dun Laoghaire now also has a online 3D tour and you should have a look .
The Maritime Museum has its home in a former church just behind the library in Dun Laoghaire and many people do n’t even know about the museum .
It is normally not free , so I usually can’t list some of their events in the Dublin Event Guide ( for Free Events ) , but now that they have a free virtual tour , have a look here : my.matterport.com/show/?m=NtUcQ6qJFJP
3 ) DUBLIN THEATRE FESTIVAL
Last week was National Bikeweek in Ireland and I totally missed it !
Weird times !
There were mainly a few Zoom calls or webinars but hardly any live events .
In the coming week the Dublin Theater Festival will start ( Thursday 24 September – Sunday 11 October ) and I wo n’t miss that , but – as you can imagine – a lot of events again are online .
Find the programme on dublintheatrefestival.ie/
4 ) Birdsong Challenge – Natural History Museum
To keep kids busy , the Natural History Museum has created a website for a Birdsong Challenge .
Watch the videos on the website here www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Natural-History/Engage-And-Learn/Learning-Resources/Birdsong-Challenge
Then learn to recognise the birdsongs and when you are next time on a walk with the whole family , identify the birds that are singing around you .
5 ) Online Courses – Special Offer
During the Covid lockdown , enrollments in Udemy courses increased by 425 % !
Wow !
What did you learn during that time ?
In September most Udemy courses will cost between EUR 10.99 and 12.99 again .
At some point in August the courses were even reduced to 9.99 , but these things happen sometimes without advance warning .
I checked though and in September and October there are no 9.99 discounts planned , so you better get the courses when you see form for between 10.99 and 12.99 .
Please use this link shor .

6 ) Books – BIG DISCOUNT ON BOOK DEPOSITORY
A new free Book summary can be found here every week : readitfor .
me/91927 Readitfor .me actually provides a number of weekly free book summaries and they also have a special offer at the moment still that will expire soon :
For $ 99 you will get Lifetime access to ALL book summaries !
This is a great price if you consider that their normal monthly charge is EUR 10 , so in just 10 month you would have spent more than with the lifetime access .

For one day , science at Willis Junior High School involved hip - hop dancing , booming special effects and an assistant principal being flung into a giant cream pie .
The demonstration by a traveling group of performers , FMA Live , tackled Sir Isaac Newton 's three laws of motion with props such as Velcro jumpsuits , inflated sumo wrestler costumes and water - propelled race cars .
Students followed the 45 - minute show like they were at a rock concert .
" It 's an entertaining aspect to learning , " Angel Guardado , a 14 - year - old eighth - grader , said after the show .
The performance covered Newton 's laws of motion : inertia , force and action - reaction .
To demonstrate the first law , performers took two student volunteers , Jake Ryan and Alan Gonzalez , dressed them in Velcro jumpsuits and propelled them against a Velcro wall .
The students stuck to the wall , illustrating how inertia works in the real world .
For the next law , performers asked another student volunteer , Maya Alvarado , to kick a soccer ball into a goal .
She succeeded by kicking the ball lightly .
Performers then gave her a larger ball , which she had to kick harder and apply more force to , in order to get it into the goal .
Eventually , the ball was so big that Maya could n't exert enough force to move it .
The law they were illustrating was force equals mass times acceleration .
Bryce Bartley , an eighth - grade science teacher , and Robert Montano , a seventh - and eighth - grade math teacher , dressed in sumo wrestler costumes and also demonstrated the law by trying to topple the other .
Only the teacher who took a running start could generate enough force to push down the mass of the other wrestler .
The third law , for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction , was demonstrated by a water - gas race car .
By stepping on a pedal that released steam , the car was propelled forward .
The cars were driven by Ciara Madril and Soledad Duenas , both eighth - graders .
The performers combined the three laws with the help of Assistant Principal Jeff Delp , who was placed in a hover chair and propelled into a giant cream pie .
FMA Live was created in 2004 by Honeywell and NASA .
Their goal was to interest more students in science , technology , engineering and math by showing them real - world applications for theories that go beyond textbooks .
Jobs in those fields are expected to grow five times faster than other fields over the next decade , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
This is the third time FMA Live has performed at Willis Junior High .
Principal Paul Bollard said he thinks the show is a good chance to teach science to students who otherwise might tune out .
" You 'd be surprised how much they get because of the hip - hop rap , " Bollard said .
He likened it to the Schoolhouse Rock series he grew up hearing and its " Conjunction Junction " song .
FMA
Live is the modern equivalent , Bollard said .
" It 's a good tool for kids , and it 's one thing they relate to , " he said .
" It 's at their level . "
' 729 ' Barcode of Israel ?
Alerts regarding identifying Israeli products by their barcode have been circulated over the internet , one example is shown below : Boycott ' 729 ' Barcode
Most of the products have a barcode to identify them .
Each barcode contains a lot of information such as the factory and also the country where it is produced .
The following system is not necessarly waterproof but will certainly allow you to screen a lot of products coming from Israël .
You can retrieve the list of these countries and the according numbers on the internet .
Some examples : 383 EAN Slovenija 471 EAN
Taiwan Notice that these one have NOTHING to do with Israël .
A barcode starting with " 729 " indicates that this product is produced in Israël 729 Israeli Bar Code Association - EAN Israel
Don't buy them if you want to protest against the current agression !!
Sometimes brands are misleading , a barcode never lies if it carries that 729 !!!
Others have added more targets to the barcode boycott list :
The American ones start with 00 till 13 .
But upon investigating the barcodes of know Israeli goods people found the barcodes were n't always correct :
The Israeli bar code story is not so simple .
I purchased several food items from Israel to investigate which could be from the occupied territories .
The Achdut Tahini from Industrial Zone Barkan ( Occupied Territories ) starts out : 7 219 .... Pri-Vayerek Olives from Industrial Zone Har Tov starts : 7 922 ... ( Barbet ( Jam ) imported from Israel by Supreme Foods of Concord Ont. : 6 507 ... )
I notice that foods from Sweden start out with either a 7 or an 8 , so there is no consistant labeling for some countries .
As a matter of fact , I notice that the first number is not consistantly the same on goods from any particular country ; foods from Canada usually start with a 6 , but not always .
There must be a better way to tell ...
Then someone investigated what EAN ( the barcode number ) actually mean .
From the EAN international FAQ : http://www.ean-int.org/faqadc.html
Does the EAN number indicate the country of origin of a product ?
No , the numbering of a product with EAN numbers does not imply any significance .
An EAN number simply starts with the prefix of the member organisation that has allocated a bank of numbers to a company .
This does not mean that the product was manufactured in a specific country or by a specific manufacturer .
So where does this leave us ?
We recommend you read all the labels and not rely on the barcode as it clearly does not indicate the country of origin although it might be accurate on many occasions .
The attacker may only be used as a shot stopper at the World Cup ...
North Korea attacker Kim Myong - Won will not be allowed to play as an outfield player at the 2010 World Cup .
The Asians opted to list the forward as their third goalkeeper to boost their options up front , thus relying on two shot stoppers in their squad .
However , FIFA has now made it clear that Korea will not be allowed to use Kim as an outfield player .
"
The squad lists that the teams had provided to FIFA by June 1 , 2010 are final and can no longer be changed .
On the final lists must be no more than 23 players , three of whom shall be goalkeepers , " read a FIFA statement published by Soccernet .
" The only exception is in the case of a serious injury of a player in the list of 23 , who could be replaced up until 24 hours before the first match of the team in the competition .
" The three players listed as goalkeepers can only play as goalkeepers during the FIFA World Cup and cannot play outfield .
This will be communicated to the teams in the team arrival meetings and will be enforced on match days .
" So to answer the question regarding the North Korean player concretely : Kim Myong - Won will not be allowed to play as an outfield player if he has been put on the list as a goalkeeper .

A proposed anti-trust settlement between the U.S. Justice Department and a subsidiary of energy giant National Grid is under fire for allegedly being too lenient to the power company — and critics say it ’s just another sign of a dysfunctional regulatory climate .
National Grid subsidiary Keyspan Energy has been accused of using Enron - style tactics to manipulate the New York State energy market between 2006 and 2008 , a scheme which withdrew power capacity from the market , raising prices and increasing profits for the power distributor .
ADVERTISEMENT
But now Congressman Dennis Kucinich has joined consumer groups and regulatory agencies to urge the Justice Department to reconsider the settlement that requires the company to pay $ 12 million penalty to the government while not refunding a single dime of the $ 100 million the market manipulation cost consumers .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I want an explanation from the Attorney General as to why this settlement was made , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Kucinich in an exclusive interview with Raw Story .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I want to know why this company is getting a figurative slap on the wrist , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ And why theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re getting away with keeping three quarters what they might have earned from this .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I hope this is not a sign of a regulatory roll - back , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
The congressmanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s remarks came after Raw Story questioned Kucinich , the chair of the House Subcommittee on Domestic Policy Subcommittee of Government Oversight that oversees the Justice Department about criticism of the settlement resulting from an investigation into anti-competitive practices of Keyspan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Keyspan reached the settlement with the anti-trust division of the Justice Department in February after an investigation revealed the company used a credit default swap engineered by investment bank Morgan Stanley to take control of competitor Astoria PowerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s capacity and effectively corner the New York market .
The swap earned Keyspan $ 68 million in profits , regulators determined , while allowing it to withdraw energy capacity from the market and inflate energy prices .
But a slew of protests filed with the federal court overseeing the settlement by advocates for consumers and even energy companies blasted the deal as too lenient to be an effective deterrent and doing little to compensate consumers for their losses .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We estimate it cost consumers in excess of $ 100 million , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Chris Olert , a spokesman for Con Edison which filed a brief opposing the settlement .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Our biggest concern is the rate payers will not receive refunds at all , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
The lack of benefit to the consumers who bore the brunt of higher energy costs also prompted the American Association of Retired Persons to file a brief opposing the settlement .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The public interest may be harmed by this settlement if , instead of the intended deterrent effect , it sends a message that anti-trust violators who inflate prices by the exercise of market powerÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦can escape serious consequences , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the AARP said .
In its response the Justice Department argued that calculating consumer losses with any precision was too unreliable , and that the settlement forced the company to disgorge most of its illicit gains .
The Justice Department did not include an estimate of consumer losses in the economic impact statement included in the settlement .
ADVERTISEMENT
Still , opponents of the settlement face an uphill battle taking on KeyspanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s parent company , National Grid .
Since 2007 National Grid has spent roughly $ 6.4 million on energy industry lobbyists according to campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org .
The firm also donated generously to the campaign coffers of Democrats and Republicans alike .
Among the beneficiaries of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largess were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who received $ 1000 each in the 2010 election cycle .
Recently the company forked over $ 2,500 to Rep. Joe Barton ( R - TX ) , whose apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward during a House hearing on the gulf oil spill caused a national uproar .
ADVERTISEMENT
The company has also been generous to the Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) , contributing $ 4,000 in 2010 .
Congressman Kucinich said he is concerned that the settlement is another sign that the promised regulatory reform from the Obama Administration has been derailed .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ There is no equity to this settlement , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Kucinich said .

Image caption Sara Carbonero stands a few feet away from her goalkeeper boyfriend
Spanish football fans have been speculating that goalkeeper Iker Casillas may have been distracted by his TV reporter girlfriend .
Attention focused on Casillas after Spain 's shock 1 - 0 defeat to Switzerland in their first game of the World Cup .
His girlfriend , Sara Carbonero , once voted the world 's sexiest journalist , was filming behind the goalmouth before the game .
She then conducted a post - match interview with Casillas .
The wives and girlfriends of Spanish players , known as esposas y novias ( wives and girlfriends ) , are barred from accompanying them to the tournament .
Image caption Iker Casillas and Sara Carbonero have been an item since 2009
Before the World Cup , when it was announced Carbonero would be in South Africa doing her trademark post - match interviews , she dismissed claims she would be disruptive , saying : " Can I destabilise the team ?
I think it 's nonsense . "
In Wednesday 's match , Swiss midfielder Gelson Fernandes bundled the ball into Spain 's goal in the 52nd minute of the game .
Casillas had rushed out to tackle a Swiss forward , but failed to grab the ball , which fell luckily for Fernandes .
Later , Spanish football websites carried comments suggesting that the presence of 25 - year - old Carbonero could have affected Casillas 's performance .
Casillas said in the post - match interview that the players were " annoyed " at the defeat .
Carbonero , who was voted Sexiest Reporter in the World by FHM USA last year , has been dating the Real Madrid goalkeeper since 2009 .
Before their opening match , Spain were rated as co-favourites to win the tournament alongside Brazil .
Ottawa — Le Bloc québécois estime que le premier ministre Stephen Harper pourrait être passible de 10 ans de prison .
Selon la députée Carole Freeman , en donnant ordre à son directeur des communications , Dimitri Soudas , de ne pas comparaître en comité parlementaire , le premier ministre s'est peut - être rendu coupable d'entrave à la justice .
« Stephen Harper pourrait lui - même être en contravention de l'article 139 du Code criminel » , a déclaré Mme Freeman hier .
L'opposition tente de forcer Dimitri Soudas à expliquer son rôle dans les demandes d'accès à l'information déposées par les journalistes .
L'opposition soupçonne les conservateurs de s'ingérer politiquement dans les demandes .
M. Harper a écrit une lettre la semaine dernière dans laquelle il reconnaît que c'est à sa demande que M. Soudas refuse de recevoir l'huissier devant lui remettre son assignation à comparaître .
A year ago , before anyone aside from a hundred or so people had ever heard the words High Frequency Trading , Flash orders , Predatory algorithms , Sigma X , Sonar , Market topology , Liquidity providers , Supplementary Liquidity Providers , and many variations on these , Zero Hedge embarked upon a path to warn and hopefully prevent a full - blown market meltdown .
On April 10 , 2009 , in a piece titled " The Incredibly Shrinking Market Liquidity , Or The Black Swan Of Black Swans " we cautioned " what happens in a world where the very core of the capital markets system is gradually deleveraging to a point where maintaining a liquid and orderly market becomes impossible : large swings on low volume , massive bid - offer spreads , huge trading costs , inability to clear and numerous failed trades .
When the quant deleveraging finally catches up with the market , the consequences will likely be unprecedented , with dramatic dislocations leading the market both higher and lower on record volatility . "
Today , after over a year of seemingly ceaseless heckling and jeering by numerous self - proclaimed experts and industry lobbyists , we are vindicated .
We enjoy being heckled - we got a lot of it when we started discussing Goldman Sachs in early 2009 .
Look where that ended .
Today , we have reached an apex in our quest to prevent the HFT " Black Monday " juggernaut , as absent the last minute intervention of still unknown powers , the market , for all intents and purposes , broke .
Liquidity disappeared .
What happened today was no fat finger , it was no panic selling by one major account : it was simply the impact of everyone in the HFT community going from port to starboard on the boat , at precisely the same time .
And in doing so , these very actors , who in over a year have been complaining they are unfairly targeted because all they do is " provide liquidity " , did anything but what they claim is their sworn duty .
In fact , as Dennis Dick shows ( see below ) they were aggressive takers of liquidity at the peak of the meltdown , exacerbating the Dow drop as it slid 1000 points intraday .
It is time for the SEC to do its job and not only ban flash trading as it said it would almost a year ago , but get rid of all the predatory aspects of high frequency trading , which are pretty much all of them .
In 20 minutes the market showed that it is as broken as it was at the nadir of the market crash .
Through its inactivity to investigate the market structure , the SEC has made things a million times worse , as HFT - trading seminars for idiots are now rampant .
HFT killed over 12 months of hard fought propaganda by the likes of CNBC which has valiantly tried to restore faith in our broken capital markets .
They have now failed in that task too .
After today investors will have little if any faith left in the US stocks , assuming they had any to begin with .
We need to purge the equity market structure of all liquidity - taking parasitic players .
We must start today with High Frequency Trading .
Further to demonstrate this point , we bring our readers attention to our post from April 1 , 2009 titled An Open Letter To Quant Funds .
In it we said :
In his April 14th report Matt Rothman wrote about a dramatic , parabolic outperformance trend for names with high short interest , low prices and fundamentally weak names .
He opined that all conditions for this trend to end are in place .
Contrary to his very valid arguments , the trend accelerated yesterday .
Stocks with poor fundamentals , market share losses and poor earning prospects that quantitative managers tend to short , gained more than higher quality long positions .
It is clear from Mr. Rothman 's report that this trend is a main contributor to outsized losses for quant managers .
Some of his respondents admitted to hitting P&L stops .
Recent acceleration of this trend , aka the " crap rally " clearly further damaged quantitative managers performance and resulted in further hits of P&L stops .
The resulting short covering and long index hedges have perpetuated the market rally for now .
At this point , it is hard to say what set off this process , but it is currently accelerating and feeding on itself .
From the timing of Mr. Rothman 's poll of quant managers , it is clear that smaller managers had ample time to exit positions and get flat .
Continuation of the " crap rally " could indicate larger , systematic problems at the largest , most sophisticated quant managers .
We are paging Jim Simmons , DE Shaw , Citadel , LSV , Jacobs Levy and " significant " ' others .
Are you all right ?
We need you alive , small and nimble , to help provide liquidity and maintain orderly markets , not outsized , bigger than the market and dead .
If you still can , please come out and speak up before it is too late .
Today , it was too late .
Liquidity disappeared .
And now we have to deal with the consequences .
One amateurish way is to cancel trades which is what the Nasdaq is doing .
This is simply pathetic , and indicates that everyone is powerless to stand before the consolidated idiocy of the HFT " cash cows . "
One person who does get it is Senator Kaufman , who should be a shining example to all the other idiots and traitors in both Congress and Senate .
Senator Kaufman issued the following release :
“ As I said on the Senate floor today , the growing sovereign debt and banking crisis in Europe is very troubling .
The U.S. needs to get its financial house in order through strong Wall Street reforms that will serve as a lasting bulwark against financial instability .
“ I also have been warning for months that our regulators need to better understand high frequency trading , which appears to have played a role today when the US market dropped 481 points in 6 minutes and recovered 502 points just 10 minutes later .
The potential for giant high - speed computers to generate false trades and create market chaos reared its head again today .
The battle of the algorithms – not understood by nor even remotely transparent to the Securitiesand Exchange Commission – simply must be carefully reviewed and placed within a meaningful regulatory framework soon . ”
It is time fot the SEC to step up to its own sole duty , which is not to guarantee itself jobs at Goldman Sachs ( well , not so much anymore ) , or to watch 18 hours of transvestite porn each day , but to protect the US investor from such borderline criminal activity as High Frequency Trading gone amok .
Forget the Fat Finger - today we were one Fed Finger away from a meltdown that would make Black Monday seem a joke in comparison .
Next time we wo n't be so lucky .
We will have much more to say on this shortly , but we leave you with the words of Dennis Dick of Bright Trading :
Predatory Market Making May Have Led to Crash
Dennis Dick , CFA
Bright Trading LLC
On January 4th of this year , Rambus ( RMBS ) fell 30 % in a matter of five minutes .
It immediately bounced back and was later attributed to a trader with a “ fat finger ” .
When this incident occurred , I discussed on Zero Hedge , the possibility of this being more than just a trader with a “ fat finger ” .
( http://www.zerohedge.com/article/rambus-hft-fat-finger-precursor-things…).
I speculated that this could have been caused by a market structural problem .
This could have been caused by a lack of liquidity due to predatory market making .
Today the same incident occurred , except this time , it happened in the overall market .
Again , the media is blaming a trader with a fat finger .
This may have been the catalyst but it was not the problem .
Predatory market making practices are driving liquidity providers out of the market .
Algorithmic systems constantly step in front of displayed liquidity providers , and discourage them from placing passive limit orders .
They are programmed to automatically step in front of displayed limit orders , to be at the front of the line for execution .
This practice is especially prevalent in thinner stocks .
If a human trader places an order at $ 20.05 , the algorithmic system automatically bids $ 20.06 .
If the human raises their bid to $ 20.07 , the computer goes to $ 20.08 .
This discourages true liquidity providers , and they place less passive limit orders .
Even in the 5 minutes that the market was crashing , these algorithmic systems were still abusing displayed orders .
I placed a few buy orders during the crash , and my orders were still automatically stepped in front of by a penny .
As my friend , Jason Fournier mentioned in his comments to the SEC , “ not only are they discouraging liquidity , they are not allowing it . ”
Broker - dealer internalization also abuses displayed liquidity as they continuously internalize retail order flow in front of displayed limit orders .
In some cases they step in front of the order by as little as 1/100th of a penny , an abusive practice called sub-pennying .
Broker - dealers justify this practice by saying they were giving their customer price improvement .
But they completely ignore the unquantifiable loss to the market participant who was displaying the order , and did not receive the fill .
These predatory market making practices are having a devastating effect on liquidity in our market .
As true liquidity providers become more discouraged , and place less passive limit orders , the depth of the market gets thinner .
Therefore , when we have a trader with a “ fat finger ” accidentally make a mistake , there are less liquidity providers to cushion the blow .
If these predatory market making practices are allowed to continue , eventually there will be no real liquidity in the depths of the market , and when there is a market impact event , we ’re in big trouble .
Today was just a taste of things to come , if our regulators do n’t take note .
And for the benefit of the SEC , this is what a broken market looks like .
We are being hoodwinked again by the FDA and Big Business - the Coca Cola Company , feeling the heat of an increasing consumer rebellion against carcinogenic sweeteners like Aspartame , managed to beg , bribe and bully the FDA into approving Truvia™ , also - known - as Rebiana .
Truvia has gotten GRAS ( " generally regarded as safe " ) status - but not Stevia .
First of all , it took chutspa to call it " Truvia " , as if Stevia somehow is n't the real thing !
Secondly , tales of Truvia™ side effects are starting to appear .
All those editorials about how wonderful it is that " Stevia is now FDA - approved " were just grossly misleading advertisements for Coca Cola 's new " Stevia - sweetened " soda pop .
It 's a hoax , folks !
And the dime - a- dozen " health sites " are taking the bait hook , line and sinker .
The FDA was bribed , blackmailed and bullied to approve Aspartame .
Truvia™ , AKA Rebiana® is an abbreviation for Rebaudioside A , one of the many sweet - tasting compounds in Stevia .
Rebaudioside
A has the least bitter after - taste of all compounds in natural Stevia , that 's why the Coca Cola Company , faced with mounting consumer pressure to remove Aspartame from their products got it rushed to FDA approval .
There are worrying reports about Truvia side effects .
But Stevia is still banned as a food additive or sweetener in the US , Europe and many other countries .
The Australian and New Zealand food standards authority recently approved Steviol glycosides ( including natural Stevia ) for use in foods , while in June 2008 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation 's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) concluded that Stevia extracts containing 95 percent steviol glycosides are safe for human use in the range of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day .
The corrupt FDA only made Cargill / Coca Cola 's product Truvia™ legal to use in food and beverages .
Why was Stevia banned by the FDA ?
unbanned ?
The non-patentable , natural Stevia is the main competitor for a multi-billion dollar sweetener industry .
If this sounds far - fetched , watch this excerpt from the documentary " Sweet Misery " on how the FDA initially banned Aspartame for 16 years , but Donald Rumsfeld - President of Searle and member of Reagan 's transition team - fired the FDA chief and put a puppet in his place who overturned Aspartame 's ban during his first day in office .
Aspartame - patentholder Searle was sold to Monsanto - a major Aspartame producer .
During the FDA 's 16 - year ban on Aspartame , G.D. Searle Company continued to spend millions of dollars in their effort to bring it to market , trying to persuade the FDA that their studies ' proving ' the safety of Aspartame were sound .
An investigation into Searle 's testing procedures subsequently came into question .
During the investigation into Searle 's testing procedures , it was discovered that much of the data was inaccurate , manipulated , and downright false .
The investigators reported " Never to have seen anything as bad as Searle 's testing " .
What followed was a first in the history of the FDA :
They requested a criminal investigation of a manufacturer for knowingly misrepresenting data , concealing material facts and falsifying tests .
The U.S. Attorney 's office was asked to begin grand jury proceedings to investigate whether indictments should be filed against Searle .
The U.S. Attorney in charge of the investigation was Samuel Skinner and Sidley & Austin was the law firm representing Searle .
Sidley & Austin negotiated a job deal with Samuel Skinner and in July 1977 , Mr. Samuel Skinner left his U.S. Attorney 's position and joined the Sidley & Austin law firm working for Searle .
His resignation stalled the grand jury investigation long enough for the statute of limitations on the Aspartame charges to expire .
Therefore the grand jury investigation was cancelled .
The Public Board of Inquiry , FDA scientists and investigators , the National Soft Drink Association and many others made their objections of any Aspartame approval clear .
But then Searle hired Donald Rumsfeld in March 1977 as their CEO .
As former Member of Congress and Secretary of Defense in the Ford Administration , Donald Rumsfeld soon hired several of his Washington friends as top management .
Rumsfeld , then CEO of Searle , stated in a January 1981 sales meeting that he would push for Aspartame 's approval using his political clout in Washington , rather than proper scientific means .
Perhaps for the same reason that Aspartame ( NutraSweet ) was ?

in Washington , rather than proper scientific means .
When Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President of the United States , Reagan 's transition team , ( incl. Rumsfeld ) , picked Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. to be the new FDA Commissioner .
In one of his first official acts as the new FDA Commissioner , Arthur Hayes approved Aspartame .
Dr. Hayes resigned two years later and took a job with Burson - Marsteller , Searle 's public relations firm , as a senior scientific consultant .
Burson - Marsteller also represented several of Aspartame 's major corporate users .
And then in 1998 , two FDA officers forced Oscar Rodes of the Stevita company to burn , yes , burn , thousands of copies of their " Stevia Cookbook " , because the literature suggested that " Stevia could be used as anything else than a dietary supplement " ( namely as a sweetener ) .
And that 's a criminal offence .
Stevia as a sweetener for human consumption is still forbidden in many countries besides the US .
In Norway for example , the maximum punishment for importing it is a - never enforced - three months in jail .
Stevia made illegal by Codex Alimentarius
In many countries , Stevia can only be sold as a food supplement , not a food additive , due to " lack of long - term safety research " .
Of course , the fact that the sugar - industry and the artificial sweetener industry are lobbying like hell for this has nothing to do with it .
But I want to focus on a much greater danger upon us , a far greater threat than just some individual countries regulating which supplements can and can't be sold .
Have you noticed the many articles , some years ago , in the mainstream media , about the " dangers of vitamins " ?
Those articles were intended to weaken opposition against the most tyrannical law the world has ever been subjected to : Codex Alimentarius .
The Codex Alimentarius is the most authoritative set of international food standards ever proposed .
It was set up as a joint program of the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
When people think vitamins are not very important and can even do harm , they are less likely to protest what the WHO ( World Health Organization ) forced down the throat of the world by means of the Codex in 2009 :
The total ban of all beneficial nutrients on Earth .
Yes , the WHO is just as corrupt as the FDA , but on a global scale .
It 's all to protect our health , of course .
I refer to article 3.2.2 of the Codex .
This article is implemented in the current ratification of the Codex as a ban of all vitamins and minerals with dosages greater than the RDA's .
But recommended daily amounts are highly in dispute for being much too low .
Why make therapeutic doses of vitamins illegal ?
In theory , fat - soluble vitamins can be overdosed but in practice , a large percentage of people walk around with deficiencies .
To protect a few zealous over - dosers against themselves , surely a world - wide ban on vitamins , minerals and herbs is a bit over the top ?
Codex Alimentarius - implemented by the WHO - classifies all herbs , vitamins and minerals as pharmaceutical drugs .. and only large pharmaceutical corporations will be allowed to produce them , only medical doctors are permitted to prescribe them , and only licensed pharmacies will have a licence to sell them - at the usual extortionate markup for non-generic medicines .
This will make those health - sustaining substances unavailable to the entire civillized world , because all member countries of the World Health Organization have to abide by it .
Even China and India succumbed .
This lecture " Nutricide " sheds light on the nefarious Codex : Former Canadian Minister of National Defence states in his book " The Evil Empire " : " Codex Alimentarius is supported by international banks and multinational corporations , including some in Canada , and is in reality a bill of rights for these banks and the corporations they control . "
With " Codex " , any food supplement in a dose that has a measurable effect on the human body ( including raising tissue levels significantly ) is deemed a pharmacological substance regulated by law .
If you think you 'll get your nutrients from healthy food like fruit , nuts and veggies , think again .
Soils are depleted worldwide and fertilizers lack trace elements and organic compounds essential to maintain health .
Big Pharma makes their fortune selling outrageously overpriced symptom - relievers that mask the cause of the problem and often excacerbate it .
The more symptoms , the more to relieve .
Big Pharma does n't like healthy folk .
Big Pharma 's own research shows that many modern illnesses never develop , or develop later , or develop more benignly , or are even cured , with proper help of essential nutrients that are lacking in industry - farmed food .
The entire world will have to start complying to Codex Alimentarius now , as it came into effect in 2009 , because the WHO threatens severe trade sanctions against any country that dissents .
Countries have been bullied by the WHO to sign the treaty - the WHO has nothing to do with health , the WHO is a Big Pharma front , a global pressure group with the clout to coerce nations into submission .
Aspartame : Sweet Misery
Donald Rumsfeld did n't just help a few million people into an early grave by " managing " the US slaughter in Viet Nam and Iraq - he also " managed " millions of his fellow countrymen into an early grave by getting Aspartame FDA - unbanned by corrupt and nepotistic means .
Since the stuff was being used in softdrinks and other foods , people were dropping like flies , but the US government and the FDA refused to disclose reports of bad side effects , let alone disclosing that Aspartame causes cancer .
It was hard to do tests on lab animals , because Aspartame producers refused to sell to scientists .
Dr. Ralph Walton , in the mid-nineties , was one of those academics .
It finally took a Freedom of Information request to get the Aspartame side - effect data , and it was n't pretty :
List of Aspartame side effects / symptoms
This is only the tip of the iceberg - the report excludes long - term symptoms like cancer and Alzheimer .
Since Aspartame got FDA - approval , Alzheimer incidency doubled .
Nowadays the toxicity of Aspartame is well established and it is held responsible for everything from ADHD to brain damage .
No wonder - Aspartame 's main metabolites are formaldehyde ( embalming fluid ) and wood alcohol ( terrible poison ) , amongst a few toxic others .
Meet Victoria Innes - Brown - MA & BA Mathematics UCSD from La Jolla California .
She set out to prove once and for all that Aspartame causes cancer , and what she found stunned the world .
Victoria set up a controlled Aspartame experiment with 108 rats over almost 3 years - the natural lifespan of the animals .
No rats were killed during the experiment , such as to honor their sacrifice to us , potential Aspartame consumers .
Most rats developed large tumors .
Victoria , having a degree in mathematics , took great care to set up a bona - fide experiment .
In fact , in a way she greatly exceeded the requirements that are common to such experiments , by not using genetically identical rats , but using as varied a population as possible .
The people of the world are n't all identical clones either .
Victoria used commercially available NutraSweet packets dissolved in the rats ' drinking water .
The daily dosage was approx .
40 mg / kg per animal per day for the life of the animals until they died a " natural " death .
She used 30 males + 30 females for the experiment , and 24 males + 24 females as the control group .
She did everything to assure that the experiment was professionally conducted .
The results were horrifying .
Most , if not all rats became severely ill , many of them with cancer .
Rats lost their skin , became blind , obese or developed other serious ailments .
Some of her pictures :
Rat with side tumor

Many say : " Aspartame is poison " and consider it common knowledge .
Here 's the evidence - I 'd call it proof .
The documentary " Sweet Misery " shows how Aspartame is slowly killing us :
Update :
There is a new scientific study that the FDA - approved daily intake of Aspartame causes brain damage :
http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231714000640
A high school in British Columbia is reprinting its yearbooks after a teacher used a pair of scissors to cut out the picture of a student whose quote he objected to from every copy in the print - run :
Teacher Ken Piercy , who was in charge of the yearbook committee , cut out Brandon 's photo and comment because he said the boy had falsely accused the principal of spending money on a fence instead of textbooks .
" I will not allow anything to be published that is hurtful and untrue , " Piercy stated in an insert placed in the defaced yearbooks .
The fence was installed by the district , not the principal .
Barr said Brandon will be asked to submit a new comment for the reprint .
Will the new Apple iPhone 4's antenna design contribute to lower signal reception ?
Possibly .
According to one antenna consultant and PCMag.com tests , it 's all in how you hold the phone  or do n't .
Will the new Apple iPhone 4's antenna design contribute to lower signal reception ?
According to one antenna consultant and PCMag.com tests , it 's all in how you hold the phone  or do n't .
Customers who have begun can send the phone 's signal indicator plunging , by several bars .
Gizmodo also assembled a number of reader responses that apparently confirmed the signal loss .
The issue , according to industry executives , is that the iPhone 4 places its antenna on the outside of the case , where merely touching it can theoretically limit its ability to pick up a signal .
" Antennas are very sensitive ; that 's just a fact with all antennas , " said Michael Rogers , chief engineer at Wi-EX , a maker of cell - phone signal booster equipment , an industry which would stand to benefit from issues with the iPhone 4's antenna .
A slight drop in signal , say from four bars to three , would n't be enough to affect a cell - phone call or data coverage , Rogers said .
But a sharp drop to a single bar of coverage could be enough to lose the signal altogether .
Enough margin is built in with data coverage that users may not see a dramatic effect in an area with a strong signal .
" But if you 're in a fringe area , anything like this means you 'll drop more calls , " Rogers said .
At this point , the problem is that most " information " out there is anecdotal , industry sources agreed ; the iPhone 4 has just begun shipping , and few if any reviews have examined the specific problem of the external antenna .
Michael Gartenberg , a mobile analyst with The Altimeter Group , said that he believed that the reports were part of an Internet - driven network effect where users blamed poor signal reception on the external antenna .
" We have to assume what we 're seeing is anecdotal , " he said .
" You would be seeing far more reports if you were seeing a major design flaw out there , " Gartenberg added .
PCMag tests confirm an issue
However , in an experiment conducted by PCMag.com Thursday , the iPhone 4 reception problem could indeed be replicated , with the so - called " death grip "  where the iPhone 4 was held with fingers touching the three antenna " lines " circling the device  causing the signal to drop .
In our testing , we discovered that the iPhone 4 " death grip " is definitely real .
Using the Speedtest . net speed testing software , we started a test with the phone sitting on a tabletop .
If we picked up the phone with a slightly sweaty hand and purposefully put one finger on each of the three " lines " around the edge of the device , with the corner tucked into the pad of the hand , the speed dropped dramatically and sometimes stalled out .
Returning it to the tabletop caused things to speed up again .
Adding one of Apple 's rubber " bumpers " to the phone negated the death grip , so it clearly has something to do with conductivity .
The " death grip " did not cause us to drop short calls within an area with a strong signal , but it did appear to make it harder to connect calls in very weak signal conditions .
To Apple 's credit , all phones have weaker signal strength when you cover their antennas .
The iPhone seems to have become a cause celebre because the three points showing where you can touch to reduce signal strength are so visually clear .
That hearkens back to the design of the original iPhone , and then the iPad , said Spencer Webb , president of AntennaSys , an independent antenna consultant and designer for mobile and other products .
When the first iPhone came out , Apple placed the antenna in an obvious location , on the back of the device , Webb said .
If a user covered with a hand , the cell - phone signal dropped , Webb said , in a phone interview that he said was being conducted on the iPhone .
" I 'm talking to you now with a well - trained hand , " he said .
Webb said that he had recently designed a broadband GSM antenna , which he surrounded with an air gap to minimize interference from the GPS chip and other components , to increase performance .
But the design of the iPhone 4 is so compact , and thin , that there was n't room to include any sort of an air gap , he said .
Part of the reason was that the enlarged battery of the iPhone 4 likely pushed the antenna outside the case , Wi -Ex's Rogers said , based on teardowns of the phone from iFixit .
Over time , cell phone antennas have migrated to the bottom of the phone , to minimize the SAR ( specific absorption rate ) of radiation that a phone produces , and is absorbed by the head .
No study has ever conclusively found  or ruled out  that SAR and cancers are not connected , and the Federal Communications Commission requires phones to be tested and the results published .
San Francisco recently became the first city in the nation to propose that SAR data be published alongside the phone .
The Apple iPhone 4 produces a maximum of 1.17 mW /g of SAR radiation at the ear , more than the iPhone 3GS and original iPhone , but less than the 3G , at 1.38 mW / g .
Moving the antenna closer to the ear was " unfortunate , " Webb said .
" And that 's the best I can say . "
Papool Chaudhari of Reyes Bartolomei Browne , a lawyer representing an inventor of a technology designed to minimize cell - phone radiation , went further .
" I think Apple chose to sacrifice safety for better call reception , " Chaudhari said in a statement .
" By placing the antenna outside the housing , Apple hopes to solve the dropped - calls problem , but at what cost ? "
Apple 's iPhone 4 antenna design : dumb ?
When , Webb said he closely examined the images of the new phone as Apple chief executive Steve Jobs projected them on the screen .
( Webb said he had ordered an iPhone 4 , but it had yet to arrive . )
Webb said that he arrived at a choice between two conclusions : either the gaps in the band were not really involved with the antenna and the RF current , or that they were .
" And if they are that 's one 's of the dumbest things I 've ever seen , " he said .
" You can't pick up the iPhone and not interfere with the antenna .
It 's even harder to pick up the phone and not interfere with the antenna than the first - generation iPhone . "
If that 's the case , people are probably correctly observing that they 're killing that antenna , Webb said .
The problem , Webb said , is that the FCC tests do n't include or simulate the presence of a hand , which means that what the FCC tested is n't indicative of real - world use , especially in the case of an iPhone 4 held by a user .
" I 'm certain that the test worked awesomely well without the presence of a hand , " Webb said .
If there is a problem with the iPhone 4 and interference by the user 's body , could the problem be solved by placing the phone in a pocket , and using Bluetooth ?
Webb said he was n't totally sure , but " would venture to say yes , " although placing it in a pocket would still effectively create body contact , he said .
Placing it in something like a fanny pack would be more effective , Webb said .
Apple representatives could not be reached for comment .
Editor 's comment : 22 year old Bradley Manning is one of the very few , true heroes we read about within the U.S. Military .
With his release of information leading to the video published as , " Collateral Murder " and other secret US crimes hidden from the people , Manning has distinguished himself as a courageous champion of the truth and his country .
He should be released from custody immediately and awarded , not imprisoned .
His superiors , on the other hand , in a perfect world , should be charged with murder and conspiracy to withhold information vital to the interests and security of the United States .
The U.S. military command in Iraq states , " The Department of Defense takes the management of classified information very seriously because it affects our national security , the lives of our soldiers , and our operations abroad . "
The Wikileaks video can only be the tip of the iceberg and no rational defense can be made to justify the murder of those unarmed civilians in the name of national security or the protection of US soldiers .
Quite the contrary , Manning may be an enemy of a criminal state , but he 's not an enemy of the people or his fellow soldiers .

U.S. Army analyst detained in leak probe
UPI Report
KUWAIT CITY , June 7 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. Army specialist is being detained in Kuwait on suspicion of leaking classified information to Wikileaks.org , officials say .
Army Spc. Bradley Manning , 22 , of Potomac , Md. , is under investigation for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables as well as U.S. combat footage in Iraq to the secret Internet organization based in Berlin , The Washington Post reported Monday .
In late 2009 Manning found video footage of a helicopter attack in Iraq in 2007 that killed several civilians , the report said .
Wikileaks released the footage in April 2010 under the title " Collateral Damage , " Wired Magazine reported , though it did not confirm Manning was the source of the leak .
Manning said he came across classified information that included " incredible things , awful things … that belonged in the public domain , and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington , D.C. , " Wired said .
" The Department of Defense takes the management of classified information very seriously because it affects our national security , the lives of our soldiers , and our operations abroad , " the U.S. military command in Iraq said in a statement .
Manning was stationed at Forward Operating base Hammer outside Baghdad when he was arrested about two weeks ago .

ROME  American - born forward Giuseppe Rossi and AC Milan striker Marco Borriello were dropped from Italy 's World Cup squad Tuesday .
Coach Marcello Lippi also sent home goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu , defender Mattia Cassani and midfielder Andrea Cossu upon announcing his final 23 - man team .
Midfielder Mauro Camoranesi remained in the squad despite injuring his left knee during training Tuesday .
Lippi did not offer any immediate explanation for his choices , although he was due to meet with reporters Wednesday .
" Did n't make it , but I have no regrets , " Rossi wrote on Twitter .
" ' Worked hard and showed what I could do .
I guess the coach had other plans .
Good luck Italy . "
Rossi was born in New Jersey to Italian parents and has dual citizenship .
He played well for Italy at last year 's Confederations Cup , scoring twice in the opener against the United States , but struggled during the second half of this season with his Spanish club Villarreal .
" Ca n't wait to go back home to my family now ! ! "
Rossi wrote .
" Gonna enjoy a beautiful summer . "
Borriello scored 14 goals for AC Milan this season but plays center forward , a position where Lippi prefers Alberto Gilardino , Vincenzo Iaquinta and Giampaolo Pazzini .
Nine players remain from the team that won the World Cup four years ago in Germany : Gianluigi Buffon , Fabio Cannavaro , Gianluca Zambrotta , Camoranesi , Daniele De Rossi , Gennaro Gattuso , Andrea Pirlo , Gilardino and Iaquinta .
Fabio Grosso , the left back who converted the decisive penalty kick in the final against France four years ago , had already been cut two weeks ago after being named to the preliminary 30 - man squad .
Lippi never even considered picking Antonio Cassano , the talented but temperamental Sampdoria forward , or Mario Balotelli , the controversial 18 - year - old Inter Milan striker .
Italy has been training in Sestriere at 2,035 meters ( 6,670 feet ) since May 23 and will depart for South Africa on June 8 .
The Azzurri have friendlies set up vs. Mexico in Brussels on Thursday and vs. Switzerland in Geneva on Saturday .
At the World Cup , Italy opens against Paraguay on June 14 and will also face New Zealand and Slovakia in Group F. ___ Squad : Goalkeepers : Gianluigi Buffon ( Juventus ) , Morgan De Sanctis ( Napoli ) , Federico Marchetti ( Cagliari ) .
Defenders : Salvatore Bocchetti ( Genoa ) , Leonardo Bonucci ( Bari ) , Fabio Cannavaro ( Juventus ) , Giorgio Chiellini ( Juventus ) , Domenico Criscito ( Genoa ) , Christian Maggio ( Napoli ) , Gianluca Zambrotta ( AC Milan ) .
Midfielders : Mauro Camoranesi ( Juventus ) , Daniele De Rossi ( AS Roma ) , Gennaro Gattuso ( AC Milan ) , Claudio Marchisio ( Juventus ) , Riccardo Montolivo ( Fiorentina ) , Angelo Palombo ( Sampdoria ) , Simone Pepe ( Udinese ) , Andrea Pirlo ( AC Milan ) .
Forwards : Antonio Di Natale ( Udinese ) , Alberto Gilardino ( Fiorentina ) , Vincenzo Iaquinta ( Juventus ) , Giampaolo Pazzini ( Sampdoria ) , Fabio Quagliarella ( Napoli ) .

Harry Benson is a photojournalist that I recently became familiar with .
Born in Scotland , Harry Benson was introduced to the United States when he landed with the Beatles when they toured America in 1964 .
His work has not only spanned decades but he has also photographed a wide variety of places and people .
Some of his more notable work includes photographing every U.S. president from Eisenhower to Obama .
He has been in the right place ( or the wrong place ) on many occasions allowing him to capture some of the most poignant moments in America history .
He was just a few feet away when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated ; he was in the same room when Nixon resigned and was there during the Meredith march with Martin Luther King , Jr. He was there when the Berlin Wall separated a country and was there to photograph it when it fell .
Among is many accolades , his photography is on permanent collection at the Scottish national Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington , DC .
He gained most of his fame as a photographer for LIFE magazine from 1970 to 2000 and currently works for Vanity Fair Magazine , and photographs for Architectural Digest , Newsweek and other major magazines .
If you have not heard of Harry Benson then you are in for a visual treat .
He has taken many wonderful photographs that run the gamut from the light - hearted and fun to the tragic and haunting .
I have chosen what I feel are 10 photographs that capture the depth and beauty of his work across a wide scale .
You can see more of his work at his website : http://www.harrybenson.com and get a more intimate look at this legendary photographer when you read On the Road with Harry Benson .
When I could find his own words about a photograph , I included them under the photo .
If not , I gave some commentary on the subject matter .
In no particular order , the photography of Harry Benson …
Michael Jackson at Neverland
One could see how Neverland could take Michael ’s mind off all his worries and transport him from the reality of his stressful life .
He had everything he wanted there .
I got the impression that in no way was Michael a recluse .
He read the papers and kept up with the news .
Once he asked me what I thought of the Reagans , who were in the White House at the time .
He was also curious to know what the Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was like , as Michael had seen my photograph of him .
Michael made a point of knowing who was who , while all the time those sad eyes were searching , looking closely at me .
Occasionally he would break into a laugh , but mostly he was just looking .
Harry Benson , Photographer
I also like this photo of Michael Jackson taken by Harry Benson .
It is more introspective and I believe captures the other side of his personality .
KKK Mother with Child , Beaufort , S.C. , 1965
I could n’t find any commentary by Harry Benson and this photograph more than any other piqued my interest into what he might have to say about it .
The visual is startling in many ways .
The KKK brings to mind violence , burning crosses and bigotry so to see a woman caring for her child is contrary to my perceptions .
When I think a moment longer , it saddens me as I realize this innocent child will have little choice but to follow their parent ’s short - sighted and prejudice way of life .
Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow , Truman Capote ’s Black and White Ball , New York , 1966
“ To this day it was the biggest party I ever shot .
Capote ’s ball was unique .
Everyone wanted to be there .
People who were n’t invited went out of town .
I was at the top of the stairs at nine o’clock and caught Sinatra as he was walking in .
He could n’t get past me .
He felt really stupid in that mask .
Someone had just yelled to him , ‘ Hey , there ’s Frankie Batman . ’
You can see the anger in his eyes behind the mask .
He was this tough guy thinking , ‘ What the hell am I doinig here ? ’
Mia Farrow had that precious , elfin look , but she was tough as nails too . ”

Robert Kennedy Assassination , Los Angeles , 1968
At the victory party following the California Democratic presidential primary , Senator Robert F. Kennedy made his way down from the podium , through the crowd , and out into the kitchen of Los Angeles ’ Ambassador Hotel .
Benson trailed at his heels .
But within seconds , the victory chants were replaced by screams .
Kennedy had been shot in the head with a .22 caliber gun , and lay dying at Benson ’s feet .
“ A Kennedy is literally shot in front of me , ” Benson said .
“ I ’m saying to myself , ‘ Do n ’t **** up today .
**** up tomorrow . ’
This is it .
This is what I came into the business for . ”
Benson , the only photographer on the scene , did n’t hesitate , and snapped now - iconic images of Kennedy on the floor , and a fear - stricken Ethel Kennedy turning around to scream : “ Give him air ! ” Benson shot five rolls of film of the assassination , and put each roll in his sock , “ in case a policeman with a gun asked me for my film . ”
He says : “ I ’d rather photograph for life than die for it . ”

President Richard M. Nixon Resigns , Washington , D.C. , August 1974
Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9 , saying farewell to his Cabinet and White House staff with his family by his side .
You can really see the pain in the faces of his family .
I truly believe they are suffering with him .
Beatles Pillow Fight , George V Hotel , Paris , 1964
The Beatles , Paris , France , 1964 : “ It was 3 am after a concert at the Olympia in Paris in January 1964 .
They had so much pent - up energy after a performance , and they really could n’t go out because they would be mobbed .
So we were sitting around talking and drinking .
Their manager , Brian Epstein , burst into their suite at the Hotel George V to tell them “ I Want to Hold Your Hand ” was No. 1 on the American charts , which meant they were going to America to be on ‘ The Ed Sullivan Show ’ …
I heard the Beatles talking about a pillow fight they had had a few nights before , so I suggested it .
I thought it would make a good photo to celebrate .
At first they said OK , but then John said , no , it would make them look silly .
Then John slipped up behind Paul and hit him over the head with a pillow , spilling his drink , and that started it . ”
Harry Benson , Photographer
I included a second Beatles photo by Harry Benson that I actually like more than this one , but the commentary on the pillow fight was too good not to share .
This photo shows the Beatles in a more candid moment that you do n’t often see .
John Lennon Memorial , Central Park , New York , 1980 Over 250,000 people joined together to share their sorrow for John Lennon ’s senseless death .
This photo is taken in Central Park December 14 , 1980 .
James Brown , Augusta , Georgia , 1979 “ In Augusta , to photograph James Brown , these pictures were taken when he suggested we go for a ride .
He told me he would show me ‘ his town . ’
So we jumped into an old car and drove around .
He would stop the car when he saw someone sitting in their yard , run up , do the split , yell out , ‘ I feel good , ’ and jump back in the car and drive off .
It was all so spontaneous and hilarious , and it took the onlookers by such surprise .
Brown was a fun-loving character and a good sport . ”
Harry Benson , Photographer I smile just thinking about the fun reactions from the townspeople as James Brown gives a mini-performance for each .
The Clinton Kiss , Little Rock , Arkansas , 1992 “ Governor Clinton had announced his candidacy for presidency and this was a quiet moment before the hectic campaign began . ”
Harry Benson , Photographer Just thinking about everything that would happen to the Clintons after this photo is amazing .
Someone should make a movie .
Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , Funeral in Atlanta , 1968
This photograph really touched me .
While it is tragic that any man should be murdered or assassinated for his beliefs it is even more tragic that a child should grow up without their father .
No child should be have to see a parent in a coffin whether that parent was Martin Luther King , Jr. , or anyone else .
Bonus Photograph Dolly Parton , Nashville , Tennessee , 1976 “ Dolly Parton makes everyone feel right at home with a down - home welcome when she meets you .
She was getting ready for me to photograph her .
I walked over to ask when she would be ready and saw her standing near a window , putting on the finishing touches of her makeup .
I said , ‘ Dolly , do n’t move , just keep doing what you are doing , ’ and she obliged .
It was a completely natural picture , no lights were set up , yet it was the one I liked best from that day . ”
Harry Benson , Photographer
Of course you think of Dolly for two things , her bust and her hair and both are captured perfectly in the photograph .
Or is that three things ?

In his first interview since the Cavs ' season ended with a shocking , second - round loss to Boston , James told CNN 's Larry King that Cleveland has " an edge " to re-sign him when the greatest collection of free agents in league history hits the open market on July 1 .
King , who interviewed James at the two - time MVP 's home near Akron on Tuesday , asked the superstar if Cleveland has " an edge going in . "
" Absolutely .
Because , you know , this city , these fans , I mean , have given me a lot in these seven years .
And , you know , for me , it 's comfortable .
So I 've got a lot of memories here .
And -- and so it does have an edge , " James said .
Also during the interview , James said he can't wait for July 1 to arrive and that he has not yet decided where he 'll sign .
" I 'm far from close , " he was quoted as saying in a transcript posted by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland .
" July is still a month away , less than a month away .
I 've thought about it , but I have n't began to strategize exactly . "
Wherever he does sign , James wants it to be a place where he can win multiple championships .
" Well , I mean , to me , I think my ultimate , my ultimate goal is winning championships , and I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I , you know , win a championship , " James told King , according to The Plain Dealer .
" The team that I go to or -- or , you know , whatever the case may be , will have an opportunity to win championships in multiple years and not just because of LeBron James , " he told King , according to The Plain Dealer .
While Dwyane Wade 's agent tried to downplay the idea of a " summit " where the top free agents will meet to discuss their plans before signing this summer , James left little doubt that he will talk with Wade , Chris Bosh and others , even proclaiming that he will be the " ringleader " for the talks .
" It will be fun to get all the free agents together and , you know , figure out a way how we can make the league better , " James told King , according to The Plain Dealer .
He also said that he wo n't demand a say in who is coaching his new team .
" I 'm not one to go into the off year and say this is who I want my coach to be .
Now , there are some coaches , that , you know , if I had an opportunity to play for , I would be delighted .
But I 'm not as far as -- as picking a coach , " James said , according to The Plain Dealer .
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted unanimously on Tuesday to require an audit of the Federal Reserve ’s emergency actions during and after the 2008 financial crisis as part of broad legislation overhauling the nation ’s financial regulatory system .
The amendment , proposed by Senator Bernard Sanders , independent of Vermont , would require the Government Accountability Office to scrutinize some $ 2 trillion in emergency loans that the Fed provided to some of the nation ’s biggest banks .
The vote was 96 to 0 .
Mr. Sanders , a professed socialist , has long demanded greater transparency at the central bank , and his original plan could have subjected the Fed to continuing audits of some of its routine operations .
But he agreed to scale it back in the face of opposition from the White House , the Fed , the Treasury and some Senate colleagues .
While the Senate provision would require an audit of the Fed ’s emergency operations beginning on Dec. 1 , 2007 , the House approved tougher audit requirements late last year in its version of the financial regulatory legislation .
Once the larger Senate bill is adopted , the provisions will have to be reconciled .
The Boston Red Sox have announced that Fenway Park will host an exhibition soccer game between Celtic FC of the Scottish Premier League and Sporting Clube de Portugal , commonly called " Sporting , " on July 21 .

Researchers have found that implanted identity chips can pick up computer viruses .
Reading University 's Mark Gasson conducted an experiment to show how radio frequency identity ( RFID ) chips could become electronically infected .
He explained to Rory Cellan - Jones the risks involved with the new technology including its effects on medical implants such as pacemakers .
“ It ’s worse than politics , ” said Larry Goldstein , a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation , which is partly financed by the oil industry .
“ They have had the authority from Day 1 .
If they could have handled this situation better , they would have already . ”
As the verbal warfare between officials and company executives escalated , the slick from the April 20 well blowout continued to spread in billowing rust - colored splotches in the gulf , raising urgent questions about what lay beneath .
On land , shrimpers were stuffing their catch into coolers in hopes of having some in store if the season ends altogether .
Hotel owners all along the gulf were trying to persuade tourists to keep their vacation plans .
But as they looked to BP and the authorities for help , or at least direction , there has only been frustration .
“ I never thought it would come to this , ” said Ryan Lambert , a charter boat operator in Buras , La. , who spoke to the federal delegation on Monday .
“ My guys look to me and say ‘ What do I do , boss ? ’
And I do n’t have an answer . ”
Several things have become clear over the past month .
Neither BP nor the government was prepared for an oil release of this size or at this depth .
The federal Minerals Management Service , charged with overseeing offshore oil development , has for too long served as a handmaiden of industry .
Laws governing deepwater drilling have fallen far behind the technology and the attendant risks .
And no one can estimate the extent of the economic and environmental damage , or how long it will last .
“ Just under 70 miles of our coast have been hit by oil , ” said Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , a Republican , who criticized the disjointed response effort that he said has allowed oil to come ashore unnecessarily .
“ Let ’s make no mistake that what is at threat here is our way of life . ”
The crude has been flowing at a rate still unknown nearly a mile below the surface , escaping in quantities far greater than the small amount of oil that has been burned off , collected with booms or sucked from the broken drill pipe lying on the ocean floor .
Bundespräsidentenwahl stellt die Bundesregierung vor eine Zerreißprobe Silvio Duwe
In der FDP wird offen über eine Wahl von Joachim Gauck nachgedacht
Mit der Nominierung des niedersächsischen Ministerpräsidenten Christian Wulff wollten die Spitzen der christlich - liberalen Koalition Handlungsfähigkeiten beweisen und nach einem mehr als missglückten Start zeigen , dass sie an dem Bündnis trotz aller Meinungsverschiedenheiten und Konzeptlosigkeit festhalten wollen .
Der CDU - Mann
Wulff , der selbst eine schwarz - gelbe Koalition führt , schien dafür der perfekte Kandidat zu sein .
Doch dieses parteipolitische Taktieren um das höchste Amt im Staate könnte Merkel und Westerwelle nun auf die Füße fallen - immer lauter werden die Stimmen aus dem eigenen Lager , die offen über eine Wahl des rot-grünen Kandidaten Joachim Gauck nachdenken .
Rein rechnerisch ist alles eindeutig .
Union und FDP kommen zusammen auf mindestens 644 Sitze in der Bundesversammlung .
Bei insgesamt 1244 Mitgliedern bedeutet dies einen deutlichen Vorsprung von 44 Sitzen , die Opposition entsendet laut den Zahlen aus dem Innenministerium höchstens 600 Wahlfrauen und - männer .
Doch die " parteipolititschen Spielchen " bei der Präsidentenwahl , die Gauck in einem Interview kritisierte , scheinen dem schwarz - gelben Lager nun selbst auf die Füße zu fallen .
Besonders in der FDP wird laut über eine Wahl des rot -grünen Gegenkandidaten nachgedacht .
So erklärte der Vorsitzende der sächsischen FDP und der dortigen Landtagsfraktion , Holger Zastrow , es gebe keinen Blankoscheck für eine Wahl von Wulff .
Er habe " große Sympathien für Joachim Gauck " .
Damit ist er nicht der einzige , auch Veit Wolpert , FDP - Fraktionsvorsitzender in Sachsen - Anhalt , überlegt derzeit noch , ob seine Fraktion mit Wulff leben könne , es gebe Bedenken .
Nach seiner Aussage sind die Liberalen in den Ländern über den Vorsitzenden ihrer Bundespartei , Westerwelle , verärgert , weil dieser sie in die Kandidatenauswahl nicht mit einbezogen habe .
Kritik an der Kandidatur von Wulff kommt auch aus der FDP in Bayern und Baden - Württemberg , bei der FDP in Thüringen ist die Entscheidung den Aussagen ihres Generalsekretärs Patrick Kurth zufolge bisher noch nicht gefallen .
In Berlin und Mecklenburg - Vorpommern sprechen sich die Liberalen allerdings für Wulff aus .
Liberale fühlen sich übergangen
Da von Seiten der Koalition lediglich Unions - Politiker für die Köhler - Nachfolge im Gespräch waren , fühlen sich die Liberalen offenbar übergangen .
Hinzu kommt die Einsicht , ihre Ziele in der schwarz - gelben Koalition in Berlin nicht durchsetzen zu können .
Die wenigen Anliegen der Liberalen , zu denen in erster Linie Steuersenkungen und die Einführung der Kopfpauschale im Gesundheitswesen gelten , sind entweder aufgrund der desolaten Haushaltslage nicht umsetzbar oder werden vom größeren Koalitionspartner abgelehnt .
Hinzu kommen die ständig sinkenden Umfragewerte der FDP , die sich innerhalb eines Jahres geradezu halbiert haben , was zu einem nicht unbedeutenden Teil auch dem erfolglos agierenden Guido Westerwelle anzulasten ist .
Die Liberalen , die offen darüber nachdenken , den rot-grünen Präsidentschaftskandidaten Joachim Gauck zu unterstützen , wissen genau , dass eine Niederlage von Christian Wulff in der Bundesversammlung gleichzeitig das Aus für die schwarz - gelbe Bundesregierung bedeuten würde .
Ob sie es soweit kommen lassen , darf ernsthaft angezweifelt werden .
Spätestens im dritten Wahlgang , wenn statt einer absoluten nur noch eine einfache Mehrheit für die Wahl des künftigen Bundespräsidenten notwendig ist , sollte die Mehrheit für Wulff stehen .
Die Diskussion ist jedoch ein deutlicher Warnschuss in Richtung Berlin .
Die Anzahl der erforderlichen Wahlgänge und die Zahl der fehlenden Stimmen aus dem schwarz - gelben Lager sind Indikatoren für die Stabilität der Bundesregierung .
Eine weitere Schwächung der Position von Angela Merkel ist wahrscheinlich .
Earlier this week the announcement that Vampire Weekend , Beach House , and Dum Dum Girls would all be performing together this summer at Merriweather Post Pavilion ( among other venues ) may have gotten us a little bit too excited .
The combination of these three massive indie bands all playing on the iconic stage that legends from Jimi Hendrix to Janis Joplin have graced ( and that Animal Collective , of course , named their critically - acclaimed album after ) has convinced us that this may just be the most “ epic ” concert of the summer .
And that got us thinking : Could we come up with a concert that was even more epic in scope ?
1. Panda Bear and the members of Grizzly Bear teach actual pandas and grizzly bears to play their songs and perform a one - night show at the Bowery Ballroom .
What we would n’t give to see a grizzly bear croon like Ed Droste …
2. Lady Gaga performs “ Bad Romance ” in Colonial Williamsburg , substituting her normal electronic backing for fifes , drums , and the choral accompaniment of Amber , Angel , and Haley from Dirty Projectors — who have substituted one Williamsburg for another .
Who says Colonial Williamsburg is only for learning how to churn butter ?
3. John Lennon is resurrected to collaborate with Danger Mouse and Ratatat .
They perform for tips at Washington Square Park .
They will certainly put the hacky - sack dudes and magicians to shame that day .
4. Flight of the Conchords perform while parachuting from a Concorde turbojet .
Watch out for the appearance of David Bowie in a sequined space suit .
He wo n’t use a parachute and may smoke some Astro Turf .
5. Zooey Deschanel and Natasha Khan perform songs from Disney Channel Original Movies with the kids from PS - 22 while amidst a huge bushel of kittens .
We actually advise not going to this concert .
The cuteness may make your head explode .
Tickets go on sale for the Vampire Weekend , Beach House , and Dum Dum Girls concert on Friday at 10 am .
Those who are engaged in the Palestinian solidarity discourse are familiar with two visions of conflict resolution : the ‘ Two State Solution ’ and the ‘ One State Solution ’ .
This week we have learned about a third possible resolution that seems to me the most reasonable and ethical considering the circumstances .
Helen Thomas , the 89 years old doyenne of the White House press corps , sketched it in one sentence .
When asked by a Rabbi holding a camera : " where should Israelis go " , she said Jews should “ get the hell out of Palestine ” .
When the Rabbi challenged her , she made it plainly clear : “ they should go home to Poland , Germany , America and elsewhere ”
Thomas was quick to be reminded who runs Capitol Hill .
A global war was declared against her .
She had to resign and to apologise .
However , her brief yet transparently clear solution is sound and should be elaborated upon .
It is an obvious fact that the Israelis do not belong to the region .
The Jewish claim for Zion i.e. Palestine is beyond pathetic .
It is in fact as ridiculous as a bunch of Italian settlers invading London 's Piccadilly Circus claiming their right to return to a land once occupied by their Roman forefathers .
Obviously Italians would not get away with it , Zionists , on the other hand , have managed to fool the nations for more than a while .
Unlike our Western politicians and Media , Helen Thomas was not impressed by the Zionist argument .
Let ’s try to understand what she is saying .
She suggests primarily that Jews do n’t belong to Palestine and Palestine certainly does n’t belong to the Jews .
She also argues that the home for Jews is somewhere else .
Thomas suggested for instance that Jews should go to Germany .
Surely this is not such a rude idea considering the love Germany pours on Israel .
We should n’t also forget that the Israeli nuclear submarines that have been on their way to the Gulf ( according to The Times ) , were given to Israel by Germany as a ‘ present ’ at the time that Israel flattened Lebanon ( 2006 ) .
If Angela Merkel is sincere , she should welcome the Israelis to return to her country and save the world from another world conflict .
As it happens , most Western leaders support the Two State Solution , they believe that such a solution is fair and ethical .
I wonder what is so ethical about it , the Two State Solution does n’t address the Palestinian Cause .
It largely ignores the Palestinian Right of Return to their land , homes , villages , fields and orchards .
It accepts the outrageous circumstances in which millions of Palestinian refugees will be left dispossessed forever .
Most humanists seem to support the One State Solution , they are convinced that such a solution is fair and ethical .
Again , I am rather perplexed here .
As much as we accept that sharing the land is reasonable and ethical , it is completely foreign to Jewish ideology and Zionism in particular .
Early Zionist immigrants were more than welcome to share the land with the Palestinian indigenous population .
But they had a completely different plan in mind , they wanted a ‘ Jews only State ’ .
They eventually ethnically cleansed the Palestinians ( 1948 ) , Those who managed to cling to the land were eventually locked behind walls and barbed wire .
The One State Solution dismisses the Jewish ideology .
As much as I myself tend to support the One State Solution , I am fully aware of the fact that such a solution may become possible only when the Israeli Jewish population gives up its supremacist ideology .
Needless to say that when this happens , the Jews in Palestine would become Palestinian Jews : ordinary people of Jewish ethnic origin who happen to live on Palestinian land .
Those who are repulsed by Helen Thomas ’ resolution , blame her for being discriminatory towards Jews .
The truth of the matter is that Thomas ’ suggestion is not at all different or more discriminatory than the notorious Two State Solution .
While Thomas suggests that millions of Jews would peacefully go back to their true home , the Two State Resolution suggests that millions of Palestinian refugees would be left with no home whatsoever .
Clearly , the Israeli State mentions again and again that it would never allow Palestinian refugees to return to their land .
Considering the latest Israeli barbarian military operations , bearing in mind the disastrous starvation in Gaza , learning about the serious threat to world peace imposed by repeated nuclear threats made by Israel against its neighboring States and Iran in particular , we should move the discourse one step further .
We better look at the Helen Thomas ’ solution .
Seemingly , the Rabbi who assaulted Helen Thomas , is not impressed by Thomas ’ solution .
He was concerned about six million Jews who perished in Europe .
Someone should remind the Rabbi that the European Judeocide has nothing to do with Palestine or the Palestinians .
However , his own behaviour towards Thomas together with the Israeli repellent murderous behaviour in the high seas , in Palestine , and the Jewish lobbies around the world , all contribute together to a necessary revision of the notion of ‘ Jewish suffering ’ in history .
At the end of the day , our vision of the past is constantly shaped by our present understandings .
Like the rest of humanity , Old Helen Thomas is tired of Jewish power and Israeli barbarism , she touched the nerve exactly where it hurts by saying the plain truth .
“ Get the hell out of Palestine ” .
Truth , it seems , echoes ethics and reason .

What ’s unusual about these numbers ?
Each series is spaced evenly on the number line :
Each number is a palindrome .
And each is prime .
There ’s a rumor going around that the Afghani Taliban is embedding dirty syringes and razors in improvised explosive devices , making hypothetical “ HIV bombs , ” or some variant of the term .
This has yet to be confirmed , but was claimed by Patrick Mercer , a British member of parliament and former soldier .
UK tabloid The Sun ran with the allegation , saying the practice had been “ exposed , ” but presenting no actual evidence .
ADVERTISEMENT
The story was carried in a number of other online venues , but at time of this writing it appeared that the only “ mainstream ” U.S. news bureau to feature the claim was Fox News , which erroneously — and perhaps mistakenly — called the scheme “ a bid to infect British troops ” .
How exactly these alleged Afghan bomb - makers could design HIV - laced weapons that target soldiers based on nationality , Fox News did not explain .
The network instead cited The Sun as its only source , although not even the British tabloid made such an unusual statement .
The allegations were apparently enough for the American Family Association ( AFA ) to weigh in .
As a conservative non -profit group best known for attacking marriage equality and homosexuals in other walks of public life , the focus of their response might have been expected .
Instead , the AFA declared in a Thursday blog headline : “ Gay sex = domestic terrorism ” .
Writer Bryan Fischer opined :
“ It is because of the risk of HIV transmission that the FDA will not allow a male homosexual to donate blood if he has had sex with another male even one single solitary time since 1977 .
The second riskiest behavior for HIV infection is injection drug use .
“ Now if gays are allowed into the military , they will be inevitably be put in battlefield situations where donated blood from soldiers may be necessary to save the lives of wounded comrades .
An HIV - infected American soldier whose blood is used in those circumstances may very well condemn his fellow soldier to death rather than save his life .
“ If open homosexuals are allowed into the United States military , the Taliban wo n’t need to plant dirty needles to infect our soldiers with HIV .
Our own soldiers will take care of that for them . ”
He would appear to believe HIV and AIDS is exclusive to homosexual communities , which it is not .
Either that or the AFA is impugning the integrity of the Armed Services Blood Program , which — like any blood donation program operating up to medical standards — screens donated fluids for disease .
ADVERTISEMENT
A call to the U.S. Army Medical Command seeking comment on Mr. Fischer ’s assertion was not returned at time of this writing .
The military ’s blood program also accepts donations from civilians , though collection centers are on military facilities and staff adheres to the Food and Drug Administration ’s rules on screening donors .
Currently , gay men are prohibited from donating blood in the U.S. , but like “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ” that ’s being reconsidered .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Los Angeles Times noted on Wednesday :
“ Pressure for a review of the policy has been building for several years .
The push has been driven by improvements in testing , which can detect HIV in the blood within two weeks of a person having been infected .
“ There were nine known cases of HIV having been transmitted via blood products between 1994 and 2002 , and none , in tens of millions of transfusions , between 2002 and 2007 , the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has complete data . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The paper added that Sen. John Kerry had attacked the gay blood ban as an “ unscientific double standard . ”
The American Medical Association has also recommended gays be allowed to donate blood , especially in lieu of an ever - present national shortage .
In documents provided by the U.S. Military Medical Command ’s public affairs office , military policy on donated blood not approved by the FDA [ PDF link ] , seen plainly in the second paragraph of a publicly available memo issued March 19 , 2010 .
The AFA ’s claims are based on misleading assumptions triggered by an unverified claim from a politician who was recently selected to lead the British parliament ’s Defence Committee .
ADVERTISEMENT
Furthermore , Federal News Radio ’s Pentagon reporter J.J. Green cited an unnamed U.S. military official as calling the allegation of an HIV - laced bomb “ ‘ absolutely ’ ridiculous ” .
“ Questions have arisen about where the Taliban would get the needles and how they would know they ’re infected with HIV , ” he added .
“ British military explosive ordinance disposal teams have reportedly have been issued special gloves to handle IEDs . ”
In any case , considering the small number of HIV transmissions by blood donor in the last two decades , it would seem fair to argue that the words “ hateful and “ ugly ” are used objectively in describing the AFA ’s latest rhetorical assault on homosexuals .

Nearly 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water .
The problem is particularly dire in Ghana , where diarrhea causes 25 percent of all deaths of children below the age of five each year , according to UNICEF .
The figure is even higher in northern Ghana , where about half the population get its water from wells , ponds and streams that often contain disease - causing microorganisms .
Part of the problem is that large , centralized water filtration and sanitation systems are n’t designed to reach remote areas like northern Ghana , according to Susan Murcott , a senior lecturer in MIT ’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering ( CEE ) .
Murcott has been distributing affordable ceramic water filters in the region through Pure Home Water ( PHW ) , a nonprofit she co-founded with local partners in 2005 .
To date , PHW has sold and distributed the filters to more than 100,000 people , and the goal is to reach 1 million people by 2015 .
Murcott has taught water and sanitation infrastructure in developing countries for more than a decade and believes that a household - scale device is crucial for fighting poverty in remote regions that are n’t connected to urban water and wastewater treatment plants .
“ Engineering schools in the West teach students mainly how to build large , urban , centralized systems , but these systems can never reach the people most in need , ” she said .
“ This is a huge disconnect , and my work has been about making people aware that while the treatment processes are the same , they can design small systems , either household - scale or community scale , that will reach the bottom billion .
” Locally branded as the " Kosim " filter , ( meaning “ pure water ” in the local Dagbani language ) , the flower pot -shaped vessel has thousands of microscopic pores on the bottom that drain water while trapping parasites and bacteria .
Although other small systems have been successful in other developing countries , the Kosim filter is the only one that has been embraced by northern Ghana ’s residents , who are willing to pay as much as $ 5 for a filter even though they earn less than $ 1 per day on average .
One reason for the popularity is that PHW is the only NGO testing and monitoring the quality of the water treated by its filters .
The organization also employs trained field personnel to help integrate the filter into poor households .
More than 40 MIT engineering and Sloan School of Management students , many of whom have traveled to Ghana thanks to the support of the CEE Masters of Engineering Program , the Global Entrepreneurship Lab and the Public Service Center , have helped PHW by conducting product - research and consumer studies .
They are currently helping the organization become locally and financially self - sufficient by building a factory in northern Ghana .
Until now , PHW would procure , sell , distribute and monitor filters it bought from a factory located more than 12 hours away , but the filters suffered from lack of quality control and often broke .
By making their own filters , Murcott is confident her team can improve their quality while also reducing their cost of production from $ 16 to $ 10 .
Because the filters cost more for PHW to produce than people can typically pay for them , owning a factory is essential for PHW to become a sustainable business that does not operate at a loss or rely solely on outside grants , according to Gordon Adomdza , a Ghanaian business professor at Northeastern University who advises PHW .
With its own factory and equipment , PHW can diversify its offerings to other clay products like bricks and tiles that can be sold for profit .
“ They can then reinvest that money to help supplement the filter deployment , ” said Adomdza , who is optimistic about PHW ’s future as a self - sustaining organization .
In January , Murcott , four students , a factory consultant and local workers spent one month building the factory , as well as the kilns and other manufacturing equipment .
The construction also involved testing the production capabilities of the site to ensure that the filters could be produced through an unusual technique that Murcott learned a decade ago while researching household filters made in Nicaragua by nonprofit Potters for Peace .
Instead of the traditional method of mixing clay , forming it into a shape and heating it in a kiln , the Potters for Peace method entails breaking the clay into small pieces that are dried in the sun for a few days .
After the pieces are ground into a powder and mixed with rice husk or sawdust , the mixture is molded into a pot with a press and placed in a kiln for eight hours .
During the firing process , combustible particles from the rice husk and sawdust burn off , leaving tiny pores small enough to keep out bacteria and parasites but large enough to allow one to 2.5 liters of water to flow through per hour .
The filter design and production process are constantly being evaluated to improve performance and durability .
While helping with the construction , Reed Miller , a graduate student in CEE , tested how different amounts of rice husk and sawdust , as well as differently shaped pots , affected the bacterial removal and flow rates of the filters .
Although his research is ongoing , Miller said his trip to Ghana was a great way to apply engineering principles he had learned in the classroom to real - world problems .
“ It was quite rewarding to create a finished product literally from the ground up , ” he said .
Murcott and two students will return to Ghana in late May to finish construction of the factory with local Pure Home Water partners before the rainy season begins in June , and full factory production is scheduled to begin later this summer .
But even that is just the tip of the iceberg for Murcott , who estimates that there are only 25 similar factories operating in 18 countries .
“ My dream is that there should be factories like this in all of UNICEF ’s so - called ‘ priority countries , ’ of which there are 60 , ” she said .
“ That would be a good start . ”
Sadly enough , there were plenty of reasons to worry even before the spill .
As an investigation in The Times made clear , the device the industry called its last line of defense  the blowout preventer  had failed before , and had never been rigorously tested in deep , cold water .
The report from the presidential commission may not be ready until the end of the year .
But William K. Reilly , one of the two chairmen of the commission , said this week that he would not recommend lifting the moratorium until he was satisfied that the industry had agreed to adopt safer drilling techniques and that the administration had reformed and strengthened the federal agencies charged with policing offshore drilling .
On Wednesday , the Interior Department established a new investigative unit to examine conflicts of interest within the oil industry ’s chief regulator , the Minerals Management Service ( recently renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy ) .
The service has been too chummy with industry , and its lax regulation may have contributed to the Deepwater Horizon spill .
The Times investigation added chilling new details on its failure to do its job .
Agency officials ignored their own studies about the perils of deep - water drilling , and in some cases their own rules , by giving BP drilling permits without insisting on proof that its backup systems would work at 5,000 - foot depths .
The pressure to resume deep - water drilling is not going away , even if Judge Feldman ’s ruling is overturned on appeal .
It must be resisted .
BP ’s $ 20 billion escrow fund  plus a special $ 100 million account designed specifically to help oil workers  should relieve some of the region ’s economic stress .
But if there is one lesson above all from this disaster , it is that business cannot continue as usual .
The economic interests of the oil industry cannot be allowed to trump the long - term health of the gulf and the jobs and the lives that depend on it .
College students who want to boost their grades can start by boosting their level of exercise , new research suggests .
A report presented on Thursday at the American College of Sports Medicine ’s 57th annual meeting in Baltimore finds that college students who regularly engage in vigorous exercise get better grades .
Although a link between physical activity and higher academic achievement has been shown in middle - school students , it has n’t been clear whether exercise is associated with better grades among older students .
To find out , researchers at Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan tracked the grades and exercise habits of 266 undergraduates .
They found that students who regularly participated in vigorous physical activity had higher G.P.A.’s .
But does exercise really boost grades — or are high academic achievers simply more likely to be higher achievers in physical activity as well ?
To answer the question , the researchers controlled for a number of factors that might influence grade point average , like gender , study time and participation in college sports .
They even controlled for area of study , noting that a kinesiology major , for instance , might be more likely to exercise than a student studying another subject .
After controlling for such variables , the findings still showed that exercise made a sizable difference in a student ’s G.P.A .
On a 4.0 grade scale , students who exercised vigorously seven days a week had G.P.A. ’s that were , on average , 0.4 points higher than those who did n’t exercise .
( The full study is n’t available online , but the American College of Sports Medicine has posted a press release about the research . )
Although the researchers controlled for the amount of time a student spends studying , earlier reports showed that students who study a lot are also more likely to exercise regularly , suggesting a high academic work ethic may also translate into a higher commitment to exercising .
Notably , a study published last year in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that the more hours a student spends studying , the more likely he or she is to exercise .
Compared with students who studied less than an hour per day , students who studied three or more hours a day were nearly four times more likely to participate in vigorous exercise and about three times more likely to take part in moderate physical activity .
And students with G.P.A. ’s of 3.5 or higher were three times more likely to participate in vigorous physical activity than students with a G.P.A. under 3.0 .
Correction :
An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the university where the research was conducted ; it is Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan , not Saginaw State University .

WeAreChangeLA ’s lead organizer Bruno Bruhwiler is being targeted as a terrorist threat .
It all began when Bruno was sitting in the audience at a civil hearing for another WACLA member .
The Judge literally did not like Bruno ’s involuntary facial expressions , and ordered him out of the courtroom .
He was detained in the hall after asking to see the officers ’
ID cards before he left the building .
They are required according to their own manual to provide ID upon request , but apparently do n’t like to be asked for it .
When the supervising officer ordered Bruno to turn around and put his hands behind his back , Bruno instantly turned around and put his hands behind his back with absolutely no resistance .
At first he was supposedly being detained for trespassing ( which is a misdemeanor ) but of course , you ca n’t trespass on public property so then they dropped trespassing and told him he was being detained for a public disturbance .
About an hour later , when the supervisor actually placed Bruno under arrest , the original charge was changed to misdemeanor contempt of court .
None of the witnesses present heard the judge mention anything about contempt when asking him to leave .
Two felony resisting arrest charges were then tacked on , which means Bruno is charged with physically resisting the officers – twice ?
– though witnesses observed that Bruno did not ever resist the officers .
The arresting supervising officer claimed that Bruno threatened to assassinate him , then the same officer ordered an underling to back up his claim as a false witness and charged Bruno with making a “ terrorist ” threat .
After 911 , legislation was passed making it very easy to charge ordinary citizens as “ terrorists ” for almost any reason .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
They are calling him a potential cop killer .
We are talking about Bruno , a man who raises money for 9/11 First Responders and the Fealgood Foundation .
He ’s also a member of So Cal Oath Keepers and the initiator of “ Talk to a cop Wednesdays , ” an outreach effort to befriend and educate law enforcement throughout Los Angeles .
We are talking about a man committed to non-violent change , peace and social justice .
Yes THAT Bruno .
While in custody , at another location for incarceration , Bruno was asked by an officer if he was the lead organizer of WeAreChangeLA , and the officer asked with a snide tone if Bruno had a website , with other officers looking on .
Either they did some quick research on him or they recognized Bruno from some other way , but they knew he was the lead organizer of WeAreChangeLA .
The mention of WeAreChangeLA made it abundantly clear that Bruno is being targeted for who he is .
This is about all of us .
This is about freedom .
The struggle for Bruno ’s freedom is a microcosm of what is happening all across the United States .
We cannot allow WeAreChange leaders to be labeled and targeted as terrorists .
It can easily be ascertained that Bruno is being railroaded through procedures .
Friends of Bruno and the WeAreChange family are literally spending their life savings fighting in Bruno ’s defense .
We know this is a total inconvenience for all of us , but Bruno and WeAreChangeLA are out there in the streets in a big way every chance they can to help make people aware of all the lies and injustices that are being used to steal our rights , our freedoms , and our future , including the biggest lie of them all , the official story of 9 - 11 .
We do n’t intend to ever stop reaching out , so please help us defend liberty and freedom by donating ANY amount you can spare .
It ’s easy , just go to wacla.org and click “ CHIP - IN ” at the top of the page .
Our site has also recently been hacked multiple times but the “ CHIP - IN ” is still functional .

Every day of your life you are aware of energy .
Energy is in those moments when you think of someone and feel a warm glow , or you walk into a room and feel bad vibes , or how color can create stress , or a piece of music can make you cry or want to dance .
The truth is that we are all made up of cosmic energy .
Everything you see , smell , taste , and touch is made up of energy .
The chair you are sitting in , the magazine you are holding , your thoughts and feelings ; these items are all pure energy .
Even where there appears to be nothing , like empty space , there is energy .
Everything in the universe and beyond is made up of chi—energy , the universal force .
Luckily we can access this knowledge and use cosmic energy in all areas of our lives .
I have been working with future life progression for many years .
This is a technique whereby I go into a trance and move forward in time to view the future .
It is the flip side of regression .
I take my clients forward for them to see where they will be and what they will be doing in years to come , even in their next lifetime .
I began to wonder what our future selves knew that would be useful for us to know .
Mankind faces many challenges and we as individuals need guidance with our own lives .
For two years I took trips into the future to find out what we know in the next century .
Time and time again the same answer came back : our future selves are more aware of cosmic energy .
They know how to utilize energy in many different ways .
They are aware of the subtle nature of energy and the difference a small change can make .
For twenty years I have also worked with past life regression ; I am constantly amazed at how aware our ancient selves were .
They understood energy , they flowed with the seasons .
They knew how to use energy to their benefit .
It came naturally to them .
During this time I discovered techniques and ideas , then came back and tried them out in my workshops .
In short , they worked .
Our current , so - called civilized selves have forgotten how to use this energy .
We think that we are clever using our mobile phones and emails , yet our past and future selves often used telepathy .
We have made great medical advances , but we once knew how to use our own energy to heal ourselves .
We work hard , but once knew how to attract everything we needed .
We have forgotten so much .
Once you understand that cosmic energy really exists , that it ’s all around you , and impacts your every day life , you can connect with its flow easily and naturally .
When you know how to connect with this cosmic energy you can work with it to bring into your life whatever you need , be it love money or good health .
Once you accept the notion of cosmic energy anything is possible .
It becomes natural to send telepathic messages and to travel astrally .
It becomes easy to feel in advance if a place or person is good for you .
You become aware of yourself as a soul , a being of energy that has existed in some form or other throughout time .
You become aware of your own unique purpose your reason for being .
As a being of energy it becomes natural that you can move through time and space ; you understand your connection to everything and everyone .
This is where the fun begins .
You become aware of all the love and abundance in the world , making it easier to flow to you .
You can raise your love vibration attracting wonderful people into your life including your soul mate .
You can shine at interviews or parties .
When your cosmic energy is flowing , you get the job , people are drawn to you , and life becomes easier .
The problem is that many people are vibrating at a low frequency .
Each and every day we are bombarded with negativity from the news and the people around us .
Our past experiences and ancestral history can also produce a poor flow of energy .
Let me give you an example .
Imagine having a relationship , and after six months it ends unexpectedly and abruptly .
At that time , your personal cosmic energy will drop and you will be vibrating on a lower frequency as you feel sadness , hurt , and rejection .
Now , because your vibration is quite low , what will you attract ?
Other people vibrating at a lower frequency .
And so as you meet a new partner or friend you are dismayed when they do not treat you well , and your vibration drops even further .
You begin the downward spiral .
This is when we hit a bad patch and wonder , " Why does this always happen to me ? "
The same can happen with work ; once we have had a bad experience such as a back - stabbing colleague or a bullying boss , our energy will drop .
Guess what ?
We will continue to attract more of the same .
Luckily , my jaunts into the future taught me many techniques to raise our vibration , which not only allows us to attract great things into our lives butt also make us feel great .
Our future selves are more aware of what is good for them ; they feel the subtle vibrations .
They use telepathy and astral travel to connect with others .
They use a combination of color , sound , and smell to produce a powerful synergistic effect and , with millions of different combinations , they can produce virtually any effect they wish .
During my visits I discovered how they use their own etheric energy to tap into people and discover just what they are thinking and feeling .
They can even leave a little of their etheric energy behind them ; this is useful in many situations ( at , say , an interview when you want to leave a lasting impression ) .
From this I developed my own Etheric Energy Technique .
In this busy world it is easy to lose track of what is important and to lose our connection with cosmic energy .
We get waylaid with gadgets and toys and television shows , yet the real magic is all around us every moment of every day .
And this energy is just waiting for you to tap into it , to improve all areas of your life .
You are a wonderful , powerful being of energy and you are meant to be connected to the universal cosmic force ; the more you connect the better life will become .
I believe the energy crisis on earth is actually a symbol of the energy crisis people have within themselves .
But as we become aware of our own energy the situation will resolve .
As we begin to create a wonderful energy within and around ourselves and others , the earth will receive our vibration and this will help the world to become a better place .

There ’s yet more evidence of odd behavior from Afghan President Hamid Karzai :
KABUL , Afghanistan —
Two senior Afghan officials were showing President Hamid Karzai the evidence of the spectacular rocket attack on a nationwide peace conference earlier this month when Mr. Karzai told them that he believed the Taliban were not responsible .
“ The president did not show any interest in the evidence — none — he treated it like a piece of dirt , ” said Amrullah Saleh , then the director of the Afghan intelligence service .
Mr. Saleh declined to discuss Mr. Karzai ’s reasoning in more detail .
But a prominent Afghan with knowledge of the meeting , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that Mr. Karzai suggested in the meeting that it might have been the Americans who carried it out .
Minutes after the exchange , Mr. Saleh and the interior minister , Hanif Atmar , resigned — the most dramatic defection from Mr. Karzai ’s government since he came to power nine years ago .
Mr. Saleh and Mr. Atmar said they quit because Mr. Karzai made clear that he no longer considered them loyal .
But underlying the tensions , according to Mr. Saleh and Afghan and Western officials , was something more profound : That Mr. Karzai had lost faith in the Americans and NATO to prevail in Afghanistan .
For that reason , Mr. Saleh and other officials said , Mr. Karzai has been pressing to strike his own deal with the Taliban and the country ’s archrival , Pakistan , the Taliban ’s longtime supporter .
According to a former senior Afghan official , Mr. Karzai ’s maneuverings involve secret negotiations with the Taliban outside the purview of American and NATO officials .
“ The president has lost his confidence in the capability of either the coalition or his own government to protect this country , ” Mr. Saleh said in an interview at his home .
“ President Karzai has never announced that NATO will lose , but the way that he does not proudly own the campaign shows that he does n’t trust it is working . ”
People close to the president say he began to lose confidence in the Americans last summer , after national elections in which independent monitors determined that nearly one million ballots had been stolen on Mr. Karzai ’s behalf .
The rift worsened in December , when President Obama announced that he intended to begin reducing the number of American troops by the summer of 2011 .
“ Karzai told me that he ca n’t trust the Americans to fix the situation here , ” said a Western diplomat in Kabul , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ He believes they stole his legitimacy during the elections last year .
And then they said publicly that they were going to leave . ”

A whole series of alarms occurred after I got the news , although I lost the source , that food stamp usage just soared to a new record high of 40.2 million persons .
This number is alarming in itself because it means that the economy is so bad that more and more hungry people cannot afford to even feed themselves , sort of like teenagers , but with hopefully better manners and dietary choices .
And also alarming that the number of people needing government assistance to buy food soared ,  which is probably a verb of some kind , which indicates action , which is a signal to me , a real Mogambo Action Hero ( MAH ) kind of guy , to spring into action with my awesome superhuman power to instantly perceive trends in even random data .
Ergo , it made me shriek alarmingly  We ’re freaking doomed !  which alarmed the other diners in the restaurant .

In terms of households ,  18.5 million households receive benefits  which means little to me other than the fact that these needy people live in households of about two , which ai n’t bad , considering .
This low - density housing situation is good news , in that it means that these people have a lot of room for much more suffering , which will surely happen when consumer prices zoom as a result of all of this insane creation of more and more money by the Federal Reserve so that the federal government can borrow and spend it .
Now , people know that I always take the alarmist , doomsday position because I am naturally paranoid and suspicious , and I have learned that I should never trust any creatures on this planet , especially seeing that half of America ’s population are Democrats , and as such , they are so demonstrably clueless as to actually declare that it is always the purpose of elected officials to use government money to help more and more people !
Even taxing half of all income , and running deficits of trillions of dollars when even that proves insufficient to do it !
Wow !
Perhaps I am so dyspeptic about such displays of raw stupidity because I had just found out that the Federal Reserve created another huge $ 8.5 billion of new Fed Credit last week , and simultaneously bought up $ 7.2 billion in US government securities , which had the effect of removing a nominal $ 7.2 billion in crappy assets ( actual worth ; pennies on the dollar ) out of the economy , thus bailing out some halfwit scumbags who owned the toxic assets and would otherwise go bust , and replaced it with cash , recapitalizing the idiots !
In One Freaking Week ( OFW ) !
Nobody can really know how much new money will be made out of this new Fed credit , but I notice that the M2 money supply , which causes inflation in price when it grows , as famously summarized as inflation in prices is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon ,  instantly jumped $ 80 billion from the previous monthly report , the Treasury Gross Public Debt jumped by $ 27 billion in the same week , a towering mountain of government - borrowed debt which is up an outrageous $ 1.5 trillion in the last year , and indebting us by a staggering $ 13.07 trillion !
Yikes !

Perhaps to give you a clue as to why I am so insane with fear that I babble incoherently , and why I am trying to drink myself into blissful inebriation but spilling most of it down my chin and into my lap because my hands are shaking so much and I mindlessly try to babble while I am drinking , for some weird reason that even I do n’t understand , all of which increases my anger and babbling , this horrifying criminally - insane inflation in the money supply by the Federal Reserve buying up assets with newly - created money has already resulted in an increase of $ 888 billion in the last year alone !
In One Freaking Year ( OFY ) !
In desperation , I turned for solace and sobering words to Lew Rockwell of the Mises Institute , thinking that his wisdom would calm me down and show me what I had misunderstood and why people think I am a raving idiot .
Instead , I saw that he wrote about the same thing !
He writes ,  Fiat paper money is destroying civilization right now .
It has fueled the predator state .
It has destabilized markets .
It has wrecked balance sheets and distorted financial markets .
It has wrecked the culture by leading the whole world to believe that prosperity can come as if by magic , that stones can be turned into bread . 

He notes that , in referring to what is popularly referred to as the  Austrian theory of economics ,  and that The Austrians were right ’ is a phrase we hear often now , and for good reason . 
As for the good reason ,  I say that you can save a lot of time by not reading any further , but just get up , go over to the window and look out at the results of a half century of the absurd neo-Keynesian econometric claptrap that the academic economists and fellow idiot - savants have foisted upon us .
We are , as a result , ruined as a result of their abject stupidity , and now the jobs are gone , the purchasing power of the money is gone , the middle class is almost all gone , and all we have left is bankrupted people , bankrupted governments , bankrupted banks , and bankrupting companies , all because of the despicable Federal Reserve creating too much money and credit , aided and abetted by their loathsome and willing comrades - in - arms , namely the Democrats in the mainstream media and the Democratically - controlled schools , a crime of such monumental stupidity , and of such devastating consequences , that they should all go to prison and stay there until science develops some intelligence - enhancing therapy so that they would not be so stupid and could be trusted to vote intelligently from then on .

Well , Mr. Rockwell is apparently not ready to be dragged into some Hysterical Mogambo Rant ( HMR ) , and instead of saying something like ,  Bravo , Mogambo !  or  That ’s just what I was thinking , too , Marvelous Mogambo Genius ( MMG ) !
he sticks to the main fact , which is that issues concerning fiat money and the business cycle stand out because the Austrians possess unique insight .
Only the Austrians have consistently warned that fiat money creates the wrong incentives for the banking industry , that central - bank manipulation of interest rates distorts the structure of production , that the combination of paper money and central banking leads to economic calamity . 

Exactly !
And when that first budget - deficit dollar was , for the first time , financed by the Federal Reserve first creating the credit in the banks , so that the banks could , for the first time , use it to loan out and thus create the first fiat money to pay for , for the first time , that first food stamp , that was issued to that first needy person , it caused the whole structure of production to be forever distorted , giving producers the idea that their increasing sales of dietary staples and yummy snack foods were coming from real demand , when in fact it was just fiat money !
Judging by the sudden rash of emails , everybody prefers Mr. Rockwell ’s explanation better than mine .
Since I seem to be outclassed at every turn , I take a different tack and wonder how many of the non-taxpayer - paid workers in the private economy ( and thus the only ones who can generate a profit from their labors with which to pay the taxes with which to support the welfare state that the American system of governments has become ) , a population of workers currently numbering less than 100 million , can continue to support the food expense of 40 million people or , up close and personal , 5 people paying to feed 2 people .
And since this is just a small part of the pandemic governmental bankruptcies that the neo-Keynesian econometric insanity has caused , as the intractable problems of Medicare and Social Security dwarf those of the food stamp program , it is indeed unfortunate that there is — and you can trust me on this one by merely looking deep into my Bloodshot Mogambo Eyes ( BME ) to see my total sincerity — no way out of this governmental bankruptcy mess , just like there has never , ever been a way of out of governmental bankruptcy in the last 4,500 years , despite innumerable attempts of innumerable idiotic governments trying to do so , desperately trying everything that they can think of , including murdering those considered non - compliant ,  yet consistently failing miserably .
And what were the winners of the last 4,500 years ?

The Best of Richard Daughty
In 1970 , the Russians started drilling Kola SG - 3 , an exploration well which finally reached a staggering world record depth of 40,230 feet .
Since then , Russian oil majors including Yukos have quietly drilled more than 310 successful super - deep oil wells , and put them into production .
Last Year Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the world 's biggest single oil producer , and is now set to completely dominate global oil production and sales for the next century .
If the opening paragraph of this report started by claiming that completely unlimited crude oil reserves exist inside planet earth , readers might be tempted to regard the entire text as preposterous ghostwriting for a novelist like Frederick Forsyth .
If the report then went on to claim that the Russians have exploited this stunning reality for nearly thirty years , right under the largely unwitting noses of western intelligence , readers could be excused for mistaking the author for a lunatic , or perhaps as a front for spy novelist John le Carré .
The problem here is that unlimited oil reserves do exist inside planet earth , and the Russians long ago developed the advanced technology necessary to recover these unlimited oil reserves in an efficient and timely manner .
Profoundly disturbing hard intelligence like this does not sit well with the frantic cries of western academic shills and lobbyists , determined to convince you all that the end of the oil world is nigh , or , more accurately , that America faces an imminent catastrophe when global production capacity " Peaks " , i.e. when world demand for crude oil finally exceeds the rate at which we can physically pump the required product out of the ground .
The gist of these false claims are outlined in a speech given at the at the University of Clausthal , by lobbyist Doctor Colin Campbell during December 2000 : " In summary , these are the main points that we have to grasp : Conventional [ Free flowing ] oil provides most of the oil produced today , and is responsible for about 95 % of all oil that has been produced so far .
It will continue to dominate supply for a long time to come .
It is what matters most .
Its discovery peaked in the 1960s .
We now find one barrel for every four we consume .
Middle East share of production is set to rise .
The rest of the world peaked in 1997 , and is therefore in terminal decline .
World peak comes within about five years " [ circa 12/2005 ]
Campbell is just the tip of a giant iceberg of academic Peak Oil ' experts ' who suddenly appeared en-masse to give you this frightening news , right after President Saddam Hussein suddenly started trading his oil in Euros rather than in US Dollars , a devastating switch with the easy capacity to destroy the US Dollar in less than five years if it was left unchallenged and unchecked .
So these shills [ decoys ] were carefully positioned to deflect your attention away from the obvious greed and incompetence of the United States Government and its Wall Street masters , and focus it elsewhere instead .
Then , hopefully , a few years later down the track when prices start to bounce through the roof , and America has no Euros to buy crude oil , you will blame gasoline prices of $ 5.00 + per gallon at the pumps on an ' inevitable decline ' in world oil production , rather than march furiously on Washington DC with locked and loaded firearms .
Though attacking Campbell and his ilk is not the purpose of this report , his idiot claims can be debunked readily enough .
While it is true that nowadays we only officially find one barrel of oil for every four barrels we consume , this is primarily because we temporarily stopped the incredibly expensive process of looking for crude oil when we had already physically established more than two trillion barrels of reserves in known reservoir locations around the world .
When those known reserves drop to [ say ] one trillion barrels we may be tempted to go and find more , but not until then .
And while it is true that the production rate from each individual oil well ever drilled has slowly declined over the years , there is a perfectly valid technical reason for this predictable reduced flow rate , which will be explained later .
In order to understand how Russia has left the rest of the world standing in its wake , it is essential to know a little bit about where oil is located , and how it is extracted from the ground for refining and commercial use .
It is an enormously complex subject , especially when considering the ultra - deep wells , which should really have a separate category all of their own .
Many years ago I was personally involved at the sharp end of two ultra - deep drilling operations [ one of them in direct liaison with Russian experts from the Moscow Drilling Institute ] , and will try to keep this drilling lesson as simple as I can .
Thankfully perhaps , the underlying principle of how and where oil is recovered from is not difficult to comprehend , as illustrated by the diagram below .
The theory underlying how oil is formed at such enormous depths in the mantle of the earth is not central to this report , because the Russians have already proved its point of origin in absolute drilling terms more than 300 times .
Those interested in the exact process should research the archives , where there are more than two hundred Russian papers on the subject .
Probably a good place to start would be " The Role of Methane in the Formation of Mineral Fuels " , written by by A.D. Bondar in 1967 .
What is central to this report is the massive advantage that Russia 's ultra - deep drilling discoveries and technical achievements give it over the western nations .
The first advantage I intend to explain is nowhere near as important in global terms as the second , because it is the second advantage that finally drove the Zionist Cabal to illegally invade sovereign Iraq , and thereby bring us all to the very brink of thermonuclear war .
However , from where I sit , the first advantage is much more important in simple humanitarian terms , although " humanitarian " is not an acceptable trading process on Wall Street .
As we have already discovered , oil can be produced virtually anywhere on earth , provided the host country can afford the expensive [ and sometimes classified ] technology , and the massive cost of drilling a well to extreme depth through extremely hard rock formations .
But just think what even 20 or 30 deep producing oil wells can mean for the people of a country that has no natural resources of its own , or worse still , for people who have been told by glib western lobbyists that they have no natural resources of their own .
Anyone who can prove that the western nations were lying or simply wrong , will become a trusted friend forever .
Vietnam is a classic example .
After more than 60 years of being enslaved , pillaged , and raped by the French and then by the Americans , the poor Vietnamese were told officially by American oil multinationals that their country was barren ; that western ' cutting edge ' technology had failed to find anything to help them recover financially from the mess left behind by American bombs , Agent Orange , and a host of other delightful gifts from Uncle Sam .
This of course was exactly where America wanted the Vietnamese to be : desperately poor and unable to take action against their former invaders .
The Russians had other ideas and a very different approach .
After telling the Vietnamese that the Americans had lied to them , oil experts were flown in from Moscow to prove this startling claim in a no-risk joint venture , meaning the Russians would provide all of the equipment and expertise free of charge , and only then take a percentage of the profits if oil was actually found and put into production .
Vietnam had absolutely nothing to lose , and swiftly gave Russia the green light .
The Vietnamese White Tiger oil field was and is a raging success , currently producing high quality crude oil from basalt rock more than 17,000 feet below the surface of the earth , at 6,000 barrels per day per well .
Through White Tiger , the Russians have assisted the Vietnamese to regain part of their self respect , while at the same time making them far less dependent on brutal western nations for food - aid handouts .
All of a sudden in a very small way , Vietnam has joined the exclusive club of oil producing nations , and a stream of cynical U.S. Senators and Congressmen have started making the long pilgrimage to Ho Chi Minh City in order to ' mend fences ' .
Predictably perhaps , the Vietnamese are very cool , and try hard to ignore their new American admirers .
Welcome to the White Tiger oil field in Vietnam .
Observe the truly amazing oil flares , in an area the Americans officially declared ' barren ' of oil reserves !
It is truly amazing how quickly good news travels [ outside of CNN ] , and in a very short space of time China was also engaged in a joint super deep venture with Russia .
Nor did it end there .
As I write this report , intelligence reports that the Russians have already moved three deep - drilling rigs into impoverished North Korea , where they intend to repeat the Vietnamese production cycle by drilling thought solid granite and basalt , with not a single trace of the ' decaying marine life ' so essential to blinkered western geologists for the ' accepted ' production of crude oil .
It may take a while , but ultimately the North Koreans will be able to go about their sovereign business without the Zionist Cabal in New York being able to blackmail them over a few ship loads of food - aid rice .
Yes indeed , Korea will eventually have an oil surplus of its own , allowing it to tell the latest in a long line of terminally insane " New World Orders " to go to hell .
The White Tiger project was the first outside Russia to openly exploit and showcase this ultra - deep technology and oil production from basalt rock to the world , though the original intent was to do so much earlier in India during 1983 .
During that year a large drilling rig in the Ganges Delta was scheduled to drill down to below 22,000 feet into basalt , and then dramatically flare " impossible " ultra deep oil .
Oil well Bodra # 3 was directly supervised by teams of experienced Russian drillers and scientists from the Moscow Institute of Drilling , with the author the only westerner on site , contracted to control one of the critical advanced systems needed to reach target depth smoothly and efficiently .
If Bodra # 3 had been allowed to drill ahead unhindered , there is no doubt the resulting impact would have sent shock waves around the oil world , and gained enormous international prestige for the Russians .
Even more importantly perhaps , the desperately poor people of West Bengal would have gained access to their own energy reserves .
Unfortunately , Bodra # 3 was not allowed to drill ahead unhindered .
The Americans were determined to stop the project one way or the other , and played on New Delhi 's obvious fear of the Communist State Government in West Bengal .
After bribing a handful of corrupt central government officials , US intelligence sent in professional American saboteurs , who managed to wreck the drilling project while the author was away on a visit to Sydney in Australia .
Before we continue to the second massive advantage derived from ultra deep oil , and thus the primary reason why Wall Street decided to illegally invade Iraq , it is essential to look briefly at the way in which America devours a massive portion of global oil supply .
You see , the ' Peak Oil ' scam is not really about the world running out of oil reserves or being incapable of producing sufficient quantities to provide for its various national users .
Instead , Peak Oil was fabricated to disguise America 's individual increasing greed for crude oil , and its imminent inability to pay hard cash for the product .
Put simply , America is going broke fast , and Wall Street wishes to blame someone else before the angry Militias appear with their locked and loaded weapons .
This sorry situation is best summarized by Professor Victor Poleo of Venezuela 's Central University , who told IPS in April that , " The mechanism by which global oil prices are set is intact , but the normal behaviour of supply and demand is not . "
According to Poleo , the root of the problem is that the United States ''is a terminal victim of its energetic metastasis .
It has neither the oil nor the natural gas needed to feed its style of development .
With just six percent of the world population , it consumes nearly 25 percent of the oil and gas produced worldwide . ''
Professor Poleo went on to explain that there were expectations that demand for gasoline in the United States would stabilize at around 7.2 million barrels a day by the mid-1990s , '' but that did n't happen , '' he said .
'' The United States ' voracity for gasoline rose to nine million barrels by 2003 , one of every two liters burnt in the world . ''
And domestic demand for crude oil will continue to grow .
The United States imports today six of every 10 barrels of oil and two of every 10 cubic meters of gas that it consumes , and by 2020 it will import eight of every 10 barrels of oil and four of every 10 cubic meters of gas , according to U.S. government reports .
Despite the fact that American intelligence already knew of Russia 's achievements with ultra deep oil production from the mantle of the earth back in the early eighties , it was obvious that this slow and expensive method of adding to national oil reserves could never keep up with America 's voracious appetite for gasoline .
So ultimately when domestic demand grew too fast , or cash reserves were finally depleted , America would either be obliged to halve its own use of gasoline , or steal it from someone else by force .
Halving gasoline usage was out of the question , so instead of building hundreds of ultra - deep drilling rigs , Wall Street squandered the cash building more aircraft carriers , with the desperate objective of attacking and permanently occupying the Middle East .
This is the point at which the second massive advantage derived from ultra - deep oil comes into play .
Do you remember how puzzled the reservoir engineers were when they discovered that their existing reserves were being " topped up " from below ?
They later discovered that what they were really observing were naturally occurring ultra - deep oil wells , leaking vast quantities of oil from the mantle of the earth upwards through fractures into what we nowadays refer to as " sedimentary oilfields " , located relatively close to the surface .
As the production companies draw oil out of these known reservoirs through oil wells , field pressure is slightly reduced , thereby allowing more ultra - deep oil to migrate up from the mantle and restock the reservoir from below .
Russian studies of their own ultra - deep wells and those in the White Tiger field in Vietnam , indicate in very rough terms that migration from the mantle is probably 20 - 30 % less than production at Middle East wellheads , meaning in turn that if the flow rates of existing Iraqi and Saudi wells are reduced by about 30 % , oil supply and production can and will continue forever , constantly replenished by ultra - deep oil from the mantle itself .
It goes almost without saying that even with production reduced by 30 % , there is more than enough oil in the Middle East to provide for America 's increasing usage for at least the next century .
And that , ladies and gentlemen , is why your sons and daughters have died and will continue to die in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East .
In direct conflict with the ' Peak Oil ' myth , the under - reamer shown in these photos can restore an oil well 's original production rate , using basically the same principle as changing the oil filter in your automobile engine
Now we come to the completely false [ or deliberately misleading ] claim by Peak Oil shills that production from existing oil wells is " slowing down " , thereby proving that the oil fields are " running dry " .
This is so wrong that it is almost breathtaking .
Think of this slowing down process in the same way you might think of the engine oil in your automobile .
The longer you run the engine , the higher the level of contaminates that get into the oil .
The higher the level of contaminates , the higher the level of friction .
Sooner or later you have something closely akin to glue coating your piston rings , and the performance of your engine declines accordingly .
This is an inevitable mechanical process well known to all automobile owners .
Henry Ford and others managed to slow down the rate of contamination in engine oils by inventing the oil filter , through which the oil has to circulate each time it passes around inside the engine .
A high percentage of the contaminates stick to the filter element , thereby allowing extra miles between oil changes , though heaven help the careless motorist who thinks he can get away without ever changing his clogged oil filter when recommended .
When oil is extracted from a producing formation underground , it flows out through pores in the reservoir rock , and then into the open borehole , from where it is transported to surface by the production tubing string .
So by the very nature of the beast , the bottom section of the well is " open hole " which allows the oil to flow out in the first place , but because it is comprised of exposed and sometimes unstable rock , this open hole section is also continually subject to all manner of turbulence and various contaminates .
For example , tiny quantities of super fine silt may exit through the pores but not continue to the surface with the oil , tumbling around in the turbulence instead , until the silt very slowly starts to block off the oil - producing pore throats .
Yes , of course there are a variety of liners that can be used to slow down the contamination , but there is no such thing as a Henry Ford oil filter 10,000 feet underground .
The inevitable result of this is that over time , the initial production rate of the well will slowly decline , a hard fact known to every exploration oilman in the business .
However , this is certainly not an indication that the oil field itself is becoming depleted , proved thousands of times by offset wells drilled later into the same reservoir .
Any new well comes on stream at the original production rate of its older cousins , because it has not yet had time to build up a thin layer of contaminates across the open hole .
Though as we shall see it is possible to " do an oil change " on a producing well and bring it back to full production , this is extremely expensive , and rarely used in the west .
Look at a simple example :
Say we have a small oil field in Iraq with ten wells that each started out in life producing 10,000 barrels of oil per day .
Fine , for a known investment we are producing 100,000 barrels of oil per day from our small field , at least for a while .
Five years later contamination may have slowed our overall production down by ten percent to 90,000 barrels per day .
So we are now faced with a choice : either " do an oil change " on all ten existing wells at vast expense and down time , or simply drill one additional well into the same reservoir , thereby restoring our daily production to 100,000 barrels with the minimum of fuss .
Take my word for it , ninety - nine percent of onshore producers will simply drill the extra well .
Naturally , there are times and places where this simple process is not an option , for example on a huge and very expensive offshore platform , which may have only 24 drilling ' slots ' , all of which have been used up .
To restore your overall production after five years you can either build another giant platform next door for two billion dollars , or " do an oil change " on each of your existing 24 wells , one at a time .
Clearly this time you are forced to carry out the time consuming business of restoring the open hole section at the bottom of the well to its old pristine condition , before various contaminates started to slow down your production rate .
For this task you first pull the production tubing out of the hole , and then run back in with a drill string , to which is attached an underreamer as shown in the pictures above .
When the reamer is directly opposite the top of the open hole producing section , the drill string is rotated to the right and the blades fly out under centrifugal force to a distance preset by you before lowering the tool into the hole .
The objective is to cut away the contaminated face of the well to a depth you consider will once again expose pristine producing pores .
As the spinning underreamer is slowly lowered , it enlarges the size of the hole , with the contaminated debris cut away and flushed back to surface by the drilling fluid .
Hey presto , you have a new oil well , and it only cost one or two million dollars to restore Remember , I said this process is rarely used in the west , which is true , but it is not true of Russia , where the objective for many years has been to dominate global oil supply by continual investment .
With no shareholders holding out their grubby little hands for a wad of pocket money every month , the Russian oil industry managed to surge ahead , underreaming thousands of its older existing onshore wells in less than ten years .
Then along came Wall Street asset Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who fraudulently got his hands on Yukos oil for a mere fraction of its value , and was on the point of selling the entire outfit to the American multinationals when Vladimir Putin had him hauled off his private jet somewhere in Siberia .
So Wall Street was finally ' cheated ' of its very own ' free ' Russian oil , and poor old Mikhail had better get used to the taste of prison food .
To recap , ' Peak Oil ' claims that because today we only find one barrel of oil for every four that we use , world oil reserves are running out .
Completely misleading propaganda . as the Russians [ and the CIA ] know perfectly well , reserves of oil in the mantle of the earth are infinite .
' Peak Oil ' also claims that we will shortly be unable to pump sufficient oil out of the ground to keep up with demand .
Completely misleading propaganda again .
We could drill more wells , but Wall Street cannot afford to pay for them , and never intended to , at least not while it still believed conquest and eternal occupation of the Middle East was a realistic possibility .
Professor Poleo makes it quite clear which direction the west needs to go in if it is to survive in the long term , and that is to follow Russia 's example by sharply reducing domestic consumption .
Back in 1990 America was using around 6 million barrels per day compared to Russia 's 8.4 million , but how things have changed since then .
Thirteen years later in 2003 , American consumption was up to 9 million , while Russian consumption had been reduced to a mere 3.2 million .
A few billion folk over there in America might like to walk around their houses and switch off any electrical appliances they do n't actually need .
Believe me , I can almost hear the oil surging through the pipelines in New York , and I live more than 12,000 miles away in Australia .
In closing , I would like to pass on my greetings and thanks to the cheerful Russian drillers and scientists I had the pleasure of working with at Bodra # 3 in West Bengal , without whose expertise we might all be dead today , as a direct consequence of repeated American sabotage attempts on the high pressure well .
My thanks also to the Moscow Drilling Institute for the unrestricted flow of information and documents on ultra deep oil production technology , without which I could not have written this report .

Exclusive Google 's Chrome OS — the operating system that moves all apps and data into a web browser — will provide remote access to " legacy PC applications " through a mystery process the company calls Chromoting , according to an email from a Google employee .
In a message posted by a third party to a public mailing list dedicated to the as - yet - unreleased Chrome OS , Google software engineer Gary Kačmarčík confirms the existence of Chromoting but gives few details .
" We 're adding new capabilities all the time , " the email reads .
" With this functionality ( unofficially named ' chromoting ' ) , Chrome OS will not only be [ a ] great platform for running modern web apps , but will also enable you to access legacy PC applications right within the browser . "
Kačmarčík calls this an " official " statement .
Neither Google nor Gary Kačmarčík has responded to requests for comment .
According to his LinkedIn profile , Kačmarčík is a former Microsoft software design engineer .
He 's been at Google since 2006 , and he works in the greater Seattle , Washington area , near Microsoft headquarters .
In the email , Kačmarčík says that Chromoting is " something like " Remote Desktop Connection , the Microsoft Windows service that gives you real - time access to distant PCs .
Presumably , this means that Chrome OS will let you access applications running on your existing Windows , Linux , or Mac desktop .
But in his email , Kačmarčík declined to elaborate .
Chrome OS is essentially Google 's Chrome web browser running atop a Goobuntu flavor of Linux .
It will not run local applications other than the browser itself .
All other apps will be accessed inside the browser , and this would now seem to include applications running on remote machines .
The OS is not due for official release until the end of the year , when it will debut on netbooks .
Last fall , however , Google released a snapshot of code under the aegis of the Chromium OS project , and Kačmarčík 's email was posted to the Chromium discussion list by a non-Google developer .
Chromium OS source code includes references to a " chromoting plug - in , " and Kačmarčík mentions chromoting code during recent Chromimum IRC discussions .
Accessing remote applications via a web browser is nothing new .
Applications like LogMeIn and GoToMyPC have offered this sort of thing for a decade .
With these services , you install a small client on your desktop PC or Mac , and once you do , you can drive that machine 's operating system — including applications — from a web browser running on a separate system .
In order to access your remote desktop , you must also download a small client alongside your browser .
But this is a tiny piece of code .
Typically , it can be downloaded in a matter of seconds .
Presumably , Google will include this sort of mini-client with Chrome OS as a plug - in , and you 'll then download a larger client on your existing desktop PC in order to access its applications .
Yes , this is a roundabout way of running desktop apps .
But with Chrome OS , Google is intent on keeping everything inside the browser .
According to Google , this is partly an effort to improve system security , but the company also has a financial interest in moving more activity and more data onto the net : more web activity means more web ads , and more web data stored on Google servers means more targeted ads .
Last month , the company announced that would allow printing from the OS by routing jobs through its servers and back down to desktop PCs that , unlike Chrome OS , run print drivers .
Some might call this progress .
Others might call it forcing the issue .
But we know where Google stands .
Notice that Kačmarčík dubbed them " legacy PC applications " . ®
SHANGHAI — A 19 - year - old employee was found dead Tuesday morning in what appears to have been the ninth suicide this year at a factory in southern China operated by Foxconn Technology , one of the world ’s largest contract electronics manufacturers , according to China ’s state - run news media .
Foxconn , which produces electronics and computer components for Apple , Dell , Hewlett - Packard and other global companies , has been struggling this year to explain a string of suicides among young workers at its huge complexes in the city of Shenzhen , where the company employs about 420,000 workers .
A spokesman for Foxconn , a unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry of Taiwan , could not be reached for comment Tuesday , and the Shenzhen police did not return phone calls .
But Xinhua , China ’s official news agency , said the Shenzhen police had reported that a young man they identified as Li Hai had apparently jumped to his death at 6:20 a.m. Tuesday at Foxconn .
Wang Tongxin , vice chairman of the general labor union in Shenzhen , a government - controlled organization , said the Shenzhen police had alerted his organization to the death Tuesday .

I have n’t written anything before about the Bechdel test which in a nutshell is a way of determining if women matter in a film .
The test was designed by cartoonist Alison Bechdel and it has become legendary .
Here are the criteria :
1 . It has to have at least two women in it
2 . Who talk to each other
3 . About something besides a man
If a movie passes this test , to me , and lots of other people it is a movie I would potentially want to see .
The test is not a test of greatness or even content , it ’s just a determination of how women are valued in the script .
Screenwriter John August ( Go , Titan AE , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ) came across this new video that ’s gone viral about how few films really pass the Bechdel Test and he looked at the films he has written and it gave him pause .
Here ’s what he came up with :
Looking back through my movies , I ’m struck by how rarely the female characters actually do talk to each other .
In Big Fish , it ’s only a brief moment with Sandra and Josephine .
In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , it ’s a throwaway moment between Violet and Veruca .
Titan A.E. fails the test unless you know that the alien Stith is technically female .
In each of these cases , I had to spend a few minutes just to come up with these ( admittedly slight ) examples .
And he asks :
Does acknowledging the situation change anything ?
Maybe .
I ’ll certainly ask myself these questions about future scripts .
For now , my upcoming projects all seem to pass , but they have a familiar paradigm : a single main female who mostly interacts with the men in the story .
Acknowledging there is a problem is the first step towards fixing it .

Politicians do some downright stupid things .
Sure , we all do .
But these are the people who draft our laws — the ones who decide how the rest of us should live and behave .
Maybe you consider wars you disagree with to be “ stupid ” decisions .
Perhaps it ’s the latest report of infidelity from politicians that ’s getting under your skin .
But today let ’s have some fun and look at the lighter side of government gaffs by exploring some incredibly stupid laws that may still be on the books .
Please note that I am not saying all of these dumb laws are still in effect ( or even were ) .
But they ’re examples reported for various states in the U.S. and some international laws as well .
Maybe they ’ll make more sense to you than to me .
Or perhaps you ’ll also find them good for a laugh .
1 . In Pennsylvania it ’s illegal to have more than 16 women live in the same house — doing so makes it a brothel .
I wanted to kick things off with an example of a dumb law from my own home state .
I ’m not sure if the specifics reported are right , or if it ’s still the case ( as opposed to an old law ) .
But I do remember the topic coming up periodically when I was in college .
It was a concern for sororities where groups of “ sisters ” would share a sorority house .
2 . In Sweden it ’s claimed that it ’s illegal to paint a house without a painting license from the government .
Well , if that ’s the case I ’m glad I do n’t live in Sweden .
I just painted my place this spring , and am planning to do some more paint touch - ups soon .
While this sounds like a pretty stupid law , I could maybe understand it if it ’s outdated and became law out of concerns over lead - based paint or something .
3 . It ’s reported that in San Antonio , Texas it ’s illegal to use your eyes or hands while flirting .
Why not just ban flirting altogether ?
Outdated , still on the books — I do n’t know .
But this is one where I ca n’t even begin to understand the logic if it ’s true … not even in a historical context .
You ?
4 . Do n’t send the kiddies trick - or - treating on Halloween in Virginia .
It ’s reported that doing so is illegal .
Again , I ’m not sure if this is legit or current .
But the idea does n’t really surprise me .
I know where I live Halloween trick - or - treating is very different than it was when I was a kid .
They ’ve put strict limits on the time kids can go out , and I seem to remember them deciding trick - or - treating should be a different day at some point — maybe if Halloween was on a school night .
So no , if this is true , it would n’t really surprise me .
Just for curiosity ’s sake , have you seen changes in trick - or - treating since you were a kid too ?
Or do I just live in a dud of a town ?
5 . In Singapore , oral sex is illegal ( unless it leads to the real deal ) .
Let ’s be honest here .
Sex laws can sometimes be the funniest .
It ’s usually a case of them being outdated , based in times when public opinion was quite different .
And when it comes to international sex laws , I ’m pretty “ forgiving , ” because I certainly do n’t understand every culture out there .
What sounds crazy to me might be perfectly normal there .
But this one ?
I really hope it ’s just a joke or at least off the books now .
Oral sex is illegal , unless you use it as foreplay .
Why do I suspect only a man could come up with that idea ?
6 . While we ’re talking about Singapore , tourists take note : it ’s also illegal to pee in an elevator .
Because apparently we need a reminder ….
7 . Way to go Fairbanks , Alaska !
( They cleaned up filthy moose sex on city streets ! )
This is one of those reported laws that ’s so incredibly stupid I ca n’t help but hope it ’s true ( because that makes it all the funnier ) .
As if animals give a moose ’s behind what our laws say .
If it works , maybe my local officials can write a law that would stop those damned birds from crapping on my car .
8 . In Canada , it ’s reported that it ’s illegal for clear and non -dark sodas to be caffeinated .
Ironically , just this morning I was talking to someone about caffeinated beverages ( yes , my life is so relevant to my work ! ) .
I never actually knew that Mountain Dew had caffeine ( have n’t had it in years either ) .
It was pointed out to me that it ’s indeed one of the most caffeinated sodas here in the U.S.
So when I saw this stupid law I immediately thought of Mountain Dew .
And I just had to look it up — is Canadian Mountain Dew different from “ real ” Mountain Dew ?
And it seems that it is ( or at least was ) !
I do n’t understand why the law was created in the first place , but I found it to be one of the most interesting .
Yes .
I find soft drinks fascinating .
Shut up .
9 . In Washington State , it ’s illegal to use x-ray machines to find the perfect shoe fit .
The hilarity of this dumb law is in its specificity .
Sometimes when you read about stupid laws , they ’re actually just taking general laws and twisting them to sound silly ( like a ban on large animals such as big dogs on a beach being twisted to say you ca n’t take a polar bear to the beach ) .
But this one is n’t one of those .
The law specifically mentions shoe fittings , and you can see the actual text of the law in the source for this one .
I could completely understand a law banning any non-medical use of x-ray equipment because of the radiation involved .
But to specifically call out shoe fittings ?
What were they thinking ?
I just ca n’t imagine so many people in Washington State trying to do this that they felt it necessary to make it illegal .
10 .
In New Jersey , it ’s illegal for a murderer to wear a bullet - proof vest while committing that crime .
Well , I guess if you ca n’t get him on the other charges … .
Remember to take these dumb laws with a grain of salt .
They ’re meant for amusement more than anything .
Do you know more about any of these reported stupid laws ?
Do you have a favorite silly law that ’s still on the books where you live ?

Advertisement The Thai military says security forces plan to surround a protest camp in Bangkok with armoured vehicles .
The military gave a deadline of 1800 ( 1100 GMT ) for people to leave the area .
Shops and businesses were urged to close and transport suspended .
As the deadline passed there was no sign of the armoured vehicles but trucks unloaded soldiers near the camp .
PM Abhisit Vejjajiva is under severe pressure to end the protests , which have paralysed Bangkok since 14 March .
The protesters , known as the red-shirts , want Mr Abhisit to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections .
He had offered polls on 14 November - but the two sides failed to agree a deal because of divisions over who should be held accountable for a deadly crackdown on protests last month .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok says the fear is that more blood might be spilled before this crisis is brought to an end .
Barricades
The move comes a day after the government announced and then cancelled a plan to cut off water and power supplies to the protesters .
The military urged businesses around the protest camp to close by the early evening deadline and stay shut .
AT THE SCENE Vaudine England , BBC News , Bangkok
This government deadline appears to be more serious than earlier ones .
We are now seeing covered trucks unloading new , combat - ready troops under a flyover a few blocks east of the red - shirt protest camp - but no armoured vehicles yet .
Colleagues have seen many more in various parts of town , including scores of troops inside the large Lumphini Park which backs on to the red - shirt camp .
Sources have told us that many more troops have been inconspicuously gathering around the city in recent days .
Local TV is reporting that several key roads have now been cleared of traffic around the red - shirt camp .
Public transport has been crammed with people trying to leave the area , exacerbating the usual rush - hour jams .
The red - shirts are making their own preparations - fiery speeches , barricade reinforcements , testing of generators and water pipes .
Anything - and even nothing - could happen in what has become an all - too - normal state of suspense .
" The authorities will seal off the protest area at all routes at 6 pm today with armoured personnel vehicles .
No - one would be allowed in , " a spokesman , Colonel Sansern Kaewkumnerd , said .
He said that sharpshooters armed with live ammunition would move into position in the area .
A BBC reporter saw trucks unloading heavily - armed soldiers several blocks from the protest encampment .
Transport officials said four elevated Skytrain stations in and around the protest zone would close at 1800 , and two subway stations .
It is not clear whether water and power supplies will be cut .
The camp stretches from Bangkok 's shopping hub south to the business district .
Protesters have built large barricades from tyres and bamboo , behind which they have stockpiled food supplies and generators .
The military 's announcement comes as hopes of a political solution to the crisis fade .
Mr Abhisit told journalists that he had withdrawn his offer of early elections in November .
" I have cancelled the election date ... because protesters refuse to disperse , " he said .
" I have told security officials to restore normalcy as soon as possible . "
A few days ago a deal had appeared within reach .
But protest leaders demanded that charges be laid against the Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban over the 10 April crackdown .
RED -SHIRT PROTEST 14 Mar : Red -shirts converge on Bangkok , hold first big rally , occupy government district 16 Mar : Protesters splash their own blood at Government House 30 Mar : A round of talks with the government ends in deadlock 3 Apr : Red-shirts occupy Bangkok shopping district 10 Apr : Troops try to clear protesters ; 25 people are killed and hundreds injured 22 Apr : Grenade blasts kill one and injure 85 near protest hub ; each side blames the other 3 May : PM Abhisit offers reconciliation plan and polls on 14 November
Profile : Thailand 's reds and yellows Mr Suthep oversaw the failed operation to clear protesters which left 19 protesters , one journalist and five soldiers dead .
Ahead of the military 's announcement red - shirt leaders appeared defiant .
" We urge that our supporters come and help us here because the more people we have , the harder it is for them to hurt us , " Nattawut Saikua , a protest leader , told a cheering crowd .
" We are ready for any attempt to forcibly disperse us .
Our guards are ready to protect the site . "
Later another red - shirt leader , Jatuporn Prompan , said protesters would be sent to surround the armoured vehicles to prevent them advancing .
The protesters are a loose coalition of left - wing activists , democracy campaigners and supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
They say the government is illegitimate because it came to power through a parliamentary deal rather than an election .

I bet the only kind of tea party this Stuntz guy ( see the quote below ) has been to is where the law profs ' wives serve the tea with , you know , scones and cucumber sandwiches .
-- Harvard Law Professor William Stuntz , described by
Nina Totenberg as " conservative " when she introduced this
clip in her report on this morning 's NPR Morning Edition
THIS BALTIMORE SUN READER GOT IT RIGHT
" I applaud the Supreme Court 's decision to scrap the " Miranda warning " nonsense ( " Supreme Court says suspects must tell police they want to be silent during interrogation , " June 1 ) .
If it was needed in the past , it is needed no more .
. . . "
You go , Jeffry D. Mueller of Eldersburg !
Tell it like it is !
Let 's scrap all that effing Miranda warning nonsense !
Only let 's do it the Chief Justice Johnny way -- we 'll scrap all that nonsense all right , but we 'll pretend we did n't !
All the kids in the Federalist Society clubhouse will bust a gut laughing .
It 'll probably be free beers all around for Johnny and his buddies , including Slow Anthony .
with his " Bill of Conditional Privileges , " formerly known as the " Bill of Rights "
And remember , this strip was drawn - written before the Berghuis v. Thompkins ruling .
( Do n't forget to click on the strip to enlarge it . )
#
You 've got to think that the radical right - wingers on the Supreme Court love it when they can fob off justifying an especially preposterous decision on poor Anthony Kennedy .
It 's as if they can sit back and say , " See , we din't do nuttin ' , " as they take their latest step toward dismantling the Constitution and American jurisprudence .
I expect you 're familiar with the case of Berghuis v. Thompkins -- you know , the one in which the now - familiar Court 's bad - boy majority did what , I mean Justice Kennedy , described as simply extending a previous ruling that the right to an attorney must be affirmatively invoked to the , uh , so - called right to remain . . . um , silent .
So that now if you get arrested , yeah , maybe ya got a right to remain silent ( and maybe ya do n't ) , but ya gotta know exactly the right words to say if 'n ya wanna exercise that right .
That 's right , ya gotta know which words to say , and ya gotta , y'know , them .
In order to have this , er , supposed right to remain silent .
This is too ridiculous even to deserve extended comment .
I remember Justice K saying something in his opinion about the suspect having to do no more than provide a clear , unequivocal statement that he 's exercising his right to remain silent .
I leave it to you to make up your own joke .
From now on , I expect the right to remain silent to be exercised principally in mass roundups of law professors and of legal journalists who cover the Supreme Court .
Boy , I 'll bet the silence then will be deafening .
You might think that if the redefined right to remain silent requires you tothat 's what you 're doing , that some burden would be placed on law - enforcement officials to revise their Miranda warning to correctly identify and describe this right .
It appears , however , that you would be wrong .
Your mistake is in thinking that this Supreme Court gives a damn about protecting the constitutional rights of a suspected criminal .
I do n't know where you get these crazy ideas .
Or Professor Stuntz either .
What kind of conservative does he think he is ?
I 'll bet he 's never even been to a tea party !
Except maybe the kind where conservative Harvard Law professors ' wives serve tea on doilies with , you know , cucumber sandwiches .
Of course that 's not what they 're up to .
Chief Justice Roberts in particular likes to pretend that the Court is n't even overturning previous rulings when he does his Constitution rewriting .
I 'll bet he mastered that smirk lying to his mom when she asked him stuff like , " Now , Johnny , do you know what happened to the chicken that 's missing from the coop ? " -- with feathers hanging out of his mouth .
If Johnny and his boys Nino and Clarence and Sammy and of course Slow Anthony ( the mentally challenged kid from down the block that the gang 's taken under their wing ) get their way , a newly arrested suspect will go straight from the reading of his Miranda rights to the precinct 's new John Yoo Interrogation Chamber .
Poor Anthony !
Nobody ever accused him of being an intellectual or legal giant .
But these days it appears he 'll do or write most anything to be allowed to play with the " cool kids .
" Now there 's an image for you : ultigeeks Johnny and Nino and Clarence and Sammy as " cool . "
I think now I 'm going to exercise my right to remain silent .
Is that clear and unequivocal enough ?

The American Civil Liberties Union has waded into the controversy over South Carolina ’s bizarre Democratic primaries last week , which ended with the Senate nomination going to an unknown , unemployed candidate who won more votes than were cast in some counties .
The ACLU has sent a letter ( PDF ) to the South Carolina State Election Commission asking it not to allow the state ’s counties to erase the voting records from the June 8 primary , which saw favored candidate Vic Rawl lose the Senate nomination to unknown Alvin Greene by a 59 - to - 41 margin .

“ We take no position on whether there were irregularities sufficient to place the outcome of the election in doubt but believe the voters in South Carolina are entitled to know that their votes were properly counted , ” the ACLU letter states .
“ That assurance can only be given if the information on the flash cards is preserved and audited . ”
Typically , South Carolina counties erase voting machines ’ memory cards before the machines are used in the next election cycle .
But with numerous Democrats raising the alarm about the possibility of electoral fraud and the possibility that Greene — as well as some other Democratic candidates — were “ plants ” designed to sabotage the Democratic primaries , attention is turning to the state ’s voting machines in an effort to preserve as much of what happened on primary night as possible .
Rawl himself has called for an investigation into the election results .
“ There are numerous complaints , ” he told MSNBC ’s Keith Olberman .
“ Everything from having my name show up on a Republican primary ballot to all sorts of issues with regard to the computer cards , with regard to the difference between the absentee votes versus the actual vote during the day of the machine voting .
We are convinced that there is something amiss with regard to either the software or the machines themselves . ”
Government watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington has called on South Carolina ’s attorney general to investigate whether Greene was “ induced to run for the Senate in violation of South Carolina law . ”

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The people of South Carolina have a right to fair , transparent and fraud - free elections , ” CREW executive director Melanie Sloan said in a statement .
“ Paying candidates to run for office and concealing the sources of campaign funds undermines the integrity of the electoral process and threatens our democracy .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Despite having won early 60 percent of the vote in election - day balloting , Greene lost the mail - in ballots by a whopping 86 - to - 16 margin against Rawl , raising observers ’ suspicions about the results .
Whether or not the election results can be properly reviewed is still up in the air .
BradBlog ’s Brad Friedman notes that South Carolina uses “ ES&S ’ 100 % unverifiable Direct Recording Electronic voting machines ” which “ are both oft - failed and easily manipulated in such a way that it ’s almost impossible to detect the systems have been gamed . ”
Two - fifths of voters do not want either Brian Cowen or Enda Kenny as taoiseach , but a majority of voters want a general election this year , according to the latest Irish Times / Ipsos MRBI poll .
Offered the choice of the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael leader as taoiseach , 40 per cent of voters said in an unprompted response that they did not want either in the job .
A total of 30 per cent favoured Mr Kenny for the taoiseach ’s office while 21 per cent favoured Mr Cowen and 9 per cent had no opinion .
Among Fianna Fáil voters 71 per cent wanted Mr Cowen for the post while 74 per cent of Fine Gael voters said they preferred Mr Kenny .
The Fine Gael leader was well ahead of Mr Cowen among Sinn Féin voters and marginally ahead among Green Party voters , but a majority of both parties ’ supporters supported neither .
In regional terms support for Mr Kenny was highest in Dublin , while Mr Cowen ’s poorest result was in the capital .
Another finding of the poll was that a majority of voters favoured the proposal of the EU Commission for greater scrutiny of national budgets , despite the criticism of the Opposition in the Dáil .
Fine Gael voters were the group most strongly in favour of the plan .
The poll was taken on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week among a representative sample of 1,000 voters aged 18 and over , in face - to - face interviews at 100 sampling points in all 43 constituencies .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3 per cent .
A clear majority of voters said , by a margin of 57 per cent to 35 per cent , that they wanted to see a general election being held this year .
In party terms only Fianna Fáil supporters said there should not be an election – by a margin of 64 per cent to 27 per cent .
Sinn Féin voters were strongest in favour of an early election by 80 per cent to 12 per cent .
Fine Gael supporters favoured an election by 74 per cent to 22 per cent , Labour voters by a narrower margin of 66 per cent to 31 per cent , while among Green voters the margin was much closer , with 55 per cent for and 45 per cent against .
Voters in Dublin were strongest in favour of an election this year by a margin of more than two to one , while people living in Connacht - Ulster were most evenly divided on the issue .
In age terms the youngest categories were most strongly in favour of an early election , while people over 55 were almost evenly divided on the issue , with those in favour ahead by a small margin .
There was a similar response to a question on whether the three outstanding byelections to the Dáil in Donegal South West , Dublin South and Waterford should be held now .
A total of 60 per cent wanted the byelections now , with 24 per cent saying they should not be held at this stage .
A majority of supporters of all political parties backed the holding of the byelections now , with the weakest support among Fianna Fáil voters at 52 per cent , increasing to 60 per cent among Green Party supporters , 62 per cent among Sinn Féin voters , 65 per cent among Labour voters and 67 per cent among Fine Gael supporters .
Strongest support for immediate byelections was expressed in Dublin , followed by Munster .
Support was not as strong in the rest of Leinster while voters in Connacht - Ulster were the least enthusiastic although there was a clear majority in every region for an early date for the contests .
In age terms older voters were more strongly of the view that the byelections should be held now than younger voters , while the best - off AB social category was the strongest in favour in class terms .
Men were considerably more strongly in favour than women .
Another finding in the poll was that , by a majority of two to one , voters did not believe that the worst was over for the economy .
EXCLUSIVE : It took James Gandolfini 6 years to get the story of Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn to the screen .
Now HBO has just given the green light to Hemingway & Gellhorn , an original movie produced by Gandolfini , who first was attached to star in the project in 2004 when it was envisioned as a feature .
He then brought Hemingway to HBO through his Attaboy production banner , which has been based at the pay cable network since 2006 .
It was worth the wait now that it stars Clive Owen and Nicole Kidman as one of American literature ’s most famous couples .
Philip Kaufman will direct from a script by Barbara Turner and Jerry Stahl .
Filming is slated for next year in Northern California .
Gandolfini will executive produce with his producing partner at Attaboy , Alex Ryan , as well as Turner , Philip Kaufman and Peter Kaufman .
Gandolfini ’s managers Nancy Sanders and Mark Armstrong will serve as co-executive producers and Trish Hofmann as producer .
In 1936 , Ernest Hemingway was already a legend when he met Gellhorn , a novelist and one of the greatest war correspondents of the 20th Century , in a local bar in Key West .
Their tumultuous romance and subsequent 5 - year marriage took them to the Spanish Civil War as Gellhorn stood toe - to - toe with the literary master , putting his famous bravado and iconic style to the test .
Gellhorn ’s competitive nature inspired the novelist to pen one of its most famous novels , For Whom the Bell Tolls .
Hemingway & Gellhorn follows a development path similar to another biopic , Grey Gardens , which also started off as a feature and went through a long gestation period before finding its way to HBO with big - screen stars Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore onboard .
It went on to become last year ’s most lauded TV movie .
HBO ’s other recent high - profile original films include You Do n’t Know Jack starring Al Pacino , Temple Grandin starring Claire Danes , The Special Relationship starring Dennis Quaid and the upcoming Cinema Verite staring Diane Lane , Tim Robbins and Gandolfini .
It also is filming the five - hour miniseries Mildred Pierce starring Kate Winslet and Guy Pearce .
Gandolfini’s has been one of two projects about Gellhorn developed in the past few years .
In 2008 , Gillian Anderson ’s company acquired Caroline Moorehead ’s biography Gellhorn : A Twentieth - Century Life and hired Sharman Macdonald to write a feature adaptation for Anderson to star as the trailblazing war correspondent .
Kidman recently finished shooting comedy Just Go with It opposite Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston and will next star in Rabbit Hole .
Owen is currently filming The Killer Elite and will begin production on Juan Carlos Fresnadillo ’s Intruders this summer .

The $ 20bn fund that Barack Obama managed to get BP to agree to set up to meet claims for economic losses and environmental costs from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is impressive , especially since the amount can be increased .
The political pressure so evident also caused BP to temporarily suspend paying dividends .
This should set a precedence for how host countries of multinationals take stern action , and executives of multinationals respond to meet their responsibilities – even if only partially .
But then the US is a powerful host country indeed , and BP had little choice but to yield given the political pressure and public anger .
Developing countries are also host to multinationals that in many cases have poisoned the environment or caused immense loss of life and property .
But these multinationals have got away scot free or paid miniscule sums for the harm they caused .
These double standards must change .
There should be international co-operation between the host and home countries of multinationals to ensure they compensate for the environmental clean - up as well as pay victims for ecological disasters they cause , wherever they take place .
The G20 leaders should talk about it this weekend , and not just focus on bank levies and the shift to fiscal austerity packages .
Though the Mexican Gulf oil spill may be the United States ' greatest environmental disaster , worse ecological catastrophes have been caused by international companies in developing countries .
Little , if any , compensation has been paid by these companies .
And the governments of the countries whose people own the companies usually turn a blind eye .
The two most directly related cases – because they also involve oil spills – are in Ecuador and Nigeria .
Ecuador 's Amazon region has been contaminated by oil and toxic waste in amounts far larger than the Gulf oil spill so far .
The oil and waste was discharged by Texaco ( bought over by Chevron in 2001 ) when it operated an oil concession in 1964 - 1990 .
The New York Times reported indigenous people in the area saying that toxic chemicals had leaked into their soils , groundwater and streams , and that some of their children had died from the poisoning .
It cited a report of an expert ( contested by the company ) who estimated that 1,400 people had died of cancer because of oil contamination .
The indigenous groups have taken a court case against Chevron for $ 27bn in damages .
They accuse Chevron of dumping more than 345 m gallons of crude oil into the rainforest and another 18.5 bn gallons of toxic waste in pits in the forests .
Experts claim that the disaster has devastated their lands , income and health to a degree far larger than the BP spill in the Gulf .
The company paid Ecuador 's government $ 40 m in the early 1990s for clean - up costs , but this amount is seen as far too little given the scale of the damage .
The second case is the Niger Delta in Nigeria , a major oil - producing region in which Shell and other companies operate .
A recent article by John Vidal in the Observer entitled " Nigeria 's agony dwarfs the Gulf oil spill .
The US and Europe ignore it " , describes how spilt oil has contaminated swamps , rivers , forests and farmlands in the region .
" In fact , more oil is spilled from the delta 's network of terminals , pipes , pumping stations and oil platforms every year than has been lost in the Gulf of Mexico , " wrote Vidal .
A report by environment groups calculated in 2006 that up to 1.5 m tons of oil – 50 times the pollution unleashed in the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska – has been spilled in the delta over the past half century .
According to Amnesty , in 2009 the equivalent of at least 9 m barrels of oil was spilled and it accused the oil companies of a human rights outrage .
Life expectancy in the rural communities has fallen to a little above 40 years .
According to Nnimo Bassey , a Nigerian who is chair of Friends of the Earth International : " We see frantic efforts being made to stop the spill in the US .
But in Nigeria , oil companies largely ignore their spills , cover them up and destroy people 's livelihood and environments . "
Then there is the worst eco -disaster of all in Bhopal , where poisonous gas from the US - owned company Union Carbide in 1984 affected half a million people , killing 2,300 immediately , with another 15,000 to 30,000 dying subsequently and many thousands of others maimed seriously .
Neither Union Carbide nor Dow Chemical , which bought the firm in 2001 , accepted responsibility for the disaster .
Union Carbide paid $ 470 m in a deal in 1989 with the Indian government , but this is a small and wholly inadequate amount , given the enormity of the disaster .
These cases show a big contrast between what the US administration is doing to hold a multinational company financially accountable , and how similar companies that cause ecological catastrophes in developing countries are able to get away either freely or with grossly inadequate pay - outs .
Developing countries should learn a lesson from the US and take similar action in line with the " polluter pays " principle .
But these countries just do n't have the political clout of the United States .
Thus , the governments of the home countries of the multinationals should also act to make their companies accountable for their actions when they operate in other countries , and to compensate adequately when they cause environmental damage .

What work do you do ?
What ’s your job title ?
For the past seven years — 1998 to 2004 — I researched and wrote a book , Sound Truth and Corporate Myth$ : The Legacy of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill .
Now I ’m an author / activist / scientist on book tour .
Titles :
Well , I have been bestowed numerous titles by others .
For example , “ pain in the ass ” by Alyeska , the consortium that operates and ( supposedly ) maintains the Trans Alaska Pipeline System .
“ Thorn in our side ” by Arctic Power , the main lobbying group trying to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
“ Propagandist ” just recently by ExxonMobil in response to Sound Truth .
“ A saint ” by several NGOs .
“ One Who Climbs High and Sees ” by Chief Marie Smith Jones , the last living speaker of the Eyak language .
You get the drift — to know me is to title me .
How does it relate to the environment ?
Sound Truth is an expose of oil as an extreme human and environmental poison in much the same way that Silent Spring was an expose of DDT .
By summarizing the advances in medical research and wildlife biology — through storytelling about sick oil - spill - cleanup workers and long - term harm to wildlife in Prince William Sound — I advocate that we get off fossil fuels .
They are poisons .
Burning fossil fuels in our vehicles and power plants contributes over 90 percent of the oil in the air and water at levels that we now know are toxic to life .
I hope Sound Truth and my story help society progress sooner , rather than later , to an energy future based on renewables .
And I hope it acts as a catalyst for all the social justice and corporate downsizing and improved public and environmental health that will co-occur with this transition .
What do you really do , on a day - to - day basis ?
What are you working on at the moment ?
I love to write — especially the kind of writing that inspires others to have hope and take action on large - scale social and environmental issues .
I get up early , usually between 4 and 5 a.m. and write until noon , then take the rest of the day “ off ” to do as Edward Abbey prescribed :
Half the day for others ; half the day for me .
I take my friends ’ dogs , and we ( five of us ) go exploring — hiking , snowshoeing , ice - skating ( on frozen terminal lakes of glaciers — yes , it ’s wild ) , berry - picking , bird - watching in spring , mountain biking — up into the mountains , through the rainforest , out onto the Delta .
I put up berries and can salmon in the fall .
In the evenings , in winter when it ’s dark , I read to prep for the next day of writing , or in summer , I go on camping trips and raft trips with human friends .
I love to watch the progression of light and plants and birds and wildlife as the seasons paint the landscape with different colors and sounds .
And when I ’m out recharging in the wild , I find the ideas flow about how to piece today ’s work into tomorrow ’s work — and beyond into my life ’s work .
What long and winding road led you to your current position ?
In the late ’60s in Wisconsin where I grew up , the robins were falling out of the trees , dying from the neurotoxin DDT .
I was 13 .
This was heavy stuff , to hear the robins fall out of trees — plop , plop — on my walk to school .
I asked my dad : Why ?
He gave me Rachel Carson ’s Silent Spring .
Then he and a small group of friends sued the state of Wisconsin .
( My dad was one of Aldo Leopold ’s last students .
Wisconsin was the first state to ban DDT . )
I decided I wanted to become a marine biologist like Carson and write books on complex topics , made simple so ordinary people could read them and take action to fix the problem .
I set off at 18 to find an ocean .
Thirteen years later , I had a masters and doctorate in marine toxicology , with a specialty in oil pollution from the University of South Carolina and the University of Washington .
Then I decided to take a summer off before I started a career path somewhere , probably as an academic .
I spent the summer of 1985 in Alaska crewing on a salmon fishing boat out of Cordova in Prince William Sound .
That was 20 years ago .
I never left .
Along with a partner , I bought a boat and permit the following year and became a commercial fisherma’am in Prince William Sound and the Copper River Delta .
We fished salmon from early May through usually September .
Starting in fall 1987 , I volunteered to help the fishers reduce the chronic air and water pollution problems from the daily operations at the tanker terminal in Port Valdez at the terminus of the Trans Alaska Pipeline .
I became a board member of both the local Cordova District Fishermen United and the statewide United Fishermen of Alaska .
After the oil spill in 1989 , and after Exxon paraded out its string of endless “ doctors , ” the fishers pushed me onto the front lines as their “ doctor . ”
( It did n’t take much pushing . )
I helped draft legislation for what became the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , testified , and talked with press while Exxon conducted its “ cleanup ” that summer .
I served the commercial fishing and environmental communities in winter / spring of 1990 through 1992 as a volunteer lobbyist in Juneau , Alaska , working to strengthen and pass strong oil - spill prevention and response laws .
Alaska now has some of the strongest laws on paper .
( Enforcement is another story . )
When the fish runs collapsed in Prince William Sound in 1992 and 1993 , I sold out of the fishery to start problem - solving in my own backyard .
I formed three nonprofit organizations to deal with the lingering social , economic , and environmental harm from the Exxon Valdez oil spill ( all of which Exxon says do not exist ) .
Check ’em out : Alaska Forum for Environmental Responsibility , Copper River Watershed Project , and Oiled Regions of Alaska Foundation .
The first one , Alaska Forum for Environmental Responsibility , was formed when three of us pooled our settlement money from an invasion of privacy lawsuit against the seven oil company owners of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System and the security firm Wackenhut for tapping our phones .
But I digress …
I stepped down as founding director of the Copper River Watershed Project in April 1998 after completing the manuscript for my first book , Alaska ’s Copper River Delta .
( If you are interested in this book you can buy it from the Watershed Project website — proceeds benefit the organization . )
Then I started to research and write Sound Truth .
I ’m 50 !
I have lived long enough now to see how my life just all pieced together .
On March 24 , 1989 , I had an epiphany .
I remember staring at the mountains that day when the tanker grounded , and I asked myself : “ I know enough to make a difference .
Do I care enough ? ” I realized I did .
That alone has made all the difference .
Who ’s the biggest pain in the ass you have to deal with ?
Myself .
No one can push me as hard as I push myself : into complete exhaustion sometimes ; into blowing out my back until I learned to manage stress ( getting outside into the wild — walking or biking around town does n’t count — away from any human - made structures counts ) ; into major guilt trips for not doing enough , until I learned that my best was enough .
On and on it goes .
My Aleut partner has taught me that my enemies are my teachers .
Suffice it to say that I ’ve had some great and very powerful ( if you count money as power ) teachers …
Who ’s nicer than you would expect ?
People in general , wherever they are .
In buses , planes , cabs , restaurants , grocery stores , parks , meetings , elevators , stairwells , trails , sidewalks , high schools , universities , even jails .
Generally , I find people ready to smile and talk wherever I come out of myself and am ready to do the same .
People are nice .
There is hope .
Now , if we can just not lose our basic human - ness in our politics , corporate boardrooms , and courtrooms , the world would be a better place .
What has been the worst moment in your professional life to date ?
Hmmmm .
I have a lot of worst moments because I ’m constantly pushing the margin and finding myself in “ situations . ”
But happily , the worst moments have always transformed into good things — or , at minimum , good stories , so my life is rich and full .
For example , Dallas County jail .
I went down to the Exxon shareholder meeting in spring 1999 to ask the shareholders to please pay their debts , specifically , the $ 5 billion in punitive damages awarded to fishers and others in 1994 , before Exxon merged with Mobil .
I asked for , and received , permission to pass out letters explaining the grim situation in Cordova , Alaska , where long - term damages to fisheries from the oil spill were creating financial hardships .
Exxon was not happy with the letter and their security asked me to step outside the hotel doors to pass them out .
I was tricked into trespassing , as I did not have permission from the hotel to pass out the letters .
I was arrested and carted off to jail .
So in the span of 30 minutes I went from seeing how some of the richest people in the world ( Exxon shareholders and corporate leaders ) could care less about the suffering their spill was causing , to seeing how some of the relatively poorest folks in America — women in the holding cell at the Dallas County jail — were very caring and compassionate .
Out of all this , I received a plane ticket to return to Dallas ( for my court trial , which was dropped after I passed a lie detector test ) and a new commitment to work for economic parity .
I used the ticket to fly down to interview Dr. Rea for Sound Truth .
Of course , the real worst moment was when I first flew over the Exxon Valdez , grounded on Bligh Reef and surrounded by a massive slick of oil .
Seeing that it was perfectly calm .
Seeing no oil - spill containment equipment .
Feeling the hot white surges of anger coursing through my body .
Realizing that Exxon was paralyzed ; that corporate officials had no idea what to do .
Realizing that it would only stay calm for a short time and then the oil would be smeared all over the sound .
Realizing all the wildlife that would die — horrible suffering and painful deaths .
Realizing how the townspeople would be hurt .
Realizing how my life would change forever .
This worst moment has yet to be transformed into a good thing .
But because the others all have , I have hopes that this one too will ultimately lead to good things : a world no longer dependent on fossil fuels and an end to all the suffering and dying , human and otherwise , that goes on in many places around the world in order to bring “ cheap ” gas to Americans .
Please , remember Prince William
Sound when you fuel your cars and let that memory lead you to more conscious choices about your own energy habits .
What ’s been the best ?
The blockade of Valdez Narrows in August 1993 .
The townspeople and fisherfolk of the community of Cordova held up tanker traffic for three days in this geologic bottleneck in Prince William Sound , shutting down transport of 25 percent of the nation ’s domestic oil supply .
They demanded that the scientists get their act together and do “ ecosystem studies ” to determine what was wrong with the sound and when it would recover .
This blockade occurred after two successive years of pink salmon run collapses and the first year of Pacific herring stock collapses .
As a result of this public pressure , the scientists conducted some of the first - ever ecosystem studies of this magnitude and duration and discovered there were long - term damages to the sound ’s wildlife from Exxon ’s spill .
What environmental offense has infuriated you the most ?
The Exxon Valdez oil spill .
Because it was so avoidable .
Because it was right there in my own backyard .
Because I knew that many innocents , human and otherwise , were going to get hurt .
Because Exxon never said “ I ’m sorry . ”
Because Exxon is still pretending that its spill had minimal impact on the Sound and on the people .
Because Exxon is still applying its almost unimaginable financial strength to fight a punitive damage award that it can well afford to pay and that would help bring closure of this trauma to thousands of people .
Because Exxon does n’t care .
It can afford not to .
For me , this spill will not be over until the world ’s people assert our power and revoke the privilege of doing business on our planet from callous , arrogant , and recalcitrant corporations such as ExxonMobil .
Who is your environmental hero ?
My father , Fred Ott .
I never heard the word “ environmentalist ” in our family growing up .
Instead , dad lived the word through his actions .
We kids learned that when something is wrong — like the robins dying from DDT — you get together a bunch of friends and figure out how to fix the problem .
You just do it .
Sure , there are the “ bricks ” of the environmental movement , like Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson , among others , but my dad is the mortar that holds all the teachings of the bricks together by living his values daily .
This is inspirational and transformational .
If enough caring people acted on their convictions , the world would be a much different place .
I have other heroes too .
The NOAA Auke Bay Lab scientists , under the leadership of Stanley “ Jeep ” Rice , were among the first to sound the alarm that oil is more toxic than we thought .
Their seminal research tracked the extent of the oil spill and followed its effects through generations of pink salmon and herring .
Some of the other scientists who stuck to their guns in the face of tremendous political pressure and insisted they were , indeed , finding that oil caused long - term harm to wildlife and the sound .
I ’ve included their stories in Sound Truth .
Their work is critical , because our federal laws regulating oil pollution are all based on outdated science which erroneously holds that oil causes only short - term harm .
Who is your environmental nightmare ?
ExxonMobil .
Not just because of the oil spill , but primarily because of its corporate actions after the spill .
For example , dividing communities and families with its money spill ( the so - called “ cleanup ” ) to silence the voices of the ones most affected .
Cleanup contracts contained a clause stating there would be no communication with press .
Exxon forged ahead with pressurized hot water wash on beaches despite evidence from its own scientists and NOAA scientists that the cleanup was doing more harm than good .
Exxon did n’t warn cleanup workers that the symptoms of chemical poisoning from inhalation of oil vapors , mists , and aerosols mimic cold and flu - like symptoms .
It did n’t report 6,722 respiratory distress claims to Occupational and Safety Health Administration officials .
It paid workers to sign a waiver releasing Exxon from any and all health claims from cleanup operations .
It discontinued manufacturing a cleanup product , Inipol , which contains an OSHA Human Health Hazard , 2 - butoxyethanol , with no notice to its former workers of potential health problems .
Exxon denies global climate change and publicly fights to downplay this phenomenon .
I consider global warming to be the greatest threat facing civilization today .
Exxon aggressively demands rights to drill the planet for fossil fuels as our future energy path .
Exxon has yet to order double - hull tankers for service in Prince William Sound , despite a mandate in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 .
Most other oil companies have ordered double - hull tankers without dire consequences to their bottom line .
Exxon endlessly appeals the $ 5 billion punitive damage award in The Exxon Valdez Case , while at the same time funding university professors to write scholarly treatises arguing that punitive damages should be capped — papers that Exxon then uses in court to try to knock down the award to $ 25 million .
Exxon has not been forthright with taxpayers and the press .
They should confess that while the Exxon Valdez cleanup may have cost the company $ 2.2 billion , at least half of that ( and probably more ) was recouped through taxes as a cost of doing business .
It hides behind a shield of lawyers , financial wealth , and taxpayer dollars to fight its public - health and environmental indiscretions .
Well !
This list goes on and on and is actually subject matter for the second book on the Exxon Valdez .
The next book is a story that deals with the state of political science , again using this oil spill to frame a larger social issue .
For the pragmatic environmentalist , what should be the focus — political action designed to change policy , or individual action designed to change lifestyle ?
Everything boils down to individual actions because our corporations , our political leaders , our government , our NGOs are all reflections of individuals acting collectively .
If the individual action changes , the collective action will eventually change .
When things go wrong , we have only ourselves to blame .
Regardless of the forum , consensus action brings about the fastest change because it does n’t get undone with a political regime shift , whether in local or national politics .
Process matters if outcome is to last — something we seem to have forgotten in politics .
In the case of reducing fossil - fuel use and carbon emissions , individual actions count because a relatively few people on a global scale are contributing to the bulk of the problem .
According to the National Research Council , 92 percent of the harmful PAHs in fossil fuels that are found in our air and water in North America come from individuals burning fossil fuels in our vehicles and our power plants .
Americans do n’t have to wait for a president or Congress to take action :
We can make choices to reduce our own fossil - fuel appetite .
Today .
What ’s your environmental vice ?
When I drive , which is n’t often , I drive a mid-sized SUV .
I ’m getting rid of it this year in favor of some sort of alternative - energy vehicle ( nope , a Prius wo n’t work in Cordova , Alaska , and I have two mountain bikes — one for visitors ) .
What are you reading these days ?
The Open Space of Democracy by Terry Tempest Williams .
Yes ! magazine by Positive Futures Network — the issue on Healing and Resistance ( OK , I ’m a little behind ) .
This is a wonderful magazine , especially for teachers !
Check it out .
What ’s your favorite meal ?
Fresh - caught ( within 24 hours or less ) Copper River wild salmon .
Grilled Copper River king salmon and sockeye salmon … Yeowee !
The rest of the year I make do with fresh frozen or canned salmon .
Proceeds from online sales of salmon at Copper River Watershed Project go to benefit a nonprofit organization promoting sustainable use of area resources .
Which stereotype about environmentalists most fits you ?
My hair .
I do n’t have calm , tidy hair .
So somehow this lumps me into the “ radical environmentalist ” crowd .
Go figure .
What ’s your favorite place or ecosystem ?
Hands down the Copper River Delta and watershed .
What ’s one thing the environmental movement is doing particularly well ?
The fact that there are some wild spaces left in America is a tribute to the environmental community ’s collective effort and vision over the years .
What ’s one thing the environmental movement is doing badly , and how could it be done better ?
We have polluted the common air , water , and soil despite 30 years of knowing better .
We now have committed innocents and unborn generations to pay the piper .
We face epidemics of cancer , asthma , depression , and other maladies from chemical poisoning .
To help reverse the dimming quality of our lives , the environmental community needs to weld the concept of environmentalism with people ’s hearts and minds and just plain living .
Let ’s face it :
We ’re all environmentalists .
Do n’t you like clean air to breathe ?
Clean water to drink ?
Are n’t you upset about children with asthma ?
Or veterans with horrendous illnesses that eat away at their bodies and minds ?
Do you want these same chemicals in the air and water and soil ?
How can loggers have jobs when forests are poorly managed ?
Or fishers fish if global fish stocks are poorly managed ?
We need to connect the very act of flipping on a light switch or turning up the heat or fueling our car with a conscious choice of knowing what energy source we are using and how much it really costs , in terms of health care , military installations , waste disposal — and then ask ourselves :
Is this the energy choice I want ?
How can I go about my business of living on this planet in ways that will have less impact on future generations ?
If you could institute by fiat one environmental reform , what would it be ?
Mandatory environmental education in our school system ( K - 12 ) and mandatory signing by all nations beyond Kyoto — a greater reduction of carbon emissions than the Kyoto Protocol currently calls for .
( OK , so that ’s two things . )
What was your favorite band when you were 18 ?
How about now ?
OK , so am I the only one who did n’t listen to music ?
This aversion started when I was in first grade and learning to write .
The teacher had us practice with our names , and I could never remember “ Fredericka . ”
( That ’s my full name , after my father Frederick , after his mother Fredericka .
Do you realize how many letters are in that ?!)
I wanted to use Riki , but noooo .
So I wrote out the long funny name on a small piece of paper and tucked it into my shirt cuff and , sure enough , it fell out one day when we had to get up to go sing .
And everybody realized I could n’t remember how to spell my own name !
Mortifying !
And surely excuse enough to avoid all music and singing for a looooong time thereafter .
What ’s your favorite TV show ?
Movie ?
I do n’t watch TV .
In fact , I do n’t even own one and never have .
They are brainwashing tools used skillfully by corporations to get people to think less and buy more .
Ugh .
Do n’t even get me started .
Movies : Definitely my all - time favorite is Lady Hawk .
I like Thunderheart , Fast Runner , Rabbit Proof Fence , Whale Rider and , well , you get the general idea .
The Matrix also , although it ’s too bad that the sequels did n’t follow through with the same visionary prescription for our times :
Wake up and get involved !
What are you happy about right now ?
It ’s a beautiful sunny day on the planet .
I ’m full .
I ’m writing .
And I ’m about to see an 82 - year - old friend and mentor I have n’t seen in awhile .
Life is about connections , and I ’m rich with a wide diversity of friends .
If you could have every InterActivist reader do one thing , what would it be ?
Start a new resolution to daily do one thing for the greater good and one thing for yourself .
For the greater good , for starters , please go to Soundtruth .
info and request , sign , and send in the petition to reopen the 1991 civil settlement for the Exxon Valdez long - term damages to wildlife and wild lands — and tell your friends to do the same .
Reopening this settlement will establish legal precedent that oil causes long - term harm , which will immediately make vulnerable all our federal laws based on the outdated 1970s science that oil only causes short - term harm .
Tightening these laws will help reduce oil use .
For yourself , please get outside every day and take a hike , do a meditation , or something that connects you with what is real — earth !
If you ’ve forgotten how wondrous and special this planet is , invite a small child to go with you …
Kazakhstan plans giant indoor city
The temperature in Astana can drop to - 40 F ( - 40C ) , but Kazakh residents could soon be able to sun themselves on a beach , go for a gondola ride or use a waterslide thanks to plans for an indoor city capable of housing 20,000 people .
Researchers at the University of Leicester have demonstrated that movable sequences of DNA , which give rise to genetic variability and sometimes cause specific diseases , are far more common than previously thought .
In a paper published in the leading journal Cell , Dr Richard Badge and his collaborators examined L1 ( or LINE - 1 ) retrotransposons : DNA sequences which can ' copy and paste ' their genetic code around the genome .
By breaking up genes , L1s can be responsible for some rare instances of genetic disease .
Working in collaboration with colleagues from the Universities of Michigan and Washington and the HHMI , the researchers developed an innovative technique to find L1s , using short sequences of DNA called fosmids .
These are free - floating loops of DNA , which can be easily transported into bacterial cells , and can carry pieces of human DNA .
Each fosmid can hold only a specific amount of DNA , approximately 40,000 bases .
So by comparing the two ends of a piece of human DNA held in a fosmid , against their known positions in the human genome sequence * , the scientists were able to quickly and easily spot differences in size .
" We 're just looking at each end of the sequence and seeing if they 're the right distance apart . " explains Dr Badge .
" This shows us the existence of insertions ( which we 're interested in ) and also deletions .
This technology is completely unbiased -- it does n't care what the insertion / deletion actually is , just whether it 's there . "
Having identified the insertions , the next step was to see if they could ' jump ' in cultured human cells and how common they are -- which is where the research team found something completely unexpected .
" Previous studies suggested that lots of L1s should jump -- but don't , " says Dr Badge .
" But about half of the L1s we found jump really well , which was very surprising .
We found about 65 elements , which had not been previously identified .
" This tells us that active human retrotransposons are much more common than we expected .
Individual active L1 retrotransposons are quite rare -- but there are a lot of them . "
The paper ' LINE - 1 Retrotransposition Activity in Human Genomes ' by Beck et al is one of three L1 studies published in the 25 June 2010 issue of Cell .
A commentary in the journal describes the team 's results -- 37 of the 68 elements studied being very active or ' hot ' -- as " incredible . "
Because of the mistaken belief in their rarity , active retrotransposons have not been as closely studied as other sources of genetic variation , but this study and the others in the journal signify a developing acceptance of their significance .
" In this field , we are constantly fighting the perception that these bits of DNA are ' junk ' , " observes Dr Badge .
" Actually they 're very active and some of them have disease relevance .
They are big bits of DNA so when they jump into a gene they disrupt the gene sequence and this can cause genetic disease . "
* This discovery , which was only made possible by the sequencing of the human genome , is reported in the same week that the scientific community celebrates " a decade of discovery since the Human Genome Project " and was part funded by the Wellcome Trust .
Work on this project in the USA was funded by the NIH , NSF and HHMI .
ESA ’s Rosetta spacecraft flew by asteroid ( 2867 ) Steins on 5 September 2008 .
Steins was Rosetta ’s first nominal scientific target .
The spacecraft encountered the asteroid in the course of its first incursion into the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , while on its way to Comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko .
A European comet - chasing spacecraft will zip by a largeasteroid next month , snapping pictures all the way and potentially unlockingsome of the mysteries surrounding the space rock .
The Rosetta spacecraft , operated by the European SpaceAgency ( ESA ) is set to glide past asteroid Lutetia on July 10 .
At closestapproach , Rosetta will come within close to 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of the spacerock .
And while that sounds far , the flyby will actually giveRosetta an approximately two - hour window of opportunity to take the firstup - close images of the space rock and immediately beam them back to Earth .
[ Photos : Asteroid probe returns to Earth . ]
Rosetta has been taking navigational sightings of Lutetia sincelate May so its ground controllers could determine if any course corrections wouldbe needed to achieve the intended flyby distance .
In 2008 , Rosetta flew by a different asteroid , calledSteins , and a few other space missions have also encountered asteroids .
Each encounter has led to different findings , and scientists are hoping thatobservations from the Lutetia flyby will contribute to the relatively smallbody of knowledgeabout asteroids .
The truth about asteroid Lutetia
Currently , not much is known about Lutetia , including whatit looks like .
The enigmatic space rock , which is from the main asteroidbelt that orbits between Mars and Jupiter , simply appears as little more than asingle point of light to ground - based telescopes .
Preliminary observations suggest that Lutetia 's continuousvariation in brightness indicate that it is rotating and has an uneven surface .
These observations have allowed astronomers to estimate the asteroid 's shapeand size , but their determinations are still varied .
Initially , astronomers thought that Lutetia had a diametermeasuring about 59 miles ( 95 km ) , and is only mildly elliptical .
Yet , morerecent estimates suggest that the diameter could be 83 miles ( 134 km ) , with apronounced elongation .
Rosetta could provide more conclusive evidence about theasteroid 's dimensions and composition ?
another area with more questions thananswers .
A carbon or metal asteroid ?
Planetary scientists believe that Lutetia is a primitiveasteroid that was left on the sidelines for billions of years , since no planetconsumed during the formation of our solar system .
In fact , most of the currentmeasurements seem to support this hypothesis , placing the asteroid in the 'C - type ' category , which contains primitive compounds of carbon .
Yet , some measurements seem to suggest that Lutetia could bea so - called ' M - type ' , which would mean that there are metals on its surface .
" If Lutetia is a metallic asteroid then we have found areal winner , " said Rita Schulz , Rosetta 's mission project scientist atESA .
Although metallicasteroids do exist , they are thought to be fragments of the metallic coresof larger asteroids that were shattered to pieces .
So , if Lutetia is made ofmetal , or even contains large amounts of metal , Schulz stated that thetraditional asteroid classification scheme would need to be revamped .
" C-class asteroids should not have metals on theirsurfaces , " Schulz said .
The data collected from the Rosetta flyby will providevaluable observations for asteroidscience , and will at least give scientists preliminary information that canthen be corroborated through ground - based observations .
And , the findings willnot only apply for Lutetia , but for other asteroids as well .
For 36 hoursaround the moment of closest approach , Rosetta will be in almost continuouscontact with the ground .
The only breaks will come as Earth rotates andengineers have to switch from one tracking station to another .
Good contactis essential because the uncertainties in the asteroid ?s position and shape maydemand last minute fine - tuning to keep it centered in Rosetta ?s instrumentsduring the flyby .
" Theskeleton of the operation is in place , and we have the ability to update ourplans at any time , " said Andrea Accomazzo , ESA Rosetta spacecraft operations manager .

* All information correct at time of publication
The investigation revolves around a committee of experts who met six days before the quake on April 6 , 2009 , and concluded that months of low - level tremors did not signal that a major quake was on its way .
One of the main conclusions of the 2007 IPCC report was that the warming over the last 50 years was most likely due to anthropogenic pollution , especially increasing atmospheric CO2 from fossil fuel burning .
But a minority of climate researchers have maintained that some — or even most — of that warming could have been due to natural causes .
For instance , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) and Atlantic Multi- decadal Oscillation ( AMO ) are natural modes of climate variability which have similar time scales to warming and cooling periods during the 20th Century .
Also , El Nino — which is known to cause global - average warmth — has been more frequent in the last 30 years or so ; the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) is a measure of El Nino and La Nina activity .
A simple way to examine the possibility that these climate cycles might be involved in the warming over the last 50 years in to do a statistical comparison of the yearly temperature variations versus the PDO , AMO , and SOI yearly values .
But of course , correlation does not prove causation .
So , what if we use the statistics BEFORE the last 50 years to come up with a model of temperature variability , and then see if that statistical model can “ predict ” the strong warming over the most recent 50 year period ?
That would be much more convincing because , if the relationship between temperature and these 3 climate indicies for the first half of the 20th Century just happened to be accidental , we sure would n’t expect it to accidentally predict the strong warming which has occurred in the second half of the 20th Century , would we ?
Temperature , or Temperature Change Rate ?
This kind of statistical comparison is usually performed with temperature .
But there is greater physical justification for using the temperature change rate , instead of temperature .
This is because if natural climate cycles are correlated to the time rate of change of temperature , that means they represent heating or cooling influences , such as changes in global cloud cover ( albedo ) .
Such a relationship , shown in the plot below , would provide a causal link of these natural cycles as forcing mechanisms for temperature change , since the peak forcing then precedes the peak temperature .
Predicting Northern Hemispheric Warming Since 1960
Since most of the recent warming has occurred over the Northern Hemisphere , I chose to use the CRUTem3 yearly record of Northern Hemispheric temperature variations for the period 1900 through 2009 .
From this record I computed the yearly change rates in temperature .
I then linearly regressed these 1 - year temperature change rates against the yearly average values of the PDO , AMO , and SOI .
I used the period from 1900 through 1960 for “ training ” to derive this statistical relationship , then applied it to the period 1961 through 2009 to see how well it predicted the yearly temperature change rates for that 50 year period .
Then , to get the model - predicted temperatures , I simply added up the temperature change rates over time .
The result of this exercise in shown in the following plot .
What is rather amazing is that the rate of observed warming of the Northern Hemisphere since the 1970 ’s matches that which the PDO , AMO , and SOI together predict , based upon those natural cycles ’ PREVIOUS relationships to the temperature change rate ( prior to 1960 ) .
Again I want to emphasize that my use of the temperature change rate , rather than temperature , as the predicted variable is based upon the expectation that these natural modes of climate variability represent forcing mechanisms —
I believe through changes in cloud cover — which then cause a lagged temperature response .
This is powerful evidence that most of the warming that the IPCC has attributed to human activities over the last 50 years could simply be due to natural , internal variability in the climate system .
If true , this would also mean that ( 1 ) the climate system is much less sensitive to the CO2 content of the atmosphere than the IPCC claims , and ( 2 ) future warming from greenhouse gas emissions will be small .
While perusing the Internet , I came across an article about how to be a more attractive woman .
First on the list was to learn how to tell a funny story .
“ Wit is the key .
Be interesting . ”
When have you ever heard anyone advise a woman to learn to tell a decent anecdote ?
Never .
Encourage women to be interesting as opposed to hot ?
It was radical !
Totally progressive and forward - thinking .
Then I realized I misread the premise : it was how to be more attractive to women .
The suggestion is well - worn and typical – for dudes .
Here ’s the thing : if we still have a need for the word “ feminist , ” then the goal of gender equality has not been reached .
No one has to say they ’re an abolitionist .
It ’s just assumed you ’re against slavery unless otherwise indicated .
We clearly still need the word – and the concept of – feminism .
The 2010 primary season has marked an unprecedented number of female candidates for national and state offices … according to the hype .
Republicans winning Republican primaries across the country is a victory for Republicans everywhere !
There are more female GOP candidates this season than ever before .
Well , there are four : former HP CEO Carly Fiorina , former eBay CEO Meg Whitman , South Carolina State Representative Nikki Haley , and former Nevada Assemblywoman Sharron Angle .
To some this could seem like a feminist victory .
It ’s a female Republican victory , sure .
But being a feminist and being against reproductive freedoms means you are not a feminist .
You can say you ’re a Mets fan , but if you only want the Yankees to win – you ’re not a Mets fan .
The irony is this swarm of candidates , almost all entirely anti-abortion rights ( save Whitman ) , has the feminism movement to thank for their ability to be candidates .
Which is like using Twitter to get your message out about the evils of micro-blogging .
This new trend in the Republican Party – putting up women who want to turn the clock back to criminalize abortion – is complicated for feminists .
And feminism in its third wave ( or so ) is already complicated .
Yes , it ’s great to think of women in power , but not when they ’re against women ’s rights as their platform .
The anti-choice movement tells women they deserve better than abortion , that they are the ones who have the best interests of women in mind .
But treating women like children who need to be told what ’s best for them is hardly equality .
It ’s a step back .
And saying not having an abortion is the right choice – is a choice .
A stealthy anti-abortion movement has been chipping away at access to information and services since before Roe v. Wade .
Crisis Pregnancy Centers , the first opening in Hawaii in 1967 , are fake women ’s clinics offering no medical services , only religious - based misinformation and scare tactics to discourage abortion and in many cases premarital sex .
They outnumber abortion providers 2 - 1 in this country .
The Dutch organization Women on Waves provides health services in countries where abortion is a crime .
A doctor with the group told me an alarming amount of their calls are from women in the U.S. in desperate situations .
Some are from U.S. soldiers who do n’t have access to abortion while serving their country , even if they ’re raped .
This should be embarrassing to us .
This should be a concern to thoughtful female candidates and patriots alike .
Currently , an amendment added to the 852 - page Pentagon policy bill repealing “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ” calls for soldiers to get the same basic health care access as civilians .
Civilians with money , at least .
This has been called “ government funding of abortions ” by opponents and “ supporting the troops ” by everyone else .
Because nothing says “ sanctity of life ” like serving in a war zone .
The Republican rhetoric about freedom , the sacredness of the Constitution and government not encroaching on your rights all come to a screeching halt at reproductive issues .
Republicans are for those platitudes … but with asterisks .
To glaze over this contradiction , female anti-abortion GOP candidates have flippantly called themselves feminists .
Which is like proclaiming yourself vegetarian while eating a ham sandwich .
They ’re not feminists .
They ’re just female .
“ Being a feminist is n’t a question of plumbing , ” author Gloria Feldt said to me .
Yes , this third wave is complicated .
But at least it ’s interesting .

Apart from ending an unbroken 17 year winning streak by Harley on one mile tracks , the win marks the first time a readily available production engine has won a Grand National Twins race in 29 years .
The Lloyd Brothers Motorsports Ducati Flat Track Project began just one year ago , when Ducati Superbike rider Larry Pegram approached friend and flat track team co-owner , David Lloyd , regarding the flat track potential of Ducati 's air - cooled engine .
Pegram Racing and Lloyd Brothers Motorsports then joined forces to build a stock - framed dirt track bike from a Ducati Sport 1000 and , after a quick shakedown by Pegram , entered the 2009 Springfield Mile where it immediately proved a formidable opponent to the dominant Harley - Davidsons .
After a summer of modifications , including the addition of the 2010 Desmodue engine from the Ducati Hypermotard 1100EVO and a custom racing chassis , Pegram entered the Indy Mile and missed the main event by just one position in the semi-qualifier .
Fast - forward to 2010 's opening round and Joe Kopp proves that Ducatis do n't need asphalt to beat the competition .
Putting the Ducati into the lead from the start of Saturday 's event , Kopp ran a fantastic race and faced little competition before finally drafting past Sammy Halbert 's Harley - Davidson on the final lap to take the checkered flag by 0.025 seconds .
The next race for the Lloyd Brothers Motorsports Ducati entry will be the famed Springfield Mile on May 30 , where Ducati AMA Superbike star , Larry Pegram will pilot a second bike alongside Saturday 's winner and former Grand National Champion , Joe Kopp .
Prior to the season beginning , Kopp had suggested the potential of the Ducati would be a major factor in this years title chase when he said , “ I am more excited for the season to start than I have been in years . ”
“ Equipment wise , I have the best of both worlds .
I will be riding Ducatis on all the mile tracks and will be able to choose between the Ducati and my XR750 on the half - mile tracks depending on how testing goes .
I really think that we are going to surprise a lot of people this year with the Ducati .
This is exactly the type of challenge that I feel I needed and I am really looking forward to proving that we can win on this bike right out of the box .
I think with my feedback and experience and my crew ’s knowledge that we can further development of this bike very quickly and have fun doing it . ”
“ We are thrilled about the team that we have been able to assemble to work together to issue in a new chapter for the historic AMA Grand National Championship .
It is truly a team effort .
Bringing new brands to dirt track will lead to a broader audience appeal for the series “ said team co-owner Michael Lloyd .
Maradona ’s team , Argentina , seems to be in great form with a spectacular win over South Korea with the final score of 4:1 .
Gonzalo Higuain scored a hat trick with 3 goals and Lionel Messi scored one .
With the win , Argentina takes the lead for Group B .
Game Highlights ( from here )
80th minute : A thing of beauty that showcases all of Argentina ’s creativity .
Again , Messi starts it , chipping a ball to Aguero , whose short cross set up Higuain for his third goal of the match .
76th minute : GOAL .
Argentina 3 , South Korea 1 .
Messi with a — dare we say it ?
— Maradona - esque run through the middle of the field and South Korea defense .
He created his own chance , firing a low left - footer that was blocked , another blast that ricocheted off the left post , and a tap - in by a well - placed and unmarked Higuain .
75th minute : A yellow card for Heinze , who has played a good game but frankly made a poor decision with the hand ball .
64th minute : Maradona , as a great player - turned - coach , was just compared to Magic Johnson and Larry Bird by ESPN play - by - play voice Ian Darke .
Suffice to say neither Magic nor Bird could back - heel a soccer ball while wearing a suit and dress shoes .
54th and 55th minutes :
The good and the bad for Argentina in short order .
First ,
Tevez ’s work rate this afternoon cannot be overstated .
He is the engine for the offense .
However , Jonas Gutierrez followed shortly after with a yellow card and will have to sit out the next match for Argentina .
Only positive there is if this score holds , Argentina wo n’t need its A team .
52nd minute : The Argentine touches within close proximity are quite impressive .
A quick sequence of Tevez to Di Maria to Higuain almost produced a third goal .
48th minute : Again , an early corner kick fr Argentina , which again is setting the pace .
Oh , and yet another shot of Diego Maradona on the sideline .
At what point does that become tiresome .
Oh , it already is .
Stoppage time : GOAL .
Argentina 2 , South Korea 1 .
A complete breakdown by the Argentine defense , which had been questioned time and again during World Cup qualifying .
And Lee Chung - Yong takes advantage , picking up the turnover and then shooting in for a 2 - 1 score .
44th minute : Messi and Tevez are having their way with the South Korea defense .
What was particularly sublime about the last chance was the speed and quickness cutting through the defense , followed up by the soft chip that dipped just over the goalkeeper but drifted a touch to the right .
33rd minute : GOAL .
Argentina 2 , South Korea 0 .
Higuain finishes a beautiful sequence with a header just inside the right post .
It started with Messi and Maxi Rodriguez on the far left side after Tevez drew a foul .
Rodriguez ’s cross into the box was flicked by Burdisso to Higuain , who was left unmarked in all the commotion .
28th minute : Yet another harrowing set piece faced by the South Korean’s .
A deft touch by Messi to Tevez , whose blast just rose over the crossbar .
That could have easily produced a 2 - 0 lead .
17th minute : GOAL .
Argentina 1 , South Korea 0 .
A huge mistake for South Korea , as Chu Young knocked in the low , driving free kick by Messi .
Argentina is offensively talented enough that it does n’t need its opponents putting the ball in the goal .
10th minute : Yellow card for the takedown by Ki Huhn .
The good news for South Korea is that the tackle ( literally ) probably stopped a break by Argentina .
The bad news is that Ki Huhn will have to be a little tentative the rest of the game with his marking .
7th minute :
We knew this before the game started , but Argentina has shown which team will control the action .
South Korea is content at this point to sit back and wait for the counterattack .
1st minute : Already a corner kick for Argentina , which is probably doing both teams a favor by pushing the action .
Game - time temperatures are below 50 degrees .
Argentina seems to be in great shape and definitely a good contender for the World Cup 2010 .
For some mice , life produces anxiety — where to nest , which bag of chips to chew through , how to escape human detection .
To cope with such crippling panic , these mice groom themselves so thoroughly and frequently that they lick off their fur .
These rodents develop bald patches and sores over their bodies .
Even in pain , the mouse licks and licks .
Researchers , led by 2007 Nobel prize winner for medicine , Mario Capecchi , found that with a bone marrow transplant , the mice stop their obsessive - compulsive behaviors and live normal lives .
Capecchi says this shows a strong connection between the immune system and mental illness .
Capecchi bred the mice with a mutation Hoxb8 , giving them the equivalent of human OCD .
Hoxb8 originates in microglia , which are immune cells .
Most would assume that neurologic cells would control behavioral ticks and the group was surprised to learn otherwise .
The mutant mice also had 15 percent fewer Hoxb8 than regular mice .
To examine Hoxb8 's effect , the researchers injected bone marrow from mice with mutant Hoxb8 mice into healthy mice .
The healthy mice began licking themselves compulsively , pulling out their fur and creating sores .
In turn , the researchers injected the mutant mice with healthy bone marrow , and these mice became non-obsessive .
Even though bone marrow transplants possess too many risks to make it a viable treatment for OCD , Capecchi says this understanding might help researchers develop drugs that regulate microglia — perhaps providing better treatments for OCD .
It is swelteringly hot and unbearably humid as we set off on our journey deep into the heart of the Dominican Republic 's tropical forests .
And as we drive along the bone - joltingly bumpy track , crammed into a truck loaded with enough supplies for our week in the wilderness , the excitement amongst the researchers grows .
We are on our way to see if we can track down one of the most strange and ancient mammals in the world - the Hispaniolan solenodon .
But finding one will not be easy : naturalists once thought that you would be more likely to see a ghost than this elusive creature .
And , indeed , few have ever come face - to - face with one .
Image caption
The solenodon is one of just a handful of venomous mammals
The nocturnal solenodon , which is only found in the Dominican Republic and in one of the last forested patches of Haiti , is often described as a " living fossil " , thanks to the fact that it has been around , virtually unchanged , for the past 76 million years .
Remarkably , this means it would have once scuttled amongst the giant feet of the dinosaurs , in the days when they roamed the Earth .
The problem is that we really do n't know anything about these animals Dr Richard Young , Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust
And it is an odd - looking animal .
It is the size of a rabbit , with a ginger - brown coat .
It has disproportionately large , clawed feet , beady little eyes and a very long , thin nose .
But perhaps its most bizarre - and prehistoric - feature is that it is the only mammal that can inject venom through its teeth , the same way a snake does .
The poison , while not deadly to humans , is the perfect tool for the insectivore , allowing it to dine on bugs as it moves around the forest at night .
Last survivors
But this unique creature is now under threat .
The Dominican Republic and Haiti , which together make up the island of Hispaniola , used to have a diverse mix of monkeys , shrews , sloths and rodents , but these have died out one by one .
Image caption
The hutia is also one of Hispaniola 's last native mammals
This has left the solenodon and a tree - dwelling rodent called the hutia as the only native mammals that remain .
Now , researchers from the UK and the Dominican Republic , with the help of a grant from the UK government 's Darwin Initiative , have embarked on a project called The Last Survivors , which they say could be our last chance to save the solenodon and hutia before they vanish from the forests forever .
The programme involves the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) , the Hispaniolan Ornithological Society ( SOH ) and the Dominican Republic 's national zoo and environment ministry .
Dr Richard Young , head of conservation science at Durrell , explains : " The problem is that we really do n't know anything about these animals - we do n't know where they are , how many there are and how this relates to their habitats .
" And before you can start to conserve them , you need to answer some really basic questions . "
But , given the suggestion that a supernatural sighting might be more likely than snatching a glance of a solenodon , finding these creatures to uncover the answers is not going to be easy .
And in fact , says Jorge Brocca , SOH 's director , few people in the Dominican Republic have ever seen one , and many have never heard of them .
He explains : " We 've been showing local people photographs , and most of them do not know what these animals are . "
Image caption The Sierra de Bahoruco is topped by a stunning pine forest
We head for the Sierra de Bahoruco , a mountain range in the south - west of the Dominican Republic , which straddles the border with Haiti .
At its highest point it reaches an elevation of 2,200 m ( 7,200ft ) .
As we negotiate the steep incline , we see a spectacular range of habitats - from dry , cactus - studded forests in the lowlands , up to vibrant , cloud forests dotted with giant trees , ferns and mosses , and finally , at the peak , a pine forest , that looks something like a tropical version of Scandinavia .
Here , the team is surveying patches of forest for solenodons - the start of an attempt to get a comprehensive grasp of the mammal 's spread across the country .
Image caption Solenodons leave a " nose poke " as they probe the ground for insects
Much of this work takes place during the day , while the animals are sound asleep in their burrows .
As we trek ever deeper into the forest , Durrell 's Joe Nunez - Mino , who is working in the field with the SOH's Pedro Martinez and local research assistants Nicolas Corona and Lleyo Espinal , tells me that trying to find them feels a bit like being a detective .
The first clue , he says , is the " nose poke " - he points to one as we tramp through the dense vegetation .
He explains : " These are holes that the creatures make in the ground as they use their long noses to probe the earth as they look for insects . "
Nearby , we find what might be the entrance of a burrow .
He bends down and takes a deep sniff inside the cave .
Solenodons , he says , have a really musty smell , a bit like a goat .
And sure enough , a pungent odour seeps out of the cave - an exciting sign that one might be in there .
Long wait
But until night falls , the solenodon will remain asleep in its subterranean den , and there is little more we can do here .
So we return to our wooden cabin , set in a small clearing , and feast upon our campfire - cooked meal , waiting for darkness to descend over the forest .
It 's going to be one of those life - defining moments to see one in the wild Dr Sam Turvey , ZSL
For the ZSL's Dr Sam Turvey , who works on the Edge of Existence Programme , the prospect of spotting a solenodon is thrilling .
" I can not tell you how excited I am about seeing one .
Being in the middle of the forest , in the middle of nowhere , in the night , is going to be amazing , " he says .
" It 's going to be one of those life - defining moments to see one in the wild . "
We know our chances of finding one might be slim , but with good weather , the expert skills of our local research assistants and a huge pinch of luck , we grow ever more hopeful that we might soon become some of the fortunate few to have come face - to - face with this elusive forest " ghost " .
RANCHO PALOS VERDES , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Facebook Inc.'s 26 - year - old chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , literally squirmed in his seat , took off his famous hoodie sweatshirt and had a Richard Nixon moment under the grilling of two of the hosts of the All Things D Conference .
As D8 co-host and BoomTown blogger Kara Swisher asked him if recent unflattering stories of the early days of Facebook accurately portrayed him , he squirmed .
" When I was 18 or 19 years old , I did a lot of stupid things , " he said .
" I do n't want to make an excuse for that .
I 'm really sorry that I did them . "
Sweat literally dripped from his face as he mostly avoided giving specific answers about the backlash stemming from the popular social network 's recent privacy changes that caused ire among users .
Zuckerberg also dodged questions about how the backlash stemming from another recent privacy uproar affected him personally .
See Tech Tales column on Facebook 's recent issues .
" A lot of stuff happened along the way , " Zuckerberg responded , briefly recounting the well - known story of Facebook 's earliest roots in a dorm at Harvard University and its subsequent move to Silicon Valley .
In the last few years , Facebook has exploded to nearly 500 million users .
Facebook 's Zuckerberg alongside an image of Richard Nixon during the famous Kennedy - Nixon TV debate in September 1960 .
When Zuckerberg wiped sweat from his face , then took off his black sweatshirt , Swisher examined the hoodie , revealing Facebook logo inside .
" This is a great moment in Internet history , " she said , before examining the hoodie and joking about a secret cult .
The interview was rich in irony .
For the CEO of a company that wants everyone to share information , Zuckerberg clearly did not like talking about himself in front of some of the tech industry 's biggest movers and shakers .
Just like a teenager who posts something silly on Facebook that he or she will regret later , Zuckerberg did not like being reminded of what may have been some of his less - than - finer moments .
Not specifically mentioned , but easily inferred , were recent tales in the blogosphere about instant messages purportedly from a 19 - year - old Zuckerberg to a friend who asked him how he gathered information about his users .
" They trust me , " comes the reply .
" Dumb Fxxxs . "
And coming out next week is " The Facebook Effect , " a book that also recounts the site 's early days , by journalist David Kirkpatrick .
Separately , an unflattering movie is in the works .
Zuckerberg is still young .
He deserves kudos for getting on the stage and at least saying he is sorry for some of his past moves and that privacy is important to Facebook .
The room was clearly sympathetic to the young CEO being grilled by two veteran journalists , Swisher and Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal , who actually were tactful and kind if persistent in trying to get answers to their questions .
But Zuckerberg 's evasive and rambling answers about privacy and the company 's revenue model were irritating .
He did not seem any closer to a willingness to change Facebook 's privacy controls so that they are set to the highest levels of protection by default .
He even predicted that the current privacy brouhaha could ultimately end up as an all - but - forgotten footnote , just like the uproar when the " news feed " first emerged ; it 's now one of Facebook 's most popular features .
In a moment of rare precision early on Wednesday evening , Zuckerberg did say there have been misconceptions about Facebook 's privacy policy .
" We recommend you share only with your friends all your really sensitive stuff , " he said .
So , while Zuckerberg may be of a generation prone to oversharing all the moments of their lives , it was pretty amusing when he said : " I wish that no one made a movie about me when I was alive . "

Image caption Police sealed off the area around the Custard Factory complex
Four people have been injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Birmingham city centre .
West Midlands Police were called to the Custard Factory complex in Gibb Street , Digbeth , shortly after 0100 BST .
Three men aged 20 , 23 , and 25 , and a 25 - year - old woman were taken to hospital with bullet wounds .
The woman was later discharged .
The men , from Birmingham and Wolverhampton , are in a stable condition .
Music festival
The Custard Factory is a mixed - use arts centre .
The shootings took place at the Urban Music Event 2010 , an annual music festival , being held in a converted factory on the site .
More than 1,000 people are believed to have been at the venue when the shooting started .
David Peebles from the Custard Factory said : " The event was not hosted , sponsored , organised or managed in any way by the Custard Factory although we do have a business relationship with the company responsible for the event .
" Pending the result of the police investigation , which is now under way , it is difficult for us to throw any more light on this tragic incident " .
The area around the Gibb Street complex was sealed off to allow forensic examination of the scene , and officers were examining CCTV footage .
Det Insp Tom Chisholm said : " We have a number of statements to take but the offender is described as a black male who may have been part of a larger group .
" We know a large number of people were there and we are appealing for them to contact the police urgently with any information they may have . "
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama faces two grim choices on Wednesday : Fire Gen. Stanley McChrystal and risk looking like he ’s lost control of the war in Afghanistan .
Or keep him and risk looking like he ’s lost control of his generals .
Even before McChrystal ’s very public slap at his boss surfaced on Monday night , the White House was already bristling at the perception that the war in Afghanistan was becoming unwinnable .
The decisive military offensive to clear the strategic town of Marjah has foundered .
Another , bigger offensive to drive the Taliban from its home turf in Kandahar has been delayed .
U.S. casualties are rising in a war that ranks as America ’s longest , surpassing the grim milestone of 1,000 dead earlier this month .
Corrupt warlords and Taliban militants are pocketing tens of millions in U.S. aid .
Now Obama must add a new crisis to that daunting list :
The commander he handpicked to win the Afghanistan war allowed a reporter for Rolling Stone to embed with him and his closest staff for a month , offering up a series of incendiary and embarrassing comments about the president and his war cabinet .
If he fires McChrystal , Obama will enjoy the dubious distinction of being the only president in modern U.S. history to sack two wartime commanders in a little more than a year .
Last May , Gen. David McKiernan was relieved of post commanding the Afghan war effort after the White House and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said “ fresh eyes ” were needed to find a more successful path forward .
On Capitol Hill , where last week key lawmakers from both parties peppered Gates and Central Command chief Gen.
David Petraeus with probing questions about the course of the Afghan war , leaders praised McChrystal ’s work but simultaneously blasted his decision to speak with Rolling Stone .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , and other key Senate Armed Services members issued a statement calling McChrystal ’s comments “ inappropriate and inconsistent with the traditional relationship between Commander - in - Chief and the military . ”
Retired Navy vice admiral Rep. Joe Sestak , D - Pa. , said that military officers have a responsibility to speak bluntly , but “ you say that privately and keep it behind closed doors . ”
But Rep. David Obey , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and a key liberal voice in the House , called McChrystal ’s comments “ contemptuous of his civilian superiors ” and demanded his resignation .
CBS
News later reported that McChrystal had offered a letter of resignation .
“ His comments , and those of his subordinates , dismissing the President , the Vice - President , Gen. ( James ) Jones , Ambassador ( Karl ) Eikenberry , and Richard Holbrooke suggests that Gen. McChrystal is locked into an ‘ everybody is wrong but me ’ approach to the world , ” Obey said .
Still , most congressmen stopped short of calling for McChrystal ’s dismissal , saying instead that the tone and sincerity of his apology after Wednesday ’s meeting with Obama would determine his future role .
Daniel Goure , vice president of the conservative Lexington Institute , said the reason for that is simple .
“ To put anyone else in charge right now would be a disaster , ” Goure said .
Goure said the Rolling Stone article does n’t quite amount to a Truman / MacArthur moment , when Gen. Douglas MacArthur was sacked over his public opposition to President Harry Truman ’s strategy in the Korean War .
The most damning comments in the article come from McChrystal ’s advisers , Goure noted , and at least one of those staffers has already been fired for his involvement with the piece .
Regardless ,
Goure said , no other American figure has the clout with Afghan president Hamid Karzai or the knowledge of the counterinsurgency strategy to succeed in Afghanistan .
But the liberal group VoteVets.org said McChrystal must be fired for disrespecting the chain of command .
Brian Katulis , senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , said the article could easily be used as Taliban propaganda , revealing infighting among U.S. leaders and a lack of real concern for the Afghan people .
“ He ’s supposed to be leading efforts to win the hearts and minds over there , ” Katulis said .
“ This article does n’t help . ”
Obama already is suffering from dwindling support for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan .
A Gallup poll released earlier this year showed that more than a third of voters believe it was a mistake to send U.S. troops into Afghanistan .
A Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month showed a drop in confidence in Obama ’s foreign policy decisions , both among Americans ( down 9 percent ) and in European and Middle East countries .

Government officials in Canada may temporarily block wireless signals as part of an effort to secure world leaders during the G8 and G20 summit scheduled in Ontario later this month .
Wireless companies told the CBC they 've been warned their signals may be blocked and no advanced warning will be given .
The jamming is expected to be used to create a “ moving bubble of electronic silence around motorcades . "
World leaders have long used jamming to stymie the use of remote - controlled bombs , but details are often hard to come by .
In 2003 , Pakistan 's then - President Pervez Musharraf was spared when the technology was used to block a signal being transmitted to bombs under a bridge , Wired reported .
Canada 's jamming plans became public because authorities are required to apply for an exemption under the country 's Radiocommunications
Act , which forbids interfering with the airwaves .
New York City Police have said they are considering using wireless jamming in the event of certain terrorist attacks to prevent the perpetrators from communicating , following reports that gunmen in Mumbai used hand - held devices during a deadly rampage in November 2008 .
People operating the jamming technology have to exercise care , since law enforcement also relies on wireless signals to communicate .
The G8 summit is scheduled for June 25 and 26 just north of Toronto , and the G20 is slated for June 26 and 27 .

BBC Newsnight , North Korea
As we arrived at Pyongyang 's airport our mobile phones were confiscated and throughout our stay in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea there was no access to the internet .
At the hotel our government minders had booked rooms alongside ours , and on the one occasion that we tried to leave without them we were reported and reprimanded .
From exchanges with our minders , we also learned that our rooms were bugged .
But then we were not being singled out , the entire country lives in a bubble of unreality , cut off from the outside world and watched by an army of informers .
There are only two mobile phone networks .
The diplomatic corps and NGO workers use one of them to contact one another .
A relatively small elite of North Koreans use the other system , but this still denies them access to foreigners inside the country and to anyone outside .
Breakneck speed Newsnight had been invited to North Korea for the celebrations marking the birthday of the Great Leader , Kim Il - sung , the founder of the country .
Thanks to the Great Leader we are allowed to watch English and American films , like The Sound of Music
North Korean student
But the invite came with a catch - we were only allowed to film model farms , model villages , model schools and model homes .
We were instructed to film statues of the Great Leader , who although dead is still president , and portraits of his son the current Dear Leader , Kim Jong -il .
We were never allowed to film anything off the official programme or speak to anyone unscripted .
When we headed into the countryside we were driven at breakneck speed past towns and villages in various stages of dilapidation and not allowed to stop .
In Pyongyang anyone who came near to the camera who did not fit the image the North Koreans want to project - particularly anyone who appeared to be returning from one of the private markets which are an embarrassment to the Communist regime - was shooed away .
Meddling minders Initially I was simply irritated by our minders who seemed to have no concept of the expectations of a television film crew .
In pictures : Inside North Korea
But my irritation slowly gave way to a realisation that their expectations of us were because they simply did not know any different .
North Korean TV only broadcasts hagiographies of the two leaders and pictures celebrating the country 's army , model farms , model villages etc .
Our minders had probably never seen any other kinds of news item or documentary about their country or the rest of the world .
They were not allowed to , and they could not , because no - one has access to the internet in North Korea .
Instead , the North Koreans have a special internal intranet which I was shown at Pyongyang University .
A postgraduate metallurgy student who spoke good English explained that he could not compare his research with a fellow student in say , London or Los Angeles , because the system would not let him .
But , he added brightly , " the Dear leader has kindly put all we need to know on our intranet system " .
At the university 's foreign language department I asked the students how they had managed to learn such good English .
" Thanks to the Great Leader , " one young man replied , " we are allowed to watch English and American films , like The Sound of Music . "
' No secrets '
When asked which world leaders - other than the Dear Leader - he admired , he quickly answered " Stalin and Mao Zedong ! "
Please turn on JavaScript .

However , the students had not heard of Nelson Mandela .
No wonder the 3,000 or so North Koreans who escape this , the most isolated and secretive country in the world , and arrive in South Korea every year feel as though they have landed on another planet .
South Koreans can use their mobile phones to pay in the supermarket , there are more and faster broadband connections per person than in any other country in the world and , if you are feeling frivolous , there are cameras and touch screen key boards along the main shopping streets to allow you to send a photo to a friend !
All new arrivals from North Korea spend months in special government schools to learn how to cope with the 21st Century .
I met Sena , who arrived just five months ago , in a computer and mobile phone shop in Seoul .
" I love the internet , " she said to me , " because there are no secrets .
Everyone can know everything ! "
She loves her mobile phone , she said , because she no longer has to walk miles simply to give a message to a friend .
Her friend , Garam , is most struck by the food : " In South Korea , you can eat anything anytime you want .
In the North , you can never find anything you would want to eat . "
But many defectors from the North complain about how they are treated in the South .
" People look down on us here , " another recent arrival told me .
" They treat us like poor , badly educated cousins with funny accents .
It is hard for us to get work here . "
People in the North tell you that they long for the two countries to be united again .
" It has been 60 years since the country was divided by the civil war .
Unification is our dream " , a university student in Pyongyang told me .
" It must happen one day " .
A bit like the attitude of West Germans towards East Germans prior to unification , the South Koreans are not too keen of the thought of 23 million hungry and badly educated cousins pouring across the border .
And the sinking of the South Korean naval ship , the Cheonan , by North Korea has brought relations between the two enemy countries to one of the most dangerous points since the end of the war .
The chances of unification have never looked so remote .

A recent copyright takedown notice from the UK's BPI revealed that the music group has been demanding that Google take down links not just to precise URLs where music is hosted on cyberlockers , but rather more generally referencing the entire site .
Now it appears that IFPI , the BPI 's big brother , is trying a similar strategy , this time with The Pirate Bay .
The British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) is the UK ’s main recording industry trade body .
It represents many hundreds of companies but it ’s most well known members are Warner , EMI , Sony and Universal .
It is at the forefront of copyright enforcement and lobbying in Britain and was largely responsible for the dismantling of the famous OiNK BitTorrent tracker .
Yesterday Techdirt asked the question : Is BPI Trying To Setup Google For Copyright Infringement Lawsuit ?
The article centered around a June 11 , 2010 takedown notice sent to Google from the UK’s BPI .
Groups such as the BPI , IFPI and MPAA send these notices on a regular basis and in a normal set of circumstances they ’re so prevalent that they would hardly make news .
However , Techdirt noted an interesting angle to this particular takedown demand .
Rather than supplying very specific URLs where infringing material could be located as is the norm with these type of requests , the BPI provided whole site URLs such as http://megaupload.com, http://sendspace.com and http://hotfile.com.
“ My guess is that this is trying to set up Google , so that Google is officially ‘ on notice ’ that these nine sites host infringing content , and while Google will almost certainly take down the links to the specific files listed , it ’s quite likely that similar files will quickly be found elsewhere on those sites — and BPI may then try to claim that Google should automatically know how to block those other files , ” wrote Masnick .
Now , in a June 10 takedown request sent to Google , it seems the IFPI could be trying a similar tactic with the search giant , but being rather more clear about it , this time in connection with The Pirate Bay .
In a fairly lengthy preamble , the IFPI describes The Pirate Bay as “ an internet - based service that facilitates copyright infringement on a massive scale ” and one which provides access to “ several hundred thousand infringing content files , including movies , games and software as well as copyright sound recordings owned by IFPI . ”
It also describes the guilty verdict handed down to the four Pirate Bay individuals in their 2009 criminal trial and references legal action to have the site blocked in Denmark and Italy .
A huge list of specific URLs which link to torrents is attached to the request and Google is asked to remove these from their search results – but IFPI goes further .
In light of the serious violations of copyright facilitated by The Pirate Bay service , and in accordance with Google ’s policies ( see http://www.google.com/dmca.html andhttps://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=58&ctx=sibling) we are asking for your immediate assistance in removing from your index , or otherwise disabling access to via your search engine , URLs linking to the website for The Pirate Bay including but not limited to the URLs specified in the attachment to this notice .
[ emphasis ours ]
IFPI continues with :
In sending this letter we are seeking to ensure that infringing content is made inaccessible or removed from the Internet as quickly as possible through your cooperation .
However , please note that we do not admit that we or the IFPI Represented Companies are responsible for detecting infringing material and notifying you of it .
Could this be similar situation to the one Mike Masnick referred to in his BPI article , but this time laying the ground for The Pirate Bay ?
“ Part of the DMCA safe harbors is that you need to remove content if you have ‘ specific knowledge ’ of the content , ” he wrote .
“ This is at the center of the Google - Viacom lawsuit .
Google claims it needs to know the specific files that are infringing , while Viacom claims that once Google knows that ‘ content x on YouTube ’ is infringing , it should be required to find and block all such content x’s , even if Viacom has not informed Google where they are . ”
It remains to be seen how Google responds to this request but since attempts to take down
The Pirate Bay have been an almost complete failure , removing it from the world ’s most important search engine could be the next best step .

Did you know that you can quickly see or hide all the hidden files in a directory from any Mac Save window with a simple keystroke ?
This is very useful when you are saving a file to a directory that will appear as invisible , also known as a dotfile in OS X .
To toggle the visibility of otherwise invisible files in a dialog box of OS X , just hit Command + Shift +. ( yes , the period key , Command + Shift + Period )
This will instantly switch the display of hidden files in any Mac OS X save dialogue box to be either showing the hidden dotfile files , or hiding them , depending on the current setting .
This is really useful for saving dotfiles and seeing things like .htaccess files or a .ssh file in Mac OS X , since they do not display by default .
If you hit the Command + Shift + Period keystroke again you will toggle the hidden files to be invisible again .
If you want a more permanent solution so that you can always see the dot files and invisible files of OS X , check out our article to show hidden files on Mac OS X , which offers a defaults command string which will set the Mac to always see the hidden files no matter where you are in the file system , and no matter the app , even within the Finder .

British Petroleum ’s deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico is still gushing at least 5,000 barrels of crude oil per day , as it has for two weeks .
It could become the biggest oil spill in US history .
Along with killing fauna like pelicans and turtles , the oil will destroy the base of the gulf ’s food chain by killing the larvae and eggs of crabs , clams , oysters , shrimp and fish , devastating the nation ’s major source of seafood and one of the region ’s key sources of employment .
Like the Exxon Valdez disaster , the damage from this spill will last for decades .
Ad Policy
It is catastrophic , spectacular , heartbreaking — but the BP spill is merely an extreme version of the norm , in which accidents and pollution are routine .
In January a tanker collided with two barges at Port Arthur , Texas , dumping 450,000 gallons of oil into the gulf .
In Ecuador , Texaco leaked 19 billion gallons of toxic wastewater and 17 million gallons of crude oil in pristine forests .
Even on its very best day , our global petroleum economy is a series of violent , toxic horrors .
Drilling , shipping , refining and burning oil is killing the planet — at the local level through poisoned air and water , and globally by fueling climate change .
Politically the competition for oil breeds conflict and corruption , as it has in the Niger Delta .
The BP disaster , then , is a glimpse of the real price of fossil fuels , and it represents not just an ecological nightmare but a moral crisis — and an opportunity for all who care about the environment to regain the offensive , to put all politicians , including President Obama , on the spot and to demand that we move in a fundamentally new direction .
Will we , as a nation , continue to rely on coal mines that collapse , nuclear plants that leak deadly radiation and oil rigs that gush slicks twice the size of Delaware ?
Or will we make the fundamental change to an economy that uses less energy and develops clean ways to produce it ?
And if we choose the latter — no foregone conclusion in the face of calls to drill , baby , drill — how , practically , can we make the transformation happen ?
In the short term , there ’s the matter of accountability .
BP , of course , should pay for the cleanup , as well as for damages to the region ’s people and businesses .
But under current federal law BP ’s total liability is capped at just $ 75 million ; Democrats in the Senate are pushing legislation that would raise that cap retroactively to $ 10 billion .
The BP oil spill , along with the West Virginia mine collapse , are also stark reminders of the deadly consequences of deregulation .
Under the Bush administration the US Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) essentially functioned as an adjunct of the oil industry — many of its top regulators now work as industry lobbyists — gutting or stalling new safety regulations and failing to impose fines in the face of clear violations .
But even if MMS had acted with due diligence , the penalties it is able to impose are so tiny that corporate giants like BP , which made $ 14 billion last year , consider them fractional costs of doing business .
There are at least two Congressional inquiries into MMS ’s lapses , and beyond finger - pointing they should provide the basis for a total overhaul of the government ’s regulatory role .
Indeed , we need a moratorium on new offshore drilling — on this , at least , Obama should follow Governor Schwarzenegger ’s lead .
And in place of subsidies to oil , coal and nuclear power , we need to make an exponentially greater investment in promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy .
There are at least 35,000 wells and more than 7,000 oil platforms in the gulf — but not one offshore wind farm .
It is time to invert that ratio .
Democratic Senate and House leaders have agreed on a 300 percent increase in the oil excise tax , to 32 cents a barrel from 8 cents now .
The hike is as part of the tax and spending bill likely to be approved this week .
So you can expect gasoline prices to rise down the road .
The tax pays for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , which now totals about $ 1.6 billion .
The fund will likely be decimated by the economic damages arising from the BP oil spill .
The new rate would be effective in the first quarter that begins 60 days after the bill is enacted , which could mean this October .
It would last through the end of 2020 .
The tax increase , which was included as part of a broader package that also extends jobless benefits , would be effective through the end of 2020 .
Republicans will almost certainly oppose the move .
But given Democrats ’ overwhelming majority in both houses of Congress , the change will likely go through .
Ironically , some oil industry executives actually want a tax increase , hoping it will forestall efforts to raise the liability cap on companies responsible for offshore disasters .
As for gasoline prices , the recent 20 percent drop in crude oil provides a positive note for consumers near - term .
" We expect retail gasoline prices to fall even as Memorial Day approaches , " Tancred Lidderdale , a senior economist at the federal Energy Information Administration , told Dow Jones .

Purpose
Several studies have found an increased risk of myocardial infarction among depressed patients .
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) appear to lack the arrhythmic adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants , and are thought to inhibit platelet aggregation .
We examined whether use of different antidepressant classes is associated with a lower risk of first - time hospitalization for myocardial infarction , as compared with nonuse .
Methods
We identified 8887 cases of first - time hospitalization for myocardial infarction and 88,862 age - and sex- matched population - based controls during 1994 –2002 , using data from North Jutland County , Denmark .
Cases and controls were stratified according to history of cardiovascular disease .
All prescriptions for antidepressants before hospitalization for myocardial infarction were identified using a prescription database .
Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of myocardial infarction associated with antidepressant use , adjusted for possible confounding factors .
Results
In patients with a history of cardiovascular disease , we found indications of a lower risk of myocardial infarction among those who used SSRIs ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.85 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.62 to 1.16 ) , nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( adjusted OR = 0.83 ; 95 % CI : 0.50 to 1.38 ) , and other antidepressants ( adjusted OR = 0.55 ; 95 % CI : 0.31 to 0.97 ) .
There were no such associations among persons without a history of cardiovascular disease .
Conclusion
Antidepressant use may be associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for myocardial infarction among persons with a history of cardiovascular disease , although it remains uncertain whether there are differences by class of antidepressant .

Wie geht es weiter mit Genshin Impact ?
– Leaks und Gerüchte zu neuem Content
Genshin Impact ist erst seit einigen
Tagen und schon gibt es die ersten Infos dazu , wie es mit dem Spiel in Zukunft weitergehen soll .
According to IRS tax records examined by The Associated Press , the
Big 12 paid out between $ 8.7 million and $ 15.4 million per school in
2008 - 09 , with Kansas State getting the smallest payout and Oklahoma
the biggest .
The Big 12's television deal with Fox expires in 2012 ,
and a more lucrative contract with ESPN runs through the 2015 - 16
academic year .
Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe said no new TV deals have been
struck , but he has " extremely strong verification , based on our
analysis with our consultants and others , and media companies
themselves , that we are in a tremendous position to execute future
agreements that will put our member institutions on par with any in
the country . "
He did not provide any numbers during a conference
call with reporters .
" The Big 12 approached us asking if we would maintain our
current agreement through its term of 2015 - 16 , and we agreed , " said
Josh Krulewitz , vice president for communications for ESPN .
A Fox Sports
Net spokesman said that no new deal had been
reached , but there would be ongoing discussions .
The Big 12 has increased the financial reward for every one of
its members since it began play in 1996 .
It distributed $ 139
million to its members this past fiscal year , more than ever .
Texas , already the richest and most powerful of the Big 12
schools , is convinced it can make even more money in a 10 - team
league .
" The Big 12 [ television ] package is going to be every bit as
good as any other conference , " Texas athletic director DeLoss
Dodds said .
" We are in good shape on the television side . "
And by staying in the Big 12 , Texas can explore whether it
should start its own Longhorns TV network .
If it had moved to the
Pac - 10 , Texas would have had to surrender its media rights .
Texas women 's athletic director Chris Plonsky said the network ,
which would broadcast Texas sports and other university events ,
should bring in " millions " to the school .
Texas is n't the only Big 12 school looking
into whether it should start its own TV network .
Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione said Tuesday that the
Sooners also are interested in the possibility and already have
invested $ 3 million in a high - definition video facility on campus
but do not have a time frame for launching the operation .
" A channel takes some time to launch , takes some time to
develop , whether it's our conference or our own , " Castiglione
said .
" That 's everything from programming to getting penetration
into the markets , and so on . "
Castiglione said Oklahoma has consulted with Texas as both
schools examine the possibilities , but the two are not considering a
joint venture .
Texas agreed to stay in the Big 12 this week in part
after getting assurances that it retains local media rights ,
including the possibility of a Longhorns network .
" We have discussed the concept of a channel with them .
We're
not in business together , " Castiglione said .
" That 's not it at
all .
I do n't want to give you that impression .
" We 've been studying it .
They 've been studying it .
...
We'd
both like to be aggressive and that part of our DNA to be
aggressive . "
Such a channel would not prevent the creation of a conference
network .
Most football and men's basketball games could n't be shown live
on Oklahoma 's own channel because of national TV contracts
through the Big 12 .
But the channel could broadcast games in those
sports that are n't picked up , along with others from the school 's
21 sports .
Oklahoma State athletic director Mike Holder said his school
also looked into creating a network , but " it does n't look like it
would be a revenue generator for us .
It would be a capital loss . "
" Even if you 're the University of Texas and there are a lot of
people nationwide that follow that brand , it 's still tough to make
a go of it , " Holder said .
" If you 're Oklahoma State , obviously with a smaller enrollment ,
a smaller population base in the state , no big metropolitan areas ,
it would be very , very difficult to make a go of it .

Some of the league 's smaller schools are giving up cash for the
promise of keeping the league together and more money later .
Kansas , Kansas State , Baylor , Iowa State and Missouri -- which were
in danger of being left homeless if the conference dissolved --
agreed to give up their share in buyout penalties to be paid by
Nebraska and Colorado for leaving the league , Beebe said .
The idea is to have that money go to Texas , Texas A&M and
Oklahoma , the schools the Big 12 needed to stay to remain viable ,
to make up for the difference in revenue those three might have
made going elsewhere .
The amount of the penalties has not been disclosed , but Colorado
athletic director Mike Bohn confirmed that his school 's penalty for
leaving the Big 12 " could be " around $ 9 million .
" We 'll work with our new conference with some type of finance
agreement , " Bohn said .
" The Pac - 10 will not assist in any
contributions toward the buyout .
But they 've indicated a
willingness to help us finance the agreement [ to join ] . "
Late Tuesday , Missouri officials said they have not agreed to
give up their share of the buyout penalties .
" In no way do we expect to be hurt financially , " Missouri
chancellor Brady Deaton said .
State officials in Kansas were n't talking much Tuesday about the
concessions , referring questions to the Big 12 or saying that details
might take weeks to work out .
Several said Kansas and Kansas State
are likely to do significantly better financially in a slimmer Big
12 even with the concessions than they would be searching for new
leagues .
" You 're weighing your costs and your gains , " said former Lt .
Gov. Gary Sherrer , vice chairman of the Kansas Board of Regents ,
which oversees both Kansas and Kansas State .
He added : " One thing we know is that being in a premier
conference is not only important financially for the athletic
programs , but it really has a lot to do with the recruitment of
students , maintaining strong support from alums and donors . "
Big 12 assistant commissioner Bob Burda responded that the 10
schools will share " all withdrawal fees withheld from Colorado and
Nebraska , " calling the earlier talks about uneven distribution of
the penalty a " good - faith offer . "
Beebe insisted the Big 12's decision to stick together was about
more than money .
" A strong , strong consideration ... by the institutions to
remain is the association of these schools , the fact that college
athletics is very much a regional , regionally supported endeavor ,
and that it would be a great travesty for this part of this country
if it 's major institutions located with conferences that are n't in
this region , " Beebe said .
Holder said Pac-10
commissioner Larry Scott and deputy Kevin Weiberg extended an offer
to five schools that " was contingent on everyone agreeing to move .
You had to have unanimity .
" We never got together on a conference call , the five athletic
directors .
We never had a meeting anywhere .
We
never really had a chance to get to that point because by the time
the presentation had been made to the five schools , one of the
schools decided that they liked where they were a lot better , so
they opted to stay . "
Texas A& M 's flirtations with the Southeastern Conference had
threatened to pull apart a 100 - year rivalry with Texas .
" We committed to the Big 12 before we knew what Texas A&M was
going to do .
We are delighted Texas and Texas A&M will be in the
same conference , " Powers said .
One thing that still could fracture the conference is hurt
feelings .
Missouri officials had hoped for an invitation to the Big
Ten , and other less influential members might not appreciate the
top - down nature of the conference .
" We live in athletics , " Dodds said .
" We beat each other up on
Saturdays , we hug each other on Sunday . "
Beebe said there are no plans to expand the conference , leaving
the Big 12 with 10 teams to play a nine - game football schedule and
do away with the conference championship game .
And what about that conference name ?
Can a league with 10 teams
call itself the Big 12 ?
" We 'll consult the Big Ten on that , " Dodds said , with a nod to
a league that now has 12 teams .

Two of the eight experts who predicted that the currency would survive said it would do so only at the cost of seeing at least one of its members default on its sovereign debt .
Andrew Lilico , chief economist at think tank Policy Exchange , said there was " nearly zero chance " of the euro surviving with its current membership , adding : " Greece will certainly default on its debts , and it is an open question whether Greece will experience some form of revolution or coup – I 'd put the likelihood of that over the next five years as around one in four .

BP agreed today to set up a $ 20 billion escrow fund to pay damage claims resulting from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Less than 24 hours after President Obama told the nation he would make BP pay for all the damages it has caused , he brought the oil giant ’s top executives to the White House where they conceded to his demand that they pay billions into an independently administered escrow fund .
Among the company executives Obama had at the White House were Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg , CEO Tony Hayward and BP ’s U.S. boss Lamar McKay .
The independent fund will be led by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , who oversaw payments to families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
Feinberg has been the administration ’s point man for setting salary limits for executives of companies that received aid from a $ 700 billion government bailout fund .
The president summoned the executives to the White House less than 24 hours after he , in a nationally televised address , accused BP of recklessness and vowed to fight the spill “ with everything we ’ve got . ”
“ We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused , ” Obama declared in his Oval Office address .
He called the massive spill a “ siege ” on the people and the environment of the Gulf Coast and announced that former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus will develop a long - term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan – also to be funded by BP – in concert with local communities hit hard by the crisis .
The president ’s speech contrasted sharply with White House remarks made in the early days of the crisis when BP was described as an “ essential partner ” in plugging the oil gushing from the broken well a mile below the surface .
During his speech last night the president said BP has threatened a whole way of life and “ I refuse to let that happen . ”
Meanwhile , both the damages from the spill and the estimates of its size continue to grow .
Shortly before the president spoke , a government panel of scientists determined for the second time in three days that the well is leaking yet more oil than the higher estimates of just a few days earlier .
The new figures are 2.52 million gallons a day , bringing the total spilled so far to 116 million gallons , more than 11 times the size of the spill during the Exxon Valdez disaster .
Leo Gerard , president of the United Steelworkers union , said “ corporate greed ” was the explanation behind both the disaster itself and what the said was the “ lying afterwards . ”
He deplored how BP , after the deadly rig explosion , contended that the well was spewing only 1,000 gallons a day when , in fact , the government now says 1.2 million gallons a day have been flowing into the Gulf .
He said the company had a “ greed - based ” reason to deny access to its own video recording the spill because “ BP will be fined based on the number of barrels of oil its well disgorges into the Gulf . ”
BP was forced to begin releasing its live video stream of the spill only after a freedom of information suit and pressure from labor and community organizations and Congress itself .
“ Greed is one of the seven deadly sins , ” Gerard said , “ and when it afflicts corporate CEOs it is deadly to workers . ”
Some progressives were critical of the president ’s speech last night for not being specific enough , particularly when it came to putting pressure on the Senate regarding climate change legislation and for not setting a specific amount BP should pay into the independently administered damage claims fund .
Most progressive critics , however , cheered the announcement of the escrow fund when it was made today .
Unlike many who wanted more specifics on other issues , the Green Energy Reporter argued in an editorial today that , at least on the issue of climate change , “ this is how Obama governs effectively .
The speech was actually pure Obama and those who expected something else have n’t been paying attention to the way he governs .
Just as when the health bill passed , he has provided a general outline of what he wants and asked Congress to work out the details . ”
The Reporter article noted that the president pushed for higher fuel efficiency standards , which was controversial , at least up until the spill , and said Obama ’s mention of wind and solar - powered electricity “ probably refers to a Renewable Electricity Standard . ”
Establishment of such a standard has been an important issue for environmentalists .
The oil spill is continuing to increase the discomfort level of Republicans who are seen as big long - time defenders of the oil industry .
Politico noted today that “ Republicans are now struggling with how to show appropriate outrage at Big Oil while sticking to their long - standing pro-drilling , pro-oil - company policies . ”

The newly formed Cameron - Clegg coalition Government in the UK is facing its first threatened backbench rebellion , over a controversial plan to reduce the risk of it being voted out of office before the end of its planned five - year term .
As the new Conservative and Liberal Democrat Cabinet met for the first time today , some senior Tory and Labour MPs voiced concern over a proposal in the coalition agreement that dissolution would need to be approved by 55 % or more of MPs .
It would represent a radical shift away from the Commons tradition that a simple majority of one would be enough on a no confidence vote to force an unpopular government to resign .
The 55 % threshold means that Mr Cameron could survive at the head of a minority Conservative government even if the Lib Dems pulled out of the coalition deal .
It would need a significant rebellion by disaffected Tories joining force with all the opposition MPs to force him to call another election .
With 306 MPs – likely to be 307 after the delayed election in Thirsk and Malton on May 27 – the Conservatives have just over 47 % of MPs .
That means the combined weight of all the other parties could not reach the proposed 55 % threshold on their own .
Under the agreement thrashed out by the Conservatives and Lib Dems during several days of negotiations , legislation will be introduced to provide for fixed - term five - year parliaments , with the next general election due to be held on the first Thursday of May 2015 .
“ This legislation will also provide for dissolution if 55 % or more of the House votes in favour , ” the coalition agreement published yesterday said .
Many MPs question whether the coalition will last that long , despite the promises made by Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg that it is a long - term arrangement for a full parliamentary term .
Labour MPs are already alarmed by what they see as an attempt to change long - standing Commons rules in the new Government ’s favour .
They have been joined by several senior Conservatives on the libertarian wing of the party who are lobbying behind - the - scenes for the 55 % threshold to be removed before the legislation is introduced in the Commons .
The last time a government fell on a no confidence vote was in March 1979 , when the minority Labour administration led by James Callaghan was defeated by 311 votes to 310 .
The confidence vote followed the government ’s defeat in a referendum on devolution and the collapse of the Lib - Lab pact .
The subsequent general election was won by Margaret Thatcher , ushering in 18 years of unbroken Conservative rule .
The most famous confidence vote was in May 1940 , the so - called Norway debate , after a British debacle in the early years of the Second World War .
The Government ’s majority was cut from 231 to just 81 and prime minister Neville Chamberlain resigned , making way for Winston Churchill to lead the nation to eventual victory .
BUCHEON , South Korea 
The sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan , apparently by a North Korean torpedo , has provoked an international crisis that has embroiled big powers like the United States and China .
But here in South Korea , it has had another effect : buoying the country ’s once embattled conservative , pro-American president , Lee Myung - bak .
Soon after taking office two years ago , Mr. Lee appeared at risk of losing public support , as he faced mass demonstrations on the streets of Seoul against the import of United States beef .
Now , political experts are talking about the “ Cheonan effect , ” as polls show that more than half of expected voters approve of the president and his tougher line toward the North .
Nowhere is the current upwelling of popular support more apparent than in polling for the local elections to be held across South Korea on Wednesday .
Mr. Lee ’s Grand National
Party , whose candidates once faced tight races in some districts , now appears poised to sweep the most important races , including hotly contested mayoral elections in Seoul and the nearby port of Incheon .
Kim Moon - soo , the conservative governor of a province outside Seoul , just two weeks ago was in an uphill battle for re-election against a liberal opponent .
Now , polls show him with a comfortable 15 percentage point lead .

WASHINGTON , June 21 ( UPI ) --
The number of U.S. doctors refusing new Medicare patients has increased to record levels as low government payment rates force them out , statistics show .
USA Today notes the doctors ' exodus comes just six months before millions of baby boomers begin enrolling in the federal government healthcare program .

" Physicians are saying , ' I can't afford to keep losing money , ' " said Lori Heim , president of the American Academy of Family Physicians .
AAFP reports 13 percent of doctors who responded to a survey said they did n't participate in Medicare last year , up from 8 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2004 .
More doctors are refusing new Medicare patients in part because Congress failed to stop an automatic 21 percent cut in payments that took effect Friday , results of state and national surveys suggest .
The American Medical Association said 17 percent of more than 9,000 doctors surveyed said they restrict the number of Medicare cases , and the rate rises to 31 percent for primary care physicians .
Shortages of primary care physicians already alarm many experts , and the seniors group AARP says record numbers of doctors refusing Medicare will make matters worse .
The federal health insurance program paid on average 78 percent of what private insurers paid in 2008 .
Some doctors in states including New York and North Carolina have left Medicare .
In New York state , Leah McCormack , the president of the New York Medical Society , is among 1,100 doctors who have left the program .
" I 'm making a statement , " said McCormack , a New York City dermatologist .
" Many physicians are really being forced out of private practice . "
TOUGH new immigration rules for foreign students are hitting Australia 's economy , with more than 125,000 fewer international students expected to come in the next 12 months , costing more than 31,000 jobs nationwide .
Confidential Immigration Department figures showing new visa applications suggest that Victoria , the state that is most reliant on foreign students , will be hardest hit , with 40,250 fewer students in the next year .
Modelling by Access Economics suggests this will cost 10,100 jobs in Victoria and punch a $ 1.17 billion hole in the state 's export income , more than a quarter of the total value of the state 's biggest export industry .
The figures show a 47 per cent drop in the number of visa applications from India alone in the nine months to the end of March .
The Australian Council for Private Education and Training believes export income nationally will take a $ 3.6 billion hit from the fall in student numbers .
Corporate CEOs would have to appear in campaign ads they fund , under a political disclosure bill the House just passed by a narrow margin .
Democrats , hoping to rein in special - interest spending before November 's midterm elections , pushed the measure , which would impose broad new disclosure rules on political spending .
The bill , approved by a 219-206 vote , was opposed by Republicans who cast it as violating free - speech protections and filled with exemptions for powerful groups , such as the National Rifle Association and labor unions .
The measure was crafted by Democrats " to help their friends , while silencing their political opponents , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said during floor debate today .
But the bill 's chief architect , Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Md. , said the legislation would ensure " the voice of citizens is not drowned out by secret spending . "
The legislation was crafted in response to a January ruling by the Supreme Court that cleared the way for unlimited spending by corporations and unions on campaign ads that oppose or support candidates .
The bill would require that most groups running independent ads to disclose their top five donors .
Companies with government contracts worth more than $ 10 million , along with corporations receiving federal bailout money , would be barred from spending on such advertising .
The measure also bans companies with more than 20 % foreign ownership from funding independent political activity .
The bill faced opposition from groups on the left and right after its sponsors exempted the powerful gun owners ' and other large nonprofits from disclosure requirements as they worked to secure the support of more lawmakers .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also sharply criticized the bill Thursday , arguing that a last - minute provision provided special treatment for labor unions .
The measure 's prospects are uncertain in the Senate .
Sen. Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , the chamber 's top Republican , Thursday assailed the proposal as " protecting incumbent Democratic politicians . "
No vote has been scheduled yet in the Senate , despite Democrats ' hopes to pass the bill before lawmakers leave Washington for a July 4 break .
Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET : The bill also includes a provision pushed by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , that singles out oil giant BP , the firm at the center of the massive Gulf oil spill , and other companies with federal leases that allow them to drill in the Outer Contintental Shelf .
They would be barred from unlimited political spending .
It was included in the bill on a voice vote Thursday .
" Energy companies may be able to drill for oil in the Outer Continental Shelf , but my amendment will keep them from drilling for votes in the Capitol at the same time , " Kucinich said in a statement .
President Obama , who has made responding to the Supreme Court 's campaign - finance ruling a top priority , hailed the bill 's passage Thursday .
Here 's the full text of Obama 's statement :
I congratulate the House of Representatives on today 's passage of the DISCLOSE Act , a critical piece of legislation to control the flood of special interest money into our elections .
The DISCLOSE
Act would establish the strongest - ever disclosure requirements for election - related spending by special interests , including Wall Street and big oil companies , and it would restrict spending by foreign - controlled corporations .
It would give the American public the right to see exactly who is spending money in an attempt to influence campaigns for public office .
The House bill is not perfect – I would have preferred that it include no exemptions .
But it mandates unprecedented transparency in campaign spending , and it ensures that corporations who spend money on American elections are accountable first and foremost to the American people .
I urge the Senate to act swiftly on its version of the bill , and I look forward to working with both chambers on prompt enactment of final legislation .

Adobe has murdered Flash for 64 - bit Linux .
At least for the moment .
On Thursday , the company took the beta tag off the 32 - bit Flash Player 10.1 for Windows , Linux , and Mac , and it released a slew of security updates for versions 10.0.45.2 and earlier .
But at the same time , it posted a statement to the Adobe Labs page announcing the end of the Flash 10.1 for 64 - bit Linux beta .
However , the company says it intends to offer 64 - bit Linux support in a future release .
" The Flash Player 10.1 64 - bit Linux beta is closed , " the statement reads .
" We remain committed to delivering 64 - bit support in a future release of Flash Player .
No further information is available at this time .
Please feel free to continue your discussions on the Flash Player 10.1 desktop forums . "
Ah , but if you visit the desktop forums , you 're told not to discuss 64 - bit Linux Flash , and you 're pointed to the 64 - bit Linux forum .
And as a Slashdotter points out , the 64 - bit forum has been set to read - only .
" Like in a Kafka novel , " says another Slashdotter .
" I 'm not sure whether I should laugh or cry ... but it reminds me of reading The Trial . "
Meanwhile , others have no intention of crying .
" That 's one down , " reads the first comment , as Slahsdot points to the death of the 64 - bit Linux player .
" Now , get them to cancel flash on i386 Linux , then on MacOS , then Windows , and we 'll be all set . "
This does not appear to come from Steve Jobs .
Though it has closed the Flash 10.1 for 64 - bit Linux beta , Adobe tells us that it still intends to offer 64 - bit Linux support in a future version of the player .
" We remain committed to bringing native 64 - bit Flash Player for desktop operating systems , " the company says .
" We expect to provide native support for Windows , Macintosh , and Linux 64 - bit platforms in an upcoming major release of Flash Player . " ®
Speaking to a crowd in Grand Rapids , Michigan on Wednesday , former president George W. Bush told onlookers that his administration did in fact waterboard alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and suggested that his action saved American lives .
“ Yeah , we water - boarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , ” Bush said , according to a local newspaper .
“ I ’d do it again to save lives . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Bush ’s Department of Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel orally advised the CIA on July 26 , 2002 , “ that the use of waterboarding was ” legal , and put it into writing in August of that year .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in March , 2003 .
Two psychologists were paid to devise the waterboarding program , which “ fake ” drowned detainees in an effort to produce vital information .
The United States prosecuted Japanese soldiers for doing the same thing after World War II .
The two former military officers , both psychologists , were paid $ 1,000 a day by the Central Intelligence Agency to supervise the torture and waterboarding of US detainees , according to a report published late Thursday .
According to current and former government officials cited by ABC News , the CIA doled out responsibility for waterboarding to a private contractor , Mitchell Jessen and Associates .
Waterboarding of detainees was designed to be Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ safeÃ¢â‚
¬Â by the two men running the firm , Bruce Jessen and Jim Mitchell .
ADVERTISEMENT
But privately , military figures have disagreed .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They went to two individuals who had no interrogation experience , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â one military officer was quoted as saying at the time .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They are not interrogators .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Documents show the CIA later came to learn that the two psychologistsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ waterboarding Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ expertiseÃ¢â‚ ¬Â was probably Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ misrepresentedÃ¢â‚¬Â and thus , there was no reason to believe it was Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ medically safeÃ¢â‚ ¬Â or effective , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the authors write .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The waterboarding used on al Qaeda detainees was far more intense than the brief sessions used on U.S. military personnel in the training classes .

Should black people be cabinet ministers ?
If any national newspaper asked this question there would be protests .
Riots , even .
Yet today , in light of the David Laws exposé , the Sun saw fit to commission a YouGov survey in which it asked : " Should gay people be cabinet ministers ? "
But by asking , the tabloid has exposed something else , something important and something its editor and that of all rightwing newspapers should take note of .
There is now a yawning chasm between the press and the public in their attitudes towards homosexuality .
Of those asked , 95 % replied that they either did n't mind if a gay person was a cabinet minister , did n't know , or thought it was a good thing .
A measly 5 % thought gay people should not hold such office .
As pro-gay as the public have become , the conservative press has n't noticed .
When the Telegraph decided to publish details of David Laws 's expenses and – oops , we did n't mean to – reveal his sexuality in the process , they presumably did n't expect to provoke widespread sympathy for the minister .
Indeed , so much so , that in that same Sun survey today , 52 % of those polled thought that the Liberal Democrat should return to the cabinet .
Compare this reaction with that prompted by Jacqui Smith .
After her and her husband 's creative approach to expenses , voters in Redditch booted the former home secretary out of office last month .
The Sun 's own - goal statistics are clear : the public have n't gone soft on expenses , they 've gone liberal on homosexuality .
Indeed , in January , the British Social Attitudes survey found that 36 % believed homosexuality to be wrong , compared with 62 % in 1983 .
That is rapid , radical change – despite a media that continues to daub gay people with puerile innuendo , 1970s stereotypes , and outright lies .
But even when mainstream readers turn on the press en masse for such portrayals , their voices are muffled .
Jan Moir 's fact - free , hate - splattered column about Stephen Gately prompted more than 25,000 complaints , yet the Press Complaints Commission rejected claims that Moir had broken their code of conduct .
And the Daily Mail ?
It swaggered on with its queer - bashing ways .
Last Tuesday , Richard Littlejohn penned a column to rival Moir's .
Writing about a job advertised for an NHS hair - removal specialist to work with transgender people , Littlejohn opined that in order to do the job you would need a " strong stomach and a sense of humour " .
He continued in his famously sophisticated style : " Whatever next ?
Bikini waxes for bisexuals ? "
The comments underneath the online version read like a Guardian editorial : " The NHS was created to serve all equally , " wrote Joshua from Croydon .
" Silly , offensive , and uninformed , " was another verdict on the article .
Those who were offended may as well have broadcast their comments on Pluto for all the difference they made .
Three days later , London 's Evening Standard ran a staggeringly homophobic review of Sex and the City 2 .
Its film critic , Andrew O'Hagan , conflated the " ugly " , " greedy " and " imperialist " tendencies of the four female protagonists with their " gay cult of youth " , calling them " gay impersonators " .
This is a franchise loved largely by women and gay men .
The Evening Standard is read mostly by well - heeled metropolitans .
Thus , the chances of this review chiming with anyone who grabs it outside a tube station are as slim as Sarah Jessica Parker .
So when I wrote on Twitter this morning in reference to the Sun 's survey : " Should homophobes edit newspapers ? " scores of people repeated the Tweet in collective disgust at the paper .
But how loudly does the public have to shout : " We have no problem with homosexuality " for editors to hear ?
How many complaints does the PCC have to receive before columnists change accordingly ?
There is much talk of newspapers dying .
If they stand any chance of keeping the life - support machine on they had better start listening to their readers .
As to the wider international implications of the unfolding disaster , one analyst on the call summed up the feelings of many by asking whether the company had noticed a " tightening of the screws " .
Mr Hayward said BP was receiving support from all around the world .
Fears have been raised that some governments might take advantage of the company 's woes to push BP out of energy projects .
The Brazilian government was singled out for praise and the country 's oil majors were said to be interested in what BP had learned thus far from the Gulf of Mexico situation .
Israel ’s raid of a “ Freedom Flotilla ” of activists that ended with nine deaths brought a global firestorm of protest , dimmed the chances for a peace deal , and threatened Israel ’s relations with Turkey , its closest ally in the region .
Both sides immediately claimed the protection of international law , with Israel citing legal justification for effectively extending its naval blockade into international waters where the flotilla was heading for Gaza .
Yet for most Western governments , with the exception of the United States , the question is not so much the legality or illegality of Israel ’s action .
Rather , European countries from Germany to Britain are focusing on the broader legal context of Israel ’s blockade of the Gaza Strip and the suffering of civilians there .
Lists of items forbidden to enter under the blockade include everything from canned fruit and fishing rods to musical instruments , donkeys , and nutmeg .
A ban on concrete and iron , carried by the “ Freedom Flotilla , ” aims to stop the building of rocket - proof bunkers – but has hampered reconstruction in the wake of Israel ’s 2009 offensive to stop Hamas rocket fire .
IN PICTURES : The Gaza flotilla and the aftermath of the Israeli naval raid
Three reports last month assessed the damage a year after the offensive ended .
The United Nations Development Program said three - quarters of the damage “ remains unrepaired and unreconstructed . ”
The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted some 40 percent of Gazans lack adequate food , while American Near East Relief found 8 in 10 people need aid .
In addition , pools of untreated sewage have grown as large as 100 acres in recent months .
Why some say legality of flotilla attack is a moot point
Indeed , living conditions in Gaza are so bad that by some readings of international law , the legality of the flotilla attack is a moot point .
“ There is a clear link between conditions in Gaza and international law that is relevant this week , ” says Mark Ellis , executive director of the International Bar Association in London .
“ At the heart of humanitarian law , the laws of war , and human rights law is a need to ensure that civilians are protected and do not disproportionately suffer from the actions of a state .
“ Right now , every objective assessment is that Gazans are suffering .
The elephant in the room in flotilla - attack legal debates is the blockade .
The real need is a focus on the legality of the conditions of people in Gaza . ”
Israel : International law not mature enough to deal with Hamas threat
Israel sees it differently .
Its justification for the flotilla attack and its Gaza policy rests on two pillars : First , Israel maintains – in the face of intense international disagreement – that Palestinians are not unduly suffering in Gaza .
Second , it argues that international law is not mature enough to handle Israel ’s unique security problems ; Israel lives in a rough neighborhood with a threat from Hamas too severe for law professors to grasp , and it must rely on its own interpretation of international law .
Michael Oren , Israel ’s ambassador to the US , told Fox News that the flotilla raid was “ perfectly legal , perfectly humane , ” and that “ Israel acted in accord with international law ....
Any state has the right to protect itself , certainly from a terrorist threat such as Hamas , including on the open seas . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted on June 2 that Hamas continues to smuggle rockets and that “ there ’s no humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Each week an average of 10,000 tons of goods enter Gaza .
There ’s no shortage of food .
There ’s no shortage of medicine .
There ’s no shortage of other goods .
So our naval personnel had no choice but to board these vessels . ”
The World Food program has said that 400 trucks are needed in Gaza per day , or 2,800 per week , to meet basic nutritional needs .
According to Israeli data ( PDF ) , an average of 371 truckloads of food products were delivered per week in 2009 and 310 per week so far in 2010 .
Israel 's legal argument for flotilla raid
Confusion remains over whether Israel extended its naval blockade from 20 to 68 miles into the open sea – or whether Israel never extended but simply intercepted the ships on grounds they had intent to bust the blockade .
Israel claims its flotilla raid was legal under the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea .
Israel says the law entitles it to enforce a blockade , even in international waters .
Clause 67 of San Remo does allow interdiction of neutral ships in a war among states if , as the clause spells out , the ship is “ reasonably ” suspected of “ breaching a blockade . ”
Yet San Remo is not a consensus treaty or legally binding , according to the Red Cross ; moreover , it does n’t offer authority for extending military jurisdiction into open seas without a formal conflict .
But few legal experts agree that Israel can suspend the paramount UN Charter on the Law of the Sea to expand a blockade overnight or preemptively intercept ships .
Under the UN charter , vessels on the high seas are subject to the jurisdiction of the flag state of that vessel .
No one can board .
Exceptions include : a vessel that does n’t fly a flag , a vessel suspected of being pirated , or vessels suspected of violating international sanctions , such as North Korean ships thought to carry nuclear materials .
Even carrying weapons at sea does n’t violate international law .
That ’s why most international jurists say Israel cannot legally justify the boarding of a sovereign ship protected under the charter .
“ In legal terms , the Turkish ship [ the biggest in the aid flotilla ] was Turkish territory , ” argues former British Ambassador Craig Murray , a fellow at the University of Lancaster School of Law .
Marcelo Kohen , a law professor at Geneva ’s Graduate Institute of International Studies , agrees that the requirements needed to claim a San Remo justification were not complete .
“ Hamas is not a state , " he says .
" There is also at present a cease - fire on Gaza , " whereas San Remo is assumed to be relevant in a state of war , says Kohen .
" Under [ Israel 's ] logic one could maintain a maritime blockade unendingly , " he adds .
" It only requires one party to consider itself as being in a ‘ state of war . ’ ”
Gaza specialist Sara Roy at Harvard University , an author and frequent critic of Israeli policy , argues that legal questions can distort more basic issues : “ After its 2005 withdrawal from Gaza , Israel claims no longer to be an occupier .
It claims no responsibility , but acts with total control .
Meanwhile , the international community pays the bills and feeds the people . ”

How much will the new health care law cost ?
That was a matter of particular dispute during the debate of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act .
The bill 's authors monkeyed around with the numbers , delaying some benefits , creating new revenue raisers , and pushing off known , needed reforms , so that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) could come up with a score below the $ 900 billion target .
Only the most naïve failed to recognize that those numbers were meaningless :
Ultimately , they would have no relationship to how much the legislation would add to taxpayers ' burdens and bloat the federal budget .
CBO has since been revising its estimates upward : Another $ 115 billion for additional administrative costs associated with the new law .
In addition , Congress now struggles to pass a change to the Medicare reimbursement rates , which will cost $ 23 billion just to patch the problem over for two years .
Taxpayers must be warned that these are just the first of many upward revisions by CBO .
As Congressman Paul Ryan pointed out during the health care debate , the CBO score was based on ten years of increased taxes and Medicare cuts , and only six years of benefits .
Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz - Eakin just released his own analysis of the law and found that , far from reducing the deficit as the President and Congressional proponents promised , the law will add more than $ 500 billion to the deficit during the first ten years and another $ 1.4 trillion in the decade after that .
Yet the program 's cost for taxpayers are just a small part of the costs that will be borne by American citizens .
Speaker Pelosi explained that only when the bill passed would Americans know what 's in it , and she was right .
Since the bill became law it 's consequences for businesses and the medical system is becoming more obvious .
Several large companies reported that they would suffer multi-million dollar losses due to the law 's new taxes .
Companies are also noting the incentives created by the law to drop insurance coverage for their employees .
As Holtz - Eakin wrote : “ Caterpillar recently noted that it could save 70 percent on health care costs by dropping coverage and paying the penalties ; AT&T's $ 2.4 billion cost of coverage would drop to just $ 600 million for penalties . ”
Altogether , Holtz - Eakin estimates that as many as 35 million Americans could lose their employer - sponsored health insurance .
So much for being able to keep your insurance .
Americans are also learning how other provisions will drive up insurance costs .
This year , “ children ” up to the age of twenty - six will become eligible for their parents ' health insurance policy .
Analysts estimate that this change will increase the cost of all family policies by about one percent .
One percent itself is n't a big deal , but it 's a reminder of the relationship between mandated benefits and price .
The federal government will soon foist numerous new mandates upon insurance companies : free preventive care services , an end to benefit caps , limits on price differentials for those with pre-existing conditions , and many more to come .
Far from freebies , these are expensive benefits and their costs will be spread around the insured population , driving premium prices up .
The law also gives government new powers to dictate how much insurance companies operate .
As a result , insurance companies will have to find new ways to make ends meet , such as by reducing payments to doctors .
And those doctors will also find ways to trim back costs , by consolidating practices to reduce overhead and taking on fewer patients .
Americans need not wait for the federal law to fully take effect to understand what 's in store .
They can also look to Massachusetts , where a similar health care law is already in force .
Health care policy expert Grace Marie Turner recently reviewed the problems that plague Massachusetts .
Health care costs for a family of four in the Bay State are the highest in the nation , with per capita health care spending 27 % higher than the rest of the nation .
The increased demand for medical services has created a shortage of doctors , making it difficult to get an appointment and creating long wait times .
Ironically this has led to increased use of emergency rooms , a problem that greater insurance coverage was supposed to solve .
Insurance companies need to raise rates to cover additional expenses , but the Governor is threatening to cap rate hikes , which will leave private insurers operating at a loss .
How long is that sustainable ?
The debate about how much this new health care law will cost Americans is far from over .
Undoubtedly , as more of the law is implemented , we will learn more about its many hidden costs and consequences .
But one thing is for sure , this new law will cost more , and like much , much more than the law 's proponents promised .
ON March 19 , 1928 , eight years into the reign of constitutional Prohibition , Pierre S. du Pont wrote a letter to William P. Smith , one of the very few people he ever addressed by first name .
Du Pont was among the wealthiest men in the world , chairman of both his family ’s chemical colossus and the du Pont - controlled General Motors Corporation .
Smith worked for a less well - known enterprise that Pierre du Pont also dominated : the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment .
“ The object of the organization , ” du Pont told his friend Bill , “ is not merely the return of the use of alcoholic beverages in the United States . ”
He went on , “ Another important factor is the tremendous loss of revenue to our government through the Prohibition laws ”  the revenue once collected through taxes on liquor and beer .
With the end of Prohibition , he wrote , “ the revenue of the government would be increased sufficiently to warrant the abolition of the income tax and corporation tax . ”
For today ’s advocates of legalized , taxable marijuana  or new levies on , say , electricity use , baseball tickets or high - fructose corn syrup  it ’s an appealing model .
Some even believe that a tax on marijuana , which could be legalized by California voters this November , could lead to a reduction in the state ’s income taxes .
But the history of the intimate relationship between drinking and taxing suggests otherwise .
The link between the two is as old as the Republic ; Alexander Hamilton provoked the Whiskey Rebellion when he persuaded Congress in 1791 to enact the first federal tax on liquor to help pay down the national debt .
By 1910 , as anti-alcohol forces were making a significant impact on American politics , the federal government was annually drawing more than 70 percent of its domestic revenue from the bottle and the keg .
In those years before the advent of the income tax , only the tariff on foreign goods and materials provided a larger share .
“ After a while , the standard red , black , or white bowtie gets a little tired , ’’ said Franklin , whose style is best described as urban dandy , complete with flashy red argyle socks and perforated patent leather shoes .
“ We wanted a statement piece .
So we just started designing for ourselves first . ’’
With that long legacy in mind , designers Bennett and Franklin set out to subvert it .
They make their ties from denim , leather , or lace over silk .
Embellishments run the gamut from Swarovski crystals to studs , spikes , and brass skulls .
Several designs are named for a place or mood they evoke .
The Chelsea , made of raw denim and adorned with snaps and hand stitching , calls to mind the skinny jean set of downtown Manhattan .
The Vienna , rosewood silk with black lace and flecked with crystals , evokes the baroque aesthetic of the Austrian capital .
Primarily , bow ties have been a mainstay for beaming grooms , pimply prom dates , and tweedy academics .
The big bow had its share of fans , of course : Karl Marx , Albert Einstein , Frank Sinatra among them .
Liberace , Elton John , and Pee Wee Herman gave the staid neckpiece an infusion of eccentric kitsch .
But in the last few years , a raft of celebs ranging from soccer stud David Beckham to hip - hop heroes Pharrell Williams and Andre 3000 have tied one on .
Women , like Rihanna and Gwen Stefani , have sported them , too .
But they have n’t been cool for decades , maybe since Elvis wore one onstage at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami in 1960 .
Ironic , yes .
Winking , yes .
Hip , not so much .
Lately , bow ties have increasingly been the accessory of choice among hipsters and celebs , who for years have eschewed them at formal events like the Oscars , the Tonys , and the Metropolitan Museum of Art ’s Costume Institute Ball .
Though they ’ve been around for eons ( the bow tie is thought to have evolved from a scarf first worn back in the 17th century ) ,
“ We ’re at a point in the fashion cycle where gentlemen need more to express their style , ’’ said Bennett .
“ I ’ve always had a respect for accessories .
You ca n’t have an outfit that says who you are until you accessorize . ’’
That tie , called the Knight , is one of almost a dozen styles in a growing collection of unapologetically over - the - top bow ties that Bennett , 23 , and Bruce Franklin , 22 , his friend since middle school , have designed as the inaugural line for their label , Robot & Brucling .
It was the black leather bow tie hanging languidly around his neck .
A pinwheel of spikes adorned the center knot and studs dotted the corners .
On a recent afternoon , the most eye - catching element of Christopher Bennett ’s ensemble was n’t his leather motorcycle jacket , his silver David Yurman chain looped in a thick knot , or his electric orange Louis Vuitton high - top sneakers .
“ And then it got out of control , ’’ Bennett added .
Bennett , 23 , of Roxbury , and Franklin , 22 , of Mattapan , were working in sales and picking up modeling gigs .
Bennett acts , too .
Like many trying to break into the fashion industry , each got his start by designing T - shirts .
But when the two friends teamed up , they took their urban fashion inclinations on a Savile Row bender .
( Bennett describes his penchant for “ funky stuff ’’ while Franklin says he was always partial to “ churchy clothes . ’’)
They started with a few oversized , Mad Hatter - style bow ties they constructed with needle and thread .
“ We just used the kind of kits you get for $ 2.99 at CVS , ’’ Bennett explained with a laugh .
Bennett wore one on a visit to New York , where a few tourists snapped photos .
Others stopped him to ask where he got it .
Those curious few were Robot & Brucling ’s first clients .
From there , a steady buzz on fashion blogs has driven traffic to their site , www.robotandbrucling.com.
In January they went to Los Angeles with a briefcase packed with five ties .
Now the pieces are on display at fashion hotspot Magnet Showroom .
With no formal tailoring experience , Bennett and Franklin asked around at local fabric stores for recommendations on a mentor before they expanded their line .
Since March , they ’ve been apprenticing under Roger Hinds of Hinds Lines & Designs .
A graduate of the Fashion Industry of Technology and veteran of the industry , Hinds opened his pattern and production company in the South End 14 years ago .
Interns and apprentices from local art schools regularly hone their tailoring skills at his warehouse studio .
“ When I think of a product , I think of it having to move from concept to something that can be a business , ’’ Hinds said .
“ When I saw their ties , it was like a diamond in the rough .
I realized they were onto something . ’’
He ’s been teaching them intricacies of pattern - making and technical design , as well as well as guiding them on how to devise a business plan and figuring out cost structures .
Of course , creating buzz helps too .
At a party at the Greenhouse , a club in New York ’s Soho , reality TV star Tila Tequila spotted them and , as Bennett is fond of telling , exclaimed , “ Where ’s my tie ? ’’
By the end of the night , she was wearing one .
Her friend , Luke Destin , a celebrity fashion stylist whose clients have included Denzel Washington , Brooke Shields , and Natasha Bedingfield , tracked down Franklin and Bennett .
“ As soon as I saw the bow tie on Tila , I knew I loved their style .
It ’s just so unique — I ’ve never seen anything like it , ’’ Destin said on the phone from New York .
“ I told them that I normally do not wear bow ties .
I ’ve never been a fan , but for some reason , I could see myself wearing theirs . ’’
But like anything iconoclastic , their ties do n’t win everyone over .
They got mixed reviews when a reporter took samples to a few boutiques on Newbury Street .
“ They ’re a cute artisanal thing , but I do n’t see a ‘ wow ’ factor in them , ’’ said Ricardo Dallai , owner of the Newbury Street boutique , Riccardi .
“ There ’s not a lot of creativity behind it . ’’
Across the street at Marc Jacobs , Brent Timothy , a sales associate , was more taken on first sight .
When asked if he thought the ties had staying power and if he ’d wear one , he said “ Hell , yes !
Most definitely . ’’

A new stem cell treatment has saved the life of a young Australian with multiple sclerosis , but MS Australia still warns the procedure is " experimental " .
Ben Leahy , 20 , was diagnosed with MS .
The first sign something was wrong was when his leg became sore .
" My legs started going numb , probably from my feet up - one leg feet up and my other leg from the waist down , " the Canberra student told The 7.30 Report .
" It was probably over a week but I thought nothing was wrong .
Then in a week it probably got really bad . "
So bad that his family , including his step - father , GP Dr Don Curtotti , rushed Ben to emergency at Canberra Hospital , fearing a brain tumour .
For his mother Prue , the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was the least - worst outcome .
" I was relieved , believe it or not .
I am sorry if it sounds stupid but Don had warned me that he could have had a tumour , " she said .
" I would n't have thought MS in a boy because it 's extremely rare , and so I was relieved .
I just thought , ' I am not going to bury my son in the next six months from bone cancer ' . "
However , the family 's respite was short - lived .
MS - a disease that attacks the protective sheath around the nerves in the brain and spinal column - is generally a long - term degenerative process .
But the MS lesions in Ben 's brain were multiplying fast , dangerously pressing on areas that controlled his key bodily functions .
In a matter of weeks , Ben 's body started shutting down .
Rushed back to Canberra Hospital , consultant neurologist Dr Colin Andrews assessed Ben 's cascading physical impairments .
" The onset was over a matter of days , with weakness in his legs and then it progressed to weakness in his arms , " Dr Andrews said .
" Eventually his limbs were totally paralysed and he could n't breathe without assistance . "
In medical terms , Ben 's MS is known as " rapid onset " , but the swiftness with which the disease robbed the teenager of his core functions was shocking .
Dr Andrew 's assessment was blunt : " If he was n't in intensive care he would have died . "
Ben 's life was reduced to mere survival .
" I could n't talk or move , " Ben recalled .
" My eyes were opened but no - one would notice that I was still alive . "
The young man 's chances of survival were nil and Dr Andrews decided to attempt a treatment he had only heard about from overseas - an autologous stem cell transplant .
The experimental procedure had never successfully been performed in Australia and required the co-operation of the neurological department at Canberra Hospital .
The answer was no .
" I remember having to go and say [ to Ben 's parents ] , ' I 'm sorry , I can't get consensus from my colleagues , so what are we going to do now ? ' "
Dr Andrews said .
' A step in the dark '
But the Curtottis had undertaken their own research .
" We had read about a fellow in Athens who had [ this ] stem cell procedure done well .
I was all for it at this stage , it was all we had , " Ms Curtotti said .
Dr Andrews went back to the hospital and this time haematologist Dr Michael Pidcock said yes .
" It was a step in the dark , " Dr Pidcock recalled .
" We had n't done something like this before . "
The procedure is akin to rebooting the patient 's immune system .
The first step was to extract some of Ben 's stem cells from his bone marrow .
" Following some chemotherapy and administration of marrow stimulating drugs , the patient 's own bone marrow stem cells are harvested from the bloodstream on a machine during a narrow window of time , " Dr Pidcock explained .
Ben 's extracted stem cells were stored in Canberra Hospital 's liquid nitrogen tank , waiting for his body to be ready to receive them back .
For this to happen , Ben was subjected to a second dose of chemotherapy to knock out his immune system and remaining bone marrow cells .
" The marrow cells were reinfused a day afterwards and following a period of reduction of the cells in the blood due to chemotherapy , the normal marrow regenerated like seedlings in a garden and produced normal blood cells after about 14 days , " Dr Pidcock said .
Within weeks of the treatment , Ben was out of intensive care and walking - something he had not been able to do for more than nine months .
A year later , MRI scans of Ben 's brain revealed almost all the life - threatening lesions had disappeared .
The result is the best in Dr Andrews 's long career .
" It is the most dramatic change that I 've ever seen in someone with MS , " he said .
However , for the Curtottis , the decision to proceed with the radical stem cell treatment was taken against the advice of the respected MS Australia .
" [ They told us ] we do n't do it in Australia and probably wo n't for another 10 years because there is just not enough information around , " Ms Curtotti said .
MS Australia 's consultant , Professor Bill Carroll , justifies this precaution in the interests of protecting vulnerable patients against false hope .
" I must say however it still is very experimental , " Professor Carroll said .
" The case of Ben Leahy is terrific for Ben , but may not be translatable to all people with MS . "
For Ben the outcome is straightforward .
" I 've got a life again , " he said .
Canberra Hospital advises the treatment is not suitable for everybody with MS .
Should you have any questions in regard to this line of treatment , in the first instance please contact and discuss with your treating doctor .
Further information can be obtained from the ACT Health Department and MS Australia .

( CNN ) -- Israel acknowledged Sunday that it edited recordings of what it said were anti-Semitic and anti-American radio calls by pro-Palestinian activists who tried to run the Gaza blockade and that it could not identify the origin of the broadcasts .
The Israeli military released a 26 - second recording Friday night in which a warning call to a ship in the flotilla was met with the reply of " Shut up -- go back to Auschwitz . "
After another voice reports that the convoy has the permission of Palestinian officials to dock in Gaza , a third voice responds , " We are helping Arabs going against the U.S. Don't forget 9/11 , guys . "
But after the organizers of the aid convoy accused Israeli officials of manipulating the tapes , the Israel Defense Forces reported it had mistakenly identified one of the six ships in the activists ' " Freedom Flotilla " as the source of the broadcasts .
And it released a nearly six - minute recording of radio traffic that included those calls and several others , along with bursts of static and calls in other languages on the same channel .
" So to clarify :
The audio was edited down to cut out periods of silence over the radio as well as incomprehensible comments so as to make it easier for people to listen to the exchange , " the Israeli military said in a statement posted on its Web site .
And it added , " Due to an open channel , the specific ship or ships in the ' Freedom Flotilla ' responding to the Israeli Navy could not be identified . "
Israeli commandos intercepted the convoy at sea on May 31 and stormed the largest vessel , the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara , killing nine people aboard .
The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza , the Palestinian territory that has been blockaded by Israel since its takeover by the Islamic movement Hamas in 2007 , and the deadly raid sparked international condemnation .
Convoy organizers from Free Gaza said Israel " doctored " the recordings " in order to paint the flotilla passengers as anti-Semites . "
The group denied its vessels were the source of the broadcasts and said the Israeli accusations made " no more sense with the explanation . "
" All radio transmissions on the sea are heard by all captains , " the group said .
" Once again , Israel is caught in a lie trying to defend itself for the murder and mayhem it committed the morning of May 31 , 2010 . "
On the full recording , an Israeli warship hails one of the vessels in the flotilla to warn it was approaching a blockade zone and warned that " all necessary measures " would be taken to prevent it from docking in Gaza .
After three warnings , Free Gaza activist Huwaida Arraf replied that the blockade was a violation of international law and that the convoy was carrying only humanitarian aid .
" We do not carry anything that constitutes a threat to your armed forces , " she says on the recording .
Chancellor George Osborne increased VAT from 17.5 % to 20 % and cut welfare spending as he moved " decisively " to tackle Britain 's record debts .
Child benefit and public sector pay will be frozen and 25 % cut from public service spending - but alcohol , tobacco and fuel will escape tax hikes .
Unveiling his first Budget to MPs , Mr Osborne said " tough but fair " action on debt was " unavoidable " .
But Labour said it was " reckless " and would " throw people out of work " .
Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman said Mr Osborne 's budget would stifle growth and hit hardest " those who can least afford it " .
BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson described the financial statement as a " massive gamble economically and politically " .
It represents a major departure from the previous government 's economic policies , with business leaders saying they hoped it would be a " defining moment " in Britain 's economic recovery .
But trade unions have warned hundreds of thousand of jobs could be lost in the public services , potentially wrecking local economies and sparking a " double - dip " recession .
Setting out his plans in the Commons , Mr Osborne said " decisive " action was needed to prevent a " catastrophic collapse " in economic confidence but stressed it would be done in a " fair " way with the better - off shouldering most of the burden .
" Everyone will pay something but the people at the bottom of the income scale will pay proportionately less than those at the top .
This is a progressive Budget , " he said to jeers from Labour MPs .
UK households , on average , will be about £ 400 a year worse off , Budget documents suggest , with the poorest 10 % losing £ 200 and the richest £ 1,800 , although the poorest will be hit harder than most as a percentage of their income .
Mr Osborne vowed to balance Britain 's books within five years , with the bulk of the savings to come from cuts to benefits and public services rather than tax increases .
And he laid the blame for the state of the nation 's finances squarely at the door of the previous Labour government , saying : " The years of debt and spending make this unavoidable . "
' Biggest gamble '
Tax credits will be cut for families earning more than £ 40,000 a year - and there will be a two year pay freeze for public servants paid more than £ 21,000 .
Those earning less will get a £ 250 rise for two years .
Mr Osborne also announced real terms cuts across all government departments of 25 % over four years - except health and foreign aid which are ringfenced .
Will Hutton , of the Work Foundation , who is advising the government on public sector pay , described the cuts as " brutal " and questioned whether they were achievable without wrecking the coalition government .
He described Mr Osborne 's Budget as the " biggest gamble a post - war government has made " .
The full details of the impact of the cuts will not be revealed until Wednesday 20 October , when Mr Osborne publishes his spending review .
The VAT increase , which Mr Osborne said would raise £ 13bn a year , is to come into effect in January .
Calculate VAT rise
How much more do things cost following the VAT rise to 20 % ?
Price £
Capital gains tax will be increased to 28 % for top rate taxpayers - less than the 50 % some Conservative backbenchers had feared .
This will come into effect at midnight .
In other moves , Mr Osborne pledged to pledge to link pensions to earnings - or prices or 2.5 % if they are higher .
Housing benefit will be reformed with a maximum limit of £ 400 a week , in a package saving £ 1.8 bn a year by the end of the Parliament .
Other benefits to be cut include the health in pregnancy grant while the Sure Start maternity grant will be restricted to the first child only and lone parents will be expected to look for work when their youngest child goes to school .
Bank levy
But there will be an extra £ 150 a year for the poorest families , through changes to family tax credits .
The government is also to introduce a medical assessment for Disability Living Allowance from 2013 for new and existing claimants .
Mr Osborne also announced plans to help the low paid by raising personal tax allowances , taking an estimated 880,000 people out of the tax system and give millions of basic rate taxpayers a tax cut of £ 200 per year .
From January 2011 , the government will introduce a bank levy , which will apply to the balance sheets of UK banks and building societies and the UK operations of foreign banks .
Mr Osborne said the move would raise £ 2bn a year once it was fully in place .
Mr Osborne said public sector workers paid more than £ 21,000 a year would have a two year pay freeze with those paid less getting a flat pay increase of £ 250 for the next two years .
The plan is the first step towards a key Liberal Democrat coalition demand of taking all those earning less than £ 10,000 out of tax .
' Enterprise - led recovery '
The chancellor must find £ 3.5 bn to pay for the giveaway - which will be clawed back from top rate taxpayers - and Labour are likely to argue it is irresponsible in the current climate .
Mr Osborne also froze the Civil List payments to the Royal Family at £ 7.9 m a year and said in future years they would be subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office .
FROM BBC NEWS BLOGS
It is rare for a Budget to contain both an overhaul of the taxation system and a significant shift in the boundary between public sector and private sector Robert Peston , BBC Business Editor Robert Peston 's blog Nick Robinson 's blog Stephanie Flanders 's blog Analysis from around the web
He stressed that the pain of his austerity measures would be shared by " everyone " - but said all would share in the proceeds of the " enterprise - led recovery " that he promised would follow .
" Yes it is tough , but it also fair , " said Mr Osborne of his first budget , adding : " Everyone will share in the rewards when we succeed .
When we say that we are all in this together , we mean it . "
He said that the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) now estimated growth this year of 1.2 % and 2.3 % next year - compared to its previous forecasts of 1.3 % of 2.6 % .
Giving her response to Mr Osborne 's statement , acting Labour leader Harriet Harman poured scorn on the Liberal Democrats for providing a " fig leaf " for their Conservative coalition partners , arguing " this reckless Tory budget would not be possible without the Lib Dems " .
' Irresponsible '
" The Lib Dems leaders have sacrificed everything they ever stood for to ride in ministerial cars and to ride on the coat tails of the Tory government , " she added .
Plaid Cymru also lashed out at the Lib Dems , with Treasury spokesman Jonathan Edwards accusing party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of sitting next to Tory leader David Cameron " like a nodding dog , agreeing with every word as VAT was raised " .
Public sector workers will be shocked and angry that they are the innocent victims of job cuts and pay freezes Dave Prentis , Unison Lib Dem reaction to Budget
" They are running out of major election policies on which to U - turn , " he added .
The SNP welcomed some Budget measures , such as the freeze on whisky duty and the restoration of the pensions and earnings link , but branded planned spending cuts " irresponsible " .
In a message to Liberal Democrat supporters , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government had " no choice except to clear up the financial mess that Labour left us " .
And he said the Budget had taken " difficult decisions in an honest and fair way and with the clear stamp of Liberal Democrat values running through it , " citing examples including the restoration of the pensions and earnings link and the tax boost for the low paid .
' Breadline Britain '
Lib Dem Deputy Leader Simon Hughes , who has vowed to protect the party 's core values , issued a statement in support of Mr Clegg after the Budget statement , saying it would protect the " needy and vulnerable " .
So far only one Lib Dem MP , Bob Russell , has publicly suggested he might vote against the Budget , as the party had campaigned against VAT increases at the election because " the low paid disproportionately pay more " .
He told BBC Radio 5 Live : " I am not at all happy .
I need to discuss with colleagues how it is we have got into this situation . "
Dave Prentis , general secretary of public service union Unison accused the coalition government of " declaring war " on public services , saying the Budget would " raise the spectre of breadline Britain " in some parts of the country .
" Public sector workers will be shocked and angry that they are the innocent victims of job cuts and pay freezes " .
But CBI director general Richard Lambert called the Budget " the UK 's first important step on the long journey back to economic health " .
Green MP Caroline Lucas called Mr Osborne 's statement a " budget for pointless austerity " full of cuts that were " neither unavoidable or fair " .
But in an e-mail to Conservative supporters , Prime Minister David Cameron said : " In this emergency Budget I believe you have the measure of this government .
" Will it provoke debate ?
Certainly .
Will it cost our coalition some popularity ?
Possibly .
But is this the right thing to do - for the health of our economy , for the poorest in our society , for the future of our country ?
I passionately believe it is . "

Mass Effect 2 : A Narratological Review
Editorial - posted by DarkUnderlord on Fri 11 June 2010 , 04:47:57
Tags : Mass Effect 2
The story of Mass effect 2 is a titanic missed opportunity .
Many of its elements are superlative , and represent a great leap beyond its predecessor .
Yet these excellently crafted pieces must hang off a ramshackle and non-sensical story .
The result is a whole considerably less than the sum of its parts .
The good bits .
Who you talk to , and what they say
ME2 benefits from some exceptional writing .
Perhaps first place should go to the characters .
From Mordin , the “ Think too fast .
Must talk quickly .
Prepositions , conjunctions ?
Unnecessary ! ” Salarian professor , to Jack the profanity - spewing biotic psychopath , your team is well written and convincing .
This is partly due to some of the party having weird and wonderful species backgrounds ( e.g. Legion and the ‘ true Geth ’ , Thane , dualism and the Hanar ) , partly due to excellent voice acting , but mostly due to developing a consistent behaviour and attitudes for each : Miranda will have an undercurrent of over - critical bitchiness , Mordin will accept ‘ end- justifies - means ’ consequentialism , and so on .
Interestingly , the blandest characters are probably the two Cerberus operatives you get at the start : Jacob and Miranda , but even they have some interesting wrinkles , especially Miranda and ownership of her engineered qualities ( even if the writers can't work out if Jacob ' happens to be black ' or is an ebonics - spouting brotha , and Miranda gets some of the most arrant and gratuitous fanservice BioWare have ever managed with her skin - tight butt - hugging outfit and high - heels ) .
Helping this is that BioWare have abandoned the ‘ angel and demon on your shoulder ’ where one party member invariably offers a renegade opinion and the other a paragon one at a set episode .
Instead , there are certain ‘ nodes ’ which prompt ( in character ) interjections from your party .
Another boon is that each character has a ‘ module ’ of story ( generally consisting of recruitment and loyalty mission ) assigned to them .
These paint out a mini plot arc with these characters , and are done well .
They could be done better – there ’s very little sense of development after the character has answered their own inner demons , either in their behaviour or interactions with Shepard .
It would be nice if whether I support or criticise what Mordin did with the Genophage , or whether I egg on or dissuade Jack from killing a mentally disturbed biotic has more of an effect on the future than just flavour text .
Yet , so long as you ‘ succeed ’ in the loyalty mission , the party member gets ‘ loyalty ’ and treats you with positive regard , whether or not you were broadly supportive or sharply critical .
This quality does n’t just apply to the party .
Although like all RPGs that have the usual medley of random quest givers and villain - of - the - sidequest , ME2 manages to give little touches of flavour and flair : Aria , the woman in charge of the asteroid - cum - crime - den Omega , the Asari Matriarch who works behind a bar , and the maybe - reluctantly - maybe - not corrupt C - Sec captain on the Citadel would be three examples .
Even the previously insufferable Liara is much better on her second outing thanks to having picked up more than a few renegade points since you last met .
The dialogue is orders of magnitude better this time around as well .
BioWare still can’t do epic speeches or anything too heavily emotional without descending into navel - gazing and angst .
However , what it has managed is saleable , lively dialogue .
Take this from the last confrontation between Shepard and the Illusive Man ( skip to 3:30 ) .
It ai n’t perfect ( I would say responding to ‘ Do n’t turn your back on me ! ’ by silently walking away would have been cooler ) but the hardball back - and - forth is at least ‘ written prettily ’ .
A lower - key example :
See particularly the ending “ Thane ’s unusual for an assassin , he may surprise you . ”
“ Yeah , and he may not . ”
Little flourishes like these ( another one .
EDI : Are you okay , Mr. Moreau ?
Joker :
No , I 'm not .
But thanks for asking ) work well : you might criticise that this Joss Wheldon - esque neat and pithy dialogue is n’t how anyone talks in the real world , but that ’s just a criticism of the genre .
The dialogue in ME2 is , broadly , good for what it is .
Look , sound and feel
Another strength of ME2 is the setting and environments .
The art direction remains fairly uninspiring , but the work put into making the settings novel and interesting pays off .
I far prefer the sprawl and squalor of Omega to the spaceport generica of the citadel .
There are other neat settings too .
A maximum security prison in space is one good example , the migrant fleet another .
Again , there ’s a pleasing attention to detail and lots of attractive little touches .
One particular favourite was the shock jock on Omega who took glee in human suffering ( ‘ A message to those raiders who destroyed the colony : Well done ’ ) and all the incidental conversations on Illium of Asari gossiping about each other .
The ‘ jungle planet ’ , ‘ ice planet ’ etc. tropes are happily confined to the ( eminently skippable ) side - missions .
The cinematics of ME2 build on those of ME1 , and the results are really rather good .
Take the intro of the Normandy getting torn apart by the collector ship or ( even better ) the ending sequences .
In terms of competent action scenes , this is surely it .
This extends to the gestures and movement of the characters themselves .
Although some of the tools are overdone ( depth of field is used far too often , and some characters go up and down like yo - yos from their seats to portentously pace about some issue or another ) the effect is generally good .
Jack the crazy criminal paces around and leaps on stuff like a barely contained animal , whilst Mordin your techie or Garrus are far more restrained .
Here ’s an example from the Miranda romance .
Now the actual sex scene is n’t great ( and we do n’t even get any sideboob ) but the whole ‘ body check , word in your ear , wink ’ is both technically well - constructed and narratively plausible .
These somatic touches are widespread , and make a welcome change from the ‘ talking head plus canned gestures ’ common in RPGs .
On a similar note , environmental elements are also used well - one example is of Miranda 's loyalty mission where Miranda is coming to terms with her only childhood friend betraying her in an elevator .
Finally , it almost goes without saying that the voice work in this game is excellent : I can't think of a duff performance or a bad word to say about it , ditto the music .
Likewise , the UE3 graphics engine seems to be even better optimized from its first outing ( no more texture pop in I could tell ) and scaled nicely to my sub-par machine .
Choice and consequence
The final plus point for ME2 is C&C .
This does need one important caveat .
The much vaunted ‘ choices in ME1 affect ME2 ’ is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be .
The choices you make in ME1 are reflected and reported in ME2 , but they do n’t really do anything to affect the story .
You get emails from the various NPCs you helped out in ME1 , and sometimes you meet again some NPCs in person on the main hub planets , but they seldom do more than give you an update and perhaps a small side - quest .
There ’s no real affect on the main arc of the story , or indeed on any of the arcs of the story ( one small exception is that the main ME1 choices can determine whether you have the option of being a spectre again , which can be used a couple of times ) .
But what ME2 deserves great praise for is its ending , which is a veritable orgy of cascading C&C .
I ’d rather outcomes were more randomized and less dependent on a binary ‘ loyalty ’ variable , but the breadth and interdependency ( someone you got on well with and was uber loyal to you could die because of another disloyal party member ) is unprecedented in modern RPGs .
Would that it become more common .
So ME2 does a lot right : I ’ve lavished praise on the characters , how they talk and act , the settings in which they find themselves , and the general panache of the portrayal of both .
Yet I do n’t think ME2 actually does good in the story department .
What gives ?
The bad stuff
ME2 has three main flaws , in ascending order of foul - up : the protagonists , the antagonists , and the plot .
Given how central these things are to a good story , BioWare ’s failure to get them to work makes all their laudable efforts elsewhere squandered .
Cerberus : from attack dog to pussy cat .
Cerberus , in ME1 , was some sort of rogue black ops organization .
Although mostly consigned to forgettable side - quests , they seemed to play around with nasty things like AI , random alien life forms , and were n’t above renegade options like feeding marines to thresher maws or murdering high - ranking alliance personnel .
Forcing Shepard to work with these people would have been an interesting and fractious relationship .
Instead , BioWare chicken out and do their best to undo and appease what they did in the last outing .
Cerberus is n’t really that bad after all .
Miranda tells you all the nasty stuff was done by some rogue cells , and it turns out Jack ’s experience with Cerberus is , again , a rogue element which was acting outside their orders .
Further , it seems pretty out of character :
Why would n’t the ‘ ends justify means incarnate ’
Illusive man authorize some morally unpleasant experiments on children to give humanity a biotic edge ?
This post - hoc whitewashing turns Cerberus into a repeat performance of the Spectres as another ' limitless authority to stop evil by any means necessary ' instead of something really morally ambiguous .
The Collectors
The over - arching big bad of the Mass Effect Universe are the Reapers , some sort of artificial life that exterminates all sapient life every few thousand years .
However , the antagonists you fight are those trying to bring the Reapers back .
Saren and Co were n’t great antagonists in ME1 .
The Collectors in ME2 are even worse .
It ’s about the time you touch down on Horizon that the Collectors become another trash mob as opposed to an engaging antagonist .
There ’s loads of interesting riffs you could take with a bunch of interplanetary ex-prothean intergalactic abductors , yet none of these are taken .
The Collectors throw themselves against you in the same not very clever way everyone else does , and instead of using some sort of Protean discovery to better understand their MO and behaviour , you get the ‘ McGuffin and plot coupon ’ approach .
Most excreble is Harbinger , the Reaper who can possess Collectors into a miniboss - like Uber Collector , and spends his time taunting you with “ Your form is fragile !
The rules of the universe bend to me !
If I have to tear you apart , Shepard , I will ! ” etc. etc. Cthulu ?
Counter - strike Greifer , more like .
It ’s the plot , stupid
The real problem is the titanic catastrophe of the plot itself .
There are lots of little niggles with ME2 ( “ Why do I start looking like the terminator if I pick nasty options in dialogue ? ”
“ If the Collectors go through the O4 relay , why do n’t people notice this / why not just blockade it or blow up the relay ? ” ) but these are sufficiently minor that you assume some semi-plausible explanation can be fan - wanked in .
The main plot of ME2 careens from the simply sloppy ( reliance on plot coupons and McGuffins ) , to the irredeemably bad ‘ oh - god - I - hope - this - gets - retconned ’ stupid ( the human Reaper ) .
Let 's start at the start .
The high powered action scene of the Normandy getting destroyed and Shepard getting killed counts for remarkably little .
Shepard gets brought back to life , a carbon - copy Normandy is made for him to command , and no one seems to mind .
The real reason for this , of course , is some sequel slate - wiping .
Yet surely there could be a better way of doing this than blowing up the Normandy only to find out Cerberus made one earlier ?
That ’s fairly minor , but the continuity between that and the middle third of ‘ finding out how to get the Collector base and nuke them ’ is frankly poor .
Like how there ’s a special McGuffin to let you go through the special relay to the Collector base which is just lying around a derelict Reaper waiting to be picked up .
Or how you and your party get forced onto a shuttle to leave the Normandy to get you out of the way so the Collectors can abduct the crew ( and not , instead , simply destroy the Normandy and the only copy of the McGuffin you have ) .
This is compounded that all the neat character vignettes are poorly integrated by the rest of the story .
It just so happens that the characters have some long lying issue exposed just when they happen to be aboard , and for some reason they need your help even though it seems something that , often , the character could do themselves ( why could n't Thane the master assassin go it alone to rescue his son the newbie assassin ?
Why could n't Garrus the grizzled vigilante hunt down his betrayer on his own ) .
Jetting off half - way across the galaxy to lift emotional baggage for the party made them less a crack team of elite specialists and more an angst battalion .
These substories deserved a less contrived integration with the plot as a whole .
The ending deserves the most ire .
It turns out the grand plan of the Collectors is to turn the Humans into some ‘ genetic slurpee ’ .
This genetic slurpee is what Reapers are made out of , so there is a Human - Reaper larva in progress .
Such a trope is space fantasy red in tooth and claw ( we suck out the souls of an entire race to form this creature , MUHAHA ! ) , but it is just ridiculous and jars with the ' fairly commonsensical + plotinium ' sci-fi background .
The final straw is the big moral choice .
Paragons can blow up the Collector base , renegades can sterilize it and let it be used by Cerberus .
Unfortunately , the paragon choice makes no sense :
The only reason is just to pettily annoy the Illusive Man ( and , actually , why can't I just pick up the phone to Captain Anderson instead ? )
Destroying the resource not only deprives you of all that juicy Reaper tech and knowledge , but also destroys the remains of those killed by the Collectors and a site for their memorial .
The party members cite concerns like how it's a betrayal to use the base , but why ?
Surely , much like the experimental data at Auschwitz , at least using it allows the deaths of these people to be used for some greater good :
The paragon - esque ' this is the wrong way , I wo n't be ruled by fear , etc. ' are groping around without any real concern behind them besides BioWare 's desire .
What 's worse is this could be easily rectified .
Instead of making the Human Reaper the end - boss , make it the McGuffin : Because there are obvious ethical concerns with using ( or handing over to Cerberus ) a machine made directly from the slaughter of thousands .
We have built a consensus .
ME2 manages to be a bad story well written .
It improves on its predecessor ( and the genre as a whole ) in a number of ways .
The individual elements like the characters or the dialogue are truly superlative : Comparisons with ' leading lights ' like PS : T or VtmB would not be hyperbole .
ME2 could have been one of the best story - driven games ever .
But it 's not , and the reason why it 's not is because the actual story is a poorly hashed together pretence to hang off a number of set pieces against an unnecessarily uninspiring antagonist .
Given the mismatch by the painstaking efforts put into these elements and the shambolic nature of the central plot arc , I wonder if BioWare started making the central elements or party member plot arcs before really hammering out the central storyline .
Because of this , ME2 is an opportunity squandered .

The second man was cleared also
The consequences of the woman ’s false allegations emerged when the second man was cleared by a jury of rape in just 45 minutes after a £ 30,000 trial .
But despite being exposed in court as a serial liar the 21 - year - old woman will never be identified .
Legal sources also said it was unlikely she would be prosecuted for perjury .
Innocent medical student Olumide Fadayomi , 27 , was dragged through months of legal hell before the trial at Sheffield Crown Court saw his name cleared .
The jury were unaware of the woman ’s history when they found him not guilty .
Several broke down in tears after learning of the impact her deceit had on a previous man 18 months earlier .
They heard Judge Patrick Robertshaw attack the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing a case “ that should never have come to court ” simply because the woman demanded it .
Judge Robertshaw said : “ The evidence did not , and was never going to , prove rape .
The prime overriding consideration in the CPS ’s decision had been merely that the complainant wished the case to go ahead .
“ It was little short of a craven abdication of responsibility for making an independent and fair - minded assessment of the case .
It is quite astonishing these decisions are made by those who simply do not have experience of what happens in Crown Court because they never come into Crown Court .
They sit behind desks and make decisions that result in this sort of trial . ”
The judge revealed how 18 months earlier the same woman had made an allegation of rape against a young man who ended up committing suicide .
He said the case never reached court because it was “ lacking in credibility ” .
After being cleared last Friday Mr Fadayomi from Nigeria said yesterday : “ My life has been hell for the last seven months .
I thought about taking my own life .
I ’ve not been able to sleep properly since all this happened .
My life has just been on hold . ”
The court heard that after failing to have the first man she accused of rape brought to court , the woman set about framing Mr Fadayomi , a stranger she met and seduced in a nightclub .
She boasted to friends : “ I ’ve got evidence this time . ”
Mr Fadayomi told the jury the woman had agreed to consensual sex and he had no idea it was a rape trap .
Chinese researchers have successfully built an electromagnetic absorbing device for microwave frequencies .
The device , made of a thin cylinder comprising 60 concentric rings of metamaterials , is capable of absorbing microwave radiation , and has been compared to an astrophysical black hole ( which , in space , soaks up matter and light ) .
The research published June 3 in New Journal of Physics , shows how the researchers utilised the special properties of metamaterials , a class of ordered composites which can distort light and other waves .
Qiang Cheng and Tie Jun Cui of the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves at Southeast University in Nanjing , China , designed and fabricated their absorbing device , officially called an " omnidirectional electromagnetic absorber , " using 60 strips of circuit board arranged in concentric layers coated in copper .
Each layer is imprinted with alternating patterns , which resonate or do n't resonate in electromagnetic waves .
The designed device can trap and absorb electromagnetic waves coming from all directions by spiraling the radiation inwards and converting its energy into heat with an absorption rate of 99 % .
Hence it behaves like an " electromagnetic black body " or an " electromagnetic black hole . "
At the moment , the device only works with microwaves , but the researchers are planning to develop a black hole for visible light next .
The current results could find some applications in microwaves .
As the researchers write , " The good agreement between theoretical and experimental results has shown the excellent ability for metamaterials as the candidate to construct artificial omnidirectional absorbing devices .
" Since the lossy core can transfer electromagnetic energies into heat energies , we expect that the proposed device could find important applications in thermal emitting and electromagnetic - wave harvesting . "
* Looking at violations of several environmental laws
* BP shares move lower after confirmation of probe
* Not the first time BP has been in Justice Dept sights
( Adds BP comment , background on Exxon Valdez )
By Ed Stoddard
NEW ORLEANS , June 1 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government has launched a widely expected criminal and civil investigation into BP Plc's BP.L massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Tuesday , ratcheting up pressure on the beleaguered British oil company .
“ We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law , ” Holder told reporters after meeting with state and federal prosecutors in New Orleans .
“ Our environmental laws are very clear . ”
Federal agencies , including the FBI , are participating in the probe and “ if we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be forceful in our response , ” he said , adding that prosecutors had a “ sufficient basis ” to start a criminal probe .
“ BP will cooperate with any inquiry that the Department of Justice undertakes , just as we are doing in response to the other inquiries that already are ongoing , ” the company said in a statement .
During his first visit to the disaster site where he took a a tour of the spill , Holder said he saw “ oil for miles and miles , oil that we know has already affected plant and animal life along the coast . ”
Confirmation of the probe , which Holder said started “ some weeks ago , ” sent BP ’s shares down further after already getting hammered most of Tuesday .
The stock plunged 15 percent , or $ 6.43 , to close at $ 36.52 at the end regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
PRESSURE GROWING
Pressure has been building on BP and the Obama administration to stop the spewing oil , now in its 43rd day and no end in sight .
Legal experts had predicted that it was only a matter of time before a criminal and civil probe would begin .
Holder declined to say who were the targets of the investigation , but the Justice Department has already demanded that at least three companies involved in the spill , BP , Transocean Ltd RIGN.
SRIG.N and Halliburton Co HAL.N , preserve their records related to the accident .
The Justice Department will look for violations of the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold them liable for cleanup costs and reimbursement for government efforts [ n N01133693 ] .
Additionally , Holder said that “ nothing is off the table at this point ” with regard to the range of charges prosecutors could pursue , including traditional criminal charges if they find false statements were made .
“ As our review expands in the days ahead , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive , ” Holder told reporters .
“ We will not rest until justice is done . ”
However , he did acknowledge that the government ’s first priority was to stop the gushing well and clean up the oil .
The April 20 explosion aboard the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and injured 17 others .
Holder said that there could also be charges related to the “ untimely and tragic deaths of those 11 rig workers . ”
This is not the first time BP has been in the Justice Department ’s sights .
In October 2007 the company agreed to pay more than $ 370 million in fines and restitution to resolve several environmental and fraud allegations including criminal charges .
Those included a deadly explosion at a Texas refinery in 2005 , pipeline leaks at the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska in 2006 , and an attempt to corner the U.S. propane market in 2004 .
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill , Exxon Mobil in 1991 paid just over $ 1 billion in penalties and damages to settle criminal and civil charges brought by the Justice Department .
The U.S. government and State of Alaska sought another $ 92 million for restoration efforts from Exxon but they are still at loggerheads over it .

June 1 , 2010 -- Eva Golinger is known for her analysis in the service of Venezuela ’s peaceful revolution against the local oligarchy and the United States empire .
She is a noted author ( The Chavez Code : Cracking US intervention in Venezuela ) .
A dual citizen of the US and Venezuela , she is an attorney , and a personal friend of President Hugo Chavez .
She is a frequent contributor to left - wing media around the world , and is the English - language editor of the Venezuelan newspaper , Correo del Orinoco .
Golinger 's is a name synonymous with solidarity and anti-imperialism .
However , she recently inexplicably emerged as a supporter of the brutal , racist and genocidal government of Sri Lanka in a resoundingly irresponsible opinion piece , printed in the Spanish daily version of Correo del Orinoco on May 15 , and on May 21 , published by the Caracas city government newspaper , Ciudad CCS .
The piece was simply entitled , “ Sri Lanka ” .
I translate into English the major part of its content and analyse its errors with the goal of countering rumours she started , and in an effort to broaden support for a most maligned and oppressed ethnic group , the Tamils of Sri Lanka .
Golinger wrote :
[ In 2005 , presidential elections occurred for the first time [ in Sri Lanka ] in nearly 30 years .
Mahinda Rajapakse obtained victory with more than 58 % of votes .
He was reelected , January 2010 with more than 60 % ...
Rajapakse , Buddhist leader , is supported by a coalition of leftist parties , among them the Communist Party .
In May , 2009 , Rajapaske finalized the civil war , defeating the armed organization , LTTE [ Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam ] .
The LTTE had close ties with the CIA , and Washington negotiated an accord with them for establishing a military base in the country , if they obtained power .
Upon its defeat , the LTTE had established numerous organizations — fronts in different countries around the world , seeking to create `a government in exile´ and hoping to isolate the current government of Sri Lanka .
Last week , representatives of one of its fronts , Canadian Hart , passed through Venezuela ; it met with government functionaries seeking support in its intent to weaken the relationship between the two governments .
Instead of relating to the illegitimate opposition in Sri Lanka , Venezuela should shake the hand of an ally that also suffers imperial aggressions .
Golinger is factually incorrect
1. Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the first president elected .
In 1982 , J.R. Jayawardane won the first presidential election with 52.9 % of the vote .
The United National Party ( UNP ) — a pro-Western party of the comprador bourgeoisie — introduced a new constitution after its 1977 landslide victory .
Before then , the office of prime minister was the highest , and Jayawardane won that post and the UNP took 80 % of the parliamentary seats .
In 1978 , the new constitution renamed the country , “ Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka ” , but this had nothing to do with socialism .
The economy then , as now , was a capitalist one with a neoliberal orientation much like Chile after the 1973 coup d’etat .
According to the government department of census and statistics own figures ( 2006 - 07 ) , 82 % of the rural population lives under the national poverty line , while 65 % of the urban population is not able to meet the minimum level of per capita daily calorie and protein intake recommended by the government Medical Research Institute .
See official figures on the government website .
There can be nothing “ democratic socialist ” about discriminating against 15 % of its population , the Tamil ethnic group , making them unequal by legally restricting their rights and privileges .
Such has been the case since independence from Britain , in 1948 .
Even the US Library of Congress studied Tamils as an “ alienated ” group .
In 1988 , it published , Sri Lanka : a Country Study :
Moderate as well as militant Sri Lankan Tamils have regarded the policies of successive Sinhalese governments in Colombo with suspicion and resentment since at least the mid-1950s , when the " Sinhale Only " language policy was adopted …
2. Rajapaska won the fifth presidential elections and with the least majority of all presidents , 50.29 % , not 58 % as Golinger wrote ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_presidential_election,_2005.)
Rajapaska is the current leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) , founded in 1951 to represent the Sinhalese bourgeoisie .
In 1960 elections , Sirimavo R.D. Bandaranayake became the world ’s first woman prime minister .
The Moscow - oriented Communist Party and the Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samja Party ( LSSP ) formed the “ United Front ” coalition with the SLFP , in 1970 .
Now with three ministerial posts , the “ old left ” betrayed the young .
Many Sinhalese leftist youth became disillusioned with the “ old left ” and after the SLFP returned to government , they rebelled .
The so - called “ leftist ” government , with the CP and LSSP , branded this upsurge a “ Che Guevarist uprising ” and crushed the rebellion by killing about 20,000 mainly rural Sinhala youth , in 1971 .
The next year , these “ left ” parties drafted the first republican constitution in which Sinhalese was codified as the only official language and Buddhism the only the official religion — Tamils are not Buddhists .
This eroded whatever support the “ old left ” had among both leftist Sinhalese and all Tamils .
Since then neither the CP nor the LSSP has managed to get a single seat in the parliament independently .
They are always with the capitalist party , SLFP .
3. Rajapaska won the January 2010 elections with 57.88 % , not 60 % , over his former chief general , Sarath Fonseka , who was in charge of liquidating the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
Fonseka ’s party , the New Democratic Front , received 40.15 % of the vote .
In desperation , a few Tamils voted for Fonseka knowing that he was the main army force in carrying out the president ’s orders in liquidating the LTTE , and massacring tens of thousands of Tamil civilians .
The one difference between the two war criminals was that Fonseka later promised that he would release the rest of the interned Tamils and return their possessions and land .
Tamils are crushed for now and resort to seeking a bit of breathing space .
( See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_People%27s_Freedom_Alliance.)
The egomaniacal president was not satisfied with just defeating his former general in the ballot box , he had him arrested and beaten , on February 7 , 2010 , shortly after the elections , and charged him with plotting a coup , which Fonseka denies .
A purge of scores of top military officers has occurred ; a dozen or more Sinhalese and Tamil journalists have been arrested .
In the four years of Rajapakse ’s rule , at least 23 journalists critical of his regime have been murdered : see http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/03/attorney-generals-words-about.html and www.jdsrilanka.blogspot.com .
4 . “ The LTTE had close ties with the CIA , and Washington negotiated an accord with them for establishing a military base in the country … ” .
That is an outrageous and unsubstantiated allegation .
In my month - long research last autumn , I found nothing to indicate Golinger ’s unsupported claim .
Looking up in Google for “ LTTE and CIA ” , nothing is found .
When searching for LTTE and CIA and LTTE ties to CIA without quotation marks , nothing exists that binds them .
I looked up some 200 hits and only found reference to the Golinger claim , and this was cited by a most sceptical Patrick J. O´Donoghue , news editor for the English - language website VHeadline.com , in a May 23 commentary .
We have no way of knowing if the LTTE even met with the CIA , but in war most anything is possible .
What we can know is that the US , and its CIA and Pentagon , have long supported the genocidal Sinhalese governments , and most certainly that of Rajapaske , and it placed the LTTE on its “ Foreign Terrorist Organizations ” hit list in 1997 .
I will delve into this further on .
5 . Golinger ’s claim that Canadian Hart is a front for the LTTE is denied by several solidarity groups in Canada who know that organisation for its humanitarian work .
See their perspective , “ Venezuela : Eva Golinger ’s misinformation endangers exiled Tamils ’ fight for freedom ” at http://vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=92565.
6. Golinger depicts the Sri Lankan capitalist and genocidal government as an “ ally ” of Venezuela , one that she recommends her revolutionary government to “ shake the hand of an ally that also suffers imperial aggression ” .
This boggles the mind , or “ beggars belief ” , as O’Donoghue wrote .
Instead of opposing the Yankee empire , her position is allied with the imperialist United States and its allies Zionist Israel , the United Kingdom and other former European colonialists , as well as the emerging superpower and worker - exploiter China .
( See my pieces in Counterpunch : “ ALBA Let Down Sri Lanka Tamils ” , “ Equal Rights or Self - Determination ” and “ The Terrorists : International support for Sri Lanka racist discrimination ” , November 16 , 20 , 25 , 2009 .

There is not a shred of evidence that the United States acts against Sri Lanka governments , on the contrary .
US supports Sri Lanka ’s genocide
The Indian Ocean is a vital waterway where half the world ’s containerised cargo passes through .
Its waters carry heavy traffic in petroleum products .
Sri Lanka ’s cooperation is vital to the US empire ’s global interests .
A separate Tamil state would complicate cooperation requirements .
The United States has been arming and financing Sri Lanka for most of the civil war period ( see www.cdi.org/PDFs/CSBillCharts.pdf.)
From at least the 1990s , the US has provided military training , financing , logistic supplies and weapons sales worth millions annually .
A Voice of America installation was set up in the northwestern part of the country .
The United States government praised Rajapaksa for restarting the war in July 2006 , and officially ending the ceasefire in 2008 .
The US embassy in Colombo issued this statement : “ The United States does not advocate that the Government of Sri Lanka negotiate with the LTTE … ” ( see http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=11769).
On May 26 , 2002 , the Colombo English - language Sunday Times wrote about a joint military pact between Sri Lanka and the US :
The Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement [ ACSA ] … will enable the United States to utilise Sri Lanka 's ports , airports and air space .
As a prelude to the signing of the agreement scheduled for July , this year , United States Naval ships have been calling at the Colombo Port for bunkering as well as to enable sailors to go on shore leave .
In return for the facilities offered , Sri Lanka is to receive military assistance from the United States including increased training facilities and equipment .
The training , which will encompass joint exercises with United States Armed Forces , will focus on counter terrorism and related activity .
The agreement will be worked out on the basis of the use of Sri Lanka 's ports , airports , and air space to be considered hire - charges that will be converted for military hardware .
US Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca was the key liaison person with the Sri Lankan government .
[ Rocca had been a CIA officer before joining the state department . ]
( See www.colombopage.com/archive_07/March5132506JV.html.)
The ACSA agreement was not finally signed until Rajapaksa came to power .
It was US citizen Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , secretary to the defence minister and brother to President Rajapaksa , who signed the agreement , on March 5 , 2007 .
( Their younger brother , also a minister , is a US citizen as well . )
George W. Bush was especially glad for Sri Lanka ’s state terrorism .
In 2006 , he encouraged the government to resume the civil war , which Bush financed with US $ 2.9 million .
The Pentagon provided counter - insurgency training , maritime radar , patrols of US warships and aircraft .
This was a continuation of “ Operation Balanced Style ” , which has used US Special Forces instructors since 1996 .
At the end of Bush ’s first term , the US was forced to cut back on aid given that it was bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq .
That , coupled with critical public opinion , organised by the Tamil diaspora , of state terrorism and systematic discrimination of Tamils , prompted US Congress to make noises about abuses of human rights by not only LTTE but possibly by paramilitary forces linked to the Sri Lankan .
government .
Thousands of Tamils blocked highways in Canada , camped outside British parliament for months , some committed suicide in front of government offices , while Indian Tamils conducted paralysing strikes .
Nevertheless , in 2008 , the US granted $ 1.45 million in military financing and training to the Sri Lanka government out of a total of $ 7.4 million in total aid .
The US made noises about a “ humanitarian crisis ” when the Sri Lankan army was about to finish the war but it never took affirmative action to bring the war to an end nor to condemn the army or government .
Even after leading international observers , and some mass media , especially in the UK and France , began to expose the Sri Lankan government ’s and the army ’s systematic atrocities against Tamil civilians and captured LTTE soldiers , the US continued to back the Sri Lankan government , in contradiction to Eva Golinger ’s account .
In mid-April , 2010 , US and Sri Lankan military forces conducted military exercises in eastern seas ( Trincomalee ) for the first time in 25 years .
Said Lt Col.
Larry Smith , the US defence attache : “ The joint exercise helped members from our two militaries to exchange best practices on how to address complex humanitarian challenges . ”
He added : “ The US and Sri Lanka have a long tradition of cooperation .
We hope this partnership can be expanded . ”
( See http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/04/us-sri-lankan-militaries-in-joint.html.)
John Pilger compares Sri Lanka ’s genocide to Israel
“ The Sri Lankan government has learned an old lesson from , I suspect , a modern master : Israel .
In order to conduct a slaughter , you ensure the pornography is unseen , illicit at best .
You ban foreigners and their cameras from Tamil towns like Mulliavaikal , which was bombarded recently by the Sri Lankan army , and you lie that the 75 people killed in the hospital were blown up quite willfully by a Tamil suicide bomber ” ( “ Distant Voices , Desperate Lives ” , New Statesman , May 13 , 2009 . )
When the US does not want to be seen on the frontlines in a war , it sends in surrogates , and Israel is its main partner in this war crime .
Israel was officially re-awarded diplomatic relations , in May 2000 ( www.dailymailnews.com/dmsp0204/dm44.html), after Sri Lanka had severed them in 1970 , in protest at Israel ’s continued illegal expansion into Palestinian territory .
Nevertheless , Israel continued to operate inside Sri Lanka out of a special interests office set up in the US embassy .
Under the table , Sri Lanka ’s successive regimes embraced Israel ’s military advisors , a special commando unit in the police and Mossad counter - intelligence agents — who sought to drive a wedge between Muslims and Tamils .
Israel sent Sri Lanka16 of its supersonic Kfir fighter jets , some Dvora fast naval attack craft , and electronic and imagery surveillance equipment , plus advisors and technicians .
Israel personnel took part in military attacks on Tamil units , and its pilots flew attack aircraft .
Tigers shot down one Kfir .
Just before the end of the war , Prime Minister Wickremanayake was in Israel to make bigger deals with Israeli arms supplies .
( See http://niqnaq.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/wayne-madsen-on-israel-and-sri-lanka/ and http://adamite.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/sri-lanka-israels-dirty-secrets/.]
Sri Lankan government war crimes
Golinger even ignores ample evidence of extreme war crimes committed by her choice for president , Mahinda Rajapakse , against the minority Tamils .
Tamils have a righteous claim for liberation because of being subject to systematic discrimination , oppression and genocide .
( Ibid : “ Equal Rights or Self - Determination ” . )
Sri Lanka ’s first president , J.R. Jayewardene , expressed the essence of this genocide to the Daily Telegraph , on July 11 , 1983 : “ Really if I starve the Tamils out , the Sinhala people will be happy . ”
In May 2009 , Rajapakse had all the civilians who survived his gunfire placed into concentration camps , which he called “ welfare villages ” , much like those the Yankees concocted in Vietnam .
In violation of United Nations ’ international rules , between 280,000 to 500,000 people were forcibly interned .
One year later , 100,000 remain .
Only 2 million Sri Lankan Tamils remain in the country .
Nearly 1 million have fled in the past three decades .
Even the United States ’ choice for secretary - general of the UN , Ban Ki-moon , was displeased with these camps when he made a brief visit to one shortly after the war ’s end .
“ I have travelled around the world and visited similar places , but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen …
I sympathise fully with all of the displaced persons . ”
Several internationally respected organisations concerned about war crimes , and a few mass media journalists , have conducted interviews with internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) , taken or viewed photographs , videos , satellite images — taken surreptitiously during the war — and have read electronic communications and documents from many sources .
Some observers have been able to visit a camp or two .
On May 17 , one of those organisations , the International Crisis Group , released its report , War Crimes in Sri Lanka .
I cite from it :
The Sri Lanka security forces and the LTTE repeatedly violated international humanitarian law during the last five months of their 30 - year civil war …from January 2009 to the government ’s declaration of victory in May [ violations worsened ] .
Evidence gathered by the International Crisis Group suggests that these months saw tens of thousands of Tamil civilian men , women , children and elderly killed , countless more wounded , and hundreds of thousands deprived of adequate food and medical care , resulting in more deaths .
This evidence also provides reasonable grounds to believe the Sri Lanka security forces committed war crimes with top government and military leaders potentially responsible .
Here is a revealing example of this evidence .
On August 25 , 2009 , Channel 4 News ( UK ) broadcast raw footage , one - minute long , showing Sri Lankan government soldiers casually executing eight bound and blindfolded , naked Tamil men , believed to be LTTE combatants .
This is a war crime according to all international agreements .
Rajapaska ’s government denied the authenticity of the photos , apparently taken by a Sri Lankan soldier and provided to Channel 4 through the exiled group of Sinhalese and Tamil journalists , Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka .
But internationally renowned forensic experts have validated its authenticity .
[ See http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2009/12/sri-lankan-execution-video-not-fake.html, http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/01/experts-strongly-suggest-that-video-is.html and http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/sri+lanka+option/3652687.]
In a recent Channel 4 News broadcast by Jonathan Miller , two eyewitnesses spoke of systematic murder of all LTTE fighters caught or surrendered .
One witness is a senior army commander : “ Definitely , the order would have been to kill everybody and finish them off . ”
A frontline Sri Lankan soldier told Miller : “ Yes , our commander ordered us to kill everyone .
We killed everyone . ”
Even the head general in charge of defeating the LTTE , General Fonseka , spoke of having orders from the defence secretary to kill leaders without taking prisoners — “ all LTTE leaders must be killed ” ( see http://www.defenceforum.in/forum/showthread.php/7399-Lanka-Army-killed-surrendering-LTTE-militants-Ex-General).
Returning to the International Crisis Group war crimes report :
Starting in late January [ 2009 ] , the government and security forces encouraged hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into ever smaller government - declared No Fire Zones ( NFZs ) and then subjected them to repeated and increasingly intense artillery and mortar barrages and other fire .
This continued through May despite the government and security forces knowing the size and location of the civilian population and scale of civilian casualties .
The security forces shelled hospitals and makeshift medical centres — many overflowing with the wounded and sick — on multiple occasions even though they knew of their precise locations and functions .
During these incidents , medical staff , the United Nations , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) and others continually informed the government and security forces of the shelling , yet they continued to strike medical facilities through May …
Among the charges that must be investigated , wrote the ICG , is “ the recruitment of children by the LTTE and the execution by the security forces of those who had laid down their arms and were trying to surrender . ”
Shortly after this report , Amnesty International released its report of torture in 111 countries .
Among those Amnesty International condemns for the “ politicization of justice ” is Sri Lanka ’s government .
It also criticizes the UN “ for its failure to intervene …
By the end of the year , despite further evidence of war crimes and other abuses , no - one had been brought to justice ” .
Amnesty ’s secretary general Claudio Cordone said that “ one would be hard pressed to imagine a more complete failure to hold to account those who abuse human rights ” .
( See http://jdsrilanka.blogspot.com/2010/05/amnestys-report-condemns-politicisation.html,
http://thereport.amnesty.org/regions/asia-pacific and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9vb-ORJCgg.)
Some leaders of the Latin American ALBA countries may be under the impression that when Westerners protest about human rights abuse that this reflects the double - speak language of white imperialism , or NGO imperialists .
This is sometimes the case .
But it is definitely not so with Sri Lanka .
None of the Western governments on the UN Human Rights Council ( HRC ) wished to condemn Sri Lanka .
They only condemned the LTTE and simply asked Sri Lanka to look into its own behaviour during the war .
Do not take my word or those of Amnesty International or the International Crisis Group for this assessment alone but look at the conclusions drawn by internationally renowned figures with impeccable solidarity credentials , such as Francois Houtart , who , among other positions , is an honorary professor at the University of Havana .
He chaired an 11 - judge panel looking into war crimes charges against Sri Lanka ’s government and army — the Permanent People ’s Tribunal on Sri Lanka ( PPT ) , held in Dublin in January .
Among the many supporters of the panel and their conclusions is Miguel D´Escoto , senior advisor to Nicaragua ’s president Daniel Ortega .
Ironically , Nicaragua is one of the ALBA countries that praised the Sri Lanka government and voted for their resolution at the HRC .
The PPT ’s conclusions approximate those allegations made by the above - mentioned organisations : Sri Lanka committed “ war crimes ” and “ crimes against humanity ” .
These conclusions are found on pages 14 - 15 of the 50 - page verdict :
Summing up the facts established before this Tribunal by reports from NGOs , victims ’ testimony , eye - witnesses accounts , expert testimony and journalistic reports , we are able to distinguish three different kinds of human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan Government from 2002 ... to the present : • Forced “ disappearances ” of targeted individuals from the Tamil population ; • Crimes committed in the re-starting of the war ( 2006 - 2009 ) , particularly during the last months of the war :
• Bombing civilian objectives like hospitals , schools and other non-military targets ;
• Bombing government - proclaimed ‘ safety zones ’ or ‘ no fire zones ’ ;
• Withholding of food , water , and health facilities in war zones ;
• Use of heavy weaponry , banned weapons and air - raids ;
• Using food and medicine as a weapon of war ;
• The mistreatment , torture and execution of captured or surrendered LTTE combatants , officials and supporters ;
• Torture ;
• Rape and sexual violence against women ;
• Deportations and forcible transfer of individuals and families ;
• Desecrating the dead ; • Human rights violations in the IDP camps during and after the end of the war :
• Shooting of Tamil citizens and LTTE supporters ;
• Forced disappearances ;
• Rape ;
• Malnutrition ; and
• Lack of medical supplies

Conclusion
I urge ALBA members of the Human Rights Council — Cuba , Bolivia and Nicaragua — along with their brothers and sisters in Venezuela to recognise an error made when they promulgated Sri Lanka ’s own resolution before the HRC and adopted it by the majority , on May 27 , 2009 -- Resolution S - 11/1 , “ Assistance to Sri Lanka in the promotion and protection of human rights ” ( http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9105&LangID=E).
The self - serving resolution only condemned the LTTE for acts of terror while praising the Sri Lankan government and supporting , naturally , its right to sovereignty .
These ALBA countries , along with most members of the Non-Aligned Movement on the HRC , let the entire Tamil people down , especially the internally displaced persons .
My assessment is shared by the people ’s tribunal in paragraph 5.5
The Tribunal stresses the responsibility of the Member States of the United Nations that have not complied with their moral obligation to seek justice for the violations of human rights committed during the last period of war .
After repeated pleas , and in spite of the appalling conditions experienced by Tamils , the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Security Council failed to establish an independent commission of inquiry to investigate those responsible for the atrocities committed due to political pressure exerted by certain Members .
The PPT came to the opposite conclusion that Golinger does on all accounts .
The US is not an actor of “ aggression ” against Sri Lanka ’s government , rather it is the case of one war criminal supporting another .
The tribunal “ highlights the conduct of the European Union in undermining the CFA of 2002 .
In spite of being aware of the detrimental consequences to a peace process in the making , the EU decided — under pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom — to list the Tamil Resistance Movement [ which included the LTTE ] as a terrorist organisation in 2006 .
This decision allowed the Sri Lankan government to breach the ceasefire agreement and re-start military operations leading to the massive human rights violations listed above .
The PPT also points to the full responsibility of those governments , led by the United States , that are conducting the so - called “ Global War on Terror ” in providing political endorsement of the conduct of the Sri Lankan government and armed forces in a war that is primarily targeted against the Tamil people . ”
As solidarity activists , we advocate the right to resist and conduct armed struggle once peaceful means fail to induce oppressive governments to engage in a process aimed at justice and equality — such is the case in Sri Lanka with the Tamil people , just as surely as it is in Palestine .
I find that most armed movements commit acts of atrocities , even acts of terror .
The struggle for liberation in Cuba was an exception to the rule .
Fortunately , it only lasted just over two years .
The armed struggle for liberation from Sinhala oppression against another Indigenous group lasted for quarter of a century and , at the end , the LTTE clearly did resort to acts of desperation and terror .
Other brave and righteous groups fighting for liberation , for equality and justice , such as Colombia ’s FARC and Palestine ’s PFLP , have also committed acts of terror .
The ANC in South Africa was brutal in its struggle for liberation .
I wonder how I would act in such circumstances !
True solidarity activists have no choice .
We must support the Tamil people .
Today , they are in disarray .
Various tendencies are in formation .
But dialogue with them all is what solidarity forces must engage in around the world .
One tendency is the new Provisional Transitional Government of Tamil Eelam ( TGTE ) , which just constituted itself in Philadelphia .
Its coordinator , Visuvanathan Rudrakumaran , is a resident of the United States and an attorney .
In February , he filed a suit in the US Supreme Court that would negate parts of the US Patriot Act and allow people to provide “ material support or resources ” to armed groups fighting for their liberation .
Tamil Eelam advocates in the US have associated with the civil rights organisation , Humanitarian Law Project , and along with supporters of the crushed LTTE and the PKK ( Kurdish rebels in Turkey ) are seeking to legitimise the rights of oppressed minorities to fight for liberation , if necessary with arms when peaceful means are impossible .
( See TGTE ’s website : http://govtamileelam.org/gov/.)
My main motivation for siding with people who fight against oppression and for liberation is a matter of basic solidarity morality , and an understanding of this is a necessity for suffering people .
The basic reason why so many millions of people have respected and loved Che Guevara is because of this moral stance .
To back any corrupt , capitalist , genocidal government — albeit in the name of support for “ sovereignty ” — is not consistent with Che ’s and our collective moral stance .

It is a very small subset of people that actually reads the scientific literature on climate change .
Even publishing scientists do n’t usually follow research outside of their field .
Few of us climate science enthusiasts read about the role of low hepatic copper concentrations in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , so why should we be surprised when medical researchers , flipping through Nature , do n’t stop to read about the sea level during the last interglacial and its relevance to today ?
For the 99 % of us who are not publishing scientists in any area , and do not have a subscription to Nature , and do n’t really find it too riveting anyway , we get all of our climate science news from the media .
The mainstream media is generally mediocre when it comes to reporting science , but when it comes to climate science they do an abysmal job .
Many people know this – you should n’t trust the media , especially when it comes to stories of impending disaster .
You should take every such story with a grain of salt .
However , it ’s no good to stop there , and never do any research into its validity .
Because what if it ’s actually true ?
Then you ’ll just be shrugging it off and going “ maybe , maybe not ” for no reason .
This happens a lot with celebrity climate science communicators , like Al Gore , or , in Canada , David Suzuki .
I ’ve written about Al Gore before , and the important thing to stress is that he does n’t matter .
In general , his communication of climate science is very accurate – he has a few minor errors in his book and movie , but the overarching message that humans are causing dangerous warming of the planet is fully supported by science .
But it could n’t matter less if Al Gore was or was n’t telling the truth , because absolutely no scientific research rests on him .
He has n’t published any peer - reviewed papers about anything even remotely related to climate .
He is purely a communicator .
A lot of people do n’t like Al Gore , and therefore think that global warming is bunk .
This kind of reasoning is very unfortunate .
They recognize that they are hearing scientific information from a partisan source , so they assume that it ’s wrong without researching what credible , nonpartisan sources say about it .
All you need is a credibility spectrum , and you ’re good to go .
There ’s somewhat less of a problem when it comes to David Suzuki – after all , he ’s not a former politician , he has more scientific training ( a biology doctorate ) than Gore , and according to a Reader ’s Digest poll , Canadians trust him more than any other celebrity .
It ’s still easy , though , to find people who do n’t like him for one reason or another .
If it comes from David Suzuki , it has to be an extremist environmental craze , so they brush off what he says without looking at more credible sources .
Celebrities like Gore and Suzuki do n’t matter .
What matters , though , is people with severely limited knowledge of the scientific process , access to credible sources , or motivation to do a little research .
What matters is the factors shaping society that have allowed so many of us to be this way .
Why do schools frame science as answers , not questions ?
Why is literature vital to public communication hidden behind paywalls ?
And why do so many people assume that entire fields of science are dependent on one or two celebrity communicators ?
Ronald McDonald has long been an admired figure .
Kids the world over brighten up when they see the affable clown , with his unmistakable red hair , yellow jumpsuit and striped shirt .
They know upon spotting him that a chicken nuggie Happy Meal ( replete with toy ) is not too far in the future .
But little does anyone know the true and sad story behind the clown .
Do n’t be fooled by that big bright red smile … there are tears underneath .
Wipe away the makeup and you ’ll find something not so pretty .
It all started out so innocent .
He was quite the gentleman … just lounging in the park .
He was respectful to the police .
He helped the elderly .
But then people started to treat him as an idol .
They even knelt before him .
This quickly got to his head .
Women began coming on to him …at first in was seemingly innocent .
A kiss on the cheek here and there .
Shortly things got out of control .
He began drinking .
His health deteriorated and for one stretch he even lost his hair .
He started harassing women .
He began soliciting masseuses that offered “ happy endings . ”
He quickly realized the power he had over women and how easily he could get what he wanted from them .
His appetite for sex escalated and he quickly became addicted .
He particularity enjoyed receiving “ head ” .
He was not one to turn down a regular romp …
… but also would venture to the more extreme .
Women were not enough and he was soon spotted with men .
… and eventually turned to pedophilia .
After all his sexcapades , his mental well - being and general health declined .
He was seen homeless at times .
The long arm of the law had to pick him up on occasion .
Usually drunk and in a stupor .
Sometimes passed out in a park .
His last resort was to turn his internal pain and suffering to rage … but he ended up attacking the wrong person … .
… a man with connections .
He was held at gun point … his life flashed before his eyes…and for that last moment he realized the mistake in his ways .
How far he ’d veered from his good ol ’ days …
… but it was too late .
In a hail of gun fire he was taken out …by none other than Jack himself .
And that is the sad sad tale behind the once respected and loved clown of the Golden Arches .
Let this be a lesson to you kids .
Do n’t take the route that Ronald did .
Behave yourself , mind your manners and be a good citizen .
In the long run you ’ll be better off ( even if you have a shitty job ) .

Adding the clouds does n't look so great though .
The use of different color channels was very interesting .
I did a bit of editing on figure 6 and already it looks like an awesome planet .
Planet Texture Tutorial by * Mr- Frenzy
Mr Frenzy has used a ton of textures and layers to create a very realistic planet texture .
In my experience , the more layers and detail you put on these types of space art the better they look .

A law firm which previously sent threatening letters to alleged file - sharers in order to receive cash settlements has complained to WordPress over a hosted blog .
According to the complaint , Automattic Inc. can be held liable for copyright infringement and defamation due to the fact it hosted a FaceBook - sourced picture of one of the firm 's lawyers which had been Photoshopped into a ' Wanted ' poster .
British law firm Tilly Bailey & Irvine ( TBI ) which began a file - sharing settlement letters scheme earlier this year , later withdrew from the business due to masses of bad publicity .
A staff member from the company later tried to rewrite history on its Wikipedia page by removing any references which showed its connection to this work .
While we have covered developments with these type of schemes closely here on TorrentFreak with numerous Davenport Lyons , ACS : Law and latterly TBI articles , there are other sites which concentrate purely on them .
The excellent BeingThreatened consumer site is an excellent resource , but for those who prefer a more tabloid - style take on events , the ACSBore blog can be quite an eye - opener .
After an earlier site , BeingScammed , was threatened by ACS : Law and was eventually taken down , a guy called ‘ Hickster ’ – himself wrongfully accused of file - sharing by the company – became motivated to launch a replacement .
“ Really the aim of the site is to put pressure on the law firms that are falsely accusing people of filesharing , ” Hickster told Torrent Freak .
“ Imagine when an internet connection is in a wife ’s name and she receives a letter from these people accusing her of downloading and watching some vile pornography .
I mean does she look at her husband in the same manner ?
Especially when it is gay pornography , what could that do to a marriage ? ”
Although Hickster maintains that he only publishes the truth , he does admit that his blog takes a ‘ Red - Top Tabloid ” approach .
Anyone familiar with the British tabloids will know that they are not averse to a bit of image Photoshopping should the need arise , and it is that type of activity that has caused Tilly Bailey & Irvine to complain about the ACSBore blog .
Back in January we reported that Lord Lucas had labeled the type of scheme run by these law firms as “ straightforward legal blackmail “ .
It was this statement that inspired Hickster into action .
After culling a photograph from the FaceBook page of a lawyer who handled file - sharing cases at TBI , Hickster transformed it into a Wild - West style ‘ Wanted ’ poster which declared “ Wanted : For Legal BlackMail ” and offered a $ 1000 reward – an amount similar to the settlement fees demanded by these companies .
This image was then included in an article on his WordPress - hosted blog .
This week in correspondence with WordPress , Tilly Bailey & Irvine complained about the image claiming “ Copyright Infringement and Libellous statements ” .
The section describing the complaint reads :
The copyright image of Ms Amanda Mitten is framed in a ‘ Wanted ’ poster with the word “ Wanted for Legal Blackmail ” .
We consider this statement to be defamatory in terms of the wording used and the way in which the copyright image has been framed in a ‘ Wanted ’ poster .
There is no truth in the statement that Amanda Mitten personally or Tilly Bailey & Irvine LLP has been involved in “ Legal Blackmail ” .
Such a statement is misleading and false .
This blog entry can be viewed by general members of the public who have access to the internet and as such cause injury to the reputation of Ms Mitten .
This blog entry has caused great distress to Ms Mitten personally .
It is generally accepted under English law that defamatory statements on web pages are to be regarded as libel .
The company also claims that the displaying of the image constitutes copyright infringement and goes on to state that as the publisher Automattic , Inc. can be held liable for defamation .
TBI then formally put the company “ on notice of our claim for copyright infringement and defamation ” while demanding an immediate takedown of the image .
Interestingly , TBI then threatened to use a Norwich Pharamacal Order against Automattic , Inc. to obtain the identity of Hickster – the same technique it used to obtain the identities of alleged file - sharers – so it can take further action against him .
Although the WordPress operator took down the image , it is n’t going to play games with their users ’ identities .
“ We only dealt with the DMCA notice contained within the e-mail sent to us , ” said WordPress in correspondence .
“ We will not , under any circumstance , disclose any contact / personal / private details of our bloggers without a U.S. Court Order , and this has not been presented to us . ”
This is n’t the first time that Hickster ’s actions have drawn the attention of lawyers acting against file - sharers in the UK .
He was named in the legal threat made by ACS : Law to file - sharing forum Slyck.com earlier this year , after he referred to a law firm employee as “ a wanker “
Today , the circumstances are different , as nearly all of the easy - to - find and easy - to - produce oil wells have been found and produced .
For example , Ghawar , the world ’s biggest oil field , was discovered in 1948 , and even with all of the advances in seismic technology over the past 60 years , nary an oil well of nearly the same magnitude has been found .
To reduce Odum ’s assertion to a pithy phrase — it takes energy to get energy – and for the past 150 years society has accessed enormous quantities of energy in the form of fossil fuels at a very low cost .
Early U.S. oil production provided 100 barrels of oil for every barrel spent in getting that oil ( Cleveland 2005 ) , while traditional fuel sources ( e.g. biomass ) returned much less .
This huge increase in net energy enabled society to build cities , increase crop yields , build cars , etc …
" The true value of energy to society is the net energy , which is that after the energy costs of getting and concentrating that energy are subtracted . ” - H.T. Odum ( 1973 )
What has become very clear over the past decade and especially the past month is that the energy cost of getting oil has increased .
We need only to compare the wooden oil derricks used to produce the fields of the early 20th century to that used currently in the Gulf of Mexico – two billion dollar ultra - deep water platforms .
Figure 1 . East Texas Oil Field ( google images ) .
Figure 2 . Deepwater oil rig ( google images ) .
As the energy cost of getting energy increases , the amount of net energy provided to society from an oil field decreases .
Take , for example , the following two hypothetical societies ( Figures 3 and 4 ) .
Society A has an energy source that can be extracted at an EROI of 18 .
Society B has an energy source that can be extracted at an EROI of 1.2 .
In this example both societies extract 100 units of energy , but due to the different EROIs with which that energy is extracted , the amount of net energy provided to society is much different .
Society A must invest six units of energy to maintain the energy infrastructure needed to extract 100 units of energy , while Society B must invest 80 units of energy .
The end result is that society A has 96 units of net energy to allocate to whichever means it desires , while society B has only 20 units of net energy .
Figure 3 . Net energy flows with a high extraction EROI .
Numbers calculated using the following equation : Net Energy = Gross Energy * ( EROI - 1/EROI ) .
Figure 4 .
Net energy flows with a low extraction EROI .
As oil becomes harder and harder to find and produce , the energy cost of getting energy will continue to increase , transitioning the world from the situation in Society A toward that of Society B .
Take , for example , the current debacle in the Gulf of Mexico .
Even if we are able to fix the well expediently and extract any remaining oil , the energy costs of this well will likely be greater than the energy gains .
As long as the amount of energy needed to get energy continues to increase , the supply of net energy to society will decrease , despite that fact that the gross supply of oil may stay constant or even slightly increase in the short term .
This means that in the future the amount of energy available for discretionary purposes , i.e. building houses , roads , and schools , will decrease , as more and more energy must be dedicated to , for example , the construction of oil pipelines , ultra - deepwater rigs , the energy to mitigate oil spills , etc ...
As Joseph Tainter noted in his book , the Collapse of Complex Societies , " Eventually the point is reached when all the energy and resources available to a society are required just to maintain its existing level of complexity . ”
So when press releases are made about new discoveries , ask yourself : “ how much energy will be used to get that energy , or what will be the energy profit ? ”
Short on time , I dropped a pyrex bowl on top of him , slid some paper under and walked him outside .
I had to get to work , but I wanted to examine him later to figure out just how many exterminators we should call .
Early Wednesday morning I was disappointed to find , relaxing on the white rug in our living room , a big cockroach .
When I returned from work , water had condensed on the inside of the bowl .
A lot of water .
The spot where I left him must have been struck by direct sunlight and he was baked .
The white paper on the ground had also absorbed some moisture , but I did n't bother to weigh that .
Next I wiped out the inside of the bowl .
Hopefully the paper towel now held most of the water from the cockroach .
I cut a little square of paper towel and set it on a scale .
With the dry paper towel on the scale , I zeroed it out .

RSS feed – using jFeed ( jQuery ) to aggregate RSS
This simple tutorial will show you how to Import rss feeds of any site into your own custom area / block of website .
It can be used as news imported from yahoo , bbc etc .
As we know , RSS feeds are usually used to trasnfer some news for people .
Today I ’ll tell you about RSS feeds and show you how to make an own RSS aggregator .
In the result , you will be able to display various RSS feeds on your website with nite and modern design .
Here is the sample :
[ sociallocker ]
[ / sociallocker ]
Well , download the source files and let ’s start coding !
Step 1 . HTML
As usual , we start with the HTML .
This is our main page code ( with 2 RSS blocks ) .
Pay heed at RSSAggrCont elements .
Param ‘ rssnum ’ means – how many rss elements will be displayed at the page .
‘ rss_url ’ – is RSS url .
I hope that you will be able to change these params easily .
templates/rss_page.html
< link href = " templates/css/styles.css " rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " /> < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src="js/jquery -1.4.2.min.js " ></ script > < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src="js/jquery.jfeed.js " ></script > < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " src="js/jquery.aRSSFeed.js " ></script > < div class = " RSSAggrCont " rssnum= " 5 " rss_url= " http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories " > < div class =" loading_rss " > < img alt = " Loading ... " src=" templates/images/loading.gif " /> </div> </div > < div class = " RSSAggrCont " rssnum= " 5 " rss_url= " http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml " > < div class =" loading_rss " > < img alt = " Loading ... " src=" templates/images/loading.gif " /> </div> </div > < script language= " javascript " type = " text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( 'div.RSSAggrCont').aRSSFeed ( ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Step 2 . CSS
Here are CSS styles .
templates/css/styles.css
. RSSAggrCont { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; - moz-box - shadow:0 0 10px #ccc ; - webkit - box - shadow : 0 0 10px #ccc ; width :500 px ; padding : 10 px ; background : #f3f3f3 ; margin : 15 px ; float : left ; } /* RSS Feeds */ .rss_item_wrapper { padding - bottom : 8 px ; } .rss_item_wrapper:last -child { padding - bottom : 0 px ; } .rss_item_header { font - size : 12 px ; font - weight : bold ; padding - bottom : 0 px ; } .rss_item_header a , .rss_item_header a:link , .rss_item_header a:visited , .rss_item_header a :hover , .rss_item_header a :active { font - size : 12 px ; font - weight : bold ; color : #33 c ; } .rss_item_info { color :#999 ; font - size : 9 px ; } .rss_item_desc { text - align : justify ; font - size : 11 px ; } .rss_read_more { background - color : #EDEDED ; font - size : 11 px ; font - weight : normal ; height :30 px ; line - height :30 px ; vertical - align : middle ; margin - top : 2 px ; padding :0 9 px ; text - align : left ; text - decoration : none ; text - transform : capitalize ; } .loading_rss { text - align : center ; width : 89 px ; height :64 px ; background - image:url (../images/loading_bg.png ) ; z-index : 10 ; margin : 10 px auto ; } .loading_rss img { margin - top : 16 px ; } .loading_rss div { width : 89 px ; height :64 px ; background - image:url (../images/loading.gif ) ; background - position : center center ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; }
Step 3 . JS
Here are few necessary JS files for our project :
js/jquery.aRSSFeed.js
// jQuery plugin - Dolphin RSS Aggregator ( function ( $ ) { $.fn.aRSSFeed = function ( ) { return this .each ( function ( ) { var $ Cont = $ ( this ) ; var iMaxNum = parseInt ( $ Cont.attr ( ' rssnum ' ) || 0 ) ; var sFeedURL = $ Cont.attr ( ' rss_url ' ) ; if ( sFeedURL == undefined ) return false ; $.getFeed ( { url : ' get_rss_feed.php?url= ' + escape ( sFeedURL ) , success : function ( feed ) { if ( feed != undefined && feed.items ) { var sCode = ' < div class="rss_feed_wrapper " >' ; var iCount = 0 ; for ( var iItemId = 0 ; iItemId < feed.items.length ; iItemId ++) { var item = feed.items [ iItemId ] ; var sDate ; var a ; var oDate if ( null != ( a = item.updated.match(/( \d+ ) -( \d+ ) -( \d+ ) T( \d+ ) :( \d+ ) :( \d+ ) Z/ ) ) ) oDate = new Date ( a [ 1 ] , a [ 2 ] - 1 , a [ 3 ] , a [ 4 ] , a [ 5 ] , a [ 6 ] , 0 ) ; else oDate = new Date( item.updated ) ; sDate = o Date.toLocaleString ( ) ; sCode += '< div class="rss_item_wrapper " >' + '< div class=" rss_item_header " >' + ' < a href= " ' + item.link + ' " target = " _blank " >' + item.title + '</a>' + '</div >' + '< div class=" rss_item_info " >' + '< span >< img src=" templates/images/clock.png " /> ' + sDate + '</ span >' + '</div >' + '< div class=" rss_item_desc " >' + item.description + '</div >' + '</div >' ; iCount ++ ; if ( iCount == iMaxNum ) break ; } sCode += '</div >' + '< div class="rss_read_more " >' + '< img class= " bot_icon_left " src=" templates/images/more.png " />' + ' < a href= " ' + feed.link + ' " target= " _blank " class="rss_read_more_link " >' + feed .
title + '</a>' + '</div >' + '< div class=" clear_both " ></div >' ; $ Cont.html ( sCode ) ; } } } ) ; } ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
js/jquery -1.4.2.min.js and js/jquery.jfeed.js
This are common files – jQuery library with jFeed library .
It is to no purpose to publish full codes of these files here ( they are pretty huge ) .
Both are available in our download package
Step 4 . PHP
Finally – PHP sources , I think that everything should be easy to understand :
index.php
<?php require_once ( 'templates/rss_page.html ' ) ; ?>
get_rss_feed.php
<? php $ s Url = ( isset ( $ _GET [ 'url ' ] ) && $ _GET [ 'url ' ] != '') ?
$ _GET [ 'url ' ] : ' http://www.boonex.com/unity/extensions/latest/?rss=1'; header ( ' Content - Type : text / xml ' ) ; readfile ( $ sUrl ) ; ?>
Step 5 . Images
Several images are required for our project :
Conclusion
Today I ’ve described you how to create own RSS aggregator using jQuery library – jFeed .
You are welcome to use it in your projects .
Good luck !
Acknowledging it would be a highly unpopular move , White House economic adviser Paul Volcker said yesterday the United States should consider imposing a “ value added tax ” similar to those charged in Europe to help get the deficit under control .
A VAT is a national sales tax that , like state and city sales taxes , would be collected by retailers .
Volcker , at the New - York Historical Society , told a panel on the global financial crisis that Congress might also have to consider new taxes on carbon and energy .
“ The President has passed historic tax cuts for middle - class families and continues to push for more tax cuts .
The President is not proposing to cut the deficit at the expense of middle - class families , ” said a White House official asked for comment .
The VAT suggestion was immediately met with outrage by Republicans .
“ It should n’t surprise anyone that the Obama White House would advocate a European - style tax to help finance their European - style government health - care plan , ” said Brian Walsh , a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee .
“ When you hear things like this , though , it ’s almost as if the Democrats think the American people will forget that we ’re in this situation because of their reckless spending agenda . ”
Volcker , a former chairman of the Federal Reserve , told the global economic panel that a VAT is “ not as toxic an idea as it has been in the past . ”
He added , “ If , at the end of the day , we need to raise taxes , we should raise taxes . ”
The tax has long had backing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , who last year said it is “ on the table ” for dealing with the country ’s fiscal woes .
Some say the tax can be a good way to raise money because — depending on how it ’s imposed — the burden does not have to fall on the consumer alone .
A VAT can also be imposed down the line on manufacturers , producers and any other business that adds value — as well as retailers .
Presumably , each could be asked to pay a smaller amount , since the burden would be spread out .
Also , since the government would be collecting at each step of the manufacturing process , if a retailer cheated , the taxman would n’t be left completely in the cold , because levies would have been collected at earlier steps leading up to the sale .
A major reason the tax is so hated is that it does not eliminate sales taxes , but is charged on top of them .
It ’s a quick way for governments to raise cash , but the tax could wind up being a burden on the poor , critics say .
The VAT idea has percolated in Washington over the years , but lawmakers have always resisted it .
The US budget deficit is expected to reach $ 1.5 trillion in fiscal 2010 .

True Blood fans who crave extra servings of vampire drama can feed on new online installments beginning Thursday night , when HBO debuts what producers describe as " interactive social theater . "
Drop of True Blood Thursday ( 9 p.m. / 8 p.m. Central ) promises some radical left turns from the storylines featured in Sunday 's telecast .
" We 're going to bring to life a scene we did n't see , but might have wanted to , in Sunday night 's episode , " wrote Drop producers , using the pen name of True Blood waitress Sookie Stackhouse , in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" Maybe it 's Bill being shoved into the car by the Fuck You Crew and speeding off into the night .
Maybe it 's
Andy crawling through the window into Jason 's house before they have their man - to - man talk . "
Elaborating on the Twitter - powered " interactive social theater " concept , producers explain that viewers ' comments will impact the outcome of Drop storylines , which are penned by True Blood 's Twitter crew .
True Blood – the raunchy series about bloodsuckers living openly among humans in Louisiana – airs Sundays at 9 p.m./8 p.m. Central on HBO .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The Chinese military denied media reports that an artillery drill in the East China Sea was a rebuke of a planned military exercise between South Korea and the United States .
Analysts and a military officer said the live ammunition exercise starting on Wednesday that will close off parts of the East China Sea off China ’s coast over six days were routine and the timing was coincidental .
“ The PLA artillery exercise in the East China Sea and the joint U.S. - South Korea exercise in the Yellow Sea are a complete coincidence , ” Li Daguang , a professor at China ’s National Defense University told the Wen Wei Po , a Hong Kong newspaper under mainland control .
“ The outside world should n’t read anything into this . ”
Li , a People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) officer , said the firing exercise was a routine one and “ not aimed at the U.S. - South Korea joint exercise . ”
But the China Daily , the country ’s official English - language newspaper , said some analysts saw the announcement of the exercise as a “ response to a joint exercise between the United States and Republic of Korea navies in the Yellow Sea . ”
The Yellow Sea lies to the north of the East China Sea , and the areas of the two exercises would not overlap .
China ’s Foreign Ministry said last week it was concerned about reports a U.S. aircraft carrier may join the anti-submarine exercise with South Korea following a standoff with North Korea over the sinking of a warship from the South .
“ Though the Chinese government did not say anything about the drill , anybody with common sense on military strategy will bet that they are related , ” one expert on China - U.S. relations , Shi Yinhong of Renmin University in Beijing , told the China Daily .
The joint exercise that had been expected this month will most likely take place in July , although a date has yet to be set , the Pentagon said on Monday .
Washington has not officially said whether an aircraft carrier could participate , as some news reports have suggested , citing Pentagon sources .
Beijing has been angered by U.S. navy ships engaging in surveillance in waters close to China ’s southern coast .
Earlier this year , Beijing curtailed contacts with the Pentagon over continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan , the self - ruled island that China claims as its own territory .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this month China ’s decision to break off military - to - military contacts could undercut regional stability .
Gates said the PLA was the main obstruction in the way of improved relations , and suggested its position was at odds with that of the country ’s political leadership .
脱毛後に入浴することは、どこの脱毛愛媛の脱毛サロンやクリニックなどでも原則禁止とされています。その理由は単純で、施術を行った直後の肌は非常にデリケートであり、ちょっとした刺激でも痛みや痒みを発生する可能性があるからです。また、肌のバリア機能の低下のみならず、ターンオーバーなどの修復機能も低下しているため、その状態で肌にダメージを与えるとなかなか回復しないことも理由のひとつです。
衛生面の観点からも、温泉を含む入浴が禁止される理由を説明することができます。どんなに浴槽や配管を綺麗にしていても、雑菌を完全に取り除くことはできないし、また自分以外にも浴槽に入る家族がいることや、不特定多数の入浴が確定している温泉などでは、リラックスはできても、脱毛後の肌に悪影響を与える可能性が高いです。したがって、肌を完全に回復させるまでは、入浴を控えることが望ましいです。
ただ、何日も入浴しなければ、それはそれで不衛生であり、また入浴は禁じられていてもシャワーは制限されない場合もあります。もちろん、シャワーは制限されないといっても、いきなり熱いお湯を用いるのではなく、最初のうちは肌への負担が少ないぬるま湯などから慣らしていくことが大切です。
脱毛後に入浴ができる目安としては、早くて1日、長くて1週間くらいになります。これは脱毛の内容や程度、肌の状態等によって変わるため、入浴を考える場合などには、施術後に医師などとよく話し合うようにしましょう。

In the device ’s latest update , Amazon has given Kindle users the ability to organize books into collections .
One way of adding a book to a collection is to open the book ’s menu , select « Add to Collection … » , and pick a collection :
It ’s the default choice , so pretty quickly , you start selecting it automatically .
Until you try to add a sample chapter to a collection :
Suddenly , the default choice is « Buy This Book Now » .
I suspect I ’m not the only one who bought a book by accident while organizing books into collections .
This is exactly the kind of thoughtless interaction design that makes people afraid of using electronic devices .
I ’m quite sure nobody ever accidentally bought a book while organizing physical books on a bookshelf .
If You See Something , Think Twice About Saying Something
“ If you see something , say something . ”
Or , maybe not :
The Travis County Criminal Justice Center was closed for most of the day on Friday , May 14 , after a man reported that a “ suspicious package ” had been left in the building .
The court complex was evacuated , and the APD Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit was called in for a look - see .
The package in question , a backpack , contained paperwork but no explosive device .
The building reopened at 1:40 pm .
The man who reported the suspicious package , Douglas Scott Hoopes , was arrested and charged with making a false report and booked into the jail .
The charge is a felony punishable by up to two years in jail .
I do n’t think we can have it both ways .
We expect people to report anything suspicious — even dumb things — and now we want to press charges if they report something that is n’t an actual threat .
Truth is , if you ask amateurs to act as front - line security personnel , you should n’t be surprised when you get amateur security .
I think this excerpt from a poem by Rick Moranis says it best :
If you see something ,
Say something .
If you say something ,
Mean something .
If you mean something ,
You may have to prove something .
If you ca n’t prove something ,
You may regret saying something .
There ’s more .
EDITED TO ADD ( 5/26 ) : Seems like he left the package himself , and then called it in .
So there ’s ample reason to arrest him .
Never mind .

I 've just finished Adrian Johns ' 2009 book , Piracy : The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates , a 500 + page magnum opus stretching from the 1600s to the present .
Johns is a noted University of Chicago historian , and his book is a fascinating and essential read for anyone interested in the history of the term " intellectual property " and development of the modern copyright and patent systems .
A warning to readers : you may not want to start at the beginning , unless you 're really interested in the organization of pre-industrial printing in England in the 1700s .
Because the book is organized chronologically , the first several chapters are , well , a bit less accessible .
So here 's my advice : start with Chapter 13 , which is about the rise of radio in the UK in the 1920s .
Turns out that history is remarkably relevant today .
Radio arose in the shadow of a patent thicket , became the province of tinkers , and posed a puzzle for a government worried that " experimenters " would ruin things by mis-adjusting their sets and flooding the ether with howling oscillation .
Many will immediately recognize the parallels to modern controversies about iPhone " jailbreaking , " user innovation , and the future of the Internet .
The momentum of Chapter 13 should carry you through to the end of the book .
Along the way , you 'll be reminded that today 's debates have historical roots in controversies over computer hacking , phone phreaking , home taping , and ultimately the 1920s patent - law rebellions against AT&T .
This is history every interested copy - fighter , patent reformer , and netizen needs to know .
Prof .
Johns ends his book by describing the unique thing about our current historical moment : the rise of what he calls an " intellectual property defense industry " :
As piracy has grown and diversified , so a counterindustry has emerged , dedicated to combating it .
The coherence and scope of this industry are relatively new and remarkable .
In previous centuries , particular groups or industries mounted efforts against piracy ; but they did not generally regard them as fronts in one common cause .
Now they do .
...
So the first implication is that we need to appreciate the historical significance of this industry of antipiracy policing and apprehend its consequences , at every social level .
The second implication follows from that .
Measures adopted against piracy can sometimes impinge on other , equally valued , aspects of society .
Indeed , it is possible that they must do so , given the nature of the task .
When that happens , however , they can trigger deeply felt reactions .
The result is a crisis , with the potential to create a moment of genuine transformation .
If that 's right ( and I think it is ) , then opposing the " intellectual property defense industry " is not the same thing as opposing " intellectual property . "
Rather , it is about insisting on values like civil liberties , privacy , and autonomy , and not allowing antipiracy enforcement to trample them .
But do n't stop reading at the end of the book .
Go back for the earlier chapters .
For example , Chapter 10 ( Google Books excerpt ) tells the story of how the term " intellectual property " arose as the byproduct of efforts in the 1870s to abolish the patent system altogether — patent advocates popularized the term to harness their cart to copyright ( " literary property " ) , which was perceived as the more secure and legitimate institution .
Chapter 8 reminds us how the United States was born as a " pirate nation , " refusing to recognize the copyrights of foreign ( mainly British ) authors .
Chapter 9 explains the early history of " legal deposit " as a requirement for copyright ( and how publishers hated it ) , which in turn became an important foundation for many of our most revered national research libraries .
Chapter 12 describes the origins of the first organized , industry - supported , private antipiracy enforcement operation ( it was music publishers fighting against sheet music reprinters in 1903 ) .
All fascinating stuff .
Poll : Americans skeptical of tea party movement
The Washington Post and ABC News are out with a new poll on the tea party movement that goes deeper than other such surveys in determining what Americans think .
Overall , there 's a lot of skepticism about the movement , but a reluctance to believe the worst media narratives .
Take the section on what subjects " think support for the Tea Party
movement is based on . "
Only 28 percent of voters say it's " racial prejudice against Obama . "
The biggest majority , 61 percent , say it's " distrust of government in general . "
That 's not surprising , as 69 percent of all voters -- the highest number since 1996 -- pronounce themselves dissatisfied with how the federal government works .
At the same time , only 8 percent of people polled claimed to be " active participant [s ] in the Tea Party movement . "
And a slight majority , 54 percent , say they 're not interested in news about the movement .
I 've put more results below the jump .

Mr Cameron ’s Milton Keynes speech about deficit reduction repeats a line that has become a common theme of speeches by Coalition politicians : one of the sins of the last government was “ accepting as a fact of life the eight million people who are economically inactive . ”
The implication is usually that this is a new low and always that it marks a tremendous failure of the last government .
Where do we stand at the present ?
According to the ONS , there are 38 million people of working age .
Of these , just under 8.2 million are economically inactive – not in employment or self - employment , but not classified as unemployed either .
The main reasons why people are economically inactive are :
– Slightly over 2.3 million are students
– A bit under 2.3 million are looking after their family / home .
– Just over 2 million are long - term sick .
– Just under 600,000 describe themselves as retired .
Coalition politicians can point out that , in May 1997 there were 7,615,000 economically inactive people .
In the latest figures , there were 8,166,000 .
Enough said ?
No .
Throughout this period , there number of working age people was rising , sometimes very quickly .
In fact , the number has risen every month since June 1993 .
When Labour was elected the working age population was just under 35.3 million ; in the latest figures it is just over 38 million – 2.75 million higher .
A much more accurate basis for comparison is what proportion of people are economically inactive and here the story is different .
Two things stand out about these figures .
One is that the increase in the number of students is more than enough to account for the whole increase in economic inactivity .
We have nearly 900,000 more students now than in 1997 – I regard that as an overwhelmingly good thing and no- one who thinks otherwise has any right to label themselves as a “ progressive ” .
The other is that the number of people categorised as economically inactive because they are long - term sick is , despite the recession , still lower than it was in 1997 .
Conservative ( and , nowadays , Liberal Democrat ) bloggers and journalists who bang on and on about Britain ’s army of shiftless malingerers never once mention this statistic .
Let ’s have a look at what has happened to those major categories :
What we do get is endless comparisons with the number of sick and disabled people in 1979 .
I ’d have said that that date was a bit of a give away , but again the representatives of the hard , unbending tendency in conservatism never point out that the tripling of the numbers of sick and disabled people happened under John Major and Margaret Thatcher .
Despite attempts to insinuate otherwise , there is no evidence that the last government tried to push people onto Incapacity Benefit to massage down the unemployment figures .
But it definitely was official policy during the 1980s and 90s recessions – talk to anyone who was a manager in the Employment Service or the DSS ( forerunners of Jobcentre Plus ) in those days and they will tell you that the standing instruction was that anyone on Unemployment Benefit who could qualify for a disability benefit was encouraged to switch .
In fact , its one of the more honourable things about the last government that , despite the terrible press they were getting for rising unemployment , they never did this .
It is one of the ironies of history that a government that brought down the number of people who were economically inactive because of sickness and disability will be remembered for letting the figures balloon .
It is beyond irony that politicians who will probably be remembered as cynics who manipulated the employment figures were in fact the first for a generation who resisted that temptation .

An anonymous reader writes " Greig ' Theremin Hero ' Stewart has developed a way to play Guitar Hero with a theremin , like an air guitar .
The results speak for themselves , in this rocking video complete with awesome costumes and some sweet artwork .
It even has a Co-op mode .
ROCK ON !
This needs to be a real product ! "
The beginning is a bit annoying , but this has to be one of the coolest " projects " I 've seen in a long time .
We mentioned recently that India was rounding up opposition to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) and that it wanted to stop the deal from being made outside of existing international institutions .
This week , it made good on its promise to object .
The new standards envisioned by ACTA " could short - change legal process , impede legitimate competition and shift the escalated costs of enforcing private commercial rights to governments , consumers and taxpayers , " said an Indian representative at the World Trade Organization .
" They also represent a systemic threat to the rights of legitimate traders and producers of goods , and fundamental rights of due process of individuals . "
One key area of concern is ACTA 's permission for customs agents to seize goods " in transit " between countries , even if those goods are legal in both the sending and receiving countries .
" Let me give an example , " said the Indian rep .
" India 's right to exercise flexibilities , such as granting compulsory licenses , would be interfered with by the mandatory application of border measures to goods in transit .
Indian exporters could be constrained from shipping goods produced under its own exception to countries where there is no applicable IPRs protection because transit may be blocked by an intervening transit country ’s application of domestic IPRs . "
Generic pharmaceuticals are the big concern here .
Countries like India sometimes create " compulsory licenses " in which drug firms can pay a set amount to the government and can legally use another organization 's patented material , whether that organization wants them to or not .
The US has similar compulsory licenses for things like music .
India also expressed irritation over the fact that " plurilateral processes like ACTA completely bypass the existing multilateral processes " at the WTO and elsewhere .
In the end , ACTA looks like overreach .
" The released ACTA text shows a general shift in the locus of enforcement which enhances the power of IPRs holders beyond reasonable measure , " said India .
" Politicians , civil society and IP experts in ACTA members countries , have expressed concern regarding the substance and modus operandi of ACTA negotiations ...
Even the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has recently raised serious questions concerning the data that has been relied on by proponents of the ACTA to support the effort . "
India demanded that the WTO take up these issues and not " remain a silent observer to such a development . "

Look .
I really , really like Twitter .
I 'm not one of those people who thinks it 's only good for one thing , or that it 's useless because you can't do Y on it .
I 've made some good connections on the site .
And even , gasp , friends .
I believe people should use Twitter in whatever way that best serves them , since the beauty of the site is that you do n't have to follow anyone you do n't want to hear from .
With that said , this post by Gautham Nagesh at The Hill 's tech blog blew me away :
Utah Attorney General used his Twitter account Friday to announce the execution by firing squad of convicted killer Ronnie Lee Gardner .
" I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner 's execution .
May
God grant him the mercy he denied his victims , " attorney general Mark Shurtleff tweeted after midnight on Friday .
I admit that part of my issue with this is that I think that capital punishment is generally indefensible .
But more than that , tweeting about someone 's death — even the death of a convicted murderer — strikes me as callous and not fitting for the gravity of the situation .
It would be different if , say , he had tweeted a link to a press release .
But to send out a message about the end of someone 's life so cavalierly .
It boggles .

A while ago I laid out a small set of productivity principles that sum up what makes me really productive .
Distilled from a million tips I read online on a daily basis , they ’re the gems that make the most difference in my everyday life .
From the time I wrote that article , I had the chance to try many new principles that are probably as effective as those .
So , there you go : the six tried and tested new productivity principles that have been working exceptionally well for me — and which can make you feel at your best too .
Principle 6 : Goals are for today , not for the future .
I got this insight from Steve Pavlina ‘s book Personal Development for Smart People , and it ’s as simple as it ’s powerful :
The point of goal - setting is to improve the quality of the present .
For a long time , I was setting goals that were like punishments : their only purpose was to serve as whips to get me to work .
“ Sacrifice yourself now to reap the benefits later ” was the rationale .
No wonder I have had a hate relationship with goals for a long time — I ’m glad things have changed now .
Set goals that make you feel powerful , motivated , and driven when you focus on them , long before the final outcome is actually realized .
So the debate about setting your goals on a daily , weekly or yearly basis does n’t really matter much .
What matters is that your goals create not only a better tomorrow but above all a better today for you .
How to Apply this Principle
Ask “ Will committing to this goal improve my present reality ? ”
If you ca n’t find a good answer , either refine the goal or throw it away .
For example : Suppose your goal is to ‘ save money ’ .
The goal is just not worth it if it makes you feel miserable .
But if ‘ saving money ’ makes you feel more confident about what you could do tomorrow , empowered and in control , that ’s a keeper .
Principle 5 : Do you want to improve ?
Track it !
Do you want to exercise every day ?
Then track the days when you exercise on a calendar .
Do you want to write the best book ever ?
Track how many words a day you actually write .
You can improve anything you do if you pay attention to it on a regular basis .
When you track , you get cold , brutally honest data .
That means , for example , realizing that you ’re writing zero words for your novel , day in and day out , exactly as your blank calendar makes painfully clear .
Nothing is more revealing ( and shocking ! ) than real - world data — real data about your actual world .
And guess what : once you start tracking , you may not even need to do any conscious effort to improve .
There ’s a phenomenon called the Hawthorne effect : we change our behavior just by being aware that we ’re being watched .
This means that tracking , by itself , can set in motion the changes that you need without any further conscious effort !
How to Apply this Principle
Use ( simple ) tracking systems .
Take anything you want to improve and create a simple spreadsheet or table in your notebook .
And since you may need to record data often , tracking should be fast and easy , otherwise it wo n’t work .
Keep a journal .
Writing regularly is a great way to track your thoughts in a more informal way ; it helps clarify what you think about any topic you choose .
An effective way to track the topics that matter to you is by using the Topics du Jour technique .
Principle 4 : Treat upcoming decisions as regular tasks .
I firmly believe that taking commitments seriously is paramount for leading a productive life ( as I ’ve outlined in one of the principles in the original manifesto — “ Honor Thy Commitments ” ) .
However , that raises a big issue : when we aim at honoring all our commitments , we tend to hesitate a lot before accepting any new ones into our lives to begin with .
And avoiding new commitments usually manifests itself as delayed decisions .
After all , for every decision we make , it means that all tasks associated with it have been officially ‘ welcomed into ’ our lives , like it or not .
Those pending decisions are big energy drains and a major source of procrastination : we ca n’t afford to let them hang around for too long .
They not only deplete our energy but , most importantly , delay meaningful , important action in our lives .
And , perversely , decisions with the greatest payoffs are the ones that we tend to put off the most .
How to Apply this Principle
Make upcoming decisions explicit .
Do n’t let important decisions drift aimlessly in your head : treat them exactly like any other of your tasks .
Write them down and deal with them .
Put them in your to - do list and allocate the amount of time necessary to make the decision .
Set a time limit for making decisions .
Oftentimes we have the illusion that if we just wait a bit longer , it will become easier to make the decision — but in fact that usually simply compounds the problem .
Most of the time , it ’s better to just decide ( imperfectly ) , adjusting to the results of our choices as we go .
Set a timer and commit to having the decision made by the time the alarm goes off .
Principle 3 : Keep it simple , sweetie .
When creating to - do lists , setting goals and the like , I always assume that these things will be used by the dumbest person I can think of — me .
And I ’m right : although I usually feel very smart when setting goals and planning , the “ doer ” in me is indeed the dumbest person I know …
This “ other me ” ( which is in control most of the time ) is a procrastinator .
He looks for any excuse to escape work .
He wants things to be complicated — because it ’s in complexity that he finds ways to avoid work without feeling guilty — while pretending to be very busy indeed .
So yes , we still want to plan , set goals , review ; but let ’s keep things simple — otherwise the doer in us will find ways to avoid the important stuff .
Simple tasks lists , simple goals , simple reminders .
How to Apply this Principle
Use simple tools and systems .
Do n’t make it complicated .
Use pen and paper or other simple tools .
Remember : your goals and plans are only support tools for action , and you should n’t spend any more time or effort than necessary on these things .
Always look for ways to simplify things .
This is more than an isolated act — it ’s a mindset .
Constantly look for opportunities to simplify routines and put time and effort streamlining them .
To make things simple is one of the most difficult things there is , but it pays off !
Principle 2 : Fresh starts , every day .
It ’s impossible to be productive every single day .
There will be setbacks .
There will be times when you will succumb to distractions .
It ’s a fact of life , and that ’s OK .
Do n’t fret over lost time ; do n’t try to catch up with yesterday ’s unfinished tasks .
If yesterday was bad , just start afresh today .
I like to think about this as a “ productivity meditation ” : if something sidetracks me , all I care about is getting focused again .
Do n’t analyze , do n’t criticize , just focus on getting back on track again .
Be forgiving with yourself and move on .
The flip side of the coin is that if you ’re having many good days in a row this is no guarantee that you ’ll have a good day next .
So , treat each new day as a new personal mini-challenge : forget past successes and failures .
Now is all that matters .
How to Apply this Principle
Treat each day as “ day zero ” :
Let go of sunk costs : act like all you have is today .
Forget tomorrow and yesterday : focus on doing your best just for today .
Do n’t fail twice in a row .
This is a technique I ’ve been trying lately with success .
It ’s simply an ‘ escape clause ’ : if you fail one time , make it your top priority not to fail for the second time at this task .
So , if you missed today ’s practice , no big deal .
But tomorrow , make that your topmost priority .
This guarantees you will get back on track quickly and make you feel terrific again in no time .
Principle 1 : You already know what to do .
Let ’s face it : most of the time you do n’t need a “ productivity system ” to get stuff done .
Although I believe that tools like task lists , goals and tracking sheets can be really useful , the fact is that they ’re only that — tools .
Just like any other tool , though , they can be misused or become an end in themselves .
Easy goals can distract us from what really matters .
Long task lists can be merely a way to show how busy we are , when in fact we ’re not sure what to do next .
We like spinning our wheels and will go to great lengths to avoid tasks we find unpleasant .
It turns out that , most of the time — right in our guts — we already know what to do .
And that ’s usually not in our to - do lists or calendars .
No system can force you to do anything .
You can “ set priorities ” and “ get organized ” but in the end , no matter how sophisticated your lists are , you ’ll still need the courage to act on what matters .
How to Apply this Principle
Listen to your fears .
What are you avoiding ?
If you ’re spending energy avoiding something , you should pay closer attention to it .
Learn to identify your tendency to procrastinate and then act on what matters , even if you feel uncomfortable at first .
Keep important things in front of you .
What is the most important thing you need to do ?
Write it on a piece of paper and keep it in front of you .
Make it hard to escape from it .
Get used to making it go away by means of action , not by running away from it .
How do these principles apply to you ?
Do these principles resonate with you ?
Do you have anything to add ?
What works and what does n’t for you ?
I ’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments !
Also , if you have n’t yet , make sure you check part I of this article , which I pompously called my “ Personal Productivity Manifesto ” ( though , as you can see , is not a fixed set of values by any means … )
Thanks !

Summary :
The IEEE ’s promotion of proprietary software is made more apparent by its position on software patents after deals with Microsoft and other monopolistic entities ; Centrify wants to put Microsoft tax in Red Hat and Fedora
ONE OF THE world ’s leading computer scientists is against them , but the IEEE is in favour of them .
What are they ?
Monopolies on algorithms .
Professor ‘ Algorithm ’ Knuth has already explained that “ there are far better ways to protect the intellectual property rights of software developers than to take away their right to use fundamental building blocks . ”
He must be referring to copyrights and / or trade secrets .
The disparity between these views of Knuth ( creator of LaTeX , which is Free software TeX ) and the views of the IEEE ( where Knuth is a special person for several different reasons ) ought to be resolved because it ’s rather shocking to find this new press release which chooses neither to be neutral nor to reject software patents .
IEEE -USA pleased that Supreme Court ’s ruling preserves software patents The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 Monday that a new method of doing business can be patented , and that the ability to patent software should not be limited .
What ’s not too shocking is the IEEE ’s active lobbying for software patents , especially given what we already know about the IEEE and Microsoft , for example .
Over the years we have accumulated numerous examples where the IEEE takes a position which is hostile towards software freedom and towards computer science in general .
Software patents are bad for all programmers in general , except the large employers of programmers ( whose managers exclude competition and thus increase profits , using software patents ) .
It ’s “ time to boycott IEEE , ” writes the president of the FFII in relation to the press release shown above .
Bradley M. Kuhn ( FSF / SFLC ) takes a constructive approach .
Yesterday he released this oggcast / audiocast which analyses the Bilski decision .
Dan Ravicher joins Karen and Bradley to discuss the Bilski case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court .
This show was released on Tuesday 29 June 2010 ; its running time is 1:14:22 .
Kuhn also posted in his blog some advice for those who want to dodge software patents in the United States , using software licences .
He endorses APGLv3 , GPLv3 , LGPLv3 , and Apache - 2.0 ( they have ‘ teeth ’ to defend against software patents ambush ) .
Lots of people are opining about the USA Supreme Court ’s ruling in the Bilski case .
Yesterday , I participated in a oggcast with the folks at SFLC .
In that oggcast , Dan Ravicher explained most of the legal details of Bilski ; I could never cover them as well as he did , and I would n’t even try .
Anyway , as a non-lawyer worried about the policy questions , I ’m pretty much only concerned about those forward - looking policy questions .
Looking back at how our community responded to this Bilski situation over the last 18 months , some of it seems similar to what happened while the Eldred case was working its way to the Supreme Court .
In the months preceding both Eldred and Bilski , there seemed to be a mass hypnosis that the Supreme Court would actually change copyright law ( Eldred ) or patent law ( Bilski ) to make it better for freedom of computer users . [...]
License your software APGLv3 , GPLv3 , LGPLv3 or Apache - 2.0 .
Among the copyleft licenses , AGPLv3 and GPLv3 offer the best patent protections ; LGPLv3 offers the best among the weak copyleft licenses ; Apache License 2.0 offers the best patent protections among the permissive licenses .
These are the licenses we should gravitate toward , particularly when now that it is certain that companies with software patents are coming after Free Software .
At least when such companies contribute code to projects under these licenses , we know those particular codebases will be safe from that particular company ’s patents .
GNU / Linux ought to watch out for Microsoft offshoots of sorts , such as Centrify [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .
Their proposition is compatibility with Microsoft , but what they actually sell is access to Microsoft ’s software patents , which have been more or less upheld in the United States but nowhere else .
Centrify is trying to bring this Microsoft patent tax to Fedora 13 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 right now whilst Microsoft continues to mock the need for server interoperability .
The company called Likewise also has roots in Microsoft and it operates similarly , by offering a Samba - type product with Microsoft patent tax [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
For those who still wonder why Microsoft protocols and software patents are counter productive , look no further . █

You'd think spending a billion dollars on a smartphone company would indicate a desire to , say , make and sell smartphones , but you 'd apparently be thinking wrong : HP CEO Mark Hurd just told investors at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch tech conference that his company " did n't buy Palm to be in the smartphone business , " and that he's not going to " spend billions of dollars trying to go into the smartphone business ; that does n't in any way make any sense . "
Yes , that sound you 're hearing is Jon Rubinstein 's heart breaking into a million tiny pieces .
According to Hurd , HP was actually more interested in Palm 's IP -- specifically webOS , which he wants to put on " tens of millions of HP small form - factor web - connected devices . "
Sure , that makes sense , and it lines up perfectly with HP 's plan to " double down on webOS " and put it on everything from netbooks and slates to printers , but hey , Mark ?
You should really look into the smartphone business when you get a second , okay ?
Just trust us on this one .
We did n't buy Palm to be in the smartphone business .
And I tell people that , but it does n't seem to resonate well .
We bought it for the IP .
The WebOS is one of the two ground - up pieces of software that is built as a web operating environment ... We have tens of millions of HP small form factor web - connected devices ... Now imagine that being a web - connected environment where now you can get a common look and feel and a common set of services laid against that environment .
That is a very value proposition .

Olivia Judson on the influence of science and biology on modern life .
Imagine .
You are lying in the grass in the east African savannah , watching wildebeest fording a shallow river .
You can hear the funny grunting noises they make , and as they pass by , you can feel the impact of their hooves on the ground and smell their rich animal smell .
You see their kicking heels , their beautiful sleek bodies .
Then you look up , and you realize that the herd stretches as far as you can see , that the plain is dark with wildebeest .
If you were to wait for them all to pass , you would be there for days .
The sight is magnificent , primal and profoundly moving .
It is the wildebeest migration .
Every year , more than a million wildebeest , along with hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles , move through the Serengeti - Mara ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya , following the rains .
In the course of a year , an individual wildebeest may cover as much as 2,100 kilometers .
( That ’s more than 1,300 miles — which is further than the distance between New York and New Orleans . )
It is the last great migration on Earth .
But for how much longer ?
A large part of the migration takes place within the vast Serengeti National Park in Tanzania , and there are reports that the Tanzanian government is preparing to build a major road through the northern part of the park : through a designated wilderness area , through the migration route .
Roads are catastrophic for wildlife .
The experiment has been done again and again all over the world : we know .
Among the problems : roads allow the easy spread of invasive plant species , as car tires often carry their seeds .
Roads also allow the rapid spread of animal diseases , and lead to an increase in poaching , building and other human activities .
But by far the biggest problem is that roads fragment habitats and disrupt animal movements .
Many animals are reluctant to cross roads , even those with little traffic .
And when there is a lot of traffic , the lives of people and animals are both at risk .
Grant Hopcraft
The usual solution is to fence the road to protect the cars .
Doing this here would likely end the migration , cause the collapse of the wildebeest population — and destroy the Serengeti as we know it .
The reason is that the lands to the north of the proposed road remain wet when the lands to the south have become dry .
Unable to reach the water , tens of thousands of animals would die of hunger and thirst ; many would become tangled in the fence .
Building the road with animal tunnels or overpasses , as has been done in Canada and other countries , would be expensive and impractical ; moreover , it probably would not work , as wildebeest are sensitive to disturbance .
They already avoid areas frequented by poachers , and are alarmed by cars .
And if the migration stopped , the Serengeti would cease to be the Serengeti , for the wildebeest define the ecosystem and drive its dynamics .
The migration is the reason the wildebeest are so numerous : it allows them to transcend the limitations imposed by local supplies of food , water and predators .
And in their travels , the animals spread nutrients throughout the system .
They fertilize plants with their urine and dung , and trample the soil .
By doing so , they help to maintain a diverse array of plants , insects and birds , and are themselves food for large numbers of lions and hyenas .
Wildebeest also help to maintain large numbers of humans .
Tourism accounts for 8 percent of gross domestic product in Tanzania , and more than 600,000 jobs .
If the migration stopped , tourism would likely decline .
After all , there would be much less to see .
Good roads are , of course , an important part of economic development .
They connect isolated communities , and allow for the trucking of commodities between inland areas and port cities .
One of the challenges of conservation is balancing the needs of humans today while protecting the resources of tomorrow .
Felix Borner
But the peculiar thing about this road is that it is not a case of animals versus people .
There is an alternative — a road to the south of the park that would connect five times more people , and cost less to build .
It would also be easier , since the landscape there is flatter ; and it would not affect the animal migrations .
And the northern road has been vigorously rejected on environmental grounds before .
Even more peculiar : up to now , the government of Tanzania has had an outstanding record of conservation .
Around a quarter of the country ’s area is managed with a view to preserving wildlife , and at 50,000 square kilometers ( almost 20,000 square miles ) the Selous Game Reserve is the largest protected area in Africa .
Tanzania boasts seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites , of which four are nature reserves — including the Serengeti National Park .
Moreover , the president of Tanzania , Dr. Jakaya Kikwete , is known for his interest in nature .
When six black rhinos arrived in the Serengeti in May — they were flown in from South Africa as part of a rhino relocation program — the president himself was there to meet them , and he has often spoken of the importance of the parks to Tanzania .
Indeed , he sometimes quotes Tanzania ’s first president , Julius Nyerere :
“ The survival of our wildlife is a matter of grave concern to all of us in Africa .
These wild creatures amid the wild places they inhabit are not only important as a resource of wonder and inspiration but are an integral part of our natural resources and our future livelihood and wellbeing .
In accepting the trusteeship of our wildlife we solemnly declare that we will do everything in our power to make sure that our children ’s grand - children will be able to enjoy this rich and precious heritage . ”
It is not clear why the Serengeti road is being considered : I was unable to reach anyone in the Tanzanian government who would comment .
But what is clear is that one of the most marvelous and awe - inspiring sights on the planet might soon vanish , killed by a road .
Notes :
I was lucky enough to see the northern part of the wildebeest migration in Kenya in 1998 , and I can attest that it is an amazing and beautiful sight .
The distance an average wildebeest travels in a year was communicated to me in an e-mail from Grant Hopcraft of the University of Groningen .
I got the distance between New York and New Orleans from here .
A northern road through the Serengeti has been under discussion for a number of years .
The route of the proposed road can be seen on a statement from the Frankfurt Zoological Society .
Evidence that the road is moving forward has come to me from a number of sources , including a copy of a letter sent by Dr. Christof Schenck , the director general of the Frankfurt Zoological Society to His Excellency Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete , President of Tanzania , on May 31 , 2010 ; and a copy of a letter sent by Tim Clarke , Ambassador to Tanzania for the European Union , to Mr. Shukuru Kawambwa , Minister of Infrastructure for Tanzania on April 9 , 2010 .
There have also been some press reports .
One appeared in the Tanzanian newspaper The Guardian on Sunday , June 13 , 2010 , with the title “ Government to build highway through sensitive Serengeti ” ; the author was Adam Ihucha .
It can be read here ; type “ sensitive serengeti ” into the search box .
Another article appeared in Britain ’s Sunday Express .
The northern road through the Serengeti National Park was vigorously rejected by a Norconsult study in November 1996 .
See the United Republic of Tanzania Ministry of Works , Technical and Socio - Economic Feasibility Study : Makuyuni – Musoma Road , Final Report .
A different conclusion was reached by a more recent report by Inter - Consult , prepared for the Ministry of Infrastructure Development in November 2007 .
See “ Tanzania National Roads Agency ( TANROADS ) Environmental and Social Impact Assessment , Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design for Natta- Mugumu - Tabora B- Klein ’s Camp - Loliondo Road ( 239 km ) Upgrading Project ” Volume 5 , Environmental Impact Assessment Report : Final Report .
This report recognizes that there will be an impact on wildlife , but argues ( implausibly , in my view ) that it can be mitigated .
The alternative southern road , along with the numbers of people it would connect and the costs of building it , is documented in a presentation called “ The Serengeti North Road Project ” prepared by Borner , M. , Bigurube , G. and Sinclair , A. R. E .

This last paper also shows how herbivores such as wildebeest increase the productivity of the grasslands .
Ending migrations has repeatedly caused animal populations to crash ; given the known importance of wildebeest for maintaining the Serengeti ecoystem , it follows that the ending the migration would alter the landscape in numerous ways .

Many thanks to Dan Haydon , Grant Hopcraft , Tony Sinclair and Jonathan Swire for insights , comments and suggestions .
Now that the cancellation of Law & Order has been announced , I can say what I ’ve been wanting to write for the past 24 hours :
Everyone who ’s now talking about how much the show will be missed … where were ya when it counted ?
Law & Order has been having a very good season .
The frequent fireworks between Sam Waterston and his ADAs played by Linus Roache and Alana de la Garza were colorful sparklers .
The series ’ rare private - life subplot — the cancer diagnosis received by S. Epatha Merkeson ’s Lt. Van Buren — has been handled with both muted emotion and an unsentimental realism rare for TV .
But the fact that I even have to remind you of who ’s doing what on the current show points to Law & Order ‘s relative irrelevance to many people , and to the media .
I do n’t see Roache or de la Garza popping up on many of those “ TV ’s hottest hotties ! ” lists , and magazines and newspapers have missed out on good excuses to do lengthy career profiles of Waterston or Merkerson because … well , because by today ’s media standards , they ’re not Twitter - trending topics of interest .
It ’s almost hard to believe now , in this time of twisting narratives in everything from Lost to Damages , that when it premiered in 1990 , Law & Order ‘s premise was considered novel — even a bit radical .
Dividing an hour - long drama into two halves , one for the police procedural , and the last 30 minutes for the courtroom drama ?
How schizophrenic , some said .
Skeptics jeered that NBC might lose viewers for one half or the other , if their favorite characters did n’t remain onscreen for the full 60 minutes .
But the public really liked the format , which was a new take combining the cop and lawyer genres .
The show maintained a broad audience for a long time , in part because it had an age - and ethnic - diverse cast .
People loved the stern - uncle approach of Steven Hill ’s D.A. Adam Schiff , and producer Dick Wolf maintained a revolving door of attractive young women of varying degrees of charm , including Jill Hennessey , Carrie Lowell , Angie Harmon , and Elisabeth Rohm .
The men were also uneven wild - cards : Michael Moriarty was an entertainingly mannered eccentric years before Vincent D’Onofrio took over that territory on Criminal Intent , and some folks never did cotton to the folksy mumbling of Fred Thompson when he replaced Steven Hill and Diane Wiest as D.A .
L&O prided itself on ripped - from - the - headlines plots , trading on the controversies of the day .
But at the same time , it was also comfort - television :
You knew most cases would be wrapped up within the hour , you knew that even if the prosecution lost , there ’d be a few words of bittersweet wisdom to be gleaned from Hill or Waterston just before the fade - out .
The show ’s New York location - shooting gave it a distinctive look : hazy gray , low - budget , old Manhattan architecture .
The series also provided work for countless New York - based actors whose true vocation was the stage , and who used their L&O day - player paychecks to continue pursuing their Broadway dreams .
( Ben Shenkman , Jack Gilpin , Kate Burton , Elaine Stritch , Frances Sternhagen , and Mary Beth Hurt were among the many to sit on the witness stand , or wear judge ’s robes , or sit behind the battered metal desk in the interrogation room . )
In the history of TV , Law & Order served as a bridge between the first generations of cop and law shows ( Dragnet ; The Defenders ) and the new breed of such shows ( NYPD Blue ; Homicide : Life on the Streets ; The Practice ) .
It was a sturdy bridge , even when its workers left and were replaced .
Behind the scenes ,
Wolf was a pioneer in the idea that it was the concept , not the stars , that people tuned in to see .
As soon as a featured actor made noise about money or a bigger role , he or she could find themselves disappeared quicker than a General Pinochet protester .
Law & Order was never “ cool . ”
It was as soothing as the lousy puns and hangdog sincerity of the late Jerry Orbach ’s Lennie Briscoe .
( Although Chris Noth and Jesse L. Martin both lent their cool - cat moodinesses to the show for a time . )
In recent years , the more hyperbolic Special Victims Unit got the bigger ratings and more attention .
But Law & Order made a case for the decency — and flaws — of the justice system as well as any work of popular culture , and gave us a lot of fine acting in the bargain .
It 's hardly a secret that large segments of the population choose not to accept scientific data because it conflicts with their predefined beliefs : economic , political , religious , or otherwise .
But many studies have indicated that these same people are n't happy with viewing themselves as anti-science , which can create a state of cognitive dissonance .
That has left psychologists pondering the methods that these people use to rationalize the conflict .
A study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology takes a look at one of these methods , which the authors term " scientific impotence " — the decision that science can't actually address the issue at hand properly .
It finds evidence that not only supports the scientific impotence model , but suggests that it could be contagious .
Once a subject has decided that a given topic is off limits to science , they tend to start applying the same logic to other issues .
The paper is worth reading for the introduction alone , which sets up the problem of science acceptance within the context of persuasive arguments and belief systems .
There 's a significant amount of literature that considers how people resist persuasion , and at least seven different strategies have been identified .
But the author , Towson University 's Geoffrey Munro , attempts to carve out an exceptional place for scientific information .
" Belief - contradicting scientific information may elicit different resistance processes than belief - contradicting information of a nonscientific nature , " he argues .
" Source derogation , for example , might be less effective in response to scientific than nonscientific information . "
It might be , but many of the arguments against mainstream science make it clear that it 's not .
Evolution doubters present science as an atheistic conspiracy ; antivaccination advocates consider the biomedical research community to be hopelessly corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry ; and climatologists have been accused of being in it to foster everything from their own funding to global governance .
Clearly , source derogation is very much on the table .
If that method of handling things is dismissed a bit abruptly , Munro makes a better case for not addressing an alternative way of dismissing scientific data : identifying perceived methodological flaws .
This definitely occurs , as indicated by references cited in the paper , but it 's not an option for everyone .
Many people reject scientific information without having access to the methodology that produced it or the ability to understand it if they did .
So , although selective attacks on methodology take place , they 're not necessarily available to everyone who chooses to dismiss scientific findings .
What Munro examines here is an alternative approach : the decision that , regardless of the methodological details , a topic is just not accessible to scientific analysis .
This approach also has a prominent place among those who disregard scientific information , ranging from the very narrow — people who argue that the climate is simply too complicated to understand — to the extremely broad , such as those among the creationist movement who argue that the only valid science takes place in the controlled environs of a lab , and thereby dismiss not only evolution , but geology , astronomy , etc .
To get at this issue , Munro polled a set of college students about their feelings about homosexuality , and then exposed them to a series of generic scientific abstracts that presented evidence that it was or was n't a mental illness ( a control group read the same abstracts with nonsense terms in place of sexual identities ) .
By chance , these either challenged or confirmed the students ' preconceptions .
The subjects were then given the chance to state whether they accepted the information in the abstracts and , if not , why not .
Regardless of whether the information presented confirmed or contradicted the students ' existing beliefs , all of them came away from the reading with their beliefs strengthened .
As expected , a number of the subjects that had their beliefs challenged chose to indicate that the subject was beyond the ability of science to properly examine .
This group then showed a weak tendency to extend that same logic to other areas , like scientific data on astrology and herbal remedies .
A second group went through the same initial abstract - reading process , but were then given an issue to research ( the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent to violent crime ) , and offered various sources of information on the issue .
The group that chose to discount scientific information on the human behavior issue were more likely than their peers to evaluate nonscientific material when it came to making a decision about the death penalty .
There are a number of issues with the study : the sample size was small , college students are probably atypical in that they 're constantly being exposed to challenging information , and there was no attempt to determine the students ' scientific literacy on the topic going in .
That last point seems rather significant , since the students were recruited from a psychology course , and majors in that field might be expected to already know the state of the field .
So , this study would seem to fall in the large category of those that are intriguing , but in need of a more rigorous replication .
It 's probably worth making the effort , however , because it might explain why doubts about mainstream science seem to travel in packs .
For example , the Discovery Institute , famed for hosting a petition that questions our understanding of evolution , has recently taken up climate change as an additional issue ( they do n't believe the scientific community on that topic , either ) .
The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine is best known for hosting a petition that questions the scientific consensus on climate change , but the people who run it also promote creationism and question the link between HIV and AIDS .
Within the scientific community , there has been substantial debate over how best to deal with the public 's refusal to accept basic scientific findings , with different camps arguing for increasing scientific literacy , challenging beliefs , or emphasizing the compatibility between belief and science .
Confirming that the scientific impotence phenomenon is real might induce the scientific community to consider whether any of the public engagement models they 're currently arguing over would actually be effective at addressing this issue .

A LABOR MP has backed calls for the federal government to intervene to help close and replace Australia 's '' dirtiest ' ' power station , the Hazelwood coal - fired plant in the Latrobe Valley .
Kelvin Thomson , the member for Wills in Melbourne 's northern suburbs , praised a report that suggests the Hazelwood plant could be replaced by 2012 at a cost of about $ 320 million a year .
In a speech to Parliament , Mr Thomson said there was a case for the Commonwealth and Victorian governments to help negotiate an early close with the plant 's owners , International Power .
It comes as some government MPs push for a major revamp of climate change policy before the federal election , in a bid to regain support lost when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said carbon trading would be delayed until at least 2013 .
The report , commissioned by Environment Victoria , estimates shutting Hazelwood would cut Victoria 's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 12 per cent , and national emissions by 3 per cent .
LIESTAL , Switzerland -- Lance Armstrong wrapped up his Tour de France preparations on a high note , finishing second in the Tour of Switzerland on Sunday , 12 seconds behind Frank Schleck of Luxembourg .
The seven - time Tour de France champion was seventh overall going into the stage , but surged into contention by placing 11th in the 16.6 - mile time trial around Liestal , finishing in 33 minutes , 30 seconds to trail stage winner Tony Martin of Germany by 1:09 .
Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara finished second in the stage , 17 seconds back , while American David Zabriskie clocked the third best time , 29 seconds behind .

Following bouts of illness and a crash earlier this season , Armstrong posted a strong performance in Switzerland , showing his 38 - year - old legs are still able to compete in high mountains and produce a solid performance in time trials .
Armstrong escaped serious injury when he crashed at the Tour of California in May , but it was a big setback in his preparations for cycling 's three - week showcase .
The cancer survivor made up for the race days he lost by competing in the Tour of Luxembourg , where he finished third , before racing in Switzerland .
Armstrong was pleased with his result heading into the Tour .
" I think if we look at the field here , on all levels , the climbers , the sprinters ... and the speed and compare it to the alternative race , this is what you 'll see at the Tour , " Armstrong said .
" For whatever reason , this race attracted all sorts of favorites , this is a good indication of what 's coming up .
I just have to stay healthy and try and find an extra 1 percent . "
The American plans to scout four mountain stages of this year 's
Tour next week before heading to Rotterdam , Netherlands , where the race starts on July 3 .
Following a 3 ½ - year retirement , Armstrong struggled in time trials last year , a discipline in which he had excelled during his heyday .
He started slowly Sunday but rallied after the first seven miles , gaining ground on the long descent to the finish .
" It was a hard time trial , it was relentless , actually I had to drive all the way , there was no recovery apart from the downhill , " Armstrong said after posting his best overall result since last year 's Tour de France , where he finished third .
Team RadioShack director Johan Bruyneel said Armstrong 's condition is improving .
" It 's a shame to lose by 12 seconds , but if somebody had told me before the race that Lance would finish second , I would have signed for it , " Bruyneel said .
" We have to be very happy .
His condition is satisfying .
The biggest part of the job has been done . "
Saxo Bank rider Jacob Fuglsang of Denmark finished third overall , 17 seconds back , while previous race leader Robert Gesink of the Netherlands dropped to fifth , 27 seconds adrift .
Schleck started the day fourth overall and secured the win by finishing 13th in the time trial , five seconds behind Armstrong .
" I surprised myself because I 'm not a time trial specialist , " Schleck said .
" But with [ my brother ]
Andy we did a specific work to improve in time trials and it paid off . "
Schleck , also expected to contend at the Tour , dedicated his victory to fellow Luxembourg cyclist Kim Kirchen , who was still in an induced coma Sunday after a heart attack on Friday night .
" Me , Andy and my entire family we really hope that things will go better quickly , " Schleck said .
" My victory is for him . "
Two - time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador , who did n't race in Switzerland , is favored to defend his title next month and Armstrong acknowledged this week it will be difficult to derail his rival 's ambitions .
But his second place - finish gave him a major morale boost before the Tour , the only race that really matters to him .
" I was third in Luxembourg , second here , I 'll do the math for the next race , " Armstrong said .
Arizona Republicans say they plan to introduce new legislation this fall that , if passed , would block the children of undocumented immigrants from becoming citizens if they were born in the United States .
Arizona is already facing a national boycott by other U.S. states and cities following its introduction of a controversial law , S.B. 1070 , signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer in April .
That law requires police to determine a person ’s immigration status if there is “ reasonable suspicion ” they are undocumented .
Both measures are the brainchild of state Sen. Russell Pearce who argues that children born on American soil to non-U.S. citizens should be barred from attaining birth certificates .
Federal law under the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution automatically grants citizenship to any child born in the country regardless of their parents ’ legal status .
Speaking to Time magazine last week Pearce said Latino immigrants that end up in the U.S. “ is an orchestrated effort by them to come here and have children to gain access to the great welfare state we ’ve created . ”
Calling children born to immigrant parents “ anchor babies , ” Pearce adds the 14th amendment has been “ hijacked ” by undocumented immigrants .
“ They use it as a wedge issue , ” he says .
Gov. Brewer and other Arizona Republicans have indicated their support for Pearce ’s new proposal and his anti-immigrant agenda .
In a recent interview with Tucson ABC affiliate KGUN Brewer said , “ It ’s illegal to trespass into our country .
And people have determined that they want to take that chance .
They can take their children back with them . ”
However opponents of the proposed legislation say such a move is contrary to the Constitution and the American spirit .
And although such a measure would not reach the Arizona Senate floor for months , critics say they are ready to fight it from the start and are not taking any chances .
Kyrsten Sinema , a Democratic state representative in Arizona who is a fierce opponent to S.B. 1070 speaking to CNN said , “ Unlike [ Senate Bill ] 1070 , it is clear this bill runs immediately afoul of the U.S. Constitution . ”
She notes , “ While I understand that folks in Arizona and across the country support S.B. 1070 , they do so because we have seen no action from the federal government .
Unfortunately , the so - called ‘ anchor baby ’ bill does nothing to solve the real problems facing Arizona . ”
Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona told the Daily Caller , “ We will definitely challenge if it does get passed .
It is clearly unconstitutional , discriminatory and it fuels this anti-immigrant agenda .
That really is not what our state needs right now , ” she said .
Pearce has proposed similar bills in Arizona twice before , but both attempts were voted down in the state ’s House .
Pearce is a long - time critic of the modern interpretation of the 14th amendment .
He has a whole section on his website in which he argues why the original authors of the amendment never would have extended the right to undocumented immigrants .
Ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War in 1868 , the amendment reads , “ All persons , born or naturalized in the United Sates , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States .
No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . ”
The amendment was drafted in order to secure the citizenship and Constitutional rights of freed slaves and their children .
Previous efforts , including one in the late 19th century challenging the citizenship of the children of Chinese immigrants , have been unsuccessful .
The right of Arizona to attempt to deny U.S. citizenship could ultimately end up in the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ It ’s blatantly unconstitutional , ” said Sinema to the Daily Caller .
Sinema , who was a constitutional lawyer before her election to the Arizona House says Pearce ’s new proposal wo n’t pass muster and it ’s in direct violation of the 1868 amendment .
“ There ’s no way this would ever go into effect , and he knows it , ” she said .

A rare white elephant , historically considered an omen of political change , has been captured in the west of military - ruled Myanmar , state media reported Tuesday .
The female pachyderm was captured by officials on Saturday in the coastal town of Maungtaw in Rakhine state , the New Light of Myanmar newspaper said .
She is aged about 38 and seven feet four inches ( more than two metres ) tall , the English - language paper said , although it did not mention where she would be kept .
Kings and leaders in Myanmar , a predominantly Buddhist country , have traditionally treasured white elephants , whose rare appearances in the country are believed to herald political change .
The Southeast Asian country , which has been military - ruled since 1962 , is due to hold its first elections for two decades later this year , although a date has not yet been announced .

Americans Have a Right to Unfiltered Information About the Human Costs of War , ACLU Says
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union today made public hundreds of claims for damages by family members of civilians killed or injured by Coalition Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The ACLU received the records in response to a Freedom of Information Act request it filed in June 2006 .
The hundreds of files provide a vivid snapshot , in significantly more detail than has previously been compiled and released , of the circumstances surrounding reports of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Since U.S. troops first set foot in Afghanistan in 2001 , the Defense Department has gone to unprecedented lengths to control and suppress information about the human costs of war , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry , and it is critical that the American people have access to full and accurate information about the prosecution of the war and the implications for innocent civilians . "
The ACLU pointed out that during both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the Defense Department has instituted numerous policies designed to control information about the human costs of war .
These policies include :
Banning photographers on U.S. military bases from covering the arrival of caskets containing the remains of U.S. soldiers killed overseas ;
Paying Iraqi journalists to write positive accounts of the U.S. war effort ;
Inviting U.S. journalists to " embed " with military units but requiring them to submit their stories for pre-publication review ;
Erasing journalists ' footage of civilian deaths in Afghanistan ; and
Refusing to disclose statistics on civilian casualties .
The files made public today are claims submitted to the U.S. Foreign Claims Commissions by surviving Iraqi and Afghan family members of civilians said to have been killed or injured or to have suffered property damages due to actions by Coalition Forces .
The ACLU released a total of 496 files : 479 from Iraq and 17 from Afghanistan .
The documents released by the ACLU are available online in a searchable database at www.aclu.org/civiliancasualties
Most of the Iraq claims range from early 2003 to late 2006 ; the majority are from 2005 .
Most claims from Afghanistan are from May 2006 , with one dating back to 2001 .
Based on the number of deaths represented and the variation in number and location of claims per year , the ACLU said it believes there are additional documents being withheld and is pressing the Defense Department to disclose them all .
Of the 496 files , 198 were denied because the military found that the incidents arose " from action by an enemy or resulted directly or indirectly from an act of the armed forces of the United States in combat , " which the military calls " combat exclusion . "
Of the 496 claims , 164 incidents resulted in cash payments to family members .
In approximately half of the cash payment cases , the United States accepted responsibility for the death of the civilian and offered a " compensation payment . "
In the other half , U.S. authorities issued " condolence " payments , which are discretionary payments capped at $ 2,500 and offered " as an expression of sympathy " but " without reference to fault . "
Claims based on incidents that were not reported in the military 's " SIGACT " ( " significant act " ) database , despite eyewitness corroborations , are generally denied for compensation although a condolence payment may be issued .
The files provide a window into the lives of innocent Afghans and Iraqis caught in conflict zones .
In one file , a civilian from the Salah Ad Din ( PDF ) province in eastern Iraq states that U.S. forces opened fire with more than 100 hundred rounds on his sleeping family , killing his mother , father and brother .
The firepower was of such magnitude that 32 of the family 's sheep were also killed .
The Army acknowledged responsibility and the claim resulted in two payments : a compensation payment of $ 11,200 and a $ 2,500 condolence payment .
In another file , a civilian in Baghdad states that his only son , a nine - year - old ( PDF ) , was playing outside when a stray bullet hit and killed him .
The Army acknowledged responsibility and paid compensation of $ 4,000 .
" As these files remind us , war imposes heavy burdens on innocent civilians , " said Jameel Jaffer , Deputy Director of the ACLU 's National Security Program .
" Although these files are deeply disturbing to read , they allow us to understand the human cost of war in a way that statistics and the usual platitudes do not . "
The ACLU noted that a significant number of the files - 92 of 496 - relate to deaths at checkpoints ( 50 files ) or near American convoys ( 42 files ) .
In one file , a civilian states that his son drove up to a checkpoint ( PDF ) in Kirkuk , was shot at through the roof of the car and hit in the abdomen ; he later died from his wounds .
An e-mail in the file from an Army sergeant states : " How was he supposed to know to get out of the vehicle when they fired warning shots ?
If I was in his place I would have stayed put too . "
The claim was denied although the sergeant suggested that the civilian might seek a condolence payment .
In another file , a civilian states that his mother was killed ( PDF ) , his four - year - old brother suffered shrapnel wounds to the head , and his sister was shot in the leg after the taxi they were riding in ran through a checkpoint in the eastern Iraq town of Baqubah .
An Army memorandum states : " [ T ] here is evidence to suggest that the warning cones and printed checkpoint signs had not yet been displayed in front of the checkpoint , which may be the reason why the driver of the Taxi did not believe he was required to stop . "
The Army suggested a condolence payment of $ 7,500 .
It is not known whether it was granted .
Attorneys on the FOIA project are Jaffer and Nasrina Bargzie of the national ACLU .
In a separate project , the ACLU filed a FOIA request in October 2003 for records concerning the abuse of prisoners held by U.S. forces in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay .
To date , that request has resulted in the release of more than 100,000 pages , all of which are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia.
Litigation regarding that FOIA request is ongoing .
Squats can be bad for your knees .
Period .
But they 're good for everything else .
So good , in fact , that you must do them .
I do n't care if you 're a bodybuilder , a powerlifter or a ballerina .
Ya gotta do them !
The question is , how ?
The answer is , as safely as possible without losing any of the benefits !
Sorta like drugs , no ?
The art and science of medicine dictates that while using drugs , you must minimize the risks while maximizing the benefits .
If there 's one way to take your iron pill , then , it 's in large doses !
That means squatting !
In sports , knee problems are high unto a way of life , but squatting is n't the primary culprit .
Among bodybuilders who have knee problems , however , squatting is the only culprit .
In both cases , squatting properly can reduce , prevent or ameliorate many , many of the common knee problems inherent in sports .
That they will make you a better bodybuilder or athlete is an unquestioned fact .
Speaking of the world of medicine and the practitioners thereof , you 'll find precious few who have any real , first - hand knowledge of squatting technique or its effects ( good and bad ) on the knees .
One who does is three - time California powerlifting champion Dr. Sal Arria , my fellow co-founder of the International Sports Sciences Association .
Dr. Arria , in the ISSA 's course text , Fitness : Complete Guide for personal fitness trainers , listed many common knee problems and ways to prevent them .
I 've drawn heavily from that text in writing this article .
I also drew from several other sources .
Knee Anatomy And Action
Keeping your knees healthy and asymptomatic begins with developing a functional understanding of how this unique joint is constructed ( anatomy ) and how it does and does n't function ( biomechanics ) .
The knee is a hinge - type joint , roughly equivalent to a door hinge , but with a little " twist " to lock it into full extension .
Instead of a fixed axis ( such as a door hinge has ) , however , it 's a complicated movement consisting of gliding and rotation in such a fashion that the articulating surfaces are always changing .
Hence , the axis is always changing .
That can lead to trouble , particularly during unweighted exercises such as leg extensions .
It 's almost a law that your quads and hammies should be of approximately equal strength in order to provide " balanced " development .
Some experts claim that a ham - to - quad strength ratio of 1 to 1 reduces shear and hamstring pulls .
At best , this is mere speculation .
When I was a powerlifter , my hamstrings were close to twice or three times the strength of my quads .
To keep your knees healthy , develop a functional understanding of the joint anatomy and function .
Most sprinters are much stronger in the hammie department too , because that 's what they all use !
If you give attention to muscle balance , beware that speculation is rampant .
Seven different types of tissue comprise the knee - bones , ligaments , tendons , muscles , synovial fluid ( bursa ) , adipose tissue and articular cartilage .
1. Bone :
The bony structures forming the knee joint are the femur , tibia , and the patella .
2. Ligaments : Fibrous connective tissue which connects bone to bone , providing stability and integrity to the joint .
The knee 's ligaments are divided into two groups , eight interior and six external ligaments .
3. Muscle :
We all have a clear idea as to what muscles are .
Clearly , there are no muscles in the knee joint itself .
The ones which act upon the knee joint are all external to the knee .
They are listed below :
The quadriceps , the muscles of the anterior ( front ) thigh .
Next are the hamstrings , or the leg biceps , located on the posterior thigh .
The other muscles of the knee all contribute to knee flexion and some toinward rotation .
4. Tendons : Fibrous bands that that connect the muscles listed above to their bony attachments .
The knee 's four extensors form a common tendon of insertion called the quadriceps tendon , which connects to the patella , and ( below it ) the patellar tendon to the tibial tuberosity .
5. Bursa :
A bursa is a pad - like sac or cavity found near areas subject to friction , i.e. joints , particularly those located between bony prominences and muscle or tendon .
It is lined with synovial membrane and contains synovia .
There are twelve such sacs in the knee .
6. Adipose Tissue : For padding .
7. Articular Cartilage : Cartilage is the connective tissue which provides for a smooth articulation between the bones which form the joint .
Cartilage also acts as a shock absorber .
The two semi-lunar shaped menisci are the knee 's only two cartilages .
Located on the tibial plateau , they cradle the femoral condyles , or the rounded knobs of the lower femur .
Since the tibial plateau is flat , and the femoral condyle is rounded , these two menisci ( along with the bursa sacs ) provide a better " fit " between these two bony structures .
The Gear Of Squatters
Two pieces of standard squatting gear — your shoes and knee wraps — should be carefully selected and used , not only to maximize both the short - and long - term health of your knees .
Shoes
Your shoes are literally where the rubber hits the road .
Think of your shoes as the foundation of your leg training sessions .
Wearing old or broken down fitness shoes for heavy squatting is like putting old , worn - out tires on a race car !
There are several reasons to avoid training in your " tennies . "
First , most general purpose fitness shoes simply lack adequate longitudinal or transverse stability , and have little or no arch support for heavy lifting .
As you squat , your feet may develop a tendency to pronate , or " cave in " toward the inner side .
When this happens , the knees are also forced inward , leading to a constant strain on the medial collateral ligaments , excessive shear force on the meniscus , and improper patellar tracking , which in turn can lead to chondromalacia .
If your feet tend to pronate anyway , or if you 're prone to being " knock kneed " ( and these two conditions are often associated with one another ) , it becomes even more important to select good training shoes .
Another important reason for using specialized shoes for squatting is that they provide a deep and solid heel cup , which prevents the foot from rocking and rolling to the outside , causing great stress on the lateral collateral ligaments of your knees .
Finally , there is a difference between a shoe being worn out and being broken down .
Even if your shoes look fine , they still may offer no arch or heel support at all , either because they never had any to start with , or because after months of use , the supports have compressed to the point to where they no longer function as they were intended .
Think about it — a tennis shoe is meant to support a 160 - pound tennis player , not a 600 - pound squat !
Loads like these cause the shoe to break down without visual signs of wearing out .
Knee Wraps
Knee wraps have long been a mainstay for competitive powerlifters , and for good reason .
When properly used , wraps can dramatically improve knee safety during heavy squatting .
More important , however , is the fact that wraps give you at least a 5 - 10 percent increase in how much you can lift .
But there 's a downside to using wraps also .
Wearing them while squatting under 80 - 85 percent or so is counterproductive to providing adaptive overload to various tissues comprising the knee .
Simply , the wrap absorbs the stress instead of the tissues , so they never get stronger .
Guidelines for wearing knee wraps during squatting are as follows :
Keeping your knees warm ( wrapped loosely ) improves blood flow and tissue elasticity .
If the weight you 're using is greater than 80 - 85 percent of your maximum , or If you have knee problems that require wearing wraps .
If you still insist on using them , go ahead and do so , but with the following points in mind .
When buying knee wraps , opt for the ones that 1 ) weigh the most ( more fabric equals greater protection , and 2 ) that stretch out to at least 19 - 20 feet in length ( more times around the knee equals greater protection ) .
Do not purchase wraps that are bulky , heavily elasticized and stretch out to under fifteen feet .
Tightness from elasticity does not afford you any real support !
Here are the steps to go through when putting your wraps on :
Sit on a chair or bench .
Begin with the wrap completely stretched and rolled up ( this makes the process much easier than fighting to stretch the wrap as you go ) .
With your leg straight , start applying the wrap below the knees , working upward .
Wrapping from " in " to " out , " ( counterclockwise for the left leg , clockwise for the right -- this helps avoid improper patellar tracking ) , anchor the wrap by applying 2 layers below the knees , then move upward , overlapping each previous layer by one - half the width of the wrap .
Apply the wrap tightly as you move past the knee , stopping somewhere on the lower third of the thigh ( powerlifting rules allow 10 centimeters above the patella ) .
Most of the wrap is wound around the leg just above the knee joint in orderto " pin " the quadriceps tendon to the femur below — better leverage ) .
Tuck the end of the wrap under the previous layer to secure it .
Repeat for the other leg .
An alternative more suitable for fitness and bodybuilding , perhaps , is to wrap tightly around the upper shin ( where the patellar ligament attaches ) , then more loosely wound over the kneecap itself ( this is important to avoid grinding the patella into the femoral condyle , creating a case of chondromalacia for yourself ) , then tightly wound over the lower quarter of the thigh .
Whenever you squat , hack squat , or leg press , your foot position is an important variable in determining not only the results you 'll obtain from the exercise , but also the safety of your knee joints .
The rationale for wrapping the knees prior to heavy squatting is that it reduced the pulling forces on the lower quadriceps and the quadriceps tendon at it's attachment to the patella .
This translates to significantly reduced chances of avulsing ( detaching ) your quadriceps tendon or tearing your quads during heavy squatting .
The chances of your patellar tendon avulsing from your tibia are a bit less , but nonetheless omnipresent .
Stance Variables Affecting Knee Health
Whenever you squat , hack squat , or leg press , your foot position is an important variable in determining not only the results you 'll obtain from the exercise , but also the safety of your knee joints .
Although each individual must determine their own best stance exercise per exercise ( based on their own anatomical peculiarities such as height and leg length ) , the following variables must be taken into consideration :
The quadriceps muscles can contract more efficiently when the feet are pointing slightly outward .
They should never point straight ahead .
If you squat with a very wide stance , your adductors tend to assist the quads .
This can result in stress to the medial collateral ligament , abnormal cartilage loading , and improper patellar tracking .
During the descent phase of any type of squat , do not allow the knees to extend beyond your feet .
The farther your knees travel over your feet , the greater the shearing forces on the patellar tendon and ligament .
Make sure that your knees point in the same direction your feet are pointing during the descent and ascent .
Because of weak quads , many lifters inadvertently turn their knees inward during the ascent , placing great stress on the medial ligaments of the knee .
Although many top bodybuilders advocate a close stance for the purpose of isolating the outer quads , this is a myth , and it places you at risk , particularly since you 'll have to use a lot of back to execute the lift , or ( if you use heels ) place great shear and compression on the knees .
The best way to squat is to put your feet in a position where they can generate the greatest opposing force to the weight ( " the athletic position " ) .
Warm up thoroughly before squatting .
Your muscles and other tissues of the knee joint love warmth !
Remember the analogy , cold taffy breaks , warm taffy does n't .
Maintain reasonable flexibility in the joints of your lower extremities and back .
Many knee injuries can be traced back to poor position resulting from inflexibility .
Finally , be careful in the exit out of the rack , and getting " set " in the squat stance .
After lifting the weight off of the pins , you should take just one step backward and immediately assume your squatting stance .
This takes time to master , but eventually all the minute adjustments can be pared down substantially .
Once set in the stance , keep your feet " nailed down " for the duration of the set .
Many people " fidget " with their feet and toes between reps which can cause a variety of problems ranging from a break in concentration to a loss of balance — and attendant stress on your knees .
Common Problems Of The Knee
Chondromalacia patellae : Softening of the articular cartilage of the patella that is produced by osteoarthritic degeneration .
Such cartilage is unsuited for the high compressive loads and frictional forces involved in squatting , and roughening of the underside of the kneecap is common .
Tight quads are responsible for 80 % of chondromalacia .
Other causes include aging , repetitive overuse , and faulty biomechanics due to genetics .
Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFPS ) : Exemplified by pain in front of patella , which intensifies during activity .
Also , pain during extended sitting , and / or walking up stairs .
PFPS is further characterized by crepitus ( noise ) , without instability .
PFPS is considered to be a tracking problem of the patella , caused by an imbalance between the medial and lateral quadriceps .
The damage to the underside of the patella is not unlike uneven tread wear in a car that needs the tires rotated .
Unstable Knee Joint : Knee suddenly gives out .
This is often caused by old injuries which have overstretched the knee ligaments .
Locked Knee :
The usual cause of locked knees is a torn meniscus or a loose body within the joint capsule .
Swelling / Tightness : Nearly always indicates an internal injury .
See physician immediately .
Crepitus : Noisy knees are no reason for concern , UNLESS accompanied by pain and / or swelling .
A lot of women ( like me ) are known to carry excessive luggage while traveling , but 13 bags all full of pot sound a little excessive !
Lisette Lee , 28 - year old possible heir to the Samsung Electronics fortune , was arrested Monday night at Port Columbus International Airport with 506 pounds of Marijuana in suitcases on board a chartered jet all packed in 13 suitcases .
Federal Drug Enforcement
Agency officials were tipped early and were waiting when her chartered jet landed .
According to WBNS , Lee told government agents she had no idea she was transporting drugs , but agents said they found cocaine and marijuana in her bag , along with a ledger that showed profits in excess of $ 300,000 .
“ She told investigators she was coming here to meet a boyfriend , ” Alverson said .
Officials say they are trying to confirm information that Lee is an heir to the Samsung electronics fortune .
Agents say she told them her family has several multimillion - dollar businesses .
Source : www.cbsnews.com
Lee arrived on a chartered Gulf Stream jet that cost $ 50,000 round trip .
Three other people were arrested – her secretary and bodyguards .
Lee has been charged with conspiracy and possession of drugs with the intent to distribute .
She is being held without bail .
If convicted , she could face up to 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 2 m ( £ 1.35 m ) .
Is Samsung not selling enough televisions to run a side business ?
Conspiracy or greed of easy money – the heir seems to be in deep trouble right now .
Ancient civilizations in much of Mexico and Central America were making different grades of rubber 3,000 years before Charles Goodyear " stabilized " the stuff in the mid-19th century , new research suggests .
The Aztec , Olmec , and Maya of Mesoamerica are known to have made rubber using natural latex — a milky , sap - like fluid found in some plants .
Mesoamerica extends roughly from central Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua ( regional map ) .
Ancient rubber makers harvested latex from rubber trees and mixed it with juice from morning glory vines , which contains a chemical that makes the solidified latex less brittle .
( Take a quiz about the ancient Maya . )
By mixing up rubber using different proportions of the two ingredients , researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that tweaking the formula led to rubber products with different properties .
Some of the rubber came out more bouncy , suggesting it may have been used to make balls for the legendary Mesoamerican ball games .
As described in ancient Maya texts , ball games often had religious meaning — pitting good against evil .
It 's thought the ball games sometimes ended in human sacrifice , most famously in ritual decapitation .
Other latex - to - morning glory proportions created more durable rubber , such as what might have been used in Aztec rubber sandals , which were described by Spanish conquistadors but have never been found by archaeologists .
A 50 - 50 blend of morning glory juice and latex created rubber with maximum bounciness , while a 75 - 25 mix of latex and morning glory made the most durable material .
Latex a " Funky White Liquid "
The initial discovery of rubber from latex and morning glory is n't so far - fetched , noted study co-author Michael Tarkanian , a researcher with MIT 's Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology .
Morning glory plants tend to grow near rubber trees , and both plants were considered sacred in several Mesoamerican cultures .
Morning glory , for example , was also used in religious ceremonies for its hallucinogenic properties .
To make their re-creations as accurate as possible , Tarkanian and colleague Dorothy Hosler harvested latex from rubber trees and juice from morning glory vines growing in Mexico .
The first challenge was getting the ingredients back to the lab .
Latex is n't regulated by U.S. Customs , and so there are no official papers for carrying it into the country , Tarkanian explained , " which is a problem when you 're bringing this funky white liquid across the border in Nalgene bottles . "
Once safely back in the U.S. , the researchers met a new hurdle :
The latex needed to be warm .
" The process always worked in Mexico , but not in the air - conditioned labs at MIT , " Tarkanian said .
When the mixture was too cold , the molecules simply did n't bond .
Today most rubber is treated through a process called vulcanization , which cooks liquid latex with sulfur to increase strength and elasticity .
Aztec Captains of Industry ?
According to Tarkanian , it 's no surprise cultures such as the Aztec were making advanced versions of rubber .
Despite their common depiction as primitive , violent people , the Aztec had a spirit of scientific inquiry , as shown by their experiments in metallurgy and other industries , he said .
" Their science , engineering , and development skills would have led them to try different combinations " of substances when making rubber , Tarkanian said .
Once the raw ingredients had been mixed , he added , the rubber took about ten minutes to form and another five minutes to harden , giving rubber workers just a few minutes to shape the final product .
Tarkanian and Hosler mostly created sheets of rubber in the lab , but they did make a few rubber balls during one session .
" At the end of the semester , we played the Mesoamerican ball game .
The losing team was beheaded , " Tarkanian quipped .
O Prophet !
Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks ( veils ) all over their bodies that they may thus be distinguished and not molested .
( 33:59 )
The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al - Manasi , a vast open place to answer the call of nature at night .
' Umar used to say to the Prophet " Let your wives be veiled , " but Allah 's Apostle did not do so .
One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the Prophet went out at ' Isha ' time and she was a tall lady .
' Umar addressed her and said , " I have recognized you , O Sauda . "
He said so , as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al - Hijab ( the observing of veils by the Muslim women ) may be revealed .
So Allah revealed the verses of " Al - Hijab " ( A complete body cover excluding the eyes ) .
Sahih Bukhari 1.4.148
" If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside on the street , or in the garden or in the park , or in the backyard without a cover , and the cats come and eat it ... whose fault is it , the cats ' or the uncovered meat ?
The uncovered meat is the problem .
If she was in her room , in her home , in her hijab , no problem would have occurred . "
France and Switzerland are proposing a ban on the Burqa , a garment especially for women that covers the head , the body and even the face , leaving its wearer looking like a klansman who forgot to do his laundry .
Belgium and the Netherlands are close to banning the Burqa .
Lefty movements have responded typically enough by accusing those in favor of the ban of being bigots , arguing that the ban is counterproductive and that all women who wear Burqas do it by choice -- because all historical and global evidence to the contrary , " " .
But what is really behind the Burqa ?
Islamists have carefully positioned this as a civil rights issue and their lefty allies are trotting along gamely trying to make the case for them .
Meanwhile the Islamists have staged confrontations over women with Burqas going to the bank or trying to vote or getting driver 's licenses .
All of this is empty theater , when you consider that the promoters of the Burqa are using it as a tool to prevent women from doing any of these things .
If you doubt that , overlay the countries where Burqas are worn most frequently with their approach to women 's rights .
Those are countries where women are heavily dependent on male guardians for even basic legal and civil transactions .
And that is the real point of the Burqa .
A Burqa is a tool for dehumanizing the wearer .
For making it difficult for them to have any individual interaction outside the home .
This is not a bug , this is a feature .
It depersonalizes women who wear it .
It makes it difficult for them to work outside the home , to have a conversation with a stranger or to even be seen as an individual .
And again , that is the entire point .
Burqas are the product of a culture and religion in which women are not supposed to have any function outside the home .
In which they are supposed to remain in Purdah , walled off inside the home .
Purdah is the Persian word for the physical imprisonment of the woman in the home behind her curtain .
Think of an individual ghetto for the women of every family .
That is the essential idea here .
Purdah is also the Persian word for the face veil that covers a woman 's face while wearing a Burqa .
The word Purdah means curtain .
When a woman walks out of the house wearing a Burqa , she is wearing a portable Purdah around herself .
She carries the enforced social isolation of it with her .
We use the word " faceless " to describe a condition of enforced anonymity .
That is exactly what the Burqa does .
It renders an entire gender anonymous .
Faceless .
And we also connect facelessness to a lack of personal autonomy .
Because autonomy is connected to identity .
Someone without a face has no identity .
Which again is the whole point of creating a mobile Purdah for women using the Burqa .
It deprives women of individual social and legal identities , and instead assigns those powers to their male guardians .
And since people have to be dehumanized before they can be deprived of their social and legal rights , that is what the Burqa is for .
Islamic cultures that mandate the Burqa also assign a woman 's legal rights to her male guardian .
She may only travel or conduct serious financial transactions through her male guardian .
Marriages , divorces and sometimes even driving a car -- requires a male guardian .
This however is not the state of affairs just in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan , but also in the heart of Europe and the United States .
We simply have not implemented laws enforcing this , which is another reason why the Islamists are pushing the Burqa , to do it for them .
The Burqa here once again serves its purpose as mobile Purdah , removing a woman from society even while she still has the law on her side .
What is really behind all this madness ?
The answer is fairly simple , and it's the same answer to much of the problems in the Muslim world .
Tribalism .
People are not individuals , they are the means of perpetuating the family .
Controlling the reproduction of the family requires tightly controlling its women , as this is culturally linked to the purity of the family .
Since inbreeding is common , the daughters of a family are likely to be bred back into the family to a cousin or an uncle .
And if not they are used as " coin " to buy access to good brides for the sons of the family or even additional wives for the patriarch .
And if not , their marriages are still linked to the honor and status of the family .
Which means that either way women are a commodity whose key value is in their purity , which is attained through Purdah or isolation from men .
While these ideas certainly did not begin with Islam , the Islamic world follows disjointed religious teachings which mix bits of stolen Christianity and Judaism , with large heapings of tribal customs .
The Mohammed of the Koran already firmly relegated women to a second place status , but the Mohammed of the Hadiths made him seem benevolent by comparison .
And the Islamists selectively use those Hadiths which fit their agenda of completely disempowering women , which is part of the Saudi funded process of radicalizing Muslims for the global Jihad .
Because they view Muslim women as tools in their conquest of the free world .
Yassir Arafat once boasted that , " . "
Of course to use a weapon , you must control it .
When you turn human beings into tools , you must first dehumanize them .
You must think of them as objects for achieving your ends .
The mental state of Muslim women in Gaza and the West Bank who teach their young children to blow themselves up in order to murder innocent people aptly demonstrates what such people will be programmed to become .
But while the Islamist may deny it in public , to him Paris , London , Amsterdam and New York ... are also Gaza .
Islamists will blame tribalism for the state of Muslim women , even as they themselves embrace tribalism in order to segregate and control their own populations .
They create their own ghettos and implement purdahs in order to build an army for the conquest of the West .
Their leaders see Western individualism as a weakness , but also as a seductive threat to their own people .
And the pattern of tribalism remains tattooed on their throbbing brains , which insists that their honor is linked to their ability to control their own women .
While of course humiliating Westerners by assaulting and degrading theirs .
This is a familiar tribal pattern incorporated into Islam .
To dishonor the family of the outsider , while protecting the honor of your own family .
To rape foreign women , while clothing your own in Burqas .
This idea goes back to Mohammed and the Koran itself .
The obvious implication is that a woman who was n't completely cloaked , would be molested .
While a cloaked woman would set herself apart as belonging to a Muslim man , and would therefore not be molested .
The Hadith of Sahih Bukhari makes it clear that the problem was that even high ranking Muslim leaders , such as Umar , a companion of Mohammed and the second Caliph , had trouble leaving women alone ... even when those women were Mohammed 's own wives .
The psychology of an Umar who waited around to catch sight of women he was n't married to and then used the phony self - righteous pretext that because he recognized a woman by her height at night , that women should all be forced to wear veils -- speaks volumes about what is still boiling away in the heads of Islamists today .
Their idea of honor is irretrievably linked to control .
Control over women to protect family honor and their own self - image .
Control over outsiders to maintain the status of family and faith .
And a constant expansion of that control is needed to reassure them of their honor .
So the Jihad moves forward in the West .
Women must cover their faces .
And then even one eye .
And there is no end to it .
Never any end to it .
The Burqa is a tool of dehumanization and control .
It is part of the larger Jihad , which is not just about terrorism , but about the complete subjugation of the entire world and everyone in it , to Sharia .
Islamic law .
In order to reaffirm Islam and the tribal honor of Muslims .
It is unacceptable in the free world because it represents the dehumanization of millions who will be forced to submit to it .
And many millions more yet to come .
The Islamists began their campaign with the Hijab , bribing and compelling women in Europe and America to wear them .
Physical violence is part of the process , particularly in France where girls who refused to wear one were , like the wives of Mohammed 's followers , vulnerable to being " molested " , if one may refer to the Tournade in such delicate terms .
The Hijab however was only the preparation for the Burqa , which is the next step in the enforced dehumanization of women .
Nor does this only affect Muslim women .
In parts of France , non-Muslim women have learned to begin wearing the Hijab to avoid being molested .
As Jewish women were forced to wear veils during their exile among Muslims .
Sheikh Hilali , the Grand Mufti of Australia , laid out the stakes quite well during the Sydney rape trials .
The women raped were non-Muslims , but as far as Hilali was concerned , it was their fault for not being in Purdah and wearing their Hijabs .
If Muslims continue to use the Hijab and then the Burqa as a distinguishing mark of women who cannot be molested , as opposed to women who can be molested -- as it was in Mohammed 's time -- women in general will be intimidated into wearing the Hijab and the Burqa .
As under the Taliban , Muslim and non-Muslim women will have a choice between agreeing to give up their rights or facing brutalization .
Those are the real stakes in the Burqa debate .
Are women human beings or are they meant only to live in Purdah under the jurisdiction of their male guardians ?
The rise of the Burqa means the end of legal rights for women .
To prove this , one need only look at countries where the preponderance of women wear them .
Opponents of the Burqa ban argue that individual abuse should be tackled individually , but they deny that these abuses are part of a greater problem , rather than individual acts .
By denying the Islamic oppression of women , they reduce a growing danger to random acts of violence , just as they have done with Islamic terrorism .
Would the European Council be as casual about a religious movement pushing for the resumption of race based slavery ?
What if the masters brought forth some of their slaves to argue that being slaves is their right if they wish to be slaves .
The answer to this , is that slaves can not be citizens .
If one truly wishes to be a slave , a depersonalized person , there are no shortage of countries where such things are normal .
The Free World is not the place for it .
It is not the place for those who wish to dehumanize women , to justify rape or murder their daughters if they violate their tribal sense of family honor .
This is not freedom .
It is slavery .
Banning the Burqa confronts a totalitarian ideology bent on dehumanizing women and depriving them of the rights of citizens , in order to centralize power within their own ideology along their old tribal patterns .
If Europe allows this , its own women will have to live by those same tribal laws as well , sooner or later .
Islam is not a passive ideology , it is expansionistic .
It will spread through missionary work , but it will even more eagerly spread through violence .
Islamic history makes this fact impossibly to deny .
To ban the Burqa is to insist that no totalitarian ideology will impose facelessness on citizens of the nation .
To fail to ban it is to abandon republican citizenship for tribal submission .
Geert Wilders , who leads the right - wing Party for Freedom ( PVV ) in Holland , said last week he believes Jordan should be renamed Palestine .
The Jordanian government responded by saying Wilders ' speech was reminiscent of the Israeli right wing .
Rise to Power Pro-Israel Right gains power in Holland Ynet Election results still unclear as radical right party gains power in parliament .
How did Muslim immigration take center stage in elections campaign ?
Who will form government ?
How will Israel be affected ?
Pro-Israel Right gains power in Holland
Wilders added that Israel deserved a special status in the Dutch government because it was fighting for Jerusalem in its name .
" If Jerusalem falls into the hands of the Muslims , Athens and Rome will be next .
Thus , Jerusalem is the main front protecting the West .
It is not a conflict over territory but rather an ideological battle , between the mentality of the liberated West and the ideology of Islamic barbarism , " he said .
" There has been an independent Palestinian state since 1946 , and it is the kingdom of Jordan . "
Wilders also called on the Dutch government to refer to Jordan as Palestine and move its embassy to Jerusalem .
The Saudi Al - Watan carried Jordan 's response to Wilders ' speech .
The kingdom 's embassy in Hague was outraged , and said the Dutch ambassador would soon be summoned to explain .
Jordan 's minister for media affairs and communications , Nabil Al Sharif , asked for clarifications .
He described Wilders ' declaration as " an echo of the voice of the Israeli Right " and " crows ' screams " .
" Jordan is an independent and secure country which supports the Palestinian issue , and these imaginings of finding them an alternate homeland are nothing but the delusions of a few people , " he said .
The PVV nearly tripled its power in the last election , going from nine parliament seats to 24 .
The right - wing party , which has called for a ban on minarets and Muslim scarves , has been holding so far unsuccessful negotiations with the liberal Right .
Justin Elliott reports at TPM that Sharron Angle , Republican nominee for U.S. Senate from Nevada was , in the 1990s , a member of the Independent American Party , the Nevada affiliate of the Constitution Party .
The Constitution Party is not merely a political party that supports the Constitution , but rather a party that promotes a very specific interpretation of the Constitution : based on founder Howard Phillips ’ Christian Reconstruction .
No conspiracy theory here ; Phillips has explicitly embraced R.J. Rushdoony as a mentor and publicly noted the influence of the “ Father ” of the movement on his own views and the views of his son Doug Phillips , the founder of Vision Forum , an organization which claims “ a zeal for the restoration of Biblical patriarchy . ”
In her book , Quiverfull , RD contributor Kathryn Joyce reported that the younger Phillips pressured members of the church in which he is an elder to support the Constitution Party .
A significant division resulted when a female member of the congregation questioned him and was disciplined by the church leaders .
The elder Phillips was one of the founders of the new Christian Right in the 1980s and is still chairman of the Conservative Caucus .
In 1992 he founded the U.S. Taxpayer ’s Party which in 1999 changed its name to the Constitution Party .
Phillips ran three times as the party ’s candidate for President ( with the endorsement of Ron Paul ) .
The Constitution Party ’s platform advocates “ returning ” American law to its “ foundations ” in “ Biblical Law . ”
The notion that the First Amendment ’s religion clauses provide for a separation of church and state is rejected , based on the argument that the founders envisioned an institutional separation of church and state at the federal level in order to protect religion from an overreaching federal government .
They contend that the founders always understood the U.S. to be a Christian nation founded on biblical law .
The Constitution Party opposes abortion in all instances ( including some forms of contraception ) .
It calls for the repeal of all federal gun laws .
It supports state ’s rights and localism including the elimination of any activities on the part of the federal government not explicitly delineated in the Constitution .
It advocates reform of Congress including the elimination of pensions , return to the election of senators by state legislators , and repeal of the electoral college .
It supports repeal of the Voting Rights Act , Social Security , and the Patriot Act .
It calls for the elimination of any control or support by government over education ( as that is the God - given responsibility of families ) , for the right of “ state and local governments to proscribe offensive sexual behavior , ” and to limit marriage to heterosexual couples .
It advocates a hard money currency , repeal of the Federal Reserve and elimination of fractional reserve banking .
As I reported here , the Constitution Party and Christian Reconstructionism have deeply influenced both Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul and his father .
It sees itself in opposition not only to Democrats , but to Republicans ; leaders have criticized Sarah Palin for calling on tea partiers to choose one of the major parties .
The party is officially on the ballot in at least 17 states including Florida , where Bernie DeCastro , an ex-con turned prison minister , its candidate running for U.S. Senate , thinks tea party favorite Marco Rubio is too liberal .
Hello !
I ca n’t describe what this feels like : Joe Danger is released exclusively to PlayStation 3 today .
This is both the most exciting and nerve wracking day of my life .
Two years ago , three friends and I decided to make a game together .
Hello Games formed and sat around playing with a box of toys .
One stunt cycle in particular .
Firing it out windows and imagining a game featuring that hapless rider .
The truth is , back then we did n’t really know what we were doing .
We did n’t know if we could make the game we wanted with just four people .
We had worked on some big titles before , games like Burnout and Black , and those were huge teams of hundreds .
All of us had been dreaming of making our own games , probably since we could play them .
In the end it was just something we had to do .
Last Friday night we all sat up waiting for our first review .
It turned out to be a 9.5 on IGN , their highest ever rated PSN game .
Then we got a 9 in GameInformer , their Game of the Month ( the first ever for PSN ) .
Amazing !
Check out some more awesome reviews here and here .
We ’ve literally poured everything we have into Joe Danger .
It ’s been an incredibly difficult two years , but to see people enjoying what we ’ve done is the most rewarding feeling in the world .
It ’s why we ’re so excited for the release .
This is the game we ’ve always wanted to make , for each of us it ’s every game we ’ve loved crammed into one innovative and tight package .
I thought I ’d let the others members of Hello Games describe what they love about the game .
Grant : “ I ’m the sole Artist and I designed most of the levels for Joe Danger .
Christmas ‘ 92 I got Sonic , and played it straight ‘ til Christmas ‘ 93 .
I wanted to create levels with that crazy feeling of speed , those sudden leaps of faith and the fluid feeling when you are in the zone .
You might be on a Bike , but for me Joe is a platformer at heart .
Just one at 200 mph . ”
David : “ I ’m the Gameplay guy on Joe Danger .
Before I had my C64 and California Games , I was Pinball obsessed .
I ’ll basically do anything for a multiplier .
Tony Hawks Pro Skater and Jet Set Radio were huge for me at Uni when I was learning to skate .
It ’s all about that extreme tension when you ’ve built up some huge score Combo , and just one mistake will wipe it all out in an instant .
Joe Danger is fast and frantic , but really it ’s all about highscores for me . ”
Ryan : “ I ’m the main technical dude at Hello Games .
I ’m that guy who loves nothing but racing games , speed - runs , time attacks .
Excitebike , Trackmania , Crazy Taxi and Burnout have been big games to me and I guess that ’s rubbed off .
Joe Danger is never anything but fast , whether you ’re trying to grab every coin in Coin Dash , or neck and neck racing for the finish line .
It ’s all about Boost .
Stunts feeds your boost , allowing for even bigger air and crazier Stunts .
Boost is that glue between racing , comboing and platforming . ”
Once again , Joe Danger is on the PlayStation Store in America later today and we really hope you enjoy it !
Spread the word .

New federal copyright infringement lawsuits plummeted to a six - year low in 2009 , the year after the Recording Industry Association of America abandoned its litigation campaign against file sharers , court records show .
Copyright lawsuits numbered 2,192 in 2009 , down almost a third from the previous year , and represented more than a 50 percent drop from 2005 , when the recording industry 's legal machinery was in full gear .
The figures provide fresh anecdotal evidence that the nation 's copyright - infringement dockets were significantly weighed down by the recording industry during that time .
And the numbers , released by the Administrative Office of the Courts , come as indie filmmakers are picking up on the aggressive legal strategy the RIAA has abandoned .
The RIAA , the record labels ' lobbying and litigation arm , announced the end of its 5 - year - old lawsuit campaign in December 2008 , after having targeted some 18,000 individuals , usually naming dozens or hundreds of defendants per suit .
In interviews with Threat Level , copyright attorneys were in agreement that the termination of the litigation campaign is largely responsible for last year 's low numbers , though economic conditions may also have played a role .
" When economic times are bad , lawsuits drop , " says New York copyright attorney Ray Dowd .
When the first round of RIAA lawsuits were filed on Sept. 8 , 2003 – targeting 261 defendants around the country – it was a hairpin turn from the RIAA 's previous strategy of going after file sharing services , rather than individual users .
The RIAA – representing the world 's big four music companies , Sony BMG , Universal Music , EMI and Warner Music – has said its lawsuits were largely a public relations effort , aimed at striking fear into the hearts of would - be downloaders .
Most everyone who was sued settled out of court for a few thousand dollars rather than risk Copyright Act fines of up to $ 150,000 per purloined music track .
Only two defendants represented themselves at trial .
Both lost massive judgments and remain embroiled in litigation today .
As 2008 ended , the RIAA announced it was done suing individuals and instead would focus on getting copyright thieves barred from the internet .
The nation 's major ISP 's , however , have declined to adopt the so - called " graduated response " or " three strikes " strategies .
In March , a consortium of independent filmmakers launched an RIAA - style mass - litigation campaign targeting thousands of BitTorrent users accused of pilfering their movies .
Those lawsuits , like the RIAA 's , begin after content owners track infringing content online , then pinpoint the infringing IP addresses and sue .

Eight planets and their moons , tens of thousands of asteroids , and trillions of comets revolve around the sun .
One of these is our Earth , orbiting the sun at an average distance of about 92,960,000 miles ( 149,600,000 kilometers ) .
The sun is a huge , glowing ball that provides light , heat , and other energy to our Earth .
But our beneficial space neighbor is also capable of some stellar " temper tantrums .
"
On Thursday , June 17 , Dr. David Hathaway , a solar scientist at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center , answered your questions about how our sun works and produces phenomena such as sunspots , solar flares , and solar storms -- " hot ' topics that have communication and health implications for everyone on Earth .
Check back on this page on Monday for a complete transcript of today 's chat .
Dr. Hathaway received his doctorate in Astrophysics from the University of Colorado in Boulder , CO in 1979 .
He worked for two years as a Post - Doctoral Fellow in the Advanced Study Program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research before taking a 3 - year position as an Assistant Astronomer at the National Solar Observatory site in Sunspot , NM .
He came to NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , AL in 1984 where he has been a member of the solar physics group and served as its team leader from 1996 to 2010 .
He has written over 150 articles on the Sun and solar physics and has received three US patents .
He has been the recipient of dozens of awards from within NASA and from the broader scientific community .
Hathaway has served on numerous advisory committees as well as elected positions within scientific organizations .
Dr. Hathaway ’s primary research interests include the nature and origin of the sunspot cycle and the fluid dynamics of the Sun ’s interior .
His research includes constructing computer models for flows on the surface of the Sun and analysis programs for extracting those flows from satellite observations .
He maintains a database on sunspots , including their sizes and positions , that extends back to the year 1874 .
This database is widely used by the solar physics community .

Abishek : Can suns rays reach how more long than Pluto ?
David :
The sun 's rays can reach 4.5 billion light years .
Pluto is only three light hours from the sun .
Akarsh_Valsan : Sir , can you explain the major composition of the Sun ?
David :
The sun is composed of 70 % hydrogen , 28 % helium , and 2 % carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen .
This is the composition it was born with from the cloud of gas that it came from long ago .
chaosx :
What truly is going to happen during our next solar cycle in 2013 .
Will it knock out much of the electronics in certain areas of the world ?
David :
The next solar cycle by most indications will be the weakest in 100 years .
We also have satellites and other technology that can help us mitigate the problems associated with flares .
However , so much of our technology is sensitive to space weather .
We need better predictions and radiation - hardened electronic components .
abishek : Can aurora borealis seen from the earth ?
David : Aurora borealis are formed when energetic particles from the sun stream down the Earth 's magnetic field lines into the polar regions .
It can be seen after many significant solar flares .
We just had one last weekend .
g00nne : Hello , I wrote today , the message is probably lost somewhere .
Can you tell me some information about the galactic Wednesday and consequent eruption of the Sun 2013 ?
Thank you for your reply .
David :
The next solar cycle should reach its peak in mid-2013 .
Again , we 're expecting the weakest solar cycle in 100 years , so the effects should be less than what we 've seen in the last few solar cycles.
nomaanakhtar :
Do solar flares produce solar winds ?
David : Solar flares are huge explosions on the surface of the sun .
They typically last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours and can blast a billion tons of matter off of the sun .
The solar wind is something altogether different .
The solar wind blows off of the sun at all times , with typical speeds of about 1 million mph .
We still do n't know exactly what causes the solar wind , but we know that it 's related to the sun 's 1 million degree corona , or outer atmosphere .
Feign :
Does the increase of solar flares happen approximately once a decade , and is this increase in flares any different from previous times ?
David :
The frequency of solar flares rises and falls with the sunspot cycle , which is about 11 years long .
The bigger cycles have more flares than the smaller cycles .
Nonetheless , a small cycle can produce a really nasty flare !
Feign :
Is a large solar flare capable of destroying life on Earth ?
David : No . :)
The sun has been producing solar flares for 4.5 billion years , and we 're still here .
prat : I read that earth 's magnetic field is protection us from solar flares .
Is it true ?
ANd how does it protect ?
What is the actual phenomena ?
David :
Yes , that 's true .
The energetic particles produced by solar flares are electrically charged particles that are diverted by magnetic fields .
We 're also protected by our atmosphere which blocks all but the most energetic particles .
Adam : Hello Jason and David .
My question related to solar variability .
I 'm interested to hear David Hathaway 's opinion on the effect that solar variability has on the climate here on Earth .
There is a school of thought amongst climate change skeptics that the warming experienced on Earth over the last 150/200 years can be attributed to an increase in solar activity and I am wondering whether David believes that this idea fits the data .
Thanks for your time .
David :
There do appear to be connections between solar activity and climate .
The sun is actually 0.1 % brighter at sunspot cycle maximum than at minimum , but this should only produce about 1/10 degree C change in temperature .
The apparent effect is larger than this , but we do n't know the exact connection .
One possibility is that the sun 's ultraviolet light , which varies by 3 - 4 % at sunspot cycle maximum , might influence the Earth 's upper atmosphere .
Another possibility is cosmic rays , which have higher fluxes at sunspot cycle minimum might produce clouds .
We still do n't know the full answer on this , but our best estimates are that the sun 's contribution to global warming plays a minor role .
nomaan :
What are solar flares ?
David : Solar flares are explosions produced by twisted magnetic fields in the sun 's atmosphere .
They produce the energy equivalent of about 1 million megatons of TNT. nyswimmer :
How hot is the sun ?
David :
The sun is 5,770 degree Kelvin or about 10,000 degrees F at the surface , but it has temperatures of tens of millions of degrees in its core where hydrogen is being converted into helium .
We 're working to get through all of the great questions you 've asked us .
Keep them coming !
To submit your own question , please type it in the box at the bottom of the window and click the ' Ask ' button on the right side of the box .
Thanks for your patience as we answer your questions .
Richard_Hendricks : How " prepared " are humans for a severe solar storm ?
David :
We 're better prepared now than we have been , but our technology is more sensitive to the effects of solar storms .
We have two satellites , ACE and WIND , that are a million miles upstream in the solar wind and provide us with about a one - hour advanced warning of the magnetized clouds of material blown off of the sun by solar flares .
This is enough to allow satellite operators and electrical power distributors to adjust equipment in anticipation of the impending impact .
K4DXV : What is your best guess for the peak of cycle 24 ?
David :
My current estimate has a smoothed sunspot number of about 70 .
The last sunspot cycle had a peak of about 120 , and the two before that had peaks of about 160.
jjordan10 :
About how much energy is produced by our sun in a year ?
David : The Sun provides about 1,300 watts per square meter every second to the Earth .
Multiple that by the area of the Earth and number of seconds in a year .
This is left as an exercise for the student .
:) Ediz_Celik :
What is the source of solar storms ? :-)
David : solar flares are one source of solar storms .
Two other eruptions from the sun can also produce solar storms : coronal mass ejections and filament eruptions .
CMEs are huge clouds of magnetized gases that are blown off of the sun .
Filaments are denser clouds of material that can also escape from the sun .
Flares , CMEs and filament eruptions can all occur together or they can occur independently .
Feign :
What is the strangest thing you have witnessed or catalogued the sun doing ?
David : Going through this REALLY long minimum .
I was fully expecting a quick end to the last cycle and the beginning of a large sunspot cycle .
This long minimum left behind a sunspot cycle more than 12 years long , with a minimum lower than we 've seen in 100 years .
I was n't expecting that , but I 'm ready for it now !
nomaan :
What is the corona of the sun ?
David :
The sun 's corona is its outer atmosphere that 's usually only seen during a total eclipse .
We now have instruments that produce artificial eclipses all the time .
The corona is exceedingly hot , over 1 million degrees C , while the surface is " only " about 6,000 degrees C .
We think the corona is heated by mechanisms involving its magnetic field .
We 're still arguing about the details .
abishek :
Will our sun become a black hole ?
David :
No , the sun just is n't massive enough to produce a black hole .
The sun should leave behind a white dwarf .
If more massive , it might leave behind a neutron star .
It takes a star about 10 x as massive as the sun to produce a black hole .
ramneek :
What exactly constitutes coronal mass ?
David : A coronal mass ejection ( CME ) is a blob of plasma ( ionized material ) with an embedded magnetic field .
They travel through the solar system on the solar wind in speeds in excess of 1 million mph.nomaan :
What are geomagnetic storms ?
David :
They occur when disturbances in the solar wind strike the Earth 's magnetic field .
These disturbances can include coronal mass ejections and high - speed streams from solar coronal holes .
When they strike the Earth 's magnetic field , the magnetic field at the surface of the Earth can be seen to fluctuate .
These fluctuations have been measured since 1844 and provide estimates of solar activity since that time .
Feign :
How long do solar storms generally last ?
David : Typical flares last for hours , but their effects can last for a day or more .
Often flares occur in groups where a particularly active region on the sun may flare for several days .
We 're still working on answering all the great questions you 've asked .
If you have n't seen yours yet , give us a few minutes to get to all of your questions .
To submit your own question , please type it in the box at the bottom of the window and click the ' Ask ' button on the right side of the box .
Thanks for your patience as we answer your questions .
Tavish_DeGroot : Kind of the opposite of the risks from solar maximum , are there any risks to satellites during solar minimum ?
David : Great question .
During solar maximum , satellites are subjected to energetic particles from solar flares .
During minimum , they receive a higher dose of galactic cosmic rays that can also cause damage .
Richard_Hendricks :
The Earth 's magnetic field is stable over fairly long times .
Why does the sun 's reverse every 11 years ?
Is it because of the slower rotation , or the energy injected by fusion ?
David :
The Earth 's magnetic field flips randomly on time scales of 100,000 to 1 million years .
The sun 's magnetic field flips " fairly " regularly every 11 years .
The major difference does have to do with the rotation .
The sun rotates once every 27 days and the convective motions associated with its magnetic dynamo also have a time period of about 27 days .
For the Earth , the rotation is one day , and the convective motions are much slower .
This produces a very different magnetic dynamo for the earth .
ramneek :
What causes reduced surface temp that gives rise to sunspots ?
David : Sunspots are places where very strong magnetic fields loop up out of the sun .
The magnetic fields in sunspots are strong enough to inhibit the flow of gases inside the sun .
This effectively chokes off the heat flow below sunspots , making them darker and cooler than their surroundings .
K4DXV : Any ideas on why cycle 24 seems to be getting off to a slow , perhaps even herky - jerky , start ?
David :
Yes , I have my pet theory related to recent observations I made with a summer intern , Lisa Rightmire .
We found that the sun 's meridional flow , a flow from the equator to the sun 's poles along meridian lines , was faster on the approach to this minimum than it was at the last minimum .
Models for the transport of magnetic field by this flow indicate that this would produce a weak magnetic field at the sun 's poles .
This magnetic field is thought to be the source of the next sunspot cycle .
Small sunspot cycles typically start late and leave behind a low solar minimum -- just what we observed .
Richard_Hendricks :
How much variance do we see over time in solar analogues ?
David : Solar analogues are other stars like the sun in which we can see starspot cycles .
They show a wider range of activity than we typically see with the sun .
Some of this may be due to differences in age or rotation rate .
Some may also be due to periods of hyperactivity and grand minima .
The sun went through the Maunder minimum , a grand minimum , from 1645 - 1715 , a period of 70 years almost entirely free of sunspots .
Akarsh_Valsan : Can you give me more details about particle radiation ?
David : Energetic particles from solar flares include protons , electrons , and the nuclei of other elements such as helium and carbon .
They can travel at speeds approaching the speed of light .
These particles can cause damage to electronics on satellites .
Ediz_Celik :
If our galaxy collided with Andromeda , is there any possibility to our sun will collide with a star ?
David : Star collisions are exceedingly rare in our position on the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy .
The sun is four light seconds in diameter , and the next star is four light years away .
That should give an indication of how much space there is between stars !
Adam :
In answer to abishek 's question , you say the Sun 's rays can travel for 4.5 billion light years .
Can I ask how you came to this number ?
Surely the suns rays will continue indefinitely unless absorbed or reflected ?
David :
The sun has only been shining for 4.5 billion years.1st_in_alphabetical_order :
Is there anything on earth that can reach temperature of the sun surface without melting ?
David :
Not that I know of , unless you have some " unobtainium . " :) nyswimmer :
What technology do you use to help you with your job ?
David : I use observations from satellites and I use the Internet extensively .
Without either of these , my job would be nearly impossible .
abishek :
Which is hotter , Earth 's core or the solar flares ?
David : I believe the Earth 's core is only a few 10,000 degrees .
Solar flares can have temps in excess to 10 million degrees .
pdove : Can solar winds be used to propel spacecraft ?
David :
Actually , sunlight itself is better than the solar wind for propelling spacecraft .
Solar sails are in active development but they use sunlight rather than solar wind .
Richard_Hendricks :
How about a more relevant question : Could a solar flare cause a mass extinction ?
Actually , that 's a terrible question .
Given what we know about flare statistics , what 's the strongest one we have seen , and what 's the strongest one we would * expect .
*David :
The sun has almost certainly been producing solar flares throughout 4.5 billion years .
The mass extinctions we know about do n't appear to have been caused by solar flares .
So my suspicion is that solar flares are n't energetic enough to cause mass extinctions .
Mestre :
Do paleo - records , like ice core samples and tree rings , record solar activity over long periods of time ?
David : Excellent question and yes , they do .
Galactic cosmic rays are modulated by the solar cycle .
When the sun is more active , fewer cosmic rays reach earth .
The cosmic rays can produce radioactive isotopes in the Earth 's upper atmosphere .
In particular , carbon - 14 and berylium - 10 .
The c - 14 gets caught in tree rings , and the Be - 10 gets trapped in ice .
By looking at these isotopes , we can estimate levels of solar activity over the last 10,000 years .
BriGuy :
Is it true that our Earth is overdue for a magnetic polar shift ( where north becomes south and vice versa ) ?
What will be the expected impact of such a thing , especially with the temporary loss of our protective magnetosphere ?
David :
The Earth 's magnetic pole flips chaotically so it's hard to say when we 're due for a shift .
All indications are that this process takes a significant amount of time , so I would n't worry about it in my lifetime .
Nonetheless , you raise an interesting question about our protective magnetosphere .
If the polar shift is more than just a shift , but rather a loss of the Earth 's magnetic field , then we 'd lose this protection -- but we 'd still have the atmosphere and its protection .
jamesdmendenhall :
If the gas were removed , what solids would remain in our sun ?
David :
The sun contains all of the elements that we also have on Earth , but with the exception of hydrogen and helium , they 're minor constituents .
At the temperatures we see in the sun , all of these elements would remain as ionized gases and would n't solidify .
Akarsh_Valsan :
Why does the sun appear yellowish during sunrise and as dark red during sunsets ?
Why is the sun changing its colour ?
David :
The sun 's color remains yellowish at all times .
The colors you see at sunrise and sunset are due to scattering of sunlight in the Earth 's atmosphere .
sayyam : I listened in on a lecture from an astronomer that solar radiations react with the oxygen in ice present on poles to form carbon - 14 ? what reaction takes place ?
And what is its relation with sun spots ?
David : Cosmic rays produce carbon - 14 ( C - 14 ) when they strike nitrogen in our atmosphere .
The C - 14 then acts like carbon and gets taken up by plants .
So we see the C - 14 in tree rings as indicators of previous solar activity .
enoch : Mr. David , are the flares actual fire or an typoe of electro magnetic waves ?
David : Flares are magnetic explosions .
The intense magnetic fields that loop up out of the sun in sunspots can become twisted and basically short - circuit themselves .
It 's called " magnetic reconnection . "
This process can release tremendous amounts of energy in a matter of seconds .
The energy itself is seen in particles ( electrons , protons ) streaming out of the flaring region .
There 's also a great deal of light in the form of X - rays that is emitted by these particles .
prat :
How does scientists predicts sun's age ( the amount of fuel in it ) ?
David :
Our best estimates of the sun's age actually come from meteorites , but we can also estimate it from our models of how the sun burns hydrogen to form helium .
This actually sets a limit on how old the sun can get , about 9 billion years .
nyswimmer :
Is it true that Venus is hotter than the sun ?
David :
No , the surface of Venus is about 700 degrees F .
The surface of the sun is more than 10X that .
Tavish_DeGroot :
What do you think is the most interesting aspect of the sun to study or observe ?
David :
The sun 's magnetic field is the source of all interesting things about the sun . :)
It 's associated with the sunspot cycle , with solar flares , and with the hot corona and solar wind .
So observing the sun 's magnetic field -- how it 's produced and behaves -- is most interesting to me.jjordan10 :
How much cooler is a sunspot to the temperature of the surface of the sun ?
David :
The temperature in sunspots drops to about 3,000 degrees Kelvin , This is actually cool enough for molecules to form , titanium oxide in particular .
nomaan :
Can solar flare of 2013 set any satellite out of orbit ?
David :
When the sun is active , it produces excess ultraviolet light that heats up the Earth 's outer atmosphere and makes it expand .
This produces drag on satellites in low Earth orbit and can cause them to de-orbit prematurely .
Since we 're expecting a small sunspot cycle maximum in 2013 , we have the opposite problem in that we can't get rid of the space junk in low - Earth orbit.1st_in_alphabetical_order :
Do you like your job ?
David :
This is the job I wanted since I was 12 years old .
I look forward to coming to work every morning and sometimes sneak in on weekends ... and I actually get paid to do it !
We 've got time for just a couple more questions .
Thanks to everyone for participating today .
JFHeins : How can we know anything about the inner structure of the sun ?
Is that all deduced from computer simulations ?
David :
For the last 50 years , we 've noticed waves on the surface of the sun that we now recognize as being sound waves trapped inside the sun .
We can use these sound waves to probe the sun 's interior the same way that geologists use seismic waves to probe the inside of the Earth .
We also have very detailed physical models for the behavior of material inside the sun and a good understanding of the physics involved in making stars .
enoch :
What is solar wind ?
David :
The solar wind consists of material from the surface of the sun that 's heated and accelerated to speeds of about 1 million mph .
It flows in all directions off of the sun and streams through the solar system well past the orbit of Pluto .
sayyam :
How will be the sun after 5 billion years ?
David :
After another 5 billion years , the sun should have exhausted its supply of hydrogen in its core .
The core then starts to collapse and becomes very hot , causing the outer layers to expand and create a red giant big enough to swallow up the inner planets ( Mercury , Venus , and yes , sadly , Earth . ) orion :
Do sun activities contribute at all to producing earthquakes and volcanoes here on earth ?
David : Probably not .
There 's very little gravitational effect and certainly earthquakes and volcanoes are more prone to gravity .
jjordan10 : Can everyday appliances be affected by the sun 's energy ?
David :
Anything that relies on satellites can be affected by solar storms .
This includes cable television , communications , weather satellites -- but for the most part , not things like cell phones or your toaster .
enoch :
What is the medium for the magnetic waves to travel through the vacuum ?
David : Space is n't a vacuum .
The solar wind permeates the entire solar system and carries with it clouds of material within embedded magnetic fields .
JFHeins :
Why is there granulation on the sun 's surface ?
David : Granulation is a pattern of convection cells seen at the surface of the sun .
The cells are about 1,000 kms wide , and this is about the depth at which the pressure at the surface doubles .
The pattern is caused by the cooling of the gases at the surface which are finally in a place where radiation can escape to space .
And now for the last question of this chat ...1st_in_alphabetical_order :
It would be an honor if I could have the last question .
Are the NASA cuts going to hinder your future sun research ?
David :
The science side of NASA is pretty healthy .
We just launched the Solar Dynamics Observatory and are looking forward to many years of interesting research .
Thanks to everyone who posed questions today .
We hope you found this to be very interesting and that you got some great answers .
Join us next week as we continue our virtual summer science camp .
We 're talking about Eclipses .

David :
My pleasure -- thanks , everyone !
Fianna Fáil Senator Ivor Callely has insisted that he broke no regulations in claiming from his west Cork home for travel expenses , despite having a base in Dublin .
Senator Callely told a committee investigating his Oireachtas expense claims that he was using a holiday home in west Cork as his principal residence after losing his Dáil seat .
The Seanad Committee on Members ' Interests this morning began a public hearing into the Dublin - based Senator 's claiming of up to € 80,000 in travel and subsistence expenses from his holiday home .
Mr Callely said he had been ' open and honest ' about his expenses and said the expenses system contained a number of anomalies .
The committee heard he paid the second home property tax on his house in Clontarf .
He said that in May 2009 he had asked the authorities to change his normal residence for expenses purposes , but had been told that could not be done until 2010 .
The Senator explained that he makes himself visible and does not hide himself when in Dublin , but he said that he is also seen walking his dog in west Cork .
A public hearing like this is almost unprecedented and the decision to have an open session reflects the pressure on Mr Callely .
He previously told journalists he was based in Cork at a time when he was traumatised by the loss of his Dáil seat .
Mr Callely resigned the Fianna Fáil whip and agreed to submit himself to the committee .
The maximum penalty Mr Callely might face should things go against him is a month 's suspension from the Seanad .
Senators Joe O'Toole , Alex White and Denis O'Donovan of Fianna Fáil led the questioning of Mr Callely , who maintained if he had over - claimed his expenses it had been totally unintentional and if that was shown he would reimburse any money .
The meeting has been adjourned until next week .
GOP
House leaders introduced a bill on Thursday to repeal the health care reform law ... the same day the Obama administration announced that it will begin sending seniors the first Medicare " doughnut hole " rebate checks to demonstrate the HCR 's benefits to some likely voters .*
Interesting juxtaposition .
Stories like this help explain why it 's politically implausible to call for health care reform 's repeal .
The public 's opinion of health care reform as a general idea is still mixed .
But nothing changes minds like money .
Deleting the law means clawing back financial assistance for older Americans with prescription drug bills between $ 3,000 and $ 6,000 .
Seniors are linchpins to midterm success because of their disproportionately high turnout .
Republicans know that .
Democrats know that .
And the administration definitely knows that , which is why it 's waging a PR war against Republicans with early rebates checks .
As the health care bill moved through the sausage maker , the benefits moved to the front and the pain moved to the back .
In the final reconciliation bill , the subsidies grew more generous , but they 're also scheduled to grow more slowly until they eventually fall back to the levels that existed in the House bill , pre-reconciliation .
The excise tax on expensive employer insurance plans was delayed until 2018 and hits fewer Americans in the first few years , but it is scheduled to grow faster than in the Senate or House plan .
So what we 're seeing with the Medicare rebates checks is , for better or worse , something of a microcosm of the bill .
Democrats are front - loading the benefits of the plan and leaving the cost- cutting for the second decade .
__
* Medicare Part D helps seniors pay for prescription drugs up to a certain level -- about $ 2,700 -- and above a " catastrophic level " -- about $ 6,100 , but not in between .
The health care reform bill gradually fills that gap , which for whatever reason has come to be known as a " doughnut hole . "
Noam Chomsky ’s statement on Israel ’s piracy of the Freedom Flotilla humanitarian aid convoy .
Hijacking boats in international waters and killing passengers is , of course , a serious crime .
The editors of the London Guardian are quite right to say that : “ If an armed group of Somali pirates had yesterday boarded six vessels on the high seas , killing at least 10 passengers and injuring many more , a NATO taskforce would today be heading for the Somali coast . ”
It is worth bearing in mind that the crime is nothing new .
For decades , Israel has been hijacking boats in international waters between Cyprus and Lebanon , killing or kidnapping passengers , sometimes bringing them to prisons in Israel including secret prison / torture chambers , sometimes holding them as hostages for many years .
Israel assumes that it can carry out such crimes with impunity because the U.S. tolerates them and Europe generally follows the U.S. lead .
Much the same is true of Israel ’s pretext for its latest crime : that the Freedom Flotilla was bringing materials that could be used for bunkers for rockets .
Putting aside the absurdity , if Israel were interested in stopping Hamas rockets it knows exactly how to proceed : accept Hamas offers for a ceasefire .
In June 2008 , Israel and Hamas reached a cease - fire agreement .
The Israeli government formally acknowledges that until Israel broke the agreeement on November 4 , invading Gaza and killing half a dozen Hamas activists , Hamas did not fire a single rocket .
Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire .
The Israeli cabinet considered the offer and rejected it , preferring to launch its murderous and destructive Operation Cast Lead on December 27 .
Evidently , there is no justification for the use of force “ in self - defense ” unless peaceful means have been exhausted .
In this case they were not even tried , although — or perhaps because — there was every reason to suppose that they would succeed .
Operation Cast Lead is therefore sheer criminal aggression , with no credible pretext , and the same is true of Israel ’s current resort to force .
The siege of Gaza itself does not have the slightest credible pretext .
It was imposed by the U.S. and Israel in January 2006 to punish Palestinians because they voted “ the wrong way ” in a free election , and it was sharply intensified in July 2007 when Hamas blocked a U.S. - Israeli attempt to overthrow the elected government in a military coup , installing Fatah strongman Muhammad Dahlan .
The siege is savage and cruel , designed to keep the caged animals barely alive so as to fend off international protest , but hardly more than that .
It is the latest stage of long - standing Israeli plans , backed by the U.S. , to separate Gaza from the West Bank .
These are only the bare outlines of very ugly policies , in which Egypt is complicit as well .
Noam Chomsky is a libertarian socialist Institute Professor of Linguistics ( Emeritus ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , known as the ‘ father of modern lingustics ’ , cognitive scientist , political activist , most cited living author of over 100 books on linguistics , political science and media , one of the world ’s leading intellectuals and of an elite few in the history of the world to be at the top of two fields : linguistics and political science .
For more than a month now , the debate has raged over how Arizona 's new immigration law could directly impact illegal immigrants and minorities concerned about racial profiling .
But when Senate Bill 1070 goes into effect July 29 , it will touch the lives of all Arizonans .
The law reaches beyond the questioning of illegal immigrants and casts a wide net over people who may come in contact with them as well , making many worry that they may inadvertently break the law .
Most of the talk concerns provisions in the law that make it a state crime to be in the country illegally , but the law also makes it a crime to stop your car in the road to hire a day laborer if it impedes traffic .
It also makes it a crime to transport , harbor , conceal or shield an illegal immigrant if you do so while committing a separate criminal offense .
And while most Arizonans do n't intend to commit a crime that would put them at risk of violating the law , many are confused enough by its wording that they worry they could unwittingly violate it .
They are unsure whether a criminal offense means armed robbery and homicide or speeding and having tall weeds .
They do n't know what activities could be covered under " harboring " or " sheltering , " and the law does n't offer any examples .
It also does n't explain impeding traffic .
Those portions of the law are broad enough in scope to leave people questioning activities they never before would have given a second thought :
Can you still hire a day laborer to help you build a front walkway ?
Should you stop serving food at the local homeless shelter ?
Is it OK to rent a house to someone who may be an illegal immigrant ?
Must you ensure that your landscaper or housekeeper is legal ?
Should you confirm the legal status of your son's friends before letting him drive them to school ?
Legal experts say many of those questions likely wo n't be answered until police begin to enforce the law and the courts begin to interpret it .
For now , some say , it may be better to err on the side of caution .
" Do n't have anyone in your house who is not documented , do n't give anyone a ride who is not documented , " said Jack Chin , a University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law professor whose specialties include immigration law .
" Because we do n't know for sure how this law is going to be interpreted , it 's not free from risk . "
Day labor
The law makes it illegal for someone in a vehicle to stop on a " street , roadway or highway " to pick up someone for work at a different location if the vehicle blocks or impedes traffic in the process .
It also makes it illegal for someone to get into a vehicle stopped on a " street , roadway or highway " to be hired for work at a different location if the vehicle blocks or impedes traffic .
That 's a concern to Marilynn Wennerstrom , who owns an older home on a 3 - acre lot in Mesa .
She said she has , on occasion , used day laborers to help with yard projects .
" I needed somebody , and what am I going to do , go to the grade school and get a sixth - grader ? " she asked .
But she said with the new immigration law , she may have to find another solution .
" Now , if I go down and pick up one of these guys , is somebody going to haul me off and impound my truck ? " she asked .
While the day - labor provision is considered one of the more clear - cut parts of the law , there is still confusion .
Attorneys say there is no legal definition of impeding traffic , and different officers would likely interpret it differently .
It would not apply to someone picking up a day laborer in a private parking lot .
This part of the law is not limited to illegal immigrants , but supporters have said the intent is to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to find work .
Harboring
The law makes it illegal for someone to conceal , harbor or shield an illegal immigrant from detection if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact the immigrant is in the country illegally , and is also committing another criminal offense .
A person convicted of harboring an illegal immigrant is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and subject to a fine of at least $ 1,000 .
The portion of the law requiring " another criminal offense " would seem to give some protection to people who are around illegal immigrants , as they would have to be committing some other crime first .
However , it is unclear how easily some other activity could end up connecting them to a violation of SB 1070 .
State statutes say a " criminal offense " could be anything from a misdemeanor involving physical injury to a felony .
That could include illegally copying more than 10 songs , driving more than 20 mph over the speed limit , getting into a fistfight , drug possession or extreme DUI .
Anyone who commits such a crime and also harbors an illegal immigrant might be violating SB 1070 , experts say .
There is also no definition of harboring in state statutes , and court interpretations vary .
Chin said most people may assume that harboring means actively concealing someone from the police .
But under the letter of the law , he said , the crime could be enforced more broadly .
" If you sell food to someone who is undocumented , is that free from risk ?
No , it 's not , " he said .
" If you have a dinner party and someone comes into your house , we would n't think of that as concealing .
But it 's difficult to know . "
Religious and non-profit groups have questioned whether they could be charged for feeding or housing the needy , businesses have wondered whether they could be cited for having an illegal - immigrant customer or employee inside one of their buildings .
Parents have asked whether they need to check the legal status of their children 's friends before inviting them over for dinner or to spend the night .
Wennerstrom has two rental houses .
She said she has read the law , and she currently has two long - term tenants that do n't cause any trouble and are n't illegal immigrants .
" I 'm not in violation of a criminal offense - at least not that I know of - so hopefully it would not apply to me if circumstances arise where I do happen to rent to a tenant who happens to be in the United States illegally , " she said .
But she said she still is unclear about whether renting is harboring .
" The general provisions and demands of this law are enough to make a landlord or rental agent very apprehensive , " she said .
Bob McWhirter , a senior attorney with the Office of the Legal Defender in Maricopa County , said it 's common to hire a landscaper or a housekeeper and not ask about legal status .
" Everybody is now worried that the person they 've been hiring for a long time may get them in trouble , " he said .
" What will the bill do ?
It 's still hard to know .
You 're going to have different jurisdictions enforcing it differently . "
In order to violate the harboring provision , it must be proven that a person recklessly disregarded the fact someone was in the country illegally .
Chin said recklessly disregarding would be if someone , for example , ignored strong signs that aroused suspicion that a person was in the country illegally but he or she deliberately did n't ask .
" If it never occurs to you that a person is undocumented , then you 're fine , " Chin said .
Transporting
The law makes it illegal for someone to transport or move an illegal immigrant in furtherance of the immigrant 's presence in the U.S. if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the immigrant is in the country illegally .
The law has exceptions for Child Protective Service workers and emergency responders such as police or ambulance drivers .
The possible sentencing is the same as for harboring , and the provision contains the same possible protections , saying people must know or recklessly disregard status , and must already be in violation of a criminal offense .
Because of this , the provision raises many of the same questions .
The law also does not explain what may constitute furtherance of an immigrant 's presence .
Luz Santiago , a pastor in Mesa , is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of SB 1070 .
In the lawsuit , she states that most of her congregation is in the country illegally .
She often drives them to doctor 's appointments , the grocery store and school .
Once a month , she also transports youths to spiritual outings .
" Ms. Santiago is concerned that she could be subject to prosecution under the transporting and harboring provisions of SB 1070 for performing work that is central to her role as a religious leader , " the lawsuit states .
Santiago 's attorney said she would not comment further .
Law supporters have said this portion was intended to target individuals who traffic immigrants over the border .
Phoenix resident Patrick McElroy , 71 , said he has read the law , has been following the debate and believes this portion is n't intended to impact people who are n't smugglers .
" It 's clear on its face that the law is n't intended for a taxi driver who takes someone from the airport to the hotel , " he said .
" If it is , then we have real problems . "
But Chin said if that were the case , then lawmakers would n't have needed to include exceptions for CPS and emergency responders .
" But what else could it mean ?
That 's hard to say , " he said .
" I do not think it 's free from risk to give an undocumented person a ride .
I do not think it 's free from risk , for example , for a public - bus driver to take an undocumented person to the mall .
Buying clothes and food certainly helps someone remain in the United States . "
John Messing , a Tucson immigration attorney who works with both illegal immigrants seeking naturalization and with businesses that work with immigrants , said the law should make all Arizonans stop and think .
" People who have contact with people who are in the country illegally are running some kind of indefinable , unquantifiable risk of breaking the law , " he said .
Finding answers
Arizona residents have heard from state lawmakers what they intended Arizona 's new illegal immigration law to mean , from activist opponents about what they fear the law will mean and from legal experts about what they interpret the law to mean .
But the only consensus seems to be that there will be no clear answers until officers begin to enforce the law , prosecutors begin to file charges and judges begin to interpret the law .
" One of the things that 's always true about laws is how they actually affect people depends as much on how they are enforced and interpreted by the court as on how they are written , " said Tim Berg , an attorney with Fennemore Craig who helped produce a memo on the law for some of the firm 's business clients .
Chin said maybe that was the point with SB 1070 .
The intent was " attrition through enforcement , " to deter illegal immigrants .
" This is not a statute that was designed to give people the ability to read it and figure out what 's permitted and what 's not , " Chin said .
" No clear rules means that people who want to be safe basically have to have no contact with undocumented people . "
Nicolas Hayek , a Lebanese - born business consultant who is widely credited with having saved the Swiss watch industry with the introduction of the Swatch , the inexpensive , plastic  and , as it transpired , highly collectible  wristwatch that made its debut in 1983 , died Monday in Biel , Switzerland .
He was 82 .
Mr. Hayek , a founder and the chairman of the Swatch Group , died of heart failure while working at the company ’s headquarters , according to an announcement on the company Web site .
The formation of the Swatch Group , which in addition to Swatch today comprises high - end watch brands like Breguet , Omega , Longines , Tissot , Calvin Klein and Mido , made Mr. Hayek one of Switzerland ’s wealthiest men .
The exquisite irony is that the company came about after Mr. Hayek was brought in to help shut the foundering Swiss watch industry altogether .
A flamboyant figure with a roguish sense of humor , Mr. Hayek was “ a rare phenomenon in Europe  a genuine business celebrity , ” as The Harvard Business Review described him in 1993 .
Chat channels to return and cross - realm play in the works
Two blue posts on the Battle . net forums have the StarCraft community in smiles as cross-regional play will get a second look and chat channels will be patched in after release .
A blue post by Blizzard Poster Kapeselus has confirmed that a certain form of chat channels will be implemented in a patch after release .
You will be allowed to join chat channels based around your interests .
You will also have the ability to join and create private chat channels , a feature that league managers will no doubt appreciate very much .
A new variation of identifiers will also return in the second phase of the beta .
This will be based on attaching each account with a character code .
These will be three digit numbers added to your nickname that will be seen in the UI screens .
This will allow you to add friends manually .
Bashiok has also come out with a response to communities outcry over the absence of cross-region play .
In his response he states that the overall goal of the Battle .
net platform is to get people online , playing and interacting which also includes allowing people to play across regions .
' Unfortunately , there are a multitude of challenges we have to overcome due to the unique regional account and billing options that did n’t exist in the past , ' writes Bashiok .
'
But those hurdles are n’t insurmountable , and we are looking into solutions that will allow interested players to obtain access to other regional versions without having to buy another full copy of the game , ' he assures the community .
So with the right activism and petitioning the community has had its voice heard and Blizzard has responded .
Despite the release of the game in a little under a month and a half , for most in the community the news of these features are better late than never .

The future of BP ’s offshore oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico has been thrown into doubt by the recent drilling disaster and court wrangling over a moratorium .
But about three miles off the coast of Alaska , BP is moving ahead with a controversial and potentially record - setting project to drill two miles under the sea and then six to eight miles horizontally to reach what is believed to be a 100 - million - barrel reservoir of oil under federal waters .
All other new projects in the Arctic have been halted by the Obama administration ’s moratorium on offshore drilling , including more traditional projects like Shell Oil ’s plans to drill three wells in the Chukchi Sea and two in the Beaufort .
But BP ’s project , called Liberty , has been exempted as regulators have granted it status as an “ onshore ” project even though it is about three miles off the coast in the Beaufort Sea .
The reason : it sits on an artificial island — a 31 - acre pile of gravel in about 22 feet of water — built by BP .

Now Yarborough has gone even further .
In a recent interview with the Florida Times - Union , Yarborough made his radical point of view clear .
When asked if he thinks that Muslims should be able to hold elected office , Yarborough said he would " have to think about it " and it depended on the office .
When asked about gays in office ?
His answer was much clearer :
It would concern me if someone of that belief was on that board if they could address that issue .
Basically Yarborough wanted to see if he could get nominees on a Human Rights Board that would discriminate while dealing with issues surrounding discrimination , saying :
Jacksonville City Councilman Clay Yarborough made headlines this month by questioning and blocking nominees to the Jacksonville Human Rights Commission because of their possible views on gay marriage , God , Islam and prayer in public places .
Yes , Clay Yarborough thinks gays and Muslims should n't hold elected office because only Christians are qualified to lead American back from the " morally bankrupt " way we have taken since the Sept 11th attacks :
I would say that when I read Romans Chapter 1 , I see striking resemblances between where Rome was just prior to its fall in comparison to where America is today .
There are striking similarities in what we allow in our societies .
Rome did not fall from an outside attack , whether it was military or otherwise .
It fell from within because it was morally bankrupt .
Of course a lot of folks will say it 's not because of that , that you can't control the stock market , you can't control finances .
There 's storms , earthquakes , pestilences , what have you .
But everything is for a reason .
That 's right , folks .
Pat Robertson Junior here thinks hurricanes , earthquakes , terrorism , and the stock market ( ?!? ) are God 's punishment on our secular society .
Care to take a guess at his top target ?
The Gays .
When asked about " homosexual marriage " coming to Florida , Yarborough let the crazy flag fly :
No , I do n't believe it should be permitted .
I do n't believe it 's right .
...
That does n't mean you hate someone who is doing it .
That 's not what I 'm advocating .
But it 's not something that needs to be perpetuated in our country .
It 's not good .
It 's not right .
See ?
Do n't hate someone who 's doing it , but it 's not good or right .
And Yarborough is n't afraid to say it .
Thank goodness we have him keeping the gays and Muslims in their place so Florida never gets hurricanes or storms ...
Yarborough is an elected official is our country .
He 's deciding on people who will sit on a Human Rights Board to deal with issues of discrimination in a large city in a huguely populous state .
And he thinks only white , Christian heterosexuals should have any rights or hold elected office .
This is shameful and I hope the people of Jacksonville , and those around the country who vote for extremists like Yarborough , wake up and realize what their votes have put in office and far - reaching effects it has .
Take a good look , America .
MORE than a thousand demonstrators marched to the Israeli embassy last night demanding the removal of the state 's ambassador .
Almadi al Harati -- an Irish citizen whose wife Fatima attended the protest in Dublin last night -- was among the 50 foreign aid workers who were injured when Israeli commandos stormed the Turkish - registered ship ' Challenger 2 ' and opened fire .
Mrs Harati said she has been unable to confirm her husband 's condition but is very worried for him as he suffers from diabetes and a heart condition .
At least 10 people were killed when Israeli troops stormed aid ships bound for the Gaza strip .
" He has four children who have no idea what 's happened and I 'm too heartbroken to tell them , " she told the crowd .
Three other Irish citizens who were aboard the ship were not injured in the raid , which has drawn condemnation from around the world -- including from Taoiseach Brian Cowen .
The protest , which initially drew about 500 people to Dublin 's Spire , quickly grew to more than a thousand as it snaked through the city centre past the Dail and wound up at the Israeli embassy in Ballsbridge .
Pensioners and other ordinary citizens joined activists , trade unionists , students and Palestinians who were all united in their solidarity with the aid workers and their revulsion over the killings .
Dublin Lord Mayor Emer Costello -- who led the march alongside SIPTU 's Jack O'Connor and members of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign -- said she was " absolutely horrified " when the news broke yesterday .
Fianna Fail TD Chris Andrews , who was among three Oireachtas members due to join the international flotilla but who were turned back in Cyprus , said Ireland was appalled by what happened .
" If Israel does this when the eyes of the world are looking at it , God only knows what it does when no one is looking , " he told the crowd .
Sinn Fein TD Aengus Snodaigh who was also amongst the Irish flotilla , demanded the immediate explusion of Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dr Zion Evrony , who met with Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin last night .
War
He also urged Ireland and the EU to withdraw from any trade agreements with Israel and to impose sanctions against it for what he said was effectively a declaration of war against Ireland .
Fellow flotilla member and Fianna Fail Senator Mark Daly likened the raid to the 1969 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry .
Meanwhile , shoppers were urged to boycott Israeli goods during a protest held in Dundalk last night , from where the Irish naval ship the mv Rachel Corrie set sail earlier this month to join the flotilla .
She was carrying 900 tonnes of medical aid including a CT scanner as well as building and educational supplies destined for Palestinians in Gaza .
Sinn Fein TD Arthur Morgan said : " Every night for the week before the ship set sail hundreds of local people went to the quayside wishing it well and then waving it off .
" This evening was an opportunity for the townspeople to follow that up with an expression of sympathy with the deceased . "
Musician Jim Corr told the crowd of about 60 : " Yet again Israel has stooped to another unimaginable low .
Maybe now the world will awaken to the evil that is the state of Israel . "

We 've discussed using the popular " snowflake " method to whittle down debt , but the same principle can be applied to making big purchases .
Learn to put away small , seemingly forgettable micro-payments , and you wo n't have to shoulder all the costs at once .

Snowflaking is the discipline of applying small , unexpected gains in cash ( from selling something on eBay to finding $ 20 in your couch ) to your debt , rather than in your wallet , thus slowly chipping away at the total amount you owe .
Personal finance blog
The Simple Dollar suggests it can work just as well in the opposite direction , when you 're saving up for something .

Whether you 're saving up for a new home or that Blu - Ray player you 've been itching to get , applying any saved or unexpected gains in money to that goal moves you in that direction without messing up your regular cashflow .
There are a number of variations to this method , too , from motivational goals ( adding to your " goal fund " every time you follow through on doing something good , like exercising ) to splitting up your snowflaking between different goals ( adding money gained in different ways to different goals ' funds ) .

The state of Louisiana once more tries to restrict abortion , and shows its true lack of compassion for rape victims .
Louisiana , not content to make sure insurance providers do n’t cover abortion and that all women have to have an ultrasound before the procedure ( including rape victims ) , has now gone even further , and passed a bill stating doctors shall no longer be covered under malpractice insurance in cases of “ elective ” abortions .
From Insurance Journal :
The Senate gave final passage with a 31 - 2 vote to the bill by Rep. Robert Johnson , D - Marksville .
It would prohibit health care providers from receiving coverage under state and private Medical Malpractice Acts when performing an abortion of “ an uncomplicated , viable pregnancy ” that is n’t required to save the life of the mother .
The measure , House Bill 1453 , is headed to the governor ’s desk , despite concerns raised by some lawmakers about denying coverage for a legal medical procedure .
Johnson acknowledged he was n’t aware of any such carve - out for other medical procedures .
The proposal creates yet another scare tactic against doctors performing abortions , this time by trying to remove any safeguards for the doctors against potential lawsuits .
It ’s also a second reminder that the state of Louisiana believes that rape victims should be pushed as far as possible towards carrying their attackers ’ babies if impregnated .
Re : US Okinawa military base and whaling ?
March 6 , 2009
US President Barack Obama 's administration has admitted it would firmly oppose whaling , delighting environmentalists ahead of a key international meeting with pro-whaling Japan .
Anti-whaling campaigners said Obama was signaling a tougher US stance leading into the meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) opening Monday in Rome which is set to look at a controversial compromise proposal .
-------------------
and
This is what the Obama Administration claims :
Under Obama 's deal , the three whaling countries would be allowed to keep hunting whales for a 10 - year period in reduced numbers .
The whaling countries in return would agree to tighter oversight of their operations , including participation in a whale DNA registry .
" We recognize that these measures do not meet the needs of those who want a complete end to whaling now , but neither can it be characterized as a whalers ' charter , " the whaling commission said in a press release announcing the proposal .
" We believe that it is undeniably better than the status quo . "
... The 1986 moratorium unquestionably reduced the number of whales killed each year .
But it 's not as clear by how much .
Some estimate that an average of 38,000 whales were killed each year before the moratorium reduced it to an average of 1,240 .
-----------------------
I wonder what the facts of the matter are ?
At one point was n't Japan planning to quit the IWC over the moritorium ?
If that happened , I suspect several others would follow , and there would be no restriction whatsoever on their whaling .
Then there 's the naval base ....

Please fasten your seatbelts and put your trays in an upright position .
One of the most stressful aspects of budget flights is that , generally , you are not automatically assigned a seat number .
If you do n't want to be amongst the crowd scrambling for seats you either have to pay extra to pre-book a seat or pay for ' speedy boarding ' where you are supposed to be guaranteed to be among the first to board the plane - useful if you are travelling as a family or a group and want to be seated together .
In practice , this sometimes does n't work , as when passengers are ' bussed ' to the plane and you then have to take your chances along with everyone else .
Personally , I normally travel solo and prefer to wait until the majority have gone through the boarding gate - some of whom have been standing in a queue for a considerable time - I then join the end of the queue and then board the aircraft by the rear steps if possible , working my way towards the front to spot an empty seat .
I prefer to sit on the aisle seat and I have no qualms about asking anyone who 's hogging all three seats to themselves to either let me pass or to move over - they generally will do the latter and , with luck , the middle seat will remain empty for the duration of the flight - somewhere to deposit book , glasses etc .
this is especially useful if travelling with Ryanair as they have decided to dispense with back seat pockets meaning you have to juggle everything on your lap !
I follow a similar procedure when the plane lands .
I have never understood the practice of everyone standing as soon as the seatbelt sign goes out scrambling for bags and coats - there 's nowhere to go !
I just sit and relax and wait for most people to leave the plane and then leisurely follow .
I recently did this at East Midlands airport , a bus was waiting at the bottom of the steps , I was last on board and ' hey presto ' first off and through passport control !
WASHINGTON — Usually Shin
In - young and her friends do n't think about North Korea and its pudgy , reclusive strongman who dons retro sunglasses , abhors airplanes and may have ordered a surprise attack on a South Korean warship .
But when pressed for their views on their pariah - state neighbor , Shin ’s age group has some things to say that might come as a surprise to the average Westerner .
A 23 - year - old Yonsei University journalism major , Shin says North Korea does n’t bother her much .
“ I have never taken their provocations as threats because none of them have ever changed my life , ” she said .
Shin and her friends represent a demographic inside South Korea that is mostly indifferent to the bellicose rhetoric and saber - rattling that characterizes the North ’s foreign policy approach .
“ The average South Korean university student is simply not interested in North Korea , ” said Brian Myers , who is director of the international studies department at Dongseo University in Busan , South Korea , and wrote a New York Times Op - Ed on the matter .
Just take his current North Korean affairs seminar as an example , he says :
Only four students chose to enroll in the class .
“ If it was a course on American politics , there would probably be 30 kids , ” he said .
College students ’ apathy toward the impoverished communist state is so acute that many of Myers ’ students lack even basic geographical knowledge of the North .
“ If you show a map of North Korea , he ’s going to have a hard time telling you the cities or even the main rivers , which is amazing when you consider how tiny the peninsula is , ” he said .
In this hyper - capitalistic society where parents spend exorbitant amounts of money to send their children to specialty schools and “ K - pop ” music seems to blare out of every nook and cranny , Shin says her friends are more interested in trying to work for Korean business conglomerates like Samsung and LG .
But the North does manage to turn heads every once in a while , Myers said .
And when that happens as it has with the sinking of the South Korean warship , the Cheonan , intriguing attitudes toward the North come to light .
Shin says that because of the crisis she and her friends now worry a little but still think of “ North and South Korea in brotherhood all the time . ”
Sung Han-na , a student at Han Se University , says hostile views toward the North are rare among South Koreans : “ I ’ve never met anyone who treats North Korea as an enemy . ”
Kim So-yeon , a 23 - year - old liberal and Joongang Law University student , also values a common bloodline and heritage .
“ I ’m one of the supporters of unification , so I try to speak about North Korea in a friendly way , ” she said .
Kim wants the North to keep its nuclear weapons .
She thinks it ’s a justified deterrent against U.S. aggression .
And she does not believe the North sank the Cheonan .
On March 26 , the South Korean navy corvette was severed in two by a mysterious underwater explosion , killing 46 sailors .
After an exhaustive investigation , on May 20 a commission of South Korean and international experts announced that North Korea had launched a torpedo strike on the warship .
But like Kim , other Koreans refuse to believe their government on this point .
A May 22 poll by South Korean newspaper Dong - A Ilbo found that 21 percent of South Koreans still did not believe North Korea was involved in the incident .
Another May 26 poll conducted by three journalist unions found that 41 percent of Korean journalists — perhaps those most in touch with their government ’s record of veracity — also do not believe the findings .
“ It ’s really extraordinary , when you think about it , that for the rest of the world it ’s incontrovertible , but for South Koreans , it ’s just not enough , ” Myers said .
He says much of the skepticism can be attributed to a sizable population of bona fide North Korean sympathizers who are especially concentrated in the southwest .
They resent President Lee Myung - bak ’s strict stance toward the North , which departs from the magnanimous “ sunshine policy ” of prior administrations .
“ People do n’t understand that about 20 percent of the population here not only really sympathize with North Korea but actually sympathize with the regime .
They actually take their sides in disagreements with the South , ” he said .
Most South Koreans believe the North sank their warship , said Peter Beck , a Pantec research fellow at Stanford University .
Still , he added that “ the average Korean ” has not completely accepted the findings and continues to cast doubts on various details .
Some would say this makes sense in a country where every president since the 1980s has been accused for corruption .
Critics see indications of a cover - up and question why the government has failed to produce important evidence like the ship ’s radio communication tapes .
A great many South Koreans are also cynical about Lee ’s handling of the incident .
They accuse him of using the event for political gain to rally conservative - leaning voters to his party prior to the gubernatorial elections that took place yesterday .
Kim would be one such skeptic .
“ It ’s a fabricated story just for the upcoming election , ” she said last month .
But despite doubts circulating the liberal - laden blogosphere , experts say more and more unsure Koreans are coming to terms with evidence that Beck calls “ too strong to question at this point . ”
Shin would fall into this group .
“ I want to believe that it ’s not North Korea who attacked our ship .
However , I am now confused very much .
The rumor saying our government made up the whole story … is not acceptable , ” she said .
Others have taken their government at its word from the get - go and are just plain fed up with the North .
“ During the two horrible years in the army , I was always under stress just because of them .
I want to be set free from it , ” said Kim Dong - hyun , a 23 - year - old who just completed the two years of mandatory military service required of all Korean men .
Indeed , North Korea Heritage Foundation analyst Bruce Klingner says the new generation of Koreans hold views more like this ex-soldier ’s than those of liberals Shin and Kim .
“ For them it ’s less affinity for North Korea , more interest in making money , ” he said .

Barrett Eugene Hansen , otherwise known as Dr. Demento , announced on Monday that he will be closing the doors of his near 40 - year old radio show this weekend in favor of producing shows for DrDemento.com .
While we ’re heartened to hear that he is not retiring from all media , his departure from radio is a shame , and has an ironic twist to it ;
He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame only this past November .
Among other accomplishments , Dr. Demento is responsible for bringing Weird Al Yankovic to worldwide attention ( who , incidentally , puts on a great live show . )
Losing him on the airwaves is a big loss , but knowing that the Doctor will still be around online helps ease the pain of his fans .
As he wrote on his site :
THE GOOD NEWS — Dr. Demento intends to continue producing new shows every week for www.drdemento.com for the foreseeable future .
A new one will be available Saturday morning , June 12 , and more new shows will be posted every Saturday thereafter .
Also …if you live in or around Amarillo , TX , you ’re in luck …by special agreement and due to contractual considerations , a version of the internet show will be heard weekly on KACV - FM there , at least through the summer .
In the meantime , check out this oldie from one of Weird Al ’s tours .
Best of luck , Doctor .

WASHINGTON  Six months after President Obama decided to send more forces to Afghanistan , the halting progress in the war has crystallized longstanding tensions within the government over the viability of his plan to turn around the country and begin pulling out by July 2011 .
Within the administration , the troubles in clearing out the Taliban from a second - tier region and the elusive loyalties of the Afghan president have prompted anxious discussions about whether the policy can work on the timetable the president has set .
Even before the recent setbacks , the military was highly skeptical of setting a date to start withdrawing , but Mr. Obama insisted on it as a way to bring to conclusion a war now in its ninth year .
For now , the White House has decided to wait until a review , already scheduled for December , to assess whether the target date can still work .
But officials are emphasizing that the July 2011 withdrawal start will be based on conditions in the country , and that the president has yet to decide how quickly troops will be pulled out .
Even if some troops do begin coming home then , the officials said that it may be a small number at first .
Given that he has tripled the overall force since taking office , Mr. Obama could still end his term with more forces in Afghanistan than when he began it .
Slavery and the British Empire
" [ T ] he supply of indentured servants to the Chesapeake had dried up in the years immediately following the disturbance of the 1670s [ Bacon 's Rebellion ] .
Even if Virginia farmers and planters had wanted to continue purchasing white servants at that time , the number of indentured migrants was insufficient to meet their needs .
The most convincing explanation of the transition from servitude to slavery in the Chesapeake lies in the changing supply and demand situation for servants at this time and the increased availability of African slaves , obtainable in conditions of nearly perfect elasticity of supply ...
During the transition from servitude to slavery in the Chesapeake , comparative prices for both forms of labour played their part in determining planters ' decisions to purchase unfree workers ... purchasers acted in an economically rational manner . "
The Invention of the White Race
Ultimately , the only check upon oppression is the strength and effectiveness of resistance to it .
Resistance does not refer only to the fight that individuals , or collections of them , put up at any given time against those trying to impose on them .
It refers also to the historical outcome of the struggle that has gone before , perhaps long enough before to have been hallowed by custom or formalized in law — as ‘ the rights of an Englishman ’ , for example .
The freedoms of lower - class Englishmen , and the somewhat lesser freedoms of lower - class Englishwomen , were not gifts of the English nobility , tendered out of solicitude for people of their own colour or nationality .
Rather , they emerged from centuries of day - today contest , overt and covert , armed and unarmed , peaceable and forcible , over where the limits lay .
Moral scruples about what could and what could not be done to the lower classes were nothing but the shoulds and should nots distilled from this collective historical experience , ritualized as rules of behaviour or systematized as common law — but always liable to be put once again on the table for negotiation or into the ring for combat .19 Each new increment of freedom that the lower classes regarded as their due represented the provisional outcome of the last round in a continuing boxing - match and established the fighting weights of the contenders in the next round .
Custom and Law
In the round that took place in early colonial Virginia , servants lost many of the concessions to their dignity , well - being and comfort that their counterparts had won in England .
But not all .
To have degraded the servants into slaves en masse would have driven the continuing struggle up several notches , a dangerous undertaking considering that servants were well - armed , that they outnumbered their masters , and that the Indians could easily take advantage of the inevitably resulting warfare among the enemy .
Moreover , the enslavement of already arrived immigrants , once news of it reached England , would have threatened the sources of future immigration .
Even the greediest and most short - sighted profiteer could foresee disaster in any such policy .
Given how fast people died in Virginia , the lifetime ’s labour of most slaves would probably have amounted to less than a seven - year term of servitude ( fifteen thousand immigrants between 1625 and 1640 only increased the population from some thirteen hundred to seven or eight thousand ) .
20
And the prospect of gaining enslaveable children in the future — an uncertain prospect , considering how few women arrived during the boom years 21 — could not compensate for the certain loss of adult immigrants in the present .
Some of these same considerations argued against employing African descended slaves for life on a large scale ; others did not .
Needless to say , adverse publicity did not threaten the sources of forced migration as it did those of voluntary migration .
Much more important : Africans and Afro- West Indians had not taken part in the long history of negotiation and contest in which the English lower classes had worked out the relationship between themselves and their superiors .
Therefore , the custom and law that embodied that history did not apply to them .
To put it another way : when English servants entered the ring in Virginia , they did not enter alone .
Instead , they entered in company with the generations who had preceded them in the struggle ; and the outcome of those earlier struggles established the terms and conditions of the latest one .
But Africans and Afro- West Indians did enter the ring alone .
Their forebears had struggled in a different arena , which had no bearing on this one .
Whatever concessions they might obtain had to be won from scratch , in unequal combat , an ocean away from the people they might have called on for reinforcements .
Africans and Afro- West Indians were thus available for perpetual slavery in a way that English servants were not .
Meanwhile , the accused rapists mostly got off lightly .
A police officer will serve one year in prison for extramarital sex and two of the other defendants were sentenced to three months for being in the company of a woman not related to them by blood .
While the plaintiff was not granted a lawyer , the defendants were .
Moreover , the plaintiff could not have any family members present with her during the trial , the court decided .
The prosecution also argued that simply because the plaintiff agreed to enter the police officer 's car , this action somehow constituted partial consent to sex , The National reported .
It 's one of in the latest in a scourge of reported rape cases in Dubai , The court proceedings were marred by legal travesties , experts say .
The Criminal Court of Abu Dhabi , in the capital of the United Arab Emirates , ruled this week that an 18 - year - old Emirati woman who accused six men of gang - raping her will herself serve a one - year sentence for consensual sex .
The case has made headlines in the Persian Gulf .
On May 2 , the plaintiff and one of the defendants , a 19 - year - old Emirati military police officer , went for a ride in his Nissan Altima in Dubai .
The woman announced during the public hearing that she had agreed to his offer of 10,000 dirhams , or $ 2,722.61 , for sex .
The police officer 's friends , four Emiratis and one Iraqi , followed the two in a separate car as he invited them to take turns raping her for hours later that day , it was alleged .
The forensics report confirmed that the woman had bruises covering her body from beatings on two separate occasions .
The plaintiff first claimed that her brother attacked her after she confided to her family that she was the victim of gang - rape .
On May 24 , the plaintiff retracted her charges of rape .
Appearing before a public hearing , shackled and clothed in an inmate 's uniform of hunter green and a black headscarf , she rescinded the allegations " to get out of " jail , Bloomberg Businessweek reported .
At that point , she was facing a penalty for extramarital sex , which is 100 lashes and a minimum of three years in prison .
Experts are not yet certain if the reported rape cases in 2010 represent a quantitative increase , as no local community associations or government entities maintain statistics on gender - based violence .
It may , in fact , reflect a social opening whereby the pervasive threat of rape has finally become a topic for discussion in the Emirates .
Patterns do emerge , with time , as defendants in other cases explain that if a woman consents to sex with them , they then may choose to " share " her with friends , as in yet another recent rape case in Kuwait .
Human Rights Watch 's Middle East North Africa researcher Nadya Khalife told Babylon & Beyond that women often keep silent about sexual crimes .
" The majority of women in the UAE do not report rape or other crimes of sexual assault , " she said .
" I think that local and international media are now focusing a bit more on violence against women , with more reporting , and this is encouraging people to openly discuss these issues . "
Cultural norms and social dimensions tend to influence the criminalization of rape victims in the UAE , Khalife said .
" Women who have been raped fear that they will not be taken seriously , or that they will also be charged with a crime , " she said .
" Also , some women are afraid of tarnishing their family ’s name if they were raped because in most societies in the Middle East , a woman ’s honor is highly valuable .
A rape victim may be pressured by her own family to not report a crime or press charges against the perpetrator , or even be forced to marry the same man who raped her . "
Despite the technology and opulence of the United Arab Emirates , debilitating gender stereotypes and assumptions against women in public threaten women 's personal safety .
Khalife explained ,
" The UAE is still a largely conservative and traditional country where women ’s social status is not as high as most would like to think , " she said .
" Issues around sexuality are still considered taboo and viewed as matters that are dealt within the family . "
The courts ' posturing against extramarital sex rather than rape is another disadvantage for female victims .
" Consensual sex is criminalized , " Khalife said .
" This makes it very difficult for women to prove that they were in fact raped because the attention is deflected from rape and assault and the concentration now lies on an act that was committed outside of marriage . "
For victims of rape , the penalties they face may discourage reporting .
" The major legal ramification for women who have been raped is that they will most likely be charged with illegal sex or sex outside marriage .
Illicit sex carries a harsh sentence of imprisonment and / or flogging . "
At least in some cases , the courts come down firmly on the side of the victim .
On June 7 , the Abu Dhabi courts upheld the death sentence for 31 - year - old Emirati fisherman Rashid Rubaih Al Rashidi , who was convicted by two courts in January and April of raping and killing a 4 - year - old Pakistani boy , Moussa Moukhtiar .
In November , Rashidi allegedly offered the young child a gift if he would come with him to the bathroom of a mosque .
After luring the boy , Rashidi gagged and raped him and then smashed his head on the bathroom floor , reported Khaleej Times .
Rashidi is the only Emirati national out of the 24 men currently on death row in the UAE .
Fifteen are Indian or Pakistani .
Death by firing squad , the fate that awaits Rashidi , has not been doled out in the UAE for five years .

Looking back at the Valencia weekend there were a number of things that perhaps need some discussions .
There was much talk about the penalties involved and whether they were fair or not .
Ferrari obviously felt that Fernando Alonso was hard done by , while McLaren felt pretty much the same way about Lewis Hamilton ’s penalty .
There were questions too about Mark Webber ’s accident and what can be done about wheel - over - wheel accidents .
There was a strong feeling that the race track needs to be changed to try to promote better racing .
In addition , there were a couple of other discordant notes : the Ferrari ’s minus any signs of a bar code , or even a white box on their bodywork ( the power of the anti-tobacco lobby seems to be endless ) ; and the appearance of Flavio Briatore on the grid , swanning around as though Singapore 2008 never happened .
The question of penalties created flak for the FIA , largely from Ferrari , which felt that it lost out .
It is all well and good to complain but to suggest manipulation of the results is really going too far .
The stewards took a long time to decide on whether Hamilton should be penalised .
It was right to do that because it was a very marginal call .
As it turned out the track position meant that Hamilton was able to avoid the full impact of the penalty .
Alonso sat behind the Safety Car as he was supposed to do and so lost a chunk of time .
That was more bad luck than manipulation .
When you have Safety Cars going out because of an accident there are always going to be winners and losers .
Alonso is sometimes lucky .
In Monaco for example , he should have been penalised for an overtaking manoeuvre on Karun Chandhok under caution , as the very point at which Nico Hulkenberg had crashed .
Race Control missed that incident and Fernando got away with it , so making too much noise about the faults of others is never a good idea …
There is a solid argument that Race Control should have better tools so that they do not have to be looking out for infringements , but rather reacting to electronic flagging of any and every transgression .
With modern GPS technology there is no reason why all of this cannot be analysed easily and instantly .
I am told that the only thing standing in the way of Race Control getting all this stuff is cost : everyone wants the technology , but no - one wants to pay .
Fair enough , then we will just have to go on arguing every time there is a problem …
The minimal penalties for the other drivers reflected the kind of time that they gained by not slowing down too much .
I think that was a good decision too , because we do not want seven guys going at high speed suddenly all slowing down because they feel they need to .
This creates the potential for more Mark Webber like incidents , which are to be avoided .
In this case I think common sense won the day .
It was tough on some drivers , particularly the ones who came into the pits at the same time as their team - mates as they lost out doubly .
As for the Webber crash , it is easy to get into hyperbole about the dangers and the drama of it , but I think – as several drivers said – that this reflects just how far the sport has come .
This is not to be complacent but rather to give a little recognition to the FIA for the work that has been done .
I know that the federation has done some work on wheel - over - accidents and I would be fascinated to see the results of that research , in terms of whether this kind of accident has patterns which can be used to minimise the dangers ( such as the angle of deflection from the straight path , the height achieved by the car and so on ) .
There were two discordant notes in Valencia that I felt did the sport no good at all .
The track did not produce good racing – for the third consecutive year .
The venue is not glamorous and the race track no great challenge and that is such a shame because the city of Valencia has a lot more to offer than appears on the TV .
The final note was the presence on the grid of Flavio Briatore .
To allow that to happen means that the sport appears to the world to accept that what happened in Singapore in 2008 was OK and that the perpetrators can swan around like they used to .
That sends out a terrible signal about the morality of the sport – if indeed one can use the two words in the same sentence .
If those in F1 want to go on seeing Briatore that is fine .
There are overpriced restaurants all over the world where they can do this , but to do it in front of the TV cameras simply make F1 look sleazy .
A week after Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai criticized Chabad 's activity in Ramat Aviv , some 800 of the neighborhood 's residents demonstrated Monday evening against the attempt by the ultra-Orthodox movement to influence local secular teens .
During the rally , which was organized by the Free Ramat Aviv foundation and held outside the Chabad House in the center of the neighborhood , protestors waved signs reading , " Stop the haredi mission " and " Haredim , leave our children alone . "
A number of confrontations between protestors and Chabad members were reported .
" Ramat Aviv is leading the process whereby seculars are showing that they too know how to organize against the attempt to take control of their lifestyle , " Deputy Mayor Meital Lehavi said during the rally .
" ( We are calling on the haredim ) to stop messing with our kids .
Recognize the parents ' right to educate their children according to their own beliefs and stop your missionary activities .
" Apart from conveying this message , we must act to change legislation in the Knesset in order to prevent spiritual peddling within the same religion , " she said .
" We 've reached a point where secular Judaism and religious Judaism are no longer considered the same religion .
The main message should be ' live and let live ' . "

Councilman Reuven Ladiansky told the crowd , " We 've come here to say no more !
No more harassment !
No more religious coercion !
Every Friday the Chabad members wait for Alliance High School students at a grove near the school .
They harass them and try to persuade them to put on tefillin and attend Torah classes .
We must prevent this activity . "
Knesset Member Nitzan Horowitz ( Meretz ) told Ynet , " This campaign is not against the haredim , it is against organizations that try to disrupt the lives of residents by employing illegal means . "
Some Ramat Aviv residents , among them several seculars , held a counter - rally in support of Chabad .
Yarmulke - clad children handed out flyers with a message to the mayor : " We , the secular and traditional residents , express our and the general public 's support for Chabad 's institutions , which have been operating in Ramat Aviv for over a decade .
The Chabad yeshiva opens its doors to all Jews and serves as a learning center for secular and religious Jews alike .
Unfortunately , the discourse in our peaceful neighborhood has recently deteriorated to mudslinging and scheming against the Chabad community . "
During the rally , a Chabad supporter was arrested for slapping a teenager .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will receive $ 75,000 to speak at Cal State Stanislaus next month , an event that has become steeped in controversy and brought the small Turlock campus worldwide attention .
Much of the scrutiny has centered on the former governor ’s speaking fee , which the university has refused to disclose .
The fact that Palin has received up to $ 100,000 for other recent appearances had stoked furious speculation and the kind of cloak - and - dagger intrigue worthy of a novel .
Now , two California State University sources who have seen the contract for the engagement said that it calls for $ 75,000 to be paid to Palin , along with expenses for her hotel , air fare and transportation .
The former governor ’s travel , however , has yet to be booked and the exact amount of her expenses is still to be determined , the sources said
Palin is receiving the fee in two payments of $ 37,500 each , one of which has already been paid , according to the sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the contract .
Officials in the California State University chancellor ’s office in Long Beach and on the Stanislaus campus would not confirm the disclosure , nor would Matt Swanson , president of the Cal State Stanislaus Foundation , the private nonprofit organization hosting the event .
Representatives from the Washington Speakers Bureau , the Virginia - based group that represents Palin , did not return a call seeking comment .
Cal State Stanislaus officials said the $ 500 - a- plate , June 25 event , which will accommodate about 400 people , is expected to net between $ 150,000 and $ 200,000 for the foundation .
Sponsored tables are selling for $ 5,000 to $ 50,000 .
They have stressed that no public funds are being spent and that costs will be covered by money raised specifically for the gala .
But state Sen. Leland Yee ( D- San Francisco ) has cited the dust - up in pushing legislation , SB 330 , that would require university foundations like that at Stanislaus to adhere to the California Public Records Act .
“ It ’s rather disappointing that Sarah Palin is asking for nearly $ 100,000 to speak at this anniversary event when we ’re looking at state increases in student fees , cancellations of classes and the fact that this money could be going to scholarships , ” Yee said in response to the fee disclosure .
“ She could do wonders for all of us … by taking this money and donating it back to the foundation . ”
The government watchdog group Californians Aware last month filed a lawsuit against the Cal State campus , seeking details of Palin ’s visit and alleging that university officials who are public employees are violating the Public Records
Act by withholding documents .
A group of Stanislaus students has claimed to have found a portion of the Palin contract in a campus dumpster , with requirements for the appearance that included plenty of bottled water and “ bendable straws . ”
University officials alleged that the documents , which did not include the fee , were stolen ; they asked the Stanislaus County district attorney to investigate .
The alleged dumping of documents prompted a probe of the foundation ’s finances by Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown .
From day one , Stanislaus officials said they invited the former governor because they knew she would generate interest and ticket sales in the mostly conservative San Joaquin Valley community .
But they were n’t ready for the resulting tidal wave , Swanson said .
“ She has brought us a new level of attention and we ’re learning how to handle that , ” he said .
But he defended the choice , saying that after looking at other potential speakers , and considering concerts and other more costly events , Palin was the “ best cost and lowest investment . ”
“ It ’s very clear that Palin has a lot of interest in our community , ” Swanson said .
“ We have our usual donors involved , but more than 50 % of them are new donors .
It ’s not our intent to alienate anybody , but in this day and age , new money is the most prized thing of all . ”

Given that superhero comics tend to be about beautiful people in skin - tight outfits engaging in rigorous physical activity , it 's only natural that there 's often a strong sexual undercurrent to their adventures , and every now and then , it bubbles up to the surface .
While it 's entirely possible for super - hero sex to be shown as a completely natural part of their lives , given the larger - than - life nature of the stories , the subject is often handled with all the subtlety of ... well , of super - hero comics in general .
That 's why today , ComicsAlliance brings you five fetishistic uses of super - powers that put a toe over the line into sexual strangeness -- and then kept on running until " sexy " was a distant memory .
# 5 : Plastic Man
Super - Power : Shape - Changing
I think it 's safe to say that wanting to see a sexy lady in a skin - tight outfit is perfectly normal .
Wanting to be that skin - tight outfit and going so far as to transform yourself into a curve - hugging evening gown and hiding in the woman 's closet waiting for her to slip into something a little more accessible , however , takes Plastic Man to the level of someone you just do n't want to be alone with , like a registered sex offender or a congressman .
Especially when you 're supposed to be using those powers to save the world from evil mind - reading super - powered aliens .
Seriously , Plas :
You got off light on this one :
There are two things , though , that make it even weirder than it already is :
For one , that 's not a bad - looking dress , which means that Plastic Man 's either one of the most gifted fashion designers of our time , or ( the more likely possibility ) , this is not his first trip to the rodeo .
He has totally done this before .
Second , and even more creepy , given that Plastic Man 's face and hands are n't visible from the outside , that means that they 're in the interior of the dress .
Good luck trying to ever feel clean again after that mental image .
# 4 . Superman
Power : Super - Lovemaking
It 's worth noting here that Jimmy Olsen is totally stoked about his bro gettin ' his mack on , and really , would n't you be ?
Lois is left flushed , dizzy , unable to stand up , and moaning .
Guys ...
Superman just gave her an orgasm in front of her coworkers by kissing her .
And I 'm not even sure if he slipped her the tongue .
That 's talent .
I 've mentioned this before on ComicsAlliance , but in the vast section of his " Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes , " Michael Fleisher writes one of my favorite sentences of all time : " Action Comics No. 306 suggests that Superman can perform feats of lovemaking of which an ordinary man would be quite incapable .
"
The incident in question takes place at the Daily Planet Christmas Party , where Clark Kent 's response to Lois loudly complaining about having to kiss him under the mistletoe ( a nice little example of public emasculation that goes a long way towards explaining why Superman tried so hard to get out of marrying her every other month ) is to give that " minx " a " Super - Kiss .
"
It 's worth noting here that Jimmy Olsen is totally stoked about his bro gettin ' his mack on , and really , would n't you be ?
Lois is left flushed , dizzy , unable to stand up , and moaning .
Guys ...
Superman just gave her an orgasm in front of her coworkers by kissing her .
And I 'm not even sure if he slipped her the tongue .
That 's talent .
# 3 . Stacy X
Power : Pheromones
There 's no shame in being one of the third - string X - Men .
It 's just a natural function of being part of a huge cast that makes up a massive comics franchise , because really : not everybody can be Wolverine , and somebody ' sgotta be Marrow .
Stacy X , however ... yeah , there 's probably some shame there , what with the fact that she 's a mutant prostitute and all .
Created in 2001 ( almost a year before Garth Ennis and Amanda Conner pretty much defined the super - hooker with " The Pro " ) , Stacy X first came to the attention of the X - Men while working at the X - Ranch , a mutant - powered brothel in Nevada , where she used her powers to deliver mind - blowing orgasms to clients for cash .
A humble origin , yes , but when you think about it , it 's not exactly worse than being a mass - murdering government killing machine .
The problem is that Stacy never really gave up on being a prostitute , even while she was on the X - Men , offering herself ( well , her powers ) up to pretty much anybody with fifty bucks , be it a fellow X - Man , someone she met on the street , Daily Bugle reporter Sally Floyd , or even the Blob .
The Blob , you guys .
Eventually she announced she was quitting the team via -- no joke -- a video of herself jumping rope naked .
Additionally , her Wikipedia entry goes back and forth between hilarity and abject depression like no other character I 've seen :
She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter , even giving Wolverine a proper workout .
Soon after being rescued by the X - Men from the X - Ranch , Stacy stayed at the Institute , but took some time off after " servicing " a special client in Chappaqua , NY .
Wolverine tracked her down and fought with her , but soon the two came to an understanding .
While she was a prostitute when she had her powers , she never actually slept with anyone for money , relying on her pheromone powers .
Since she lost her powers , this has apparently changed .
# 2 : Starfox
Power : Super - Sexiness
We 've talked about Starfox and his powers before , but the short version is that Eros of Titan -- who got the name " Starfox " from the Wasp because he is a foxy dude from the stars -- has the power to make you really horny .
Seriously .
It 's generally referred to as a euphoria - inducing power , but he also has the ability to make someone infatuated with him with a touch , and coupled with the fact that he 's a natural handsome and charismatic guy with a pretty open attitude to sex , it 's led to some pretty awkward moments that came to a head when he was put on trial for sexual assault in the pages of " She - Hulk . "
It was n't just his string of one - night stands that got him in trouble , though :
His powers also had a profound effect on the life of Elliot Kohl , former agent of Hydra :
So let this be a lesson , kids :
Do n't join terrorist organizations that fight Captain America , or you too will have your sexual identity rearranged by a dude in a red and white unitard .
# 1. Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne
Powers : Shrinking and Growing Powers : Shrinking and Growing
The U.S. Department of Justice recently made an important step in fixing our justice system ’s approach toward same - sex domestic violence .
The DOJ clarified [ pdf ] that the Violence Against Women Act ( VAWA ) is intended to protect individuals in gay and lesbian relationships as well as those in heterosexual ones .
VAWA , which was sponsored by then - U.S. Senator Joe Biden in 1994 , has been crucial in establishing violence - prevention and victim - services programs like the STOP grants and Engaging Men and Youth Program , which function to protect victims of domestic violence , dating violence , sexual assault and stalking .
The language used in VAWA is ostensibly gender - neutral–it refers not only to “ spouses ” ( which legally means opposite - sex partners because same - sex marriage is unrecognized federally ) but also to “ intimate partners ” and “ dating partners , ” which means “ a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the abuser . ”
But , as authors of a recent violence against women study report , the justice system has not sufficiently recognized or responded to violence that occurs in LGBT relationships :
Existing biases against gay and lesbian lifestyles and the dominance of heterosexual attitudes within the police department and the courtroom have not created the same atmosphere of legal support and resolution that is offered to heterosexual victims of violence .
To date , research has provided a discouraging account of the police response to same - sex domestic violence .
This research has noted that police have minimized the potential seriousness of the incident , failed to arrest the perpetrators or even intervene and ignored standard domestic violence procedures concerning the identification and arrest of the ‘ primary aggressor ’ regardless of physicality .
Members of the LGBT community who are victims of abuse have long faced obstacles in accessing shelter , legal protections and community support , largely because many police officers and counselors are not equipped to meet the unique needs of gay , lesbian and transgender victims .
Writes Rutgers University public administration professor Evan Stark :
When sociologist Claire Renzetti did her path - breaking research on same - sex violence in 1995 , fewer than 1 in 10 ( 9.3 percent ) of domestic violence agencies offered services targeted to battered lesbians and the rest had no plans to do so .
Because relatively few lesbian victims have been identified at traditional service sites , we have little or no solid point - of - service information on their utilization patterns , though underutilization is a certainty .
Same - sex Intimate Partner Violence ( IPV ) goes underreported in part because officials lack the language for classifying same - sex couples , as domestic violence expert Ola Barnett , distinguished emerita professor of psychology at Pepperdine University in Malibu , observes in Family Violence Across the Lifespan :
Official reports of same - sex IPV are generally lacking because police and the FBI do not have categories suitable for classifying same - sex IPV .
Instead , they place these offenders and victims into categories such as ‘ friend ’ or ‘ acquaintance ’ .
Laws against IPV in some states do not even apply to gays and lesbians because gays and lesbians cannot be legally classified as intimate partners .
The seven - page DOJ memorandum alone wo n’t erase the homophobia and ignorance that many abuse survivors in homosexual relationships face , but it ’s a step in the right direction .
Although the lion ’s share of domestic violence victims are women and children – 83 percent of spousal murders are committed by men and 84 percent of stalkers are men , according to an American Bar Association report–violence does happen in lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender relationships .
Those victims deserve access to the same legal and social protections afforded to those in heterosexual relationships .

If you use standard tap water in your windshield washer fluid reservoir instead of a cleaner , you may have effectively turned your vehicle into a biological weapon .
Sure , that sounds cool and all , but according to BBC News , the only person you 're going to be hurting is yourself .
As it turns out , using plain water can cause the washer fluid system to become a breeding ground for Legionella bacterium – the same nastiness that causes Legionaires ' Disease and pneumonia .
Spray your windshield and the bacteria becomes airborne , allowing it to easily enter your lungs and wreak havoc with your immune system .
Researchers discovered the hive of scum and villainy lurking under the hood by attempting to discern why professional drivers were five times more likely to become ill than their amateur counterparts .
After a little scientific sleuthing , the lab coats unearthed the bacteria .
So do the world a favor and top off your windshield washer fluid reservoir with some sort of purpose - built cleaner .
The stuff will kill the infection - causing bacteria and will keep the fluid from freezing in the winter .
Not bad for 99 cents a gallon .

What the Hell Happened ?

DOSE :
oral PCP
BODY WEIGHT : 100 lb
Last night was the first night I ever actually experienced this drug called PCP .
I did it once over a yr. ago , but I only did a 1 / 4 of a bag and I ate it so it did n't do too much , but I could tell that it was something that I would not like to do again .
This time I did n't know about it .
I was at my boyfriend 's house and we were supposed to go out to see a band so I was drinking some cheap wine really fast to get in the party kind of mood .
One of his friends called him and he wanted to go hang out with them so we did .
These people usually have a lot of diff .
drugs so I knew there was going to be something going on , but I 'm not really into the stuff they do so I did n't plan on doing anything except drinking .
My boyfriend and his friends snorted their lines of PCP and tried convincing me to do it but I kept telling them no .
I was drinking a Long Island Iced Tea .
Later that night the girl that was there told me to read a quote that was posted on her refridgerator behind me so I turned around to read it .
Not thinking anything of it .
I was drinking my tea slowly because I did n't trust my boyfriend 's friends because I was afraid that they were going to put something in my drink or they already had .
After sipping on my drink for more than two hours everyone was getting on my ass about drinking it so slow so they made up a game for me , if the dice landed on an odd number I had to drink .
Well , I ended up finishing my drink pretty quick and knew that I felt more than just an alcohol buzz .
We all got up to go sit on the floor in the living room and that 's when I could tell that something was def. up .
I went to sit down , but I could n't figure out how far away the floor was from me .
This reminded me of the one other time I tried PCP cuz the same thing happened so I knew that I was fucked up .
A lot after that is a blur .
I kept holding onto my boyfriend because it was dark in the room and they had a strobe light on and I could n't see a damn thing .
I thought that I was going to lose my bf .
After a little while I could n't handle it anymore and told him that we had to go home .
This part I do n't remember much , but I guess I kept telling my bf that I wanted to leave , but then I would say I wanted to stay and then two seconds later I would want to leave again .
I remember trying to put on my shoes and I could n't see them except a blurry white glow .
I could n't get them on at all .
Then when we finally went to leave I supposedly tried to walk down the stairs and almost fell and my bf had to pretty much carry me down .
I do n't remember getting in my bf 's truck .
I do remember sitting in the truck in the drive - way of my bf 's cousin 's house and he went inside and left me in the car alone .
I know I started freaking out then .
I was thirsty and kept trying to drink some shit , but I could n't lift the bottle .
Then I remember talking to myself or something and praying not to die cuz I thought I was done for .
Then when my bf got back we went to his house and I could n't walk worth shit .
I had no control over my body at all and could n't even tell that I was moving .
I knew that I wanted to move , but I was n't sure if I really was or not .
After we got in the house things just got more crazy .
I started throwing up all over and I could n't stand up and I was crying cuz I was certain that I was going to die .
I wanted to just got to bed and sleep it off , but when I was laying down it felt like I was laying on a slope and I was going to fall off the bed .
I kept asking my bf if I was going to be alright and I did n't believe him when he said I would be .
My body felt all numb , but I could still feel stuff .
It was like there was a layer of fuzz around my entire body , kind of like when your leg or something falls asleep , but not as bad .
I could n't barely feel my tongue either and could n't talk worth shit .
I was convinced that when I woke up I was going to be paralyzed and have brain damage and have a lisp .
I woke up a few hours later and still felt all fucked up .
I still could barely walk and I could n't focus on one thing .
It would keep jumping from place to place .
Then two hours after that I could manage to see and walk some .
Not it 's been about 14 hours since I took it and I still feel all weird and it feels like I do n't have a brain .
So , if there are tons of mispellings and fucked up shit in here , you know why .
Confronted with a nation of drunks who seem inclined to get ever drunker , Nice , the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , has come up with various temperance schemes .
It wants GPs to ask more questions .
Better still , it says , would be an increase in the price of alcohol , since that is " likely to be more effective in reducing alcohol - related harm among the population as a whole " .
On the other hand , look at the Duchess of York .
The duchess says she is broke .
" I absolutely have not a pot to piss in , " is her analysis of the situation .
And yet , when the News of the World filmed the duchess offering to sell access to her ex-husband for half - a- million pounds and failing to spot , in the midst of this transaction , that the buyer was a famous undercover reporter , she now says she had " been drinking " and continued to drink as the deal was completed .
The newspaper 's video suggests that , although she was not close to being classically hog - whimpering , the duchess had certainly reached the earlier , possibly more dangerous stage of slurring fluent , unstoppable rubbish , to wit : " I 'm a complete aristocrat .
Love that do n't you ?
I love it .
It 's tremendously fabulous .
But I 've never admitted that to anyone by the way . "
It is probably fortunate , in the circumstances , that she did not discover strong feelings for the mystery tycoon or confess that , in some important personal respects , Andrew had never been able to do much for her .
Afterwards , telling Oprah Winfrey about the role alcohol had played in her downfall , the duchess used an interesting , and to some of us unfamiliar expression : " I was not in my right place . "
If , as it appears , she has found a new idiom for intoxication , then at least some good has come out of this dreadful situation .
Although the English are to drunkenness vocabulary what the Inuits are to snow , heavy usage does tend to exhaust the supply and " I was not in my right place " has an air of injured dignity , suffused with pious exculpation , which cannot be said of rat-arsed , legless , paralytic , wasted , pissed , smashed or even , as Christopher Hitchens phrases it , " flown with wine " .
When you think of her background , though , the duchess was being hard on herself .
If she was not in her right place after a bottle or so , you could argue that her late grandmother - in - law , the Queen Mother , spent much of her life adrift on a remote planet .
Always admired for her ready smile and preternaturally high spirits , it was not until after her death that much of the Queen Mother 's endless vivacity could confidently be attributed to the steady absorption of gin , interrupted only by sleep , champagne and meal times at which , as her biographer William Shawcross put it , " the wine was poured with generous aplomb by her uniformed stewards " .
Small wonder that her daughter Princess Margaret continued this tradition , though with more generous aplomb than was eventually good for her , and that her grandson and great - grandsons still seem unwilling always to heed official Know Your Limits advice .
In her new autobiography , Laura Bush recalls Prince Charles 's request for two glasses of ice to be supplied for himself and Camilla Parker Bowles before they joined a receiving line : " The prince removed a flask from his pocket and added to each a small splash of what I presume was straight gin . "
How much more would alcohol have to cost to deter this kind of drinker , along with bourgeois dipsos who , research suggests , increasingly aspire to drink as if they , too , were candidates for the Bullingdon club ?
It seems a little negligent to allow the middle classes to drink themselves to death purely because £ 4.50 bottles of wine are unlikely to be a disincentive .
And even if , as Kingsley Amis once said of whale hunting , that seems a good way of using them up , it is surely unfair that modest but hard - up drinkers should be penalised for the surge in bingeing for which the Labour government , cheap alcohol and the strategems of a cunning , over - indulged drinks industry are widely thought to be responsible .
Without , say , 24 - hour licences , happy hours and vertical drinking , how would those staggering , semi- dressed girls whose fate now obsesses the Daily Mail ever have discovered that they shared this interest with the late Queen Mother ?
To say nothing of Alan Clark , Roger Scruton and , of course , Christopher Hitchens , who argues that " no better form of sodality has ever been devised " .
And , he agrees with the Mail , no worse form of sorority .
" It 's much worse to see a woman drunk than a man .
I do n't know why this is true but it is . "
It is also worse to see ordinary people drunk than privileged ones .
I do n't know why this is true , but it must be , given that the proposals for government action seem to have been prompted principally by a democratisation of heavy drinking , particularly where women are concerned , rather than any genuine interest in stamping it out .
There has not even , amazingly , been a law to prohibit drink - driving completely , presumably because brewers argue that the survival of country pubs should come before that of human beings .
And far from prompting remedial action , the scale of cross-country bacchanalia following the introduction of Tessa Jowell 's " continental cafe culture " has led only to a reinterpretation of drunk and disorderly so as to make it closer to drunk and homicidal .
This fitful interest in controlling intake and the fact that heavier alcohol consumption has been tolerated in the past suggest , to some , that the government and media are merely acting out another great British tradition : that of alcohol - inspired moral panics .
In a fascinating paper on binge drinking , the academics Virginia Berridge , Betsy Thom and Rachel Herring show that heavy drinking , along with disapproval of it , goes back at least to the 12th century , when William of Malmesbury wrote of the English : " Drinking is a universal practice , in which occupation they passed entire nights as well as days … they were accustomed to eat until they became surfeited , and drink until they were sick . "
Plainly , the Daily Mail 's gutter - bound slappers and distraught female over - achievers are only beginning to catch up with ancestors whose crapulence , Malmesbury claimed , cost us the Battle of Hastings ( the Normans having spent the previous night , continental - style , nursing a single Ricard ) .
But as Mr Hitchens says , and sometimes demonstrates , our national habit is not always pretty .
And as Nice explains , aplomb can be an appalling drain on the health service .
Price fixing looks unfair and , on current form , there appears to be little appetite for punishing drinkers who enjoy re-enacting the Brideshead vomit scene in their local town centre .
What now ?
The last big temperance movement had Methodism , public decency , the cautionary tale of Eric , or Little by Little .
But we have something they did n't : a woman who makes Gin Lane resemble a Sure Start centre .
If the true story of Sarah Ferguson does not inspire a generation of children to sign the pledge , then nothing will .
Here are some stories from today ’s press conference :
Parise Excited To Play For MacLean
Add Zach Parise to the list of players excited to be playing for new head coach John MacLean .
“ I ’m really looking forward to it , ” Parise said to Tom Gulliti .
“ Hopefully , he ’ll bring some new ideas , something fresh for all of us , because we need that . ”
As the Devils all - time goals leader ( 347 ) , the expectation is the team will become more offensive minded under MacLean .
Parise believes MacLean will bring the team ’s offensive game up to speed .
“ Hopefully , we ’ll be a lot more offensive minded and play more of a puck - possession game , ” Parise said , “ because that ’s the way these teams that are winning now play . ”
But it does n’t all come down to offense .
What matters is whether or not the players will respect the coach .
Parise , who experienced MacLean running the bench during Lou Lamoriello ’s two stints as coach .
While he was n’t the actual coach , Parise believed MacLean did a solid job .
“ I really liked him then when he was doing that , ” Parise said .
“ And when guys were called up from Lowell this year we ’d always ask them how Mac was doing there and they all liked playing for him . ”
So far , Parise and Jamie Langenbrunner have come to the support of MacLean .
Hopefully , his hiring is this well received throughout the locker room .
Langenbrunner Will Remain Captain
Both Lamoriello and MacLean strongly supported Langenbrunner ’s current captaincy , telling the media that there would be no change in captain this season .
“ I think Jamie is a great leader , ” MacLean said .
“ I actually played with him briefly ( in Dallas in 2001 ) and , having coached him , I think he ’s good for what we ’re going to try to do here in the future .
He ’s been tremendous with the young guys and himself being a veteran he ’ll be able to help everybody with the transition . ”
Well , that ends any speculation from our point of view .
Even though I wrote this piece about how Langenbrunner needed to go as captain , we wo n’t see that this year .
Robinson , Terreri To Remain With Staff
Both Larry Robinson and Chris Terreri will return to the Devils staff next season .
Robinson will return as MacLean ’s top assistant , while Terreri will be back as the goaltending coach .
Scott Stevens will also remain with the organization as a “ roving coach , ” working in New Jersey , Albany and Trenton .
Stevens requested to remain in that role during last season .
Tommy Albelin will also remain in the organization , but his position is to be determined .
Albelin , who was an assistant for the past three years , wanted to gain bench experience .
He may end up as an assistant with Albany .
Lamoriello and MacLean will pick one more assistant together .
MacLean would prefer the assistant to be offensive minded , because Robinson can focus on defensive issues , but it ’s not mandatory .
Peter Ekweri , a Ugandan man , who was deported in Ghana instead of Uganda from Sweden in 1995 is suing the Swedish state after being imprisoned and tortured in the west African country .
The case of so - called refugee dumping was revealed in 2001 and Ekweri was one of eleven refugees left by the Swedish authorities in Ghana .
A Swedish consul is reported to have received several hundred thousand kronor from police to manage the handover .
Ugandan Ekweri first came to Sweden via war - torn Sudan in 1993 , but after a language test conducted by the Aliens Appeals Board ( part of the Migration Board which was closed in 2006 ) , it was concluded that he was from Ghana and he was subsequently deported there , ending up in prison .
“ They locked me up and tortured me .
The other prisoners harassed me continually , ” the man told SVT .
A police inspector had submitted a guarantee that Sweden would stand for the return flight if it was shown that he was not Ghanian , a promise that was however never kept .

New benefit system in Britain forces sick and disabled into work
By Dennis Moore
24 June 2010
A recent report throws into sharp focus the terrible conditions faced each day by thousands of people claiming benefits in Britain .
“ Unfit for Purpose ” , published by the Scottish Citizens Advice Bureaux ( CAB ) , examines the Employment and Support Allowance ( ESA ) with new medical testing criteria introduced in November 2008 by the Labour government .
Part of the Labour government ’s new proposals to get people “ off benefit and back into work ” , this new benefit replaces Incapacity Benefit and Income Support for those who are sick and unable to work .
The report highlights grave concerns regarding the implementation of this benefit and the subsequent removal of applicants who were found fit after attending Work Capability Assessments .
The CAB ’s findings have highlighted areas of widespread abuses .
Claimants report that they are not listened to at the Work Capability Assessments , and that supporting medical evidence is disregarded .
In some cases the claimant ’s actual answers at interviews are distorted .
There have been particular concerns about people with mental health problems , as well as those with life threatening conditions .
Macmillan Cancer Support , a leading cancer charity working with people suffering from the disease , argues that people with a terminal illness should automatically be fast - tracked through the ESA .
Yet they have reports of patients who are receiving intensive chemotherapy being ordered to attend Work Capability Assessments and Work Focussed Interviews .
The CAB reports on a woman in her 50s from South East England with cancer of the face who applied for ESA : “ She was called for a work capability assessment before her treatment began .
In the assessment she scored six points and was found fit to work , although the medical examiner ’s report stated that a return to work could only be considered after six months .
Two weeks later she began oxygen therapy for five hours a day , four days a week .
After this she was due to undergo surgery before further post - operative oxygen therapy ” .
Under the previous rules , those claimants suffering from particular medical conditions could be exempted from attending a Personal Capability Assessment ( PCA ) , as it was then called , if the claimant ’s doctor could confirm the patient ’s condition to the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) .
The new rules for the ESA Work Capability Assessment have limited the number of conditions that are subject to exemption by a claimant ’s doctor .
These one - off assessments have been criticised as a blunt and inaccurate tool for assessing claimants with complex and fluctuating problems , often leading to people who are clearly unwell being found fit for work .
The Labour government had estimated that with the introduction of ESA and the Work Capability Assessment , there would be an increased number of claimants being found fit for work .
The Personal Capability Assessment found approximately 37 percent of claimants fit for work .
While under the new system the government had expected the percentage found fit for work would be approximately 50 percent , the figure has in fact risen to 68 percent .
That is 31 percent higher than under the previous PCA rules and 18 percent higher than the government ’s own estimation .
The Department for Work and Pensions anticipated that with the introduction of ESA there would be an expected 21,000 additional appeals .
Statistics suggest this figure is up to 50,000 in the first year .
This has had a significant impact on the already overstretched workload of advice / advocacy agencies .
The DWP expect 50 percent of claimants who appeal to be found fit for work .
They are then moved onto Jobseekers Allowance , a benefit dependent on the claimant actively seeking work and accepting any work that is offered , however unsuitable .
The government intends to transfer all claimants , some 2.4 million people , to the new system by 2015 .
Five hundred doctors will carry out up to 10,000 assessments each week over the next five years .
Hundreds of thousands of claimants will be affected , in effect being driven off sickness benefit .
The medical assessments are being carried out by Atos Origin Healthcare , a private company that was awarded a £ 500 million , seven - year contract in 2005 to deliver assessment and medical services for the DWP .
Atos has a history of failure and incompetence in delivering public services .
In 2007 the Manchester Evening News reported that , after a series of blunders , health bosses had to recall up to 900 people in the North of England after they had undergone medical scans conducted by Atos , some for serious conditions .
The company ’s contract , worth £ 257 million a year and set to provide 450,000 tests a year , was suspended as a result .
In November 2008 , the Independent reported on the loss of confidential data by Atos on a memory stick that included data on an estimated 12 million people .
The role of this company is just one example of the impact of privatisation of the welfare state that began under Labour and is to be continued under the current Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition .
Last weekend , we warned our customers about a Zero - day exploit targeting Adobe Flash and Reader in the wild .
The corresponding BID can be seen here .
We have updated our antivirus definitions in order to detect this new threat as Trojan .
Pidief.J , and we have done an analysis of this new exploit to understand how it works .
At first glance , the PDF document looks suspicious : it contains a Javascript object and a Flash application .
The Javascript is clearly malicious , and has the typical form of heap - spraying code :
Image 1 : Malicious Javascript code attempting to run heap spraying
Image 2 : A suspicious Flash object contained in the PDF document
Opening the PDF document with Adobe Reader causes the application to crash , which confirms our initial suspicion .
A document used for an exploit should not crash , it should transfer control to the exploit code and run malicious actions from there .
In this case , I am probably using a different version of the software for which the exploit was meant , or maybe the exploit is simply buggy or unreliable .
Anyway , the crash occurs at this point in the code :
Image 3 : The vulnerable code that is supposed to transfer control to the malicious shellcode
The ECX register contains a pointer that is being dereferenced in order to call some function .
In this example , the pointer is invalid and points to an unallocated memory area , causing the software to crash .
Normally a working exploit document would be able to abuse a bug like this in order to cause the code to transfer the execution to the sprayed shellcode .
In fact , having a look around , we can immediately locate what the exploit was supposed to run :
Image 4 : Malicious shellcode to be executed upon successful exploitation
The shellcode is copied at different locations in memory by the Javascript heap - spray code .
Notice all the ' 0c 0c 0c 0c ' bytes written to memory , shown in Image 4 ; these are typically used in heap spraying .
I manually ran the shellcode from its supposed entry point , and I found a decryption loop that decrypts part of the remaining shellcode plus some interesting strings , including a URL , shown in the red box in Image 4 .
Where does this vulnerability originate from ?
As we can see , the Javascript code is only running a heap spray , but it ’s not trying to exploit anything .
So the exploit is likely to be in the Flash application itself .
Let ’s give it a closer look !
First of all , the Flash application looks like a legitimate application that was slightly modified in order to run the exploit .
I started analyzing its ActionScript code , and I found some problems in one of the script modules .
The tools I used to disassemble the script objects were giving strange results , like the two snippets of code in the following image :
Image 5 : Incorrect code syntax
The syntax of the code is invalid ; it seems the decompiler was confused and decompiled invalid bytes , so this is a good indication of where the problem could be .
As I kept analyzing the Flash applet , I found several interesting strings inside it .
Searching on the Internet brought me to a website that hosts the clean application , including its source code .
I quickly downloaded the clean version of the application , and started comparing the bad Flash file with the clean one .
We know that something is wrong in this script and which particular module we have to look for in the binary data of the Flash application .
Since I have the clean version , I extracted the ActionScript binary opcode bytes related to the buggy module that we see in Image 5 , and I compared them .
One single instruction is responsible !
The clean Flash application has a valid sequence of opcodes in the code module , seen in Image 5 , because such opcodes were the translation from the ActionScript code that was legitimate .
The attacker here did not alter the ActionScript code , he modified the compiled opcodes of the Flash virtual machine in order to insert an invalid opcode where it should not be allowed .
As a result , the opcode interpreter gets confused when reading these opcodes , leading to an incorrect execution , which ends up as a memory - access violation .
This modification is very subtle , as the opcode is only two bytes long .
When I restored it with the clean two bytes , the Flash application becomes legitimate .
Both Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash are vulnerable , which means that a malicious Flash application like this can be used both inside a PDF , like in the case of this analysis , or it can simply be embedded in a webpage .
Be sure to update your Adobe software regularly , and avoid opening documents or webpages from any untrusted or unknown source .
Organizers of Madrid 's pride parade , scheduled for the beginning of next month , have announced that they are cancelling the invitation of Israeli representatives slated to appear there , Ynet learned Monday .
The Israeli delegation , made up of members of the LGBT association and the Foreign Ministry , was scheduled to run an Israeli " bus " in the parade , for the first time since its establishment .
But the delegation has recently received hints from Spain that their arrival may cause anger among local pro-Palestinian groups , which may require excess security and , more importantly , cause a lot of embarrassment .
The organizers ' fears peaked with the emergence of anti-Israel protests following the IDF raid on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla , and on Monday they cited lack of security for the cancellation .
Sources close to the affair say the decision was also affected by a number of anti-Israeli groups .
Madrid pride parade in 2006 ( Photo : Reuters )
The Madrid Pride Parade is considered one of the largest in the world , and boasts over a million marchers each year .
The past few weeks have seen Israel 's gay and lesbian community in intense preparations for the event , including choosing its representatives .
Community reps expressed their deep disappointment by Madrid 's decision .
Chairman of the LGBT Union in Israel , Mike Hamel told Ynet , " We regret the fact that the pride organizations in Madrid have decided to focus on issues that have nothing to do with the community .
The Union was invited as a non-political organization .
This is a missed opportunity for dialogue . "
Foreign Ministry official Yossi Levy said , " As far as we know , the Spanish organizers of the parade canceled Israel 's participation for so - called security concerns .
In any case , this is an ugly scandal that turns the pride parade into a shame parade .
" Israel is the only country in the Middle East that holds pride parades , hangs pride flags on the streets and respects the gay and lesbian community 's rights .
The primitive politicization and the blatant capitulation to the terror and violence of anti-Israeli elements go against the Pride Parade 's principle of preventing discrimination , " he added .
" Those who decided to prevent Tel Aviv 's representatives from participating are dragging the Pride Parade into the hallways of the anti-Israeli inquisition , instead of marching on the path of tolerance and dialogue . "
Wikileak Case Echoes Pentagon Papers
Almost four decades after Defense Department insider Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers – thus exposing the lies that led the United States into the Vietnam War – another courageous “ national security leaker ” has stepped forward and now is facing retaliation similar to what the U.S. government tried to inflict on Ellsberg .
Email
Printer friendly Army Intelligence Specialist Bradley Manning is alleged to have turned over a large volume of classified material about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to Wikileaks.org , including the recently posted U.S. military video showing American helicopters gunning down two Reuters journalists and about 10 other Iraqi men in 2007 .
Two children were also injured .
The 22 - year - old Manning was turned in by a convicted computer hacker named Adrian Lamo , who befriended Manning over the Internet and then betrayed him , supposedly out of concern that disclosure of the classified material might put U.S. military personnel in danger .
Manning is now in U.S. military custody in Kuwait awaiting charges .
Though there are historic parallels between the actions of Manning today and those of Ellsberg in 1971 , a major difference is the attitude of the mainstream U.S. news media , which then fought to publish Ellsberg ’s secret history but now is behaving more like what former CIA analyst Ray McGovern calls the “ fawning corporate media ” or FCM .
In the Ellsberg case , the first Pentagon Papers article was published by the New York Times – and when President Richard Nixon blocked the Times from printing other stories – the Washington Post and 17 other newspapers picked up the torch and kept publishing articles based on Ellsberg ’s material until Nixon ’s obstruction was made meaningless , and ultimately was repudiated by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Today , the major response of the Times , Post and other tribunes of the FCM has been to write articles disparaging Manning , while treating Lamo as something of a patriotic hero .
The Washington Post depicted Manning as a troubled soldier , “ slight ” of build , a loser who “ had just gone through a breakup , ” who had been “ demoted a rank in the Army after striking a fellow soldier , ” and who “ felt he had no future . ”
The Post even trivialized Manning ’s motive for leaking the material , suggesting that he was driven by his despair , thinking “ that by sharing classified information about his government ’s foreign policy , he might ‘ actually change something . ’”
Lamo also was quoted , speculating on what prompted Manning ’s actions .
" I think it was a confluence of things -- being a thin , nerdy , geeky type in an Army culture of machismo , of seeing injustice , " Lamo told the Post .
Saving Lives ?
Meanwhile , the New York Times put Lamo ’s motives in the most favorable light .
“ Mr. Lamo said he had contacted the Army about Specialist Manning ’s instant messages because he was worried that disclosure of the information would put people ’s lives in danger , ” the Times reported .
“ He said that Army investigators were particularly concerned about one sensitive piece of information that Specialist Manning possessed that Mr. Lamo would not discuss in more detail . ”
The Times quoted Lamo as saying : “ I thought to myself , ‘ What if somebody dies because this information is leaked ? ’ ” According to the Times , Lamo elaborated on his moral dilemma in a Twitter message .
“ I outed Brad Manning as an alleged leaker out of duty , ” Lamo said .
“ I would never ( and have never ) outed an Ordinary Decent Criminal .
There ’s a difference . ”
In other words , the Times and the Post – two heroes of the Ellsberg case – seemed more interested in making the case against Manning ( and sticking up for his betrayer ) than in taking the side of a whistleblower who had put his future and his freedom on the line to inform the American people how the Iraq ( and Afghan ) wars are being fought .
There has been little suggestion by either the Post or the Times that Manning had done a patriotic service by helping to expose wartime wrongdoing .
The FCM also has shown little interest in the U.S. government ’s apparent attempts to hunt down Julian Assange , the Australian - born founder of Wikileaks.org which decrypted the video of the Iraq helicopter attack and posted it on the Internet under the title , “ Collateral Murder . ”
The Pentagon ( undoubtedly with the help of the CIA and the National Security Agency ) is reportedly conducting a manhunt for Assange , who is known to travel around the globe staying at the homes of friends and doing what he can to evade government notice .
The U.S. military has argued that videos like the Baghdad helicopter attack and photographs of American troops mistreating Iraqi and Afghan detainees must be kept secret to avoid enflaming local populations and putting U.S. soldiers in greater danger .
President Barack Obama adopted that argument last year in overturning a court - ordered release of a new batch of photos showing U.S. soldiers committing abuses .
However , there is nothing classically classifiable about the helicopter videos or the other photographic evidence that has leaked out , such as the sordid pictures of naked Iraqi men being humiliated at Abu Ghraib prison .
Under U.S. law , the government ’s classification powers are not to be used to conceal evidence of crimes .
‘ Most Dangerous Man ’
Yet , except for the changed role of the big newspapers , history does appear to be repeating itself , with the emergence of another “ Most Dangerous Man , ” the appellation that Nixon ’s aide Henry Kissinger gave to Ellsberg during the Pentagon Papers case .
If you have n’t , you need to quickly watch the Academy Award - nominated documentary , The Most Dangerous Man in America : Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers , to brush up on your history .
You ’ll quickly understand how Manning ’s recent arrest and the Pentagon ’s hunt to neutralize Assange jibe with the story of the copying and publishing of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War .
It should also be kept in mind that Ellsberg was n’t the only “ dangerous man ” who helped undo the culture of secrecy surrounding the Nixon presidency .
When Nixon responded to the Ellsberg case by organizing a special “ plumbers ” unit , which then spied on the Democrats at their Watergate headquarters , other whistleblowers , like “ Deep Throat ” ( FBI official Mark Felt ) , helped journalists expose the wrongdoing .
Poor Nixon , in his vain attempt to keep control and power , he just had to keep expanding his “ enemy list . ”
A very similar crisis of conscience exists now .
Power politics , and especially the politics of war , corrupt policymakers who deal with intelligence and security issues – and that leads to secrecy expanding exponentially to cover up bloody mistakes and shocking crimes .
For eight years , George W. Bush and Dick Cheney ran a highly politicized administration that took these inherent problems to new heights .
And Obama , for many reasons , has thus far chosen to “ look forward , not backward , ” and has thus fallen way short of his singular campaign promise of CHANGE .
Despite his assurances of greater government openness , Obama has surely not given support to government whistleblowers .
Quite the opposite , Obama has expanded on Bush ’s methods , such as claims of the “ state secrets ” defense to block court challenges to government actions .
The Obama Administration has even instituted criminal prosecution of government employees who blew the whistle on prior unlawful actions of the Bush regime by daring to reveal , for instance , that Bush ’s NSA was warrantlessly monitoring American citizens .
The final step in the U.S. government 's continuing foray to the “ dark side ” has been Obama ’s signing off on the proposed targeted assassination of an American citizen – who had been linked to support for Islamic terrorism – without any judicial due process .
Imperial President Another major similarity between the Ellsberg era and today is that the United States is again witnessing the accrual of excessive “ War Presidency ” powers by the Executive Branch to the detriment and weakening of the legislative and judicial branches , not to mention significant damage to the legitimate function of the Fourth Estate , the press .
Crude attempts to avoid accountability ( as well as the constitutional checks and balances ) by shredding documents and other evidence to prevent judicial accountability even seem to have succeeded .
For instance , CIA officials learned the lessons of the Abu Ghraib photographic evidence by brazenly destroying 92 videotapes of terrorism suspects being interrogated with waterboarding and other brutal methods .
While no legal action has as yet been taken against the CIA officials involved , government whistleblowers and even journalists who helped expose Bush - era wrongdoing may not be so lucky .
The Obama Administration is said to be threatening to not only prosecute government whistleblowers but to jail a New York Times reporter for not giving up his sources for stories that revealed Bush ’s illegal warrantless monitoring .
No wonder many news executives privately admit that in the current environment , they would never have the guts to publish something like the “ Pentagon Papers ” even though the Supreme Court upheld their prior brave actions in a landmark decision bolstering freedom of the press .
The current crippling of the U.S. domestic press makes it impossible for a singular Ellsberg - type insider to rely on the press as a last resort to get important information to the public .
( Ellsberg had first taken his documents to members of Congress responsible for Executive Branch oversight , but they did n’t act . )
Given the fracturing and weakening of the U.S. press – its transformation into the FCM – a government “ whistleblower ” is more often like a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it .
( Witness the BP disaster in the Gulf and the prior unheeded warnings of whistleblowers who warned of safety problems and potential spills . )
No ‘ Right Way ’
Having been one of the very few government officials publicly identified in a positive way for “ whistleblowing , ” Coleen Rowley has often been asked if there ’s a “ right way ” to do it and also “ what should and can a loyal and patriotic government employee who has sworn to uphold the Constitution do after witnessing such fraud , waste , abuse , illegality , or a serious public safety issue ? ”
The hard truth is that there are no good answers .
There is no effective whistleblower protection in attempting to disclose within the chain of command and / or to warn one ’s Inspector General .
( Even some of the IGs who stood up and tried to investigate have been retaliated against or stifled . )
There is no protection for whistleblowers as well from the Office of Special Counsel .
( Indeed Bush ’s former Director of the Office of Special Counsel himself has faced accusations of ethical breaches . )
In 2006 , the Supreme Court ruled that there is no protection under the First Amendment for government employees making disclosures even if they are privy to and blow the whistle on outright illegal activity .
[ Garcetti v Ceballos — more here . ]
The government insider who witnesses fraud , waste , abuse , illegality or a risk of serious public safety faces certain retaliation or firing if he attempts to disclose internally .
Moreover , his / her warnings will undoubtedly be swept under the rug .
It ’s easy therefore to argue that less - compromised international press outlets and Web sites , like Wikileaks.org , may offer a better hope for getting out the truth .
As Wikileaks.org ’s founder Julian Assange has said about the possibility of more news sites releasing sensitive information : “ Courage is contagious . ”
If the story of the Pentagon Papers is again playing out , the attempt to punish Manning and neutralize Wikileaks.org could be of similar magnitude to the effort employed against Ellsberg and the newspapers that received his photocopied documents .
( The criminal case against Ellsberg ultimately collapsed after the disclosure of Nixon 's illegal spying operations , including a break - in at the office of Ellsberg 's psychiatrist . )
There is one possible answer , however .
Every decent reporter and journalist as well as every honest government employee and citizen who cares about democracy and freedom of the press could unite to do the Paul Revere thing and sound the alarm .
The little bit of integrity and conscience left in the mainstream media needs to be immediately reminded of the Nixon - Watergate - Pentagon Papers history and awakened to the dangerous consequences that otherwise flow from “ war empowered ” Presidents , from their well - oiled military machine and covert intelligence apparatus .
The Fourth Estate needs to go back to work battling the undue secrecy and covert perception management which will ultimately be used against them all and the U.S. citizenry .
( Those who would have you believe that what you do n’t know ca n’t hurt you must like the BP oil executives downplaying their oil spill . )
It ’s quite possible that the future of accountable government is teetering on the brink with the arrest of the 22 - year - old Army intelligence specialist and the fugitive manhunt for the WikiLeaks founder .
History does repeat itself , but not necessarily with the same positive ending .
This time , it could go either way .
The choice now is whether to move toward more militarism ( and the secrecy that protects it ) or toward more openness and honesty – and possibly a more democratic future .

" We do release trains because over years of experience , we 've found that predictability is one of the things that vendors value , " Mike Milinkovich , executive director of the Eclipse Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
" Vendors want to make their release plans with a high degree of certainty that they 'll get what they need from Eclipse , so they can build their product plans accordingly . "
Among the new projects being included with Eclipse Helios are the egit and jgit projects that support the Git source code management technology .
A recent survey done by Eclipse reported that the Eclipse community was increasingly using Git within their development efforts .
" We 're also starting to use Git internally at Eclipse as one of the supported source code control systems , " Milinkovich said .
Eclipse Helios is also shipping with the new JavaScript Development Tools project ( JSDT ) IDE for JavaScript developers .
" What we 're trying to provide is a real IDE for JavaScript developers , " Milinkovich said .
" What we see out there is a lot of JavaScript developers that are n't using modern IDEs and we think that Eclipse can help address that need . "
Better integration with Linux
Linux users will also be getting a boost with the Eclipse Helios release via an updated Linux IDE package .
Related Articles NetBeans IDE 6.9 Release Adds JavaFX Composer and PHP Tools
" Basically in the past year , the Linux Tools project has made a lot of progress so they 're now pulling in support in the IDE for quite a few popular Linux tools including RPM , Valgrind , Autotools and others , " Milinkovich said .
" So there is much better integration with Linux tools . "
Eclipse is also aiming to make it easier for developers to find plugins for Eclipse projects more easily with the new Eclipse Marketplace Client .
Milinkovich noted that for the Helios release , the marketplace will show approximately 100 plugins with the number set to grow over time .
The plugins will be a mix of both open source as well as commercial plugins offered by Eclipse member companies .
The Eclipse Helios release also includes an updated version of the core Eclipse IDE itself with new comment formatting and patching support .
Eclipse and NetBeans in Joint Development ?
Over the past seven years , Eclipse , both as an IDE and as a community , has in part been in competition with the Sun-led NetBeans effort , which is now run by Eclipse Foundation member Oracle .
Last week , Oracle released NetBeans 6.9 including new JavaFX capabilities .
With Oracle now in control of NetBeans , Milinkovich thinks that it might be time to bring the Eclipse and NetBeans communities together .
" Having NetBeans and Eclipse competing with each other in offering free IDEs for Java developers is not helping Java any longer .
So we'd be open to doing something to bring those communities together .
The big win is that it's not the Eclipse or the NetBeans community , it 's the Java community . "

Shutting Out Parents
Obama 's Disappointing Blueprint for Reform
As public school parents and parent advocates , we have grave reservations about the Obama administration ’s " blueprint for reform " , laying out its proposals for the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act .
Along with 16 other parent activists from throughout the country , we recently wrote a letter to the president and Congress , which hundreds more signed on to , registering our opposition to the administration ’s agenda for the nation ’s schools .
As this letter from “ parents across America ” pointed out , the parent voice has been missing so far from the national debate on education , and is entirely absent from the top - down , often draconian policies put forward by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan .
Secretary Duncan ’s approach not only ignores the central role parents should play in their children ’s education and lives , but also gives scant attention to the reforms we believe are necessary to improve our schools .
Overall , we strongly maintain that the blueprint ’s proposals would undermine rather than strengthen the public education system , particularly in the urban districts whose parents we represent .
We are aware that Secretary Duncan ’s track record in Chicago included dismantling parent - majority local school councils and returning millions in federal parent - involvement funds to Washington because of administrative roadblocks to their use .
The fact that the blueprint for federal education programs the secretary helped devise omits the need to involve parents in decisionmaking cries out for redress .
Most of the funding for family - engagement programs has been cut , with the remainder consolidated into the federal charter - school and parent - choice programs .
The only instance in which parent involvement in decisionmaking is mentioned in the blueprint is to require that parents of Native American children be included in the design of programs at the school level .
Secretary Duncan ’s May 3 speech to the Mom Congress on Education and Learning , held at Georgetown University in Washington , seemed more focused on chastising parents for supporting their local schools than on presenting effective new proposals for engaging their ideas .
The secretary offered mostly tired nostrums to the parents in the audience who expressed frustration with being ignored by their school leadership .
His proposed doubling of Title I parent - involvement funds , from 1 percent to 2 percent , while welcome , will be unproductive if parents are not given adequate opportunities to participate in the planning and implementation of Title I programs , as well as other education reforms .
And it ’s not just the issue of involvement that concerns parents .
Many schools in our communities are already experiencing or anticipating sharply increased class sizes and shortened school years as a result of the current economic crisis .
Yet the blueprint ’s proposed funding system would rely primarily on competitive grants and questionable policies , as exemplified by the administration ’s Race to the Top initiative .
This means that millions of at - risk children will become losers in the race for federal funds , while simultaneously being victimized by unproven approaches to learning .
For example , the requirement that 5 percent of schools be closed or turned into charter schools , or that half their teaching staffs be fired , is overly disruptive , and unlikely to help these schools improve .
Though the U.S. Department of Education calls such proposals “ innovation , ” we see them as representing large - scale experiments on our children — experiments lacking a foundation in research and implemented without informed parental consent — something that would never be allowed in fields such as medicine .
We speak from experience .
In Chicago , the mass closure of schools has been associated with increased violence , including students murdering other students .
Moreover , research has shown that the students sent elsewhere after the closure of their schools did no better academically than before .
In New York City , the closing of schools has led to more overcrowding and the destabilization of nearby schools , and sharp spikes in the number of students categorized as “ discharges , ” those leaving the system or being pushed out without graduating , yet never counted as dropouts .
We object to the reform blueprint ’s focus on privatization and its push to radically expand the charter school sector .
Though some charters may offer students a quality education , one of the largest national studies shows they are , on average , no better , and frequently worse , than neighboring regular public schools .
Charters also draw money , space , and other resources from district schools , while enrolling fewer of their communities ’ immigrant , special - needs , and poor children .
The punitive approaches proposed by the administration are also likely to deter rather than attract qualified teachers to work in the highest - need schools .
Blaming teachers and threatening them with the loss of their jobs in underresourced , overcrowded schools that enroll the most at - risk students is like blaming doctors for all the problems of our inequitable health - care system , and it will lead to even greater inequities in the distribution of experienced teachers .
Tying teacher pay and tenure to gains or losses in students ’ standardized - test scores will make the prospect of teaching in inner cities less attractive .
According to the National Academy of Sciences , such tests are also a highly unreliable basis for judging teachers .
Too many schools have already become joyless test - prep factories , rather than centers of real learning .
All children , especially those in inner cities whose parents cannot afford to supplement their schooling , need and deserve a full complement of social studies , science , arts , and physical education .
Yet these subjects are being driven out of the curriculum by the high - stakes testing regime imposed in recent years .
The Obama blueprint pays lip service to the need for a well - rounded education , but its proposals to link teacher evaluation and pay to the results of high - stakes exams are likely to make a bad situation even worse .
Finally , this blueprint pays almost no attention to the need to address enormous disparities in funding across and within states , saying only that “ states will be asked to measure and report on resource disparities and develop a plan to tackle them . ”
In a plan filled with heavy - handed threats and promises of financial windfalls for states that adhere to the administration ’s preferred approaches of closing schools , firing teachers , tying their pay to test scores , and opening more charters , this statement seems to be a mere afterthought , with no consequences attached .
Education is a public trust , and the very foundation of our democracy .
Congress holds a great responsibility in its hands in the pending reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act .
We are well aware that powerful corporate and foundation interests are shaping many federal and local education policies with dollars rather than evidence - based solutions .
We hope that Congress and the administration will listen more carefully to parents as they deliberate on this crucial piece of legislation , and that the next version of the ESEA formally incorporates our views .
As highly knowledgeable primary stakeholders , we must be permitted to have a seat at the decisionmaking table .
If lawmakers truly listened , they would turn away from the risky experiments in the administration ’s blueprint and replace them with real solutions to the problems facing schools , including putting an end to unfair funding disparities , reducing class sizes , providing a balanced curriculum with multiple methods of assessment , and requiring that schools and districts involve parents in decisionmaking .
These are the changes that parents want , that will work , and that , if incorporated into the ESEA , will provide our neediest public school children with their best chance to learn and succeed .

The first named storm of the Atlantic season has hit BP 's oil spill clean - up efforts in the Gulf of Mexico .
Hurricane Alex , upgraded from tropical storm status late last night and expected to hit the coasts of Mexico and Texas later today , is expected to interrupt the company 's efforts for several days to come .
Waves as high as 3.6 metres ( 12ft ) are expected to delay the company 's plans to employ a further system to capture more oil from the blown - out oil well until later in the week , while controlled burns of crude on the oil 's surface , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all halted yesterday , officials said .
Alex , the first June storm in 15 years to gain hurricane strength in the Atlantic , is expected to make land tonight , bringing 15 - 30 cms ( 6 - 12ins ) of rain to north - eastern Mexico and southern Texas as well as dangerous storm surges along the coast .
The hurricane has winds of 80 mph and was located about 255 miles south - east of Brownsville , Texas , at 7 am today UK time .
It was moving west at 5 mph , the US national hurricane centre said .
Mexico has closed its Gulf coast ports of Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas – which handle around 80 % of the country 's oil exports – since Sunday because of strong surf .
Although Alex is hampering BP 's clean - up efforts , the company has said the storm is not expected to interrupt plans to drill two relief wells intended to plug the leak by August .
A hurricane warning has been issued for the coast of Texas , south of Baffin Bay down to the mouth of the Rio Grande , and along the north - east coast of Mexico .
A tropical storm warning extends south along the east Mexican coast to Cabo Rojo , just south of the port city of Tampico .
Officials in south Texas have prepared rescue vehicles and shelters in San Antonio and Laredo , and rushed supplies to the Rio Grande Valley .
Bob Pinkerton , mayor of South Padre Island , a coastal community where the entire economy rests on tourism , last night urged residents and visitors to evacuate .
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November , and meteorologists predict this year 's to be an active one .

The Case of TDL3 Posted by Mikko @ 10:05 GMT
Ace from our Kuala Lumpur lab has written a technical white paper on the internals of the highly advanced TDL3 trojan .
The paper goes deep into the features of this advanced backdoor / rootkit .
You can download " The Case of Trojan DownLoader TDL3 " from here [ 2MB PDF file ] .
In some ways , TDL3 is similar to the infamous Mebroot rootkit .
For a thorough discussion on Mebroot , see our presentation from 2008 .

It could become one of the longest skiing seasons on record
Hundreds of skiers and snowboarders dressed for the summer have been enjoying a " carnival atmosphere " as the sun shone on a Highland ski resort .
About 200 snow sports fans took to the slopes at CairnGorm Mountain to enjoy the unseasonably warm temperatures of 21C on the slopes .
Operations manager Colin Matthew said skiing was still possible right down to mid-mountain level .
He said it was set to become one of the longest skiing seasons on record .
Mr Matthew said : " CairnGorm today has had a real carnival atmosphere with the public out in shorts , shades , t- shirts and even the occasional kilt .
" The sledge park and the fun park have both been really popular today .
" Snow conditions are soft and a bit like summer skiing on a European glacier with the temperature on the top slopes well into the lower 20s - the only difference is that we 're short a few thousand feet on altitude here at CairnGorm . "
He added that he hoped skiing would continue until at least the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of May .
First of all , historians will be shocked by the numerous inaccuracies crammed into the sixty second commercial .
Then there are the veterans who would be offended by the suggestion that armed insurrection against the U.S. is an acceptable form of political dissent .
And other patriots will object to these pretend revolutionaries using the American flag as a table cloth .
And , of course , Stephen Colbert will likely want to sue Barber for appropriating his persona ( but not nearly as funny ) .
But who could have anticipated that Glenn Beck would emerge as the harshest critic of Barber ?
Beck called Barber " a dope " and said that he is " one of dumbest people I have seen . "
You have to wonder what would set Beck off to this degree .
After all , Barber 's ad was as close to a tribute to Beck as could be imagined .
He featured Beck 's three favorite Founders .
He mirrored Beck 's disingenuous devotion to the Constitution .
He covered the conspiratorial territory that Beck plods incessantly .
He did everything but genuflect and chant Beck 's name .
Beck even prefaced his criticism by saying that he agreed with Barber 's description of the IRS .
So why is Beck so outraged and offended ?
Perhaps the answer lies in these remarks by Beck on his radio program today :
" How many times did they stand up peacefully ?
How many times did they stand up and get onto a ship and vomit off the side of it so they could go deliver a letter to the king ?
Well , I know it 's been a tough couple of years , it may not be time yet to gather your armies . "
Setting aside the vomiting Founders , Beck tells us here precisely why he 's mad : Barber jumped the gun , and in the process , spilled the beans .
Beck is n't upset at Barber for overtly advocating violent rebellion .
He 's upset that Barber spoke too soon .
Beck is n't ready yet .
And Barber committed the cardinal sin of upstaging Beck and usurping his role as the Messianic leader of the revolt .
This conclusion is painfully obvious .
Why else would Beck get so worked up over a call to " gather your armies ? "
The last sentence of his new novel ( released today by coincidence ( ? ) ) menacingly declares ...
" We 're everywhere .
Stay with us .
I 'll see you soon .
The fight starts tomorrow . "
How exactly is that different than Barber 's call to arms ?
OK , Beck 's book is fiction , or as he calls it , " faction . "
Beck says that the events in the book are made up , but he also says that the ideas are rooted in the truth .
But Barber 's ad is not exactly non-fiction , given that he is seen conversing with long - dead historical figures .
So there really is no difference between them other than Barber 's audacity for getting out in front of Beck 's parade .
Beck has an event coming up in August that is scheduled to be the launch party for his next book , " The Plan , " a 100 year blueprint for the restoration of America .
I can understand why Beck would be angry at Barber for stealing the thunder he hopes to rain down on his disciples .
He has been planning for the release of The Plan for months .
How dare Barber spoil it all by promoting his own crackpot schemes to get elected to Congress ?
That 's what Beck is so infuriated by .
Beck will lead his troops into battle when the time is right and not before .
And woe be to anyone who imperils his plot or gets in his way .
Bonus Hypocrisy : Keith Olbermann also criticized Barber 's ad , but Beck found no common quarter with him .
In fact , Beck bashed Olbermann as a ...
" ... two -faced , no talent , soon to be washed up , alcoholic , throw yourself off the ledge of a building cause you such a loser , kind of guy . "
So when Beck calls Barber out it 's righteous indignation .
When Olbermann does it , it makes him a loser .
More importantly , I 've never heard any suggestion that Olbermann was an alcoholic .
But Beck 's litany of insults paint an accurate picture of Beck himself .
Beck is a former abuser of alcohol and drugs .
He admits to being suicidal on multiple occasions .
He has lost about half his audience since the beginning of the year .
And neither of his faces have any talent .
Forget European banks for the moment .
We know why they 're troubled .
Check out oil .
StockCharts.com :
It took a huge leg down on Friday , and if you 're the type who cares about lines and technicals , it 's now well below the 200 - day moving average , which screams bear market ( and would also seem to scream deflation ) .
Of course , it 's been impressively volatile , and was this low right after Scott Brown .
Now on the other hand , investors continue to sing the praises of Palladium , which remains near all - time highs .
He 's a glowing , pro-Palladium article in Bloomberg .
Its big use is catalytic converters for cars .
And yet , oil would also seem to benefit from the same trends , so the disparity is a bit odd .
Of course , there are supply issues as well , so merely looking at demand is only getting half of the equation .
Yet the disparity is interesting .
U.S. DISTRICT COURT GIVES FDA A SORELY NEEDED DRUBBING
By Attorney Jonathan Emord
June 3 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
On May 27 , 2010 , the Honorable Ellen Segal Huvelle of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that FDA violated the First Amendment when it variously censored and saddled with lengthy and inaccurate disclaimers ten health claims associating the essential nutrient selenium with a reduction in the risk of certain kinds of cancer .
The decision ( Alliance for Natural Health v. Sebelius ) is momentous .
It upsets a plan underway within the Commission to undermine and disavow compliance with the final and binding orders of the United States Court of Appeals in Pearson v. Shalala , a plan fully in accord with the wishes of that dedicated fan of unlimited government , Congressman Henry Waxman .
I have had the privilege of representing the plaintiffs in the Pearson cases , including the present one , Alliance for Natural Health v. Sebelius , holding FDA censorship of selenium claims unconstitutional .
In the landmark Pearson v. Shalala case , the FDA ’s censorship of four nutrient - disease relationship claims ( including ones associating antioxidant vitamins with cancer risk reduction ; folic acid with neural tube defect risk reduction ; fiber with colorectal cancer risk reduction ; and omega - 3 fatty acids with coronary heart disease risk reduction ) was held unconstitutional under the First Amendment .
The story behind the story is that FDA utterly refuses to comply with the Pearson decision and with that case ’s progeny .
A short time after Pearson v. Shalala was decided , I was informed by an FDA employee in the know that the FDA would “ never abide by that court decision , never , ever . ”
He meant to dissuade me from future litigation on the notion that it would be costly and futile given the fact that FDA would continue to censor claims , regardless of what the courts ruled .
In other words , that FDA employee put me on notice that an agency of the government that regulates about one - quarter of the economy viewed itself as unconstrained by final and binding constitutional mandates from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
The statement shook me to my core and has been a source of recurrent reflection for me as I have watched that agency defy federal court orders and flout statutory requirements again and again .
For me , it confirmed that this agency ’s refusal to abide by the court orders it disliked was not the product of bureaucratic incompetence but was by design .
There can be no rule of law , no constitutional limit on the exercise of government power , and no ethics in government service if those who rule powerful federal agencies , like the FDA , so disrespect the authority of the federal courts that they will ignore or circumvent the courts ’ orders .
There can be no meaningful separation of powers if the FDA can with impunity violate and circumvent court orders as if it , not those courts , were the final arbiter of the legality of agency action .
That agency hubris and lawlessness has in fact been operative since Pearson v. Shalala was decided in 1999 .
Political forces dominant within the FDA , and in particular within its all powerful Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , are committed to protecting the pharmaceutical industry from competition that would otherwise arise if the public understood the disease risk reducing effects of a host of nutrients .
FDA routinely censors accurate claims concerning the state of nutrition science in disease risk reduction .
The political aim prompting the censorship is to preserve a monopoly on therapeutic claims for the drug industry .
Those who work closely with this agency , as I have over the years , know well that it is a captive of the drug industry .
Agency whistleblowers , not least of which is David Graham , the Associate Director of the FDA Office of Drug Safety , have stated repeatedly to Congress that FDA views its mission as approving as many drugs as possible , excoriates and ostracizes agency medical reviewers who contend a drug too unsafe to be marketed , and considers the drug industry not a true regulatee but , rather , the agency ’s “ client . ”
Advertisement
The drug industry jealously guards its FDA - enforced monopoly over the right to make therapeutic claims and views dietary supplements as annoying sources of potential competition if ever allowed to inform the public of disease risk reducing effects arising from ingestion of certain food elements .
By serving as the industry ’s agent in condemning nutrient health claims , the FDA ensures that consumers turn first to drugs rather than to elements in the food supply when seeking a disease risk reduction or prevention strategy .
Maintaining a public mind set that associates drug treatment as the sole source of meaningful health maintenance pays huge dividends when , for example , consumers choose to ingest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to dull the pain associated with osteoarthritis rather than the dietary supplements glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to repair that cartilage ; choose to ingest anti-clotting drugs as a preventive of heart disease when omega - 3 fatty acids appear quite effective and safe for that same purpose ; and choose to apply over - the - counter drugs for relief of common sun burn when vitamin E and aloe may be superior to those drugs and far less toxic .
While profitable to the government protected drug industry , maintenance of the false mindset that drugs are the only answer to disease prevention increases risks to human health because synthetic drugs typically beget side effects that elements in the daily diet do not .
Thus , it would behoove all of us to adopt a healthy dietary regimen , replete with certain dietary supplements that at above RDI levels beget health and disease risk reduction benefits , than to proceed ignorant of emerging science concerning health effects of the diet and depend instead on crisis intervention with toxic drugs only after diseases that could have been prevented come to the fore .
We can do so only if we are well enough informed , but it is the aim of the FDA to keep us in the dark so that its favored regulatee , the drug industry , can enjoy an absolute monopoly on the dissemination of therapeutic information .
I remember too well the horror stemming from FDA ’s rigid refusal for over 4 years to allow a folic acid-neural tube defect risk reduction claim to reach the market .
The CDC and NIH were trumpeting to doctors for over two decades that 400 micrograms of folic acid when consumed daily by women of childbearing age before they became pregnant could cut the risk of spina bifida or anencephaly by as much as 40 percent .
Former FDA Commissioner David Kessler , a pediatrician , refused to let that information appear in the market on folic acid containing dietary supplements and foods .
The consequence was that women were first hearing of the risk reduction when they approached their obstetricians with a pregnancy , not before when the supplement has to have been ingested to achieve risk reduction .
Thus , some 2,500 preventable neural tube defects occurred each year as women unaware of the need to consumer folic acid daily before pregnancy suffered the monstrous realization after the fact that their newborns were so afflicted ( many many more chose to abort their NTD - afflicted fetuses ) .
To protect the drug approval process from competition , Dr. Kessler condoned the sacrifice of thousands of children .
Even when political pressure ultimately forced Kessler to back down , he chose to allow the claim only for foods , not for supplements , and yet supplements were the only reliable means to impart folic acid at the 400 microgram or above level , daily .
Vegetables and other foods containing folate lose large quantities of that folate during normal shelf life , chopping , cooking , and steaming .
That reality did not deter the agency from maintaining its drug supportive bias .
People would surely look at a dietary supplement as a potential disease preventive if the agency allowed supplements containing folic acid to be viewed as neural tube defect risk reducers .
So , the agency reluctantly allowed the claim for foods .
Only after my firm sued the FDA ( and ultimately defeated it ) , did the agency finally allow the claim to be made for dietary supplements .
Since the claim has entered the market there has been a steady reduction in neural tube defect births in America .
Women are getting the message and it is proving to be a life saver .

The selenium case just won is another excellent case in point .
Judge Huvelle brilliantly saw through the FDA ’s manipulation of the science , noting contradictions and false representations in the agency ’s analysis , and she strongly defended the First Amendment against the agency ’s attempt to negate it .
We now await to see if FDA will finally accept constitutional limits on its power or will balk yet again , choosing lawlessness to the rule of law .
If history is our guide , FDA will continue to be a brigand .
Paul Gray , the bassist from the band Slipknot , was found dead in a hotel in Iowa this morning ... this according to local police .
According to the Urbandale Police Dept , an employee at the hotel found Gray 's body in his room early this morning .
Cops say they found no evidence of foul play at the scene , but there will be an investigation into Gray 's death .
We 're all familiar with those days when your modem locks up and you have to unplug it from the wall , but if you 're more familiar than most , you can create an automatic power cycler with just a few basic electronics .

While you may want to try getting a new modem first , sometimes your internet connection just does n't agree with you and you 're stuck power cycling the modem much more often than you 'd like to .
While you may be able to automate the rebooting process using software ( since you can probably reboot your router or modem from your browser ) , that wo n't always work either .
When all other solutions leave you with nothing , blogger Gigawatts shows us how to make your own power cycler that will reboot the router whenever it detects a lack of internet connection .

Depending on your experience and dedication to the project , there are a number of ways to go about building the relay .
Gigawatts ' original version was a bit simpler and was housed in a peanut butter jar , consisting of a transistor , a relay , a DB - 9 connector , and a molex connector , but if you 're a bit more experienced with electronics , he has instructions for embedding the relay inside the wireless router itself .
Together with a cron task for his DD - WRT hacked router , the relay could detect when the internet connection died and automatically cut the power to the modem — a pretty clever workaround to an annoyance we 're all familiar with .

Steampunk is a retrofuturistic subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th - century industrial steam - powered machinery . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Although its literary origins are sometimes associated with the cyberpunk genre , [ 4 ] steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American " Wild West " , where steam power remains in mainstream use , or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power .
Steampunk most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them — distinguishing it from Neo- Victorianism [ 5 ] — and is likewise rooted in the era 's perspective on fashion , culture , architectural style , and art . [ 6 ]
Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne . [ 7 ]
Other examples of steampunk contain alternative - history - style presentations of such technology as steam cannons , lighter - than - air airships , analog computers , or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine.[ citation needed ]
Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy , horror , historical fiction , alternate history , or other branches of speculative fiction , making it often a hybrid genre .[ citation needed ]
The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987 , though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier [ 8 ]
A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk , consisting of steampunk - themed manga and anime , [ 9 ] with steampunk elements having appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s . [ 10 ]
Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles , clothing fashions , or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction , Victorian - era fiction , art nouveau design , and films from the mid-20th century . [ 11 ]
Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo - Victorian mechanical " steampunk " style , and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk . [ 12 ]
History [ edit ]
Precursors [ edit ]

Steampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th - century scientific romances of Jules Verne , H. G. Wells , Mary Shelley , and Edward S. Ellis 's The Steam Man of the Prairies . [ 13 ]
Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name .
Titus Alone ( 1959 ) , by Mervyn Peake , is widely regarded by scholars as the first novel in the genre proper , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ page needed ] [ 16 ] while others point to Michael Moorcock 's 1971 novel The Warlord of the Air , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] which was heavily influenced by Peake 's work .
The film Brazil ( 1985 ) was an early cinematic influence , although it can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk . [ 20 ]
The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was an early ( 1970s ) comic version of the Moorcock - style mover between timestreams . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
In fine art , Remedios Varo 's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress , fantasy , and technofantasy imagery . [ 23 ] [ page needed ]
In television , one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series The Wild Wild West ( 1965 –69 ) , which inspired the later film . [ 13 ] [ 24 ]
Origin of the term [ edit ]
Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s , the term steampunk originated in the late 1980s as a tongue - in - cheek variant of cyberpunk .
It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter , [ 25 ] who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers ( The Anubis Gates , 1983 ) , James Blaylock ( Homunculus , 1986 ) , and himself ( Morlock Night , 1979 , and Infernal Devices , 1987 ) — all of which took place in a 19th - century ( usually Victorian ) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells '
The Time Machine .
In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus , printed in the April 1987 issue , Jeter wrote :
Dear Locus , Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night ; I 'd appreciate your being so good as to route it to Faren Miller , as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in " the Powers / Blaylock / Jeter fantasy triumvirate " was writing in the " gonzo- historical manner " first .
Though of course , I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering .
Personally , I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing , as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers , Blaylock and myself .
Something based on the appropriate technology of the era ; like " steam - punks , " perhaps .... K.W. Jeter [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Modern steampunk [ edit ]
While Jeter 's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices , Powers '
The Anubis Gates , and Blaylock 's Lord Kelvin 's Machine were the first novels to which Jeter 's neologism would be applied , the three authors gave the term little thought at the time .
[ 28 ]:48 They were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam - based technology or alternative histories .
Keith Laumer 's Worlds of the Imperium ( 1962 ) and Ronald W. Clark 's Queen Victoria 's Bomb ( 1967 ) apply modern speculation to past - age technology and society .[ 29 ] [ page needed ]
Michael Moorcock 's Warlord of the Air ( 1971 ) [ 30 ] is another early example .
Harry Harrison 's novel A Transatlantic Tunnel , Hurrah ! ( 1973 ) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973 , full of atomic locomotives , coal - powered flying boats , ornate submarines , and Victorian dialogue .
The Adventures of Luther Arkwright ( mid-1970s ) was one of the first steampunk comics .[ citation needed ]
In February 1980 , Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first " chapter " of their 10 - part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer . [ 31 ]
In 2004 , one anonymous author described steampunk as " Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future . " [ 32 ]
The first use of the word " steampunk " in a title was in Paul Di Filippo 's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy , [ 33 ] consisting of three short novels : " Victoria " , " Hottentots " , and " Walt and Emily " , which , respectively , imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human / newt clone , an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters , and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson .
Japanese steampunk [ edit ]
Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan . [ 9 ]
Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s , dating back to Osamu Tezuka 's epic science - fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World ( 1948 ) , Metropolis ( 1949 ) and Nextworld ( 1951 ) .
The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s , including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto 's Space Battleship Yamato ( 1974 ) and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda 's manga Rose of Versailles ( 1972 ) .
Influenced by 19th - century European authors such as Jules Verne , steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial Europe , linked to a phenomenon called akogare no Pari ( " the Paris of our dreams " ) , comparable to the West 's fascination with an " exotic " East . [ 10 ]
The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki , who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s , starting with the television show Future Boy Conan ( 1978 ) . [ 10 ]
His manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind ( 1982 ) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements .
Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa : Castle in the Sky ( 1986 ) , which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as " one of the first modern steampunk classics . " [ 34 ]
Archetypal steampunk elements in Laputa include airships , air pirates , steam - powered robots , and a view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power . [ 10 ]
The success of Laputa inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production , Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water ( 1990 ) , a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , with Captain Nemo making an appearance . [ 10 ]
Based on a concept by Miyazaki , Nadia was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro Otomo 's anime film Steamboy ( 2004 ) . [ 35 ]
Disney 's animated steampunk film Atlantis : The Lost Empire ( 2001 ) [ 13 ] was influenced by anime , particularly Miyazaki 's works and possibly Nadia . [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli anime films Porco Rosso ( 1992 ) [ 9 ] and Howl 's Moving Castle ( 2004 ) , [ 10 ]
Sega 's video game and anime franchise Sakura Wars ( 1996 ) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji / Taishō era Japan , [ 10 ] and Square Enix 's manga and anime franchise Fullmetal Alchemist ( 2001 ) . [ 9 ]
Relationships to retrofuturism , DIY craft and making [ edit ]

Superficially , steampunk may resemble retrofuturism .
Indeed , both sensibilities recall " the older but still modern eras in which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world , one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline . " [ 2 ]
One of steampunk 's most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms .
As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it , " the tinkering and tinker - able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world . " [ 38 ]
In this respect , steampunk bears more in common with DIY craft and making . [ 39 ]
Art , entertainment , and media [ edit ]
Art and design [ edit ]
Many of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with , among others , Walt Disney 's film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ( 1954 ) , [ 40 ] including the design of the story 's submarine the Nautilus , its interiors , and the crew 's underwater gear ; and George Pal 's film The Time Machine ( 1960 ) , especially the design of the time machine itself .
This theme is also carried over to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks , in the themed area the " Screampunk District " at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris ' Discoveryland area . [ 41 ]
Aspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function . [ 42 ]
In this it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement .
But John Ruskin , William Morris , and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production .
On the other hand , steampunk enthusiasts present a " non-luddite critique of technology " . [ 43 ]
Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo - Victorian mechanical " steampunk " style . [ 22 ] [ 44 ]
Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars . [ 45 ]
The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials ( such as polished brass , iron , wood , and leather ) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era , [ 30 ] [ 46 ] rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design . [ 42 ]
In 1994 , the Paris Metro station at Arts et Métiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style , to honor the works of Jules Verne .
The station is reminiscent of a submarine , sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes that look out onto fanciful scenes . [ 47 ] [ 48 ]
The artist group Kinetic Steam Works [ 49 ] brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007 . [ 50 ]
The group 's founding member , Sean Orlando , created a Steampunk Tree House ( in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group [ 51 ] ) that has been displayed at a number of festivals . [ 52 ] [ 53 ]
The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton , Delaware . [ 54 ]
The Neverwas Haul is a three - story , self - propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels .
Designed by Shannon O’Hare , it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015 . [ 55 ]
When fully built , the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely .
Currently , the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works , an " art car factory " in Vallejo , CA , owned by O’Hare and home to several other self - styled " contraptionists " . [ 56 ]
In May–June 2008 , multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn , New York , in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope . [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
Utilizing this device , New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities , [ 59 ] prior to White Mischief 's Around the World in 80 Days steampunk - themed event . [ 60 ]
Clockwork Universe sculpture at Tim Wetherell 'ssculpture at Questacon , Canberra , Australia ( September 24 , 2009 )
In 2009 , for Questacon , artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe .
This steel artwork contains moving gears , a working clock , and a movie of the moon 's terminator in action .
The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams . [ 61 ]
Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011 , [ 62 ] though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk .
Thus the craft network may not strike observers as " sufficiently steampunk " to warrant its use of the term .
Comedian April Winchell , author of the book Regretsy :
Where DIY meets WTF , cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website " Regretsy " . [ 63 ]
The blog was popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk " notables " . [ 64 ]
From October 2009 through February 2010 , the Museum of the History of Science , Oxford , hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects , curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan , [ 65 ] who also exhibited his own " electro - futuristic " lighting sculptures , and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett , museum director . [ 66 ]
From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions , this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from across the globe .
The exhibition proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum 's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors .
The event was detailed in the official artist 's journal The Art of Steampunk , by curator Donovan . [ 67 ]
In November 2010 , The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru , New Zealand .
Created from papier - mâché to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear , rayguns , and general steampunk quirks , its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long .
A year later , a more permanent gallery , Steampunk HQ , was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore , and has since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru . [ 68 ]
In 2012 , the Mobilis in Mobili : An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance made its debut .
Originally located at New York City 's Wooster Street Social Club ( itself the subject of the television series NY Ink ) , the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum , of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House , [ 69 ] Joey " Dr. Grymm " Marsocci , [ 45 ] and Christopher Conte . [ 70 ] with different approaches . [ 40 ] " [ B]icycles , cell phones , guitars , timepieces and entertainment systems " [ 70 ] rounded out the display . [ 45 ]
The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk . [ 71 ]
Fashion [ edit ]

Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era .
Such influences may include bustles , corsets , gowns , and petticoats ; suits with waistcoats , coats , top hats [ 72 ] and bowler hats ( themselves originating in 1850 England ) , tailcoats and spats ; or military - inspired garments .
Steampunk - influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and " period " accessories : timepieces , parasols , flying / driving goggles , [ 73 ] and ray guns .
Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits , after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian - era objects .
Post - apocalyptic elements , such as gas masks , ragged clothing , and tribal motifs , can also be included .
Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion , the Lolita and aristocrat styles , neo-Victorianism , and the romantic goth subculture . [ 21 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]
In 2005 , Kate Lambert , known as " Kato " , founded the first steampunk clothing company , " Steampunk Couture " , [ 76 ] mixing Victorian and post - apocalyptic influences .
In 2013 , IBM predicted , based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards , blogs , social media sites , and news sources , " that ' steampunk , ' a subgenre inspired by the clothing , technology and social mores of Victorian society , will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry " . [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
Indeed , high fashion lines such as Prada , [ 79 ]
Dolce & Gabbana , Versace , Chanel , [ 80 ] and Christian Dior [ 78 ] had already been introducing steampunk styles on the fashion runways .
And in episode 7 of Lifetime 's " Project Runway : Under the Gunn " reality series , contestants were challenged to create avant - garde " steampunk chic " looks .
[ 81 ]
America 's Next Top Model tackled Steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models competed in a Steampunk themed photo shoot , posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl . [ 82 ] [ unreliable source ]
Literature [ edit ]
The educational book Elementary BASIC - Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes ( 1981 ) , by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar , may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine in an adventure story .
The instructional book , aimed at young programming students , depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations , and lists programs that perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases .
The book even describes a device that allows the engine to be used remotely , over telegraph lines , as a possible enhancement to Babbage 's machine .
Companion volumes — Elementary Pascal - Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to Binary - An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes — were also written .
In 1988 , the first version of the science fiction tabletop role - playing game Space : 1889 was published .
The game is set in an alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies .
Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick , Loren Wiseman , and Marcus Rowland . [ 83 ]
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling 's novel The Difference Engine ( 1990 ) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness of steampunk . [ 24 ] [ 84 ]
This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling 's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage 's proposed steam - powered mechanical computer , which Babbage called a difference engine ( a later , more general - purpose version was known as an analytical engine ) , was actually built , and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century " ahead of schedule " .
This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future , rather than the more prevalent utopian versions .
Nick Gevers 's original anthology Extraordinary Engines ( 2008 ) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre 's writers , as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions .
A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released , also in 2008 , by Tachyon Publications .
Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk , it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock , whose " Narbondo " trilogy is typically considered steampunk ; Jay Lake , author of the novel Mainspring , sometimes labeled " clockpunk " ; [ 85 ] the aforementioned Michael Moorcock ; as well as Jess Nevins , known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( first published in 1999 ) .
Younger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes , by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld . [ 86 ]
Reeve 's quartet Mortal Engines is set far in Earth 's future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources , a concept Reeve coined as Municipal Darwinism .
Westerfeld 's Leviathan trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought between the " clankers " ( Central Powers ) , who use steam technology , and " darwinists " ( Allied Powers ) , who use genetically engineered creatures instead of machines . [ 87 ]
" Mash - ups " are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers , mixing steampunk with other genres .
Suzanne Lazear 's Aether Chronicles series mixes steampunk with faeries , and The Unnaturalists , by Tiffany Trent , combines steampunk with mythological creatures and alternate history . [ 88 ]
While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting , [ citation needed ] later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historic era .
Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternate history ; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology .
" Fantasy - world steampunk " , such as China Miéville 's Perdido Street Station , Alan Campbell 's Scar Night , and Stephen Hunt 's Jackelian novels , on the other hand , presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm , often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam - era and other anachronistic technologies .
However , the works of China Miéville and similar authors are sometimes referred to as belonging to the " New Weird " rather than steampunk .[ citation needed ]
Self - described author of " far - fetched fiction " Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary .
In 2009 , he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society . [ 89 ]
The comic book series Hellboy , created by Mike Mignola , and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro , all have steampunk elements . [ 90 ]
In the comic book and the first ( 2004 ) film , Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered , and who has many mechanical prostheses , including a clockwork heart .
The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film , Hellboy II : The Golden Army ( 2008 ) , as an ectoplasmic medium ( a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit ) .
This second film also features the Golden Army itself , which is a collection of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors .
Steampunk settings [ edit ]
Alternative world [ edit ]
Steampunk - style composite apparatus
Since the 1990s , the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods , to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam - or spring - powered technology . [ 24 ]
One of the earliest short stories relying on steam - powered flying machines is " The Aerial Burglar " of 1844 . [ 91 ]
An example from juvenile fiction is The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell .
Fantasy steampunk settings abound in tabletop and computer role - playing games .
Notable examples include Skies of Arcadia , [ 92 ] Rise of Nations : Rise of Legends , [ 93 ] and Arcanum : Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura . [ 13 ]
One of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle - earth - like world was the Forest of Boland Light Railway by BB , about gnomes who build a steam locomotive .
50 years later , Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel Raising Steam , about the ongoing industrial revolution and railway mania in Ankh - Morpork .
The gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk , [ 94 ] as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men , but still run on steam and mechanical power .
The Dwarves of the Elder Scrolls series , described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer , also use steam - powered machinery , with gigantic brass - like gears , throughout their underground cities .
However , magical means are used to keep ancient devices in motion despite the Dwemer 's ancient disappearance . [ 95 ]
The 1998 game Thief : The Dark Project , as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot , feature heavy steampunk - inspired architecture , setting , and technology .
Amidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk - style technology and aesthetics .
Examples include Jean - Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's The City of Lost Children ( 1995 ) , Turn A Gundam ( 1999 –2000 ) , Trigun , [ 96 ] and Disney 's film Treasure Planet ( 2002 ) .
In 2011 , musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20 - year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City , to promote his album A Map of the Floating City . [ 13 ]
American West [ edit ]
Another setting is " Western " steampunk , which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres .
One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis .
Recent examples include the movie Wild Wild West , the Italian comics about Magico Vento , [ 97 ] Devon Monk 's Dead Iron , [ 98 ] and the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland - style Disney Parks around the world .[ citation needed ]
Fantasy and horror [ edit ]
Kaja Foglio introduced the term " Gaslight Romance " , [ 28]:78 gaslamp fantasy , which John Clute and John Grant define as " steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised , smoky , 19th - century London , as are Gaslight Romances .
But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century — on Dracula , Jekyll and Hyde , Jack the Ripper , Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan — and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy , though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history . " [ 99 ]
Author / artist James Richardson - Brown [ 100 ] coined the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a " darker " bent .
Mary Shelley 's
The Last Man , set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization , was probably the ancestor of post - apocalyptic steampunk literature .
Post - apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant , such as in Hayao Miyazaki 's post - apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan ( 1978 ) , [ 96 ] where a war fought with superweapons has devastated the planet .
Robert Brown 's novel , The Wrath of Fate ( as well as much of Abney Park 's music ) is set in A Victorianesque world where an apocalypse was set into motion by a time - traveling mishap .
Cherie Priest 's Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie apocalypse happened during the Civil War era .
The Peshawar Lancers by S.M. Stirling is set in a post - apocalyptic future in which a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of Industrialized civilization .
The movie 9 ( which might be better classified as " stitchpunk " but was largely influenced by steampunk ) [ 101 ] is also set in a post - apocalyptic world after a self - aware war machine ran amok .
Steampunk Magazine even published a book called A Steampunk 's Guide to the Apocalypse , about how steampunks could survive should such a thing actually happen .
Victorian [ edit ]

In general , this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period ( sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period ) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun , but electricity is not yet widespread , " usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West - era United States " , [ 102 ] with an emphasis on steam - or spring - propelled gadgets .
The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras , though some in this " Victorian steampunk " category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and as late as the end of World War I .
Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine , [ 103 ] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , the Disney animated film Atlantis : The Lost Empire , [ 13 ] Scott Westerfeld 's Leviathan trilogy , [ 104 ] and the roleplaying game Space : 1889 . [ 13 ]
The anime film Steamboy ( 2004 ) is another good example of Victorian steampunk , taking place in an alternate 1866 where steam technology is far more advanced than it ever was in real life .
[ 105 ]
Some , such as the comic series Girl Genius , [ 13 ] have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings .
Other comic series are set in a more familiar London , as in the Victorian Undead , which has Sherlock Holmes , Doctor Watson , and others taking on zombies , Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde , and Count Dracula , with advanced weapons and devices .
Karel Zeman 's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne ( 1958 ) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk .
Based on Jules Verne novels , Zeman 's film imagines a past that never was , based on those novels .
[ 106 ]
Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki 's anime films such as Laputa : Castle in the Sky ( 1986 ) and Howl 's Moving Castle ( 2004 ) , which contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre . [ 107 ] [ 108 ]
" Historical " steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy , but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well .
For example , Morlock Night , written by K. W. Jeter , revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future . [ 24 ]
Paul Guinan 's Boilerplate , a " biography " of a robot in the late 19th century , began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real .
[ 109 ]
The site was adapted into the illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate : History 's Mechanical Marvel , which was published by Abrams in October 2009 . [ 110 ]
Because the story was not set in an alternative history , and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era , [ 111 ] some [ specify ] booksellers referred to the tome as " historical steampunk " .
Asian ( silkpunk ) [ edit ]
Fictional settings inspired by Asian rather than Western history have been called " silkpunk " .
The term appears to originate with the author Ken Liu , who defined it as " a blend of science fiction and fantasy [ that ] draws inspiration from classical East Asian antiquity " , with a " technology vocabulary (... ) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia ( bamboo , paper , silk ) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific ( coconut , feathers , coral ) " , rather than the brass and leather associated with steampunk . [ 112 ]
Other authors whose work has been described as silkpunk are JY Yang [ 113 ] and Elizabeth Bear .
Music [ edit ]
Robert Brown and Finn Von Claret from Abney Park
Steampunk music is very broadly defined .
Abney Park 's lead singer Robert Brown defined it as " mixing Victorian elements and modern elements " .
There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the Steampunk sound , from industrial dance and world music [ 75 ] to folk rock , dark cabaret to straightforward punk , [ 114 ] Carnatic [ 115 ] to industrial , hip - hop to opera ( and even industrial hip - hop opera ) , [ 116 ] [ 117 ] darkwave to progressive rock , barbershop to big band .
Joshua Pfeiffer ( of Vernian Process ) is quoted as saying , " As for Paul Roland , if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk music , it is him .
He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project .
He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight , and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else ... " [ 118 ]
Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist ( i.e. , Steampunk and Dieselpunk ) music . [ 119 ] [ 120 ]
Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying , " Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk ! " [ 121 ]
Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as Steampunk .
For example , the music video of " Turn Me On " , by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj , takes place in a Steampunk universe where Guetta creates human droids .
Another music video is " The Ballad of Mona Lisa " , by Panic ! at the Disco , which has a distinct Victorian Steampunk theme .
A continuation of this theme has in fact been used throughout the 2011 album Vices & Virtues , in the music videos , album art , and tour set and costumes .
In addition , the album Clockwork Angels ( 2012 ) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics , themes , and imagery based around Steampunk .
Similarly , Abney Park headlined the first " Steamstock " outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond , California , which also featured Thomas Dolby , Frenchy and the Punk , Lee Presson and the Nails , Vernian Process , and others . [ 120 ]
The music video for the Lindsey Stirling song " Roundtable Rival " , has a Western Steampunk setting .

The plot of the Soviet film Kin-dza - dza ! ( 1986 ) centers on a desert planet , depleted of its resources , where an impoverished dog - eat - dog society uses steam - punk machines , the movements and functions of which defy earthly logic .
In making his 1986 Japanese film Castle in the Sky , Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture , the film featuring various air ships and steam - powered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky , accomplished not through magic as in most stories , but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal — analogous to the lodestone used in the Laputa of Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels — augmented by massive propellers , as befitting the Victorian motif . [ 125 ]

Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Laputa : Castle in the Sky ( 1986 ) , Steel Empire is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam - powered technology .
The commercial success of Steel Empire , both in Japan and the West , helped propel steampunk into the video game market , and had a significant influence on later steampunk games .
The most notable steampunk game it influenced is Final Fantasy VI ( 1994 ) , a Japanese role - playing game developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System .
Final Fantasy VI was both critically and commercially successful , and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games . [ 35 ]

Culture and community [ edit ]
Steampunk Magazine Cover of
Because of the popularity of steampunk , there is a growing movement of adults that want to establish steampunk as a culture and lifestyle . [ 132 ]
Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion , [ 133 ] home decor , music , and film .
While Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies , [ 21 ] it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism , described by scholar Marie - Luise Kohlke as " the afterlife of the nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary " .
[ 134 ]
The subculture has its own magazine , blogs , and online shops . [ 135 ]
In September 2012 , a panel , chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM , was held at Stan Lee 's Comikaze Expo .
The panel suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth , neo -Victorian , and cyberpunk , as well as a growing number of fandoms , it was fast becoming a super - culture rather than a mere subculture . [ 136 ]
Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk 's inclusive diversity . [ 137 ]
Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk - inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by optimism about human potential .
[ 138 ]
A 2004 Steampunk Manifesto , later republished in SteamPunk Magazine , lamented that most " so - called " steampunk was nothing more than dressed - up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that " authentic " steampunk would " take the levers of technology from the [ technocrats ] and powerful . " [ 139 ]
American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg Rocek impersonated anarcha - feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender , society and politics .
[ 5 ]
SteamPunk Magazine was edited and published by anarchists .
Its founder , Margaret Killjoy , argued " there have always been radical politics at the core of steampunk . " [ 140 ] Diana M. Pho , a science - fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog Beyond Victoriana , similarly argued steampunk 's " progressive roots " can be traced to its literary inspirations , including Verne 's Captain Nemo . [ 141 ] Steampunk authors Phenderson Djèlí Clark , [ 142 ] Jaymee Goh , [ 143 ] Dru Pagliassotti , [ 144 ] and Charlie Stross [ 145 ] consider their work political .
These views are not universally shared . [ 74 ]
Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk " has nothing to offer but designer clothes . " [ 140 ]
Pho argued many steampunk fans " do n't like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered ideological . " [ 141 ]
The largest online steampunk community , Brass Goggles , which is dedicated to what it calls the " lighter side " of steampunk , banned discussion about politics .
Cory Gross , who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of steampunk , argued that the " sepia - toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable philosophy or culture " denounced in the Steampunk Manifesto [ 139 ] was in fact representative of the genre . [ 146 ] Author Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk " nearly meaningless . " [ 147 ]
Kate Franklin and James Schafer , who at the time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook , admitted in 2011 that steampunk had n't created the " revolutionary , or even a particularly progressive " community they wanted .
[ 148 ]
Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017 that steampunk was no longer punk , since it had " lost the anti-authoritarian , anti-establishment aspects . " [ 149 ]
Others argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement , [ 150 ] preferring to see steampunk as " escapism " [ 151 ] or a " fandom " .
[ 152 ]
In 2018 , Nick Ottens , editor of the online alternate - history magazine Never Was , declared that the " lighter side " of steampunk had won out . [ 153 ]
To the extent that steampunk is politicized , it appears to be an American and British phenomenon .
Continental Europeans [ 154 ] and Latin Americans [ 155 ] are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause .
Social events [ edit ]
June 19 , 2005 marked the grand opening of the world 's first steampunk club night , " Malediction Society " , in Los Angeles . [ 156 ] [ 157 ]
The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub , interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood , until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017 . [ 157 ]
Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic , Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with " The Steampunk Ball " . [ 158 ]
2006 saw the first " SalonCon " , a neo-Victorian / steampunk convention .
It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists , musicians ( Voltaire and Abney Park ) , authors ( Catherynne M. Valente , Ekaterina Sedia , and G. D. Falksen ) , salons led by people prominent in their respective fields , workshops and panels on steampunk — as well as a seance , ballroom dance instruction , and the Chrononauts ' Parade .
The event was covered by MTV [ 159 ] and The New York Times . [ 21 ]
Since then , a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over , with names like Steamcon ( Seattle ) , the Steampunk World 's Fair ( Piscataway , New Jersey ) , Up in the Aether : The Steampunk Convention ( Dearborn , Michigan ) , [ 160 ] Steampunk NZ ( Oamaru , New Zealand ) , Steampunk Unlimited ( Strasburg Railroad , Lancaster , PA ) . [ 161 ]
Each year , on Mother 's Day weekend , the city of Waltham , MA , turns over its city center and surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival , a US outdoor steampunk festival .
During the first weekend of May , the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 attendance . [ 162 ]
In recent years , steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic - Con International , with the Saturday of the four - day event being generally known among steampunks as " Steampunk Day " , and culminating with a photo - shoot for the local press . [ 163 ] [ 164 ]
In 2010 , this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's largest steampunk photo shoot .
[ 165 ]
In 2013 , Comic - Con announced four official 2013 T - shirts , one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic - Con toucan mascot in steampunk attire . [ 166 ]
The Saturday steampunk " after - party " has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar : in 2010 , the headliners included The Slow Poisoner , Unextraordinary Gentlemen , and Voltaire , with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM ; [ 167 ] [ 168 ] in 2011 , UXG returned with Abney Park . [ 169 ]
Steampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires , in the US .
Some festivals have organised events or a " Steampunk Day " , while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire .
The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha , Wisconsin , on the Wisconsin / Illinois border , featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season , the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon . [ 170 ]
Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe .
The largest European event is " Weekend at the Asylum " , held at The Lawn , Lincoln , every September since 2009 .
Organised as a not - for - profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society , the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln , England , along with Lincoln Castle .
In 2011 , there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance .
The event features the Empire Ball , Majors Review , Bazaar Eclectica , and the international Tea Duelling final . [ 171 ] [ 172 ]
The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden , but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London , within walking distance of H. G. Wells 's home . [ 173 ]
The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012 , and now takes place thrice a year , and has spanned three boroughs and five venues . [ 174 ]
Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus [ 175 ] and filmed by the BBC World Service . [ 176 ]
The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013 , [ 177 ] on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder 's " Manorlands " hospice in Oxenhope .
The Steampunk Physics Surge of 2020 [ edit ]
Information Theory +
Thermodynamics = Quantum Steampunk
Since 2015 , in the vein of Jules Verne 's prescient writings , life has once again begun to imitate art , as steampunk has entered the realm of legitimate science .
In early 2020 , an article in Scientific American titled " Quantum Steampunk : 19th - Century Science Meets Technology of Today " [ 178 ] discussed a major movement in cross - disciplinary study , in which information theory is being used to update the basis of steam technology : Thermodynamics .
A flurry of publications and citations surrounding Nicole Yunger Halpern [ 179 ] supports the emerging subfield she has dubbed " Quantum Steampunk " in her 2018 dissertation .
In the realm of science closer to the fringe , at least one published paper claims , [ 180 ] via revisionist history , that modern physics is indistinguishable from a straightforward advancement of aether theory .
This same author 's lectures at steampunk conventions , while appearing half theater and half legitimate science discussion , have heralded a " neoclassical revolution " of physics and a return of the aether .
The oft - repeated quotation of Einstein that " space without ether is unthinkable " [ 181 ] intimates that there may indeed exist some scientifically legitimate and conceptually advanced versions of the aether concept which fit into a modern physics context .
Fully within the realm of conventional science , however , the interpretation of concepts such as space - time curvature and random effects in Quantum Mechanics ( QM ) have been interpreted through the lens of fluid dynamics by various scientists starting as far back as when Erwin Madelung proposed the Madelung equations as an alternative form of the Schrödinger equation and aspects of fluid rotation / turbulence are found more recently in Superfluid vacuum theory , although concepts of a superfluid electromagnetic medium compatible with relativity have been traced as far back as 1909 , to the seminal work of micropolar elasticity [ 182 ]
Eugène Cosserat produced , by the english translator of that work : David Delphenich .
However , in April 2020 Dr. Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar of Cambridge released a Gauge theory formulation of Lord Kelvin 's Vortex theory of the atom [ 183 ]
Research at MIT by John Bush [ 184 ] in Hydrodynamic quantum analogs casts the random effects and other " spooky behaviors " of QM as an expression of Chaos Theory in a fluid medium , thus returning a very " Clockwork Universe " aesthetic to modern physics via the inference of deterministic chaos underlying a complex fluid - like substrate responsible for particle emergence .
This surge in legitimate science surrounding steampunk may be a repetition of the historical trend of sci- fi predictions inspiring the course of future science . [ 185 ] [ 186 ]
The wisdom of using brass , bronze and copper as construction materials , known from ancient times , resurfaced during the 2020 COVID - 19 pandemic due to the antiviral properties of copper , which are electromagnetic in origin . [ 187 ]
This can be loosely categorized under the " steam era " physics of galvanism . [ 188 ]
Research in 2015 found that an earlier version of the virus , which lasted 4 - 5 days on common surfaces , was extremely vulnerable to copper - based metallics , with inactivation times for brasses being ≤ 40 minutes and with some copper surfaces as little as 5 minutes . [ 189 ]
A more recent study of modern coronavirus , which found it living on common surfaces after 72 hours , also found that copper reduced its viral active time down to 4 hours maximum .
[ 190 ]
Now with the 2020 technology advancement for laser treatment of copper surfaces resulting in instant killing of bacteria , [ 191 ] and large scale copper surface deployments in hospitals , [ 192 ] it appears our world is rapidly becoming more " Steampunked . "

The remarkable ability of an electron to exist in two places at once has been controlled in the most common electronic material -- silicon -- for the first time .
The research findings -- published in Nature by a UK - Dutch team from the University of Surrey , UCL ( University College ) London , Heriot - Watt University in Edinburgh , and the FOM Institute for Plasma Physics near Utrecht -- marks a significant step towards the making of an affordable " quantum computer . "
According to the research paper , the scientists have created a simple version of Schrodinger 's cat -- which is paradoxically simultaneously both dead and alive -- in the cheap and simple material out of which ordinary computer chips are made .
" This is a real breakthrough for modern electronics and has huge potential for the future , " explained Professor Ben Murdin , Photonics Group Leader at the University of Surrey .
" Lasers have had an ever increasing impact on technology , especially for the transmission of processed information between computers , and this development illustrates their potential power for processing information inside the computer itself .
In our case we used a far - infrared , very short , high intensity pulse from the Dutch FELIX laser to put an electron orbiting within silicon into two states at once -- a so - called quantum superposition state .
We then demonstrated that the superposition state could be controlled so that the electrons emit a burst of light at a well - defined time after the superposition was created .
The burst of light is called a photon echo ; and its observation proved we have full control over the quantum state of the atoms . "
And the development of a silicon based " quantum computer " may be only just over the horizon .
" Quantum computers can solve some problems much more efficiently than conventional computers -- and they will be particularly useful for security because they can quickly crack existing codes and create un-crackable codes , " Professor Murdin continued .
" The next generation of devices must make use of these superpositions to do quantum computations .
Crucially our work shows that some of the quantum engineering already demonstrated by atomic physicists in very sophisticated instruments called cold atom traps , can be implemented in the type of silicon chip used in making the much more common transistor . "
Professor Gabriel Aeppli , Director of the London Centre for Nanotechnology added that the findings were highly significant to academia and business alike .
" Next to iron and ice , silicon is the most important inorganic crystalline solid because of our tremendous ability to control electrical conduction via chemical and electrical means , " he explained .
" Our work adds control of quantum superpositions to the silicon toolbox . "
Recently I ’ve been following the Vala programming language and using it some in embedded systems .
Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming features to GNOME developers without imposing additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C .
A few notes and observations about Vala :
language syntax that resembles
C# , so you can write code faster with less mistakes
Vala compiles to C , so it starts fast and runs fast like native applications
binaries are not platform independent ( like Mono or Java )
lots of bindings already exist , as it is very easy to write bindings to existing C libraries
easy to write programs that are mixed C and Vala
documentation is still a bit sparse , so you end up reading the binding files to figure out how to use the libraries
Much of the core Vala functionality is built on top of Glib .
Having programmed extensively with Glib , I can say programming in Vala is a lot more fun , and a lot less tedious .
Vala also provides dynamic D - Bus bindings which makes if very nice for writing system daemons or other bits of software that need to implement a D - Bus server .
As far as real world experience , in a recent application , we ported a system monitoring application from C# to Vala .
There were no real serious problems with the original application , but it started slow ( 7 seconds or so ) , and the customer wanted to reduce the boot time of the system .
Once you get past the core language syntax , the libraries for Vala are all different than C# , so most of the library function calls needed tweaked a little .
Most of the functionality was implemented with Vala , but there were a few minor functions that were implemented in C .
It now starts fast , which is what we needed .
We are also using the fsod application from the OpenMoko project in a customer project .
This is an excellent example of a well written , advanced Vala project that uses features such as plugins and D - Bus .
Watching the releases from the Vala project , it is amazing the progress this language is making .
I ’m sure we ’ll be hearing more about Vala in the future .

The beauty of writing systems is that each has something unique from which to draw inspiration .
Two weeks ago , in the first part of this article , we covered Arabic and East - Asian languages ( Chinese , Japanese , Korean and Vietnamese ) and a few Indic scripts ( Devanagari , Thai and Tibetan ) .
We are now back for the second ( and last ) part , which is a bit different but just as interesting .
You will see that some features of the languages presented here clearly correspond to our Latin - based system , while others are unfamiliar .
The point of this second part is to complete our look at writing systems of the world and to think more generally about what they signify .
We ’ll cover the following :
Writing Systems Of The World
Before we get started , let ’s take a moment to understand where everything fits in :
Click on the image to see it full - size .
Figuring out how many languages are spoken in the world is hard , but estimates are at around 7000 languages and dialects , with hundreds of script for writing them down .
Fortunately , the major writing systems fall into four broad categories :
Alphabetic .
As you probably know , an alphabet is a segmental writing system in which a standardized set of letters ( graphemes ) roughly represents phonemes .
The word “ alphabet ” is derived from Alpha and Beta , the first two symbols of the Greek alphabet .
Two types of alphabets are important in classifying writing systems : Adbjad , which contains symbols for consonants only , or vowels optionally written with diacritics ( e.g. Arabic and Hebrew ) .
Adbugida , whose basic signs denote consonants with inherent vowels .
“ Following ” vowels other than inherent ones are denoted by diacritical marks or another systematic modification of the consonants ( e.g. Devanāgarī ) .

In a logographic system , each character ( logogram ) represents a single complete grammatical word and is more precise than a morpheme ( e.g. Chinese ) .

Syllabaries .
As the name suggests , in a syllabic system , characters represent or approximate syllables ( or more precisely “ moras ” ) , which make up words .
A symbol typically represents a consonant sound followed by a vowel sound , or a vowel alone ( e.g. Japanese ) .

Featural .
A featural writing system represents finer details than an alphabet .
Each symbol represents not a whole phoneme but rather the phonetic features that make up the phoneme , such as voicing or place of articulation ( e.g. Korean ) .
Unluckily for us , most writing systems cannot be classified as purely one type .
Indeed , many languages include several of these features .
In English , for example , the clusters of phonemic letters are a complex match to their sounds .

I could go on , but then this would not be the article you signed up for .
So , we ’ll go back to our subject and start exploring the typographic beauty of languages .
If you ’re interested in this classification of fascinating writing systems , then this Wikipedia article is a great start .
Hebrew
The Hebrew alphabet is a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet , which is itself a descendant of the Phoenician alphabet .
Like Arabic , the Hebrew alphabet is an abjad in its traditional form ( i.e. an alphabet consisting only of consonants ) , written from right to left .
It has 22 letters , 5 of which have different forms at the end of a word ( called “ sofit ” ) .
The Hebrew alphabet has only one case , so capitalization is not used , and it is often called the “ alefbet ” because of its first two letters .
Diacritics
Again like Arabic , modern Hebrew orthography includes several types of diacritics as aids to pronunciation .
These are written above , below or inside the letter , in ways that do not alter the spacing of the line .
Text containing these markings is referred to as “ pointed ” text and contains three types of marks :
The niqqud ( points ) are used most .
They represent vowels or are used to distinguish between alternative pronunciations of several letters of the alphabet .
( points ) are used most .
They represent vowels or are used to distinguish between alternative pronunciations of several letters of the alphabet .
The geresh ( indicating initialisms ) and the gershayim ( indicating acronyms ) are diacritics that affect pronunciation .
They are also used to denote Hebrew numerals but are not considered part of the niqqud .

They are also used to denote Hebrew numerals but are not considered part of the niqqud .
The cantillation are accents that show how Biblical passages should be chanted and that sometimes function as punctuation .
Letters are in black , points in red and cantillation in blue .
Fonts
The Hebrew letter ה ( hei ) in four fonts ( from right to left ) : modern Hebrew block , modern Hebrew handwriting , Torah scroll writing , “ Rashi ” script .
Hebrew can be written in three main scripts :
Cursive Hebrew .
Used almost exclusively when handwriting in modern Hebrew , because it is faster to write than traditional Hebrew .

A semi-cursive script used in books for editorial insertions or biblical commentary .
( Named after Rashi , one of the great medieval Jewish scholars and biblical commentators . )

Block .
Used mostly in books .
A stylized form of the Aramaic script .
Gematria
In Hebrew , each letter is also used to denote numbers .
One interesting thing about Hebrew is “ Gematria , ” the system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase , in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other .
The best - known example is the Hebrew word “ Chai ” ( meaning “ life ” ) , which is composed of two letters that add up to 18 .
For this reason , 18 is a spiritual number in Judaism , and many Jews give gifts of money in multiples of 18 .
The word “ Chai ” is composed of the two letters : Chet ( ח ) and Yod ( י ) .
There are 22 solid figures composed of regular polygons ( 5 Platonic solids , 4 Kepler - Poinsot solids and 13 Archimedean solids ) .
Because the Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters , we can infer a correspondence between these two seemingly unrelated categories .
The art of gematria is knowing which solid to associate with which letter .
This system is used to gain insight into related concepts and to find correspondence between words and concepts .
According to most practitioners , there are several methods of calculating the numerical value of individual words and phrases .
When converted to a number , a word or phrase can then be compared to another word or phrase , from which a similarity can be identified .
Calligraphy
Over 150 laws govern how the Hebrew alphabet can be written by a Jewish scribe .
Needless to say , we wo n’t list them all here , but a few are below , including the standard for writing the letter “ tsadi , ” which consists of the letters Yud and Nun .
For more information , this website is quite extensive .
European Alphabets
In this part , we ’ll cover the five modern European alphabetic scripts : Latin , Greek , Cyrillic , Armenian and Georgian .
Latin
The basic modern Latin alphabet ( containing 26 letters , possibly also used in combination with diacritics ) is the best known of the Latin alphabets .
The writing system is not only the most used in Europe but is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world today .
Consequently , we have many Latin - derived alphabets .
Some languages have fewer than 26 letters , such as the Italian alphabet , which has only 21 letters ( thanks to the person who pointed this out in a comment ) .
Most Latin - derived alphabets use the basic 26 letters , plus extensions .
Diacritics are the most common way to extend the alphabet , but not the only way , as we will now see .
1. Adding diacritics
One way to extend the basic alphabet is by adding diacritics to existing letters , a practice followed by most Latin - based languages ( English pretty much being the exception ) .
The illustration below is from the very interesting article “ On Diacritics ” from I Love Typography , showing various diacritics in use .
2. Joining multiple letters to make ligatures Another way to extend the alphabet is by joining multiple letters to make ligatures .
Fusing two or more ordinary letters creates a new glyph or character .
Typical ligatures in the Latin script .
3. Clustering letters Diagraphs and trigraphs are pairs and triplets of letters to which a special function has been assigned .
They are not proper characters and do not correspond to the value you would get by combining two or three characters normally .
Rather , they are pairs or triplets of letters with a special function .
In Welsh , the digraph “ Ll ” is fused as “ ll ” to form a ligature .
Digraphs and trigraphs are found in alphabets other than the Latin one , and we can discern various patterns in their form :
4. Collating
The question arises : how to sort all these modified letters ?
This is where collating comes in handy .
Collation is the assemblage of written information into a standard order .
One common type of collation is alphabetization , although collation is not limited to ordering letters of the alphabet .
These additional letters can be regarded as distinct new letters and are assigned specific positions in the alphabet ( such as the symbols Å , Ä and Ö in Swedish ) :
A · B · C · D · E · F · G · H · I · J · K · L · M · N · O · P · Q · R · S · T · U · V · W · X · Y · Z · Å · Ä · Ö
In other cases , especially with letter - diacritic combinations , extensions are identified by their base letter ( as with Ä , Ö , Ü and ß in German ) .
A · B · C · D · E · F · G · H · I · J · K · L · M · N · O · P · Q · R · S · T · U · V · W · X · Y · Z ( + Ä · Ö · Ü · ß)
To complicate things further , there are languages in which certain extensions are regarded as new letters and others are not .
For example , in Spanish , the character Ñ is considered a distinct letter and is sorted between N and O in the dictionary ; but the accented vowels Á , É , Í , Ó , Ú are not distinct from the unaccented vowels A , E , I , O , U , respectively .
A · B · C · D · E · F · G · H · I · J · K · L · M · N · Ñ · O · P · Q · R · S · T · U · V · W · X · Y · Z ( + Á · É · Í · Ó · Ú · Ü )
Cyrillic Alphabet
The Cyrillic alphabet was developed by the Slavs in Bulgaria in the 9th century .
It is based on the system of Greek capital letters , augmented by ligatures and consonants from the older Glagolitic alphabet to account for sounds not found in the Greek .
The Greek alphabet .
The Russian Cyrillic alphabet .
The early Cyrillic alphabet came to dominate over Glagolitic in the 12th century .
Since its creation , it has adapted to changes in the spoken language and developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages .
Variations of the Cyrillic alphabet are used nowadays for languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia .
It is interesting how different some of these letters can be depending on whether they ’re written in regular or italic cursive :
Likewise , uppercase , small caps and lowercase can be quite different :
Armenian
The Armenian alphabet has been used for the Armenian language since the 5th century .
Until the 19th century , the Armenian language had only one written form : Old Armenian .
Since then , phonological changes have split it into two dialects : Eastern and Western Armenian .
A typeface created by Khajag that improves on the legibility of current typefaces used in school textbooks .
Schools nowadays teach only the Eastern dialect as the written form because it is closer to the historical Old Armenian form , even though the Western dialect is more widely spoken .
The following chart shows the alphabet , with its Eastern ( EA ) and Western ( WA ) phonetic values :
Punctuation in Armenian is quite interesting , because it is completely different than what we are used to :
The Erkatagir script is monumental in style .
The majuscule letters are large , erect , with gracefully rounded lines that connect ( or spring from ) the vertical elements of the letters .
All letters are written on a base line between two imaginary parallel lines , with ascending and descending elements only slightly extending beyond .
Round Erkatagir is characterized by a contrast of thick vertical forms and razor - thin connecting curved strokes .

The Bolorgir , or minuscule , ancestor of modern Armenian type fonts , dominated scribal hands from the 13th to 16th centuries and continued well through the 19th .
It has developed more elegant and graphic forms , and although by definition a round script , the characters are slanted and the letters have sharp corners .
The contrast between base shapes and connecting strokes is not as extreme as in Erkatagir ; it is a more cursive script ( characters are closer to one another ) , smaller in size and different in shape .
[ text and image from 15 levels ]
The Notrgir , or notary script , is a blend of Bolorgir and Sła ’gir , dominated by small cursive forms .
Back in the 17th and 18th centuries , the secretary — working as a scribe in the royal court or Catholicosate — employed as a matter of necessity time - saving cursive versions of Bolorgir and even smaller Notrgir letters .
The structure may have entered Armenian writing traditions in the late Byzantine Greek or Latin periods .

Georgian
Georgian ( ქართული დამწერლობა ) is the writing system of the Georgian language ( of course ) , but also of other languages in the Caucasus , mostly South Caucasian languages .
Georgian has always used three distinct alphabets : Asomtavruli , Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli .
They have progressed through three forms , all dissimilar , even though they share the same letter names and “ collation ” ( now you know that ’s just a fancy way of saying alphabet order ) .
The word meaning “ alphabet ” ( ანბანი [ anbani ] ) is derived from the names of the first two letters of each of the three Georgian alphabets , the modern one containing 33 letters .
Georgian is interesting because of its double influence .
Like its neighboring language , Armenian , it displays Greek influences in its letter - ordering , while Iranian influences are visible in the cursive shapes of the letters ( especially the ancient forms ) , and the abundance of sibilants are reminiscent of Pahlavi , an ancient Iranian script .
Mongolian
The Mongolian script has a long history .
It was developed as an adaptation of the script of the Uyghurs , who were captured by the Mongols during a war against the Naimans around the 12th century CE .
But it did n’t fit the Mongolian language : the spelling was ambiguous because Uyghur letters represented multiple sounds .
In addition , the spelling fossilized while the sounds naturally evolved , thus separating the written and spoken language .
Language reform during the 16th century CE alleviated the problem , and the resulting script is known as Mongolian :
Mongolian is special for its vertical writing .
The Uyghur script and its descendants — Mongolian , Oirat Clear , Manchu and Buryat — are the only vertical scripts written from left to right .
This happened because the Uyghurs rotated their script ( which was derived from Sogdian , a right - to - left script ) 90° counter - clockwise to emulate Chinese writing , but without changing the relative orientation of the letters .
For more inspiration from the Mongolian script , do n’t miss these antiques of Mongolian calligraphy .
Inuktitut
Inuktitut ( ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ , literally meaning “ like the Inuit ” ) is the language of the Inuit people , specifically the Inuit of the Canadian Eastern Arctic .
It also refers to the Inuit language as a whole , which itself is more of a dialect continuum than a single language .
Roughly four dialects and variants groups are on this continuum , depending on the region where they are spoken .
The Canadian census reports that approximately 35,000 Inuktitut speakers are in Canada , including about 200 who reside outside of traditionally Inuit lands .
With only 0.01 people per square kilometer of land , Nunavut is one of the least populated regions in the world .
And yet it has four official languages : English , French , Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun .
For this reason , the government of Nunavut adopted a clean sans - serif font called Pigiarniq ( designed by Tiro Typeworks ) that enables its people to use all four languages in a uniform manner .
The result is a professional - looking free font family :
Preview of the Pigiarniq font : regular , light , italic , bold , heavy .
International Phonetic Alphabet
Let ’s finish this series with the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) .
This system of phonetic notation is based on the Latin alphabet and is designed to represent only distinctive qualities of spoken language : phonemes , intonation and the separation of words and syllables .
Phonetic transcriptions of the word “ international ” in two English dialects .
The general principle followed by the International Phonetic Association is to provide one symbol for each distinctive sound , meaning :
Individual sounds are not represented by letter combinations , and multiple sounds are not represented by individual letters ( the way “ x ” represents [ ks ] or [ ɡz ] in English ) ;
Letters do not have context - dependent sound values ( as “ c ” does in English and other European languages ) ;
Two sounds are usually not given separate letters if no known language distinguishes between them ( a property known as “ selectiveness ” ) .
Interestingly , all pronunciations in the languages we have looked at can be summarized in the following IPA chart .
That ’s right : one page !
Occasionally , the International Phonetic Association adds , removes or modifies symbols ; but as of 2008 , the IPA proper has 107 distinct letters , 52 diacritics and 4 prosody marks .
Obviously we wo n’t look at the chart in detail .
Below , though , is the IPA chart for vowels , mapped according to the position of the tongue .
The IPA is a special type of notation , and yet we can still make out familiar words and names :

Notes on ordering from outside Germany and outside the European Union
* shipping costs in the shop are for Germany .
If you order from outside , they will be higher .
Unfortunatly they vary for every country , so its hard ( read : stupid work ) to list prices .
Best you order 6 bottles or more , to keep the cost per bottle low ( And 10kg is a common shipping price limit anyway ... )
* within the EU shipping costs may vary between ~8 and and ~ 80 EUR !
.nl , .be , .lu , .ch , .li , .dk , .at. , .sk , .cz are in the 8 - 12 EUR range ( 8 - 10 for up to 10kg , 10 - 12 for up to 15 kg ) , while .uk , .fr , .it , se , .ir , .no , .es , .pt , .sk , .fi , .sl , .pl , .lv , .lt , .ee at 20 - 30 EUR , the rest of the world is even higher .

How to order using the German UI
I believe that the iPhone 4 will be remembered as the device that invented video chat .
Just like how the iPod is often seen as the first real mp3 player .
It was n’t at all of course .
There were dozens of mp3 players before it .
But the iPod set a new quality bar which was so much higher than everything before it , that it redefined the space , and actually made it accessible to the mainstream .
Video chat is in a similar place today to where mp3 players were 10 years ago .
There are lots of video chat solutions out there on the market .
Skype is the most well known .
I helped launch Google ’s video chat system across Gmaill , iGoogle and Orkut during my tenure there .
It definitely is one of the best on the market , and it ’s still only appealing to early adopters .
I mean “ early adopters ” in the classic Everett Rogers sense , which is to say folks for whom the extra value of the new technology outweighs the hassles of using it .
This is a step beyond the “ innovators ” category , who are willing to bend over backwards debugging a brand new product just because they understand that it will be important later .
Video chat has been available to innovators for a great many decades .
With iPhone 4 , Apple will push video chat to the early majority category .
Apple has a history of sitting on potential technologies until all the bugs are worked out , which is fundamentally what ’s needed to appeal to more than just early adopters .
I ’m pretty sure FaceTime will be no exception .
In 6 months , video chat wo n’t be this geeky thing that people put up with out of desperation .
It will begin to be integrated into normal culture .
We ’ll start to see television dramas and movies incorporate it as just a way some people communicate , rather than as a way to demonstrate how high - tech somebody is .
People who are n’t geeks will start to use video chat .
Video chat really matters
Those of us who have lived deeply with video chat understand its value .
There is a ton of additional content transmitted in video that helps communication on many levels .
It allows for a more nuanced informational discussion , but more importantly IMHO , it allows distant communication to be much more personal and emotional .
Anybody who has tried professional collaboration with another team that is thousands of miles away knows that this level of communication is at least as important for business uses as it is for social communication .
The first time you meet your collaborators in person , they become more real , more trustworthy , easier to talk to , especially about difficult subjects like problems that might arise in a project * gasp * .
Video chat is certainly not as good as meeting people in person , but it is a huge step above email , IM or phone .
( Getting drunk together I believe represents the highest professionally - accepted level of humanization . )
Human - to - human communication has always been the killer feature of computer technology .
Video chat makes synchronous communication fundamentally better , and as such will become a major part of everybody ’s life in the developed world in the years to come .
What does this mean for everybody else ?
The history of technology innovation tells us that a couple things typically happen when an emerging technology pushes into the majority segments .
First , established players will all get a boost .
Apple will be doing a huge favor to Skype and Google Video Chat by removing the veil of geekiness from their products .
Apple ’s huge investment in making this product work well will make all consumers more willing to try alternatives .
Another common side - effect is that the space will get more difficult for new entrants .
This usually happens as the technology standardizes .
There becomes a “ normal way of doing things ” that people start “ to get . ”
Before a technology can reach the majority , it will typically bounce around dozens of different modalities as everybody tries to find a way of doing it that resonates with the market .
This uncertainty represents a clear opportunity for start - ups and the subsequent standardization is the closing of that opportunity .
Another reason the space usually gets harder for startups is that economies of scale start to kick in as production levels ramp up to meet the larger demand .
This naturally favors large companies , since it raises the amount of investment needed to compete .
Which Social Graph ?
Another reason the space might get harder for newcomers is the natural monopoly of social graphs — consumers are better off if there is a single definitive place to keep track of their contacts rather than having to replicate and maintain a different list for each service .
As such , social graphs are important assets to anybody in this space .
But if Tim O’Reilly gets his way ( which I hope he does ) and we end up with a loosely - coupled internet OS , this wo n’t be a problem for startups , as they ’ll just be able to draw from an openly available graph , say from a Google or Facebook .
I ’m really not sure how this aspect will play out .
My guess is that Apple will rely on the de-centralized social graph which is the contact list built into every iPhone .
It ’s a less useful corporate asset than if it were properly cloud - hosted , which will make it harder for them to expand the service to OS X machines .
Perhaps they ’ll make something useful out of mobileme here , but I have my doubts .
But given the revenue they get from App Store sales , it ’s not clear that the OS X machine is even a major part of their consumer strategy going forwards .
If so , this would likely be a strategic shift for them , as the inclusion of web - cams on essentially every OS X machine for years was probably done in anticipation of making a major push into video chat at some point .
Do n’t forget Cisco
In addition to the obvious players like Google and Skype , this is also incredibly important for Cisco too .
Cisco has long been interested in video chat .
Why ?
The same underlying reason Intel has been investing in multi-media since the late 1980 ’s .
Multimedia on PCs needs lots of CPU power , and video chat needs lots of bandwidth .
It ’s called “ primary demand stimulation . ”
To be very clear : Cisco wants everybody to use video chat because video chat uses lots of bandwidth , and when people are using lots of bandwidth , Cisco sells more big routers .
Cisco is in the final phases of buying Tandberg , who is the biggest supplier of video - chat hardware for businesses .
Their aquisition of Flip last year seems strategically odd in isolation , but in this context makes perfect sense .
They are building ( buying ) expertise in consumer - electronics which can handle high quality video .
Take a Flip camera , add a network ( like a linksys wifi box ) and you ’ve got a video chat terminal .
I predict we ’ll see such a toy out of Cisco in about 2012 , as video chat fills the early majority segment and edges against the late majority .
When David Kean got home from his shopping spree Sunday , he immediately went online .
“ Well , I spent 40 K today , ” wrote Kean , a real estate agent , in a post on the website LoftLA.com .
“ Expensive weekend . ”
Pricey jewelry ?
Luxury car ?
No , parking spaces .
Advertisement
Kean is a future resident of 1100 Wilshire , a swanky high - rise condo development downtown .
And for his $ 40,000 , he bought the right to park his Mercedes CLK coupe and Lincoln Aviator in two spaces on the sixth floor of his building .
Not long ago in car - friendly Los Angeles , free parking seemed like a birthright .
But the real estate boom has hit even the parking lot .
1100 Wilshire is selling parking spots for $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 a pop , offering new residents , who are paying $ 400,000 to $ 1 million for their units , the chance to wrap the cost of their spaces into their mortgages .

Such prices may have been standard in tony sections of New York , Boston and San Francisco , long known for their walk - able downtowns and elaborate public transportation systems .
But in Los Angeles -- home to some of the world ’s first parking garages as well as those sprawling postwar shopping mall parking lots -- the price tags are raising some eyebrows .
Real estate professionals said the setup seems unusual -- even along the canyon of high - rise condos in West Los Angeles .
Shel Kirschner , an agent with Coldwell Banker in West Los Angeles , said that he had n’t heard of selling parking spaces separately from condo units .
“ If you buy a unit in any of condos on the Westside , 90 % of the time , you do have assigned parking ” included with the purchase price , he said .
Donald Shoup , a professor of urban planning at UCLA , said the arrangement “ is bringing us more into line with what other big cities are doing . ”

By charging separately for parking , said Shoup , author of “ The High Cost of Free Parking , ” 1100 Wilshire in effect encourages use of public transportation by residents of the building , which is just a few blocks from a Metro subway stop .
“ Unbundling the parking gives people a new choice , ” said Shoup .
“ Maybe it will deter people who want to own three cars , and encourage people who own only one .
This is exactly the direction L.A. ought to be moving : People who use less parking pay less for housing . ”
In other cities , “ it would be unthinkable to have the parking thrown in for free .
It would turn it into L.A. ”
Residents of the 1100 building get two unassigned spaces with their purchase price , said Kevin Ratner , a senior vice president of Forest City Enterprises , which is developing the project .
Advertisement
But the building ’s design requires drivers to climb a four - story “ speed ramp ” before parking on the fifth through 16th floors .
The unassigned spaces are on the higher floors -- and just getting to them could be enough to induce acrophobia .
Hence the premium parking .
“ You can buy your way down in the building , ” said Ratner .
“ I would do it if I were buying there .
When you roll it into the mortgage , the monthly impact is comparable to what you would pay for parking .
And for resale , it ’s great . ”
While urban planners might hope the high prices will drive some residents to mass transit , early evidence suggests otherwise .

Developer Forest City rolled out the parking program just a few weeks ago , and the response has been positive , Ratner said .
“ You can buy more than two spaces ... you could have more than two cars .
It is a car - centric town , ” he said .
“ Maybe your husband has a couple of hot rods . ”
In downtown Los Angeles , where parking has long been at a premium , some say the 1100 Wilshire prices are just another necessary evil .
Many lots downtown charge $ 100 or more per month for parking .
Residents of the Higgins Building at 2nd and Main streets recently voted to charge themselves a condo fee of $ 65 a month to pay for a valet for themselves and their guests .
Kean , the 1100 Wilshire condo owner who purchased two spaces , said he is guaranteeing himself an easy ride home .
“ Otherwise , you come home late , and you have to circle up to the 11th floor ....
It ’s a mile up . ”
