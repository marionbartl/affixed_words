The history of wigs , after the jump .
Wikipedia says :
Wigs have been worn for thousands of years ; the ancient Egyptians , for instance , wore them to protect their shaven heads from the sun .
Other ancient peoples , including the Assyrians , Phoenicians , Greeks and Romans also used wigs .
Curiously , they are principally a Western form of dress ; in the Far East they have rarely been used except in the traditional theatre of China and Japan .
After the fall of the Roman Empire the use of wigs fell into abeyance in the West for a thousand years , until revived in the 16th century as a means of compensating for hair loss or improving one 's personal appearance .
They also served a practical purpose ; the unhygienic conditions of the time meant that hair attracted head lice , a problem that could be much reduced if natural hair was shaved and replaced with a more easily de-loused artificial hairpiece .
Royal patronage was crucial to the revival of the wig .
Queen Elizabeth
I of England famously wore a red wig , tightly and elaborately curled in a " Roman " style , and King Louis XIII of France pioneered wig- wearing among men from the 1620s onwards .
Periwigs or perukes for men were introduced into the English - speaking world with other French styles when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 , following a lengthy exile in France .
These wigs were shoulder - length or longer , imitating the long hair that had become fashionable among men since the 1620s .
Their use soon became popular in the English court .
...
With wigs becoming virtually obligatory garb for men of virtually any significant social rank , wigmakers gained considerable prestige .
A wigmakers ' guild was established in France in 1665 , a development soon copied elsewhere in Europe .
Their job was a skilled one , as 17th century wigs were extraordinarily elaborate , covering the back and shoulders and flowing down the chest ; not surprisingly , they were also extremely heavy and often uncomfortable to wear .
Such wigs were expensive to produce , as the best examples were made from natural human hair ; the hair of horses and goats was often used as a cheaper alternative .
During the 18th century wigs became smaller and more formal , with several professions adopting them as part of their official costumes ; this tradition survives in a few legal systems .
They were routinely worn in western European countries and the British colonies of North America .
The wearing of wigs as a symbol of social status was largely abandoned in the newly created United States and France by the start of the 19th century , although it persisted a little longer in the United Kingdom .
Women 's wigs developed in a somewhat different way .
They were worn from the 18th century onwards , although at first only surreptitiously , and full wigs in the 19th and early 20th century were not fashionable .
JSON is a lightweight text format for data interchange .
It is often better suited for structured data than XML .
A frequently requested task with JSON data is its transformation to other formats , especially to XML or HTML for further processing .
The most obvious way to achive this , is to use a programming language ( ECMAscript , Ruby , … ) and the DOM - API .
In XML we can transform documents by another XML document containing transformation rules ( XSLT ) and applying these rules using an XSLT - processor .
Adopting that concept I have been experimenting with a set of transformation rules ( written in JSON ) .
As a result in analogy to XML / XSLT the combination JSON / JSONT can be used to transform JSON data into any other format by applying a specific set of rules .

Sharp Blue : Ancient Egypt in ten paragraphs
This is the first of what I hope will be an occasional series of “ Histories in Ten Paragraphs ” .
In this installment , my aim is simply to provide the basic chronological framework for the history of Egypt for readers who have only a passing familiarity with that civilisation ; I make no claims of originality of interpretation .
Of necessity I have condensed many important and complex eras into brief sketches or neglected them entirely .
I hope that experts will forgive these simplifications but equally I hope that they will point out my more obvious errors .
The absolute chronology of dynastic Egypt is subject to many uncertainties , but for the sake of brevity I have used the dates given by Grimal throughout this essay .
If there ’s sufficient interest in this article , I ’ll probably write a similar one about either Rome or ancient Mesopotamia next .
1. The Old Kingdom , 2700 - 2200BC
The first state controlling all of Egypt was formed in around 3150 BC with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer - Menes .
It ’s conventional to divide ancient Egyptian history into a sequence of dynasties ( some of which were contemporaneous ) , and Narmer - Menes is traditionally the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty .
The archetypal pattern of Egyptian state and society was laid down some four hundred years later during the Old Kingdom , four successive dynasties ( 29 kings in all ) that ruled from Memphis in Lower Egypt .
The civil , military and religious administrations were centred on the person of the pharaoh , who was believed to have a special relationship with the gods .
The ideology of this strong centralised state was given concrete form through monumental architecture : the famous pyramid tombs ( including the three gigantic pyramids at Giza ) , stone temples and presumably also mud - brick palaces which have not survived .
Egyptian military power expanded beyond the first Nile cataract into Lower Nubia in the south and into Sinai in the north ( the former the major source of the gold on which the Egyptian economy depended , the latter of turquoise ) .
Egyptian commercial interests reached further afield , to Byblos in the Levant ( an important source of timber ) and Punt on the Red Sea coast of eastern Africa ( source of incense , ebony , ivory , animal skins and other luxury goods ) .
This state endured for centuries .
2. The First Intermediate Period , 2200 - 2040BC
The power of the centralised state ultimately depended on the agricultural surplus of the fertile soils of the Nile flood - plain ( one role of the pharaoh was to intercede with the gods to control the Nile innundations vital to Egyptian agriculture ) .
In the 22nd century BC , a temporary shift in climate reduced the level of these innundations , causing widespread famine , which eroded the religious authority of the pharaohs and , more practically , undermined the economic and military power of the regime .
Both trade beyond Egypt and mining expeditions were abandoned , Asiatic invaders seized the Nile Delta , and the country slid towards anarchy as the reach of the pharaoh contracted towards Memphis .
During the later Old Kingdom local dynasties of provincial governors had emerged and now the state fractured along these pre-existing faultlines as people looked to regional powers for their security .
Eventually , the process of disintegration halted and reversed as rival dynasties at Herakleopolis and Thebes consolidated and extended their control .
3. The Middle Kingdom , 2040 - 1674BC
Mentuhotep II , who became King of Thebes in 2061BC , eventually defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and his other rivals , ushering in a period of renewed unity .
The centuries that followed were the classical period of Egyptian civilisation and the Twelfth Dynasty - which followed Mentuhotep ’s Eleventh Dynasty - was one of the most powerful in Egyptian history .
The Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs pacified Nubia as far as the region of Kush around the third cataract , exploited the gold mines of the Eastern Desert , built impressive irrigation works , extended Egyptian influence into Syria - Palestine , developed a balanced and elegant architectural style , and presided over an efflorescence of literature .
The Middle Kingdom also saw subtantial immigration from Syria - Palestine as people moved to Egypt to provide labour for the booming economy .
After a complex problem of succession following the long reigns of Senusret III and Amenemhat III , the Twelfth Dynasty ended with the death of Queen Sobekneferu in 1802BC .
Although the transfer of power to the Thirteenth Dynasty was smooth , the golden age of the Middle Kingdom gradually began to fade .
4. The Second Intermediate Period , 1674 - 1553BC
Under the Thirteenth Dynasty , Egypt once again began to fragment politically .
As the power of the pharaohs diminished , a new political power irrupted into Egyptian history : the Hyksos , a group of semitic peoples who crossed from Asia into northern Egypt and established their own kingdom in the Nile delta , with its capital at Avaris .
The Hyksos brought new military technologies - chariots and composite bows - with them to Egypt but it ’s likely that the defection of already politically powerful asiatic immigrants to the Hyksos cause rather than sheer military power was the deciding factor in the takeover of northern Egypt .
Contrary to the impression given by the propaganda of the New Kingdom pharaohs , the Hyksos rapidly adopted most aspects of Egyptian culture .
The Hyksos kings brought a measure of renewed stability and prosperity to the Delta , and earned the support of many native Egyptians .
Soon the situation in the rest of the country stabilised too and a new equilibrium emerged , each of whose parts considered the others as equals : a network of northern city - states with varying degrees of loyalty to the Hyksos king in Lower Egypt , a powerful breakaway state ruled from Thebes by native Egyptian kings in Upper Egypt , and a newly emerged semi-Egyptianised kingdom of Kush in Nubia .
5. The New Kingdom , 1552 - 1352 BC : Tuthmosids
Just as the First Intermediate Period ended with the wars of the Theban king Mentuhotep II , so the Second Intermediate Period ended with the wars of Theban kings Kamose ( last pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty ) and his brother Ahmose I ( first pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty , the first of the New Kingdom ) .
A branch of the family related by marriage to Ahmose were to rule Egypt for two centuries .
This period saw the construction of the Egyptian Empire as the warrior pharaohs Tuthmose I , Tuthmose III and Amenhotep II pushed Egypt ’s borders deep into Nubia and to the Euphrates in Syria .
The reign of Hatchepsut , the first ( and perhaps only ) woman to rule not as queen regent but pharaoh provided a relatively peaceful interlude during which a trading expedition was sent to the exotic land of Punt .
During this period Egypt prospered as never before , and its power dominated the Mediterranean world .
The Egyptian New Kingdom became part of an international system of great powers : Egypt , Babylonia , Elam ( in western Iran ) , Mycenaean Green , Arzawa ( in south - western Asia Minor ) , Alashiya ( Cyprus ) , Mittani ( in Syria ) , Hatti ( the kingdom of the Hittites in central Anatolia ) and Assyria ( in northern Mesopotamia ) .
The rulers of each of these powerful states , the Great Kings , considered the others as both peers and rivals , and they competed with each other in limited ways through vassal - state proxies .
The system was bound together by diplomatic correspondence , mostly in Babylonian , and the exchange of luxury gifts .
Much of the wealth that poured into Egypt from international trade and tribute was used to fund monumental architecture : the Karnak temple of the state god Amun at Thebes was repeatedly expanded and elaborated by successive pharaohs , substantial mortuary temples such as Djeser - Djeseru , the temple of Hatchepsut at Deir el - Bahri , were built and extensive tombs were cut out of the rock of the Valley of the Kings in the Theban necropolis and filled with treasures .
The apogee of the Tuthmosid era was the long , glorious reign of Amenhotep III , whose son , the heretical pharaoh Akhenaten , was to plunge Egypt into turmoil .
6. The New Kingdom , 1352 - 1295 BC : The Amarna Interlude
Throughout the New Kingdom , the priesthood of Amun grew in wealth and power , eventually coming to rival and then exceed the power of the pharaoh .
By the time of Amenhotep III this potential for rivalry was becoming apparent and Amenhotep actively promoted the cult of the sun-god Re in an attempt to counterbalance the Amun priesthood .
This , though , was nothing next to the religious revolution ushered in by his son , who came to the throne as Amenhotep IV but soon changed his name to Akhenaten .
Under Akhenaten the old religion of Egypt was largely swept away - at least so far as the court was concerned - and replaced by the worship of the sun ’s disc , the Aten .
This was the earliest recorded monotheistic religion .
Conveniently for the royal family , only Akhenaten ( and perhaps his famously beautiful queen , Nefertiti ) could directly worship the Aten and receive life from it and all other Egyptians had to worship through the pharaoh .
Akhenaten also moved the capital from
Thebes to a new city called Akhetaten ( “ Horizon of the Aten ” ) that he ordered built in the middle Egyptian desert at what is now el - Amarna .
It ’s clear that much of this was achieved against widespread resistance only through the loyalty of the army to the Tuthmosid family .
Akhenaten ’s reign also brought a revolution in Egyptian art , which for a short period cast aside the ancient formalism and embraced a new mood of naturalism , innovation and finally downright weirdness .
While the court threw itself into Aten worship in splendid isolation at Akhetaten , the situation in the colonised territories grew desperate .
For a decade , Akhenaten simply ignored letters from vassal kings begging for help against the ascendant power of the Hittites .
His death was followed rapidly by that of the next pharaoh , the elusive Smenkhkare , and then of Akhenaten ’s young son Tutankhaten / Tutankhamen .
The Tuthmosid dynasty rapidly imploded as the Egyptian Empire teetered on the brink of chaos .
That the empire did n’t collapse was due to three men who in turn became pharaoh : the Amarna regime ’s elder statemen Ay ( the father of Amenhotep III ’s queen Tiy ) , who masterminded the restoration of the worship of the traditional gods , and the generals Horemheb and Ramesses I , who stabilised the military situation .
The last became the founder of the new Nineteenth Dynasty .
The aftermath of the Amarna debacle saw a concerted attempt to erase all traces of Akhenaten and his new religion from Egyptian history .
7. The New Kingdom , 1295 - 1069BC : Ramessids
During the post - Amarna period the equilibrium of the great states had begun to shift dramatically as Hatti swallowed Arzawa , partitioned Mittani with Assyria and began to detach Egypt ’s vassals in Syria - Palestine , where Akhenaten ’s neglect had weakened Egypt ’s position .
Containing the threat of Hittite expansion was the great challenge for the early Nineteenth Dynasty pharaohs .
Their efforts culminated in one of the great battles of the ancient world , the immense but somewhat inconclusive battle fought between Ramesses II and the Hittite king Muwatallis II in 1274BC at Kadesh in Syria .
After Kadesh , the war continued on a less epic scale until 1258BC when Ramesses and the new Hittite king Hattusili III agreed the world ’s earliest known peace treaty , after which relations between the two great powers were generally friendly .
However , the challenges faced by the last pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty and the Twentieth Dynasty pharaohs were of an altogether greater magnitude and they proved themselves only barely equal to them .
During this period , the system of great states beyond Egypt ’s northern borders entirely collapsed and the Near East plunged into a “ dark age ” that lasted for centuries .
The events during this collapse and its causes are generally obscure .
What is clear is that a combination of factors contributed .
The increasing burden of taxes required to support the palace elites caused large numbers of people to drop out of the economy and become “ habiru ” living on the margins of civilisation .
There was an extremely serious debt crisis in Babylonia .
War between states in the east may have been an important factor , as may migrations of Aramaean tribes into the region .
Along the Mediterranean , armies of “ Sea Peoples ” were probably both a cause and an effect of the collapse .
The state of Hatti , weakened by civil wars , was swept away , leaving only relatively small and impotent successor states .
The pharaohs Merenptah and Ramesses III defeated attempted invasions by the Sea Peoples in 1209BC and 1180 BC respectively .
Ramesses III , though , was to be the last powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom .
The Twentieth Dynasty continued to rule a unified Egypt for a century after his death , but his successors were generally weak and ineffectual .
Furthermore , climate change once again caused crop failures and famine .
In the end , the New Kingdom was fatally weakened by the troubles beyond and within its borders , and Egypt declined into a third period of disunity and foreign domination .
8. The Third Intermediate Period , 1069 - 664BC
Following the death of Ramesses XI in 1069BC , power was split between Piankh , the High Priest of Amun at Thebes and the pharaoh Smendes who ruled from Tanis in the Nile Delta .
This was the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period , a confused and confusing period of Egyptian history that would last for four centuries , during which parts of Egypt were ruled by a range of dynasties related to each other by complex family relationships .
In essence , the Third Intermediate period can be roughly divided into three phases .
During the first phase , from 1069 BC to 945BC , pharaohs of the Twenty - First Dynasty nominally ruled the country but power in the south remained in the hands of Piankh ’s successors ( who occasionally even claimed royal titles ) .
The second phase , from 945 BC to 747BC , saw the emergence of Libyans as an important new factor in Egyptian politics .
The Nile Delta had been slowly infiltrated by Libyans tribes from the west since the Twentieth Dynasty but during this period they formed their own tribal confederacies that were independent of the rule of the pharaoh .
With the death of Psusennes II , last pharaoh of the Twenty - First Dynasty , Shoshenq I , Great Chief of the Meshwesh [ Libyans ] became king .
He and his successors dominated Egypt for two centuries and even extended Egyptian power once more into Palestine .
During the third phase , Egypt was conquered by Egyptianised Kushite pharaohs from Nubia who ruled for almost a century .
The last part of Kushite rule , under the great Taharqa , was overshadowed by a desperate struggle with Assyria , which had by now recovered from its own dark age and was busily building an empire in Syria and Palestine .
The Assyrians launched a series of invasions of Egypt between 671BC and 664BC , eventually defeating the Kushites and making Egypt a vassal of the Assyrian Empire .
Ironically , it was this foreign conquest that would restore Egypt ’s unity under a native dynasty .
9 . The Late Period , 664-525BC
At first , the Assyrians attempted to control Egypt through twenty native governors .
Then , in 664BC , they recognised the remarkable Psamtik , the governor of Sais in the Delta , as sole king of Egypt .
With the Assyrians distracted by their own internal struggles , Psamtik spent twenty years making this nominal power into a concrete reality in a series of campaigns against Egypt ’s other semi-independent powers .
The Saite king bolstered his own forces by importing large numbers of mercenaries from Caria in Asia Minor and from Greece .
Henceforth , Greeks would always be entangled with Egyptian history .
In 656BC Psamtik ’s forces finally took control of Thebes and he appointed his daughter Nitocris as the next Divine Adoratrice of Amun , thus guaranteeing his control of the formerly independent priesthood .
For the first time in four centuries , Egypt was united under an Egyptian pharaoh .
For a century and a half , he and his successors , the Twenty - Sixth Dynasty presided over the “ Saite renaissance ” , a period of renwed prosperity in which the pharaohs made a concerted effort to reestablish Egyptian greatness .
However , the world beyond the Saite monarchy was a much more dangerous place than that inhabited by the New Kingdom pharaohs : if the New Kingdom ’s world had been one of rival kingdoms , the Egypt of the Late Period was part of a world of great empires .
Following the destruction of the Assyrian Empire , Egyptian armies and their Greek mercenaries attempted to restablish Egyptian control of Palestine but the Saite kings soon found themselves embroiled in war with the Neo - Babylonian Empire , which had also expanded into the vacuum left by the Assyrian collapse .
Finally , Egypt became drawn into the struggle between the vigorously expansionistic Persian Empire , which had eclipsed the Babylonians , and the Greeks .
The Persian king Cambyses II invaded Egypt in 525BC , defeated and captured the pharaoh , Psamtik III , ending both the Saite dynasty and Egypt ’s independence .
10 . The End of Ancient Egypt
The post - pharaonic history of ancient Egypt extended a millennium beyond the Persian conquest .
Save for a brief interlude from 404BC to 343BC beteen two periods of Persian occupation , ancient Egypt would never again be ruled by Egyptians .
The second Persian occupation was terminated in 332BC by the conquests of Alexander the Great .
From 304BC till 30 BC , Egypt was ruled by Alexander ’s general Ptolemy and his descendents .
Then , following the defeat of Cleopatra VII and Marcus Antonius by Octavian ( later Augustus ) at Actium in 31BC , Egypt became part of the Roman Empire .
Both Greeks and Romans preserved much of the administrative machinery of the pharaonic state , and Egypt flourished once again .
Indeed , it was the richest and perhaps most important province of the Roman Empire , and for a long time was the personal property of the emperor himself .
Furthermore , Egyptian culture and religion proved very popular across the Graeco - Roman world .
The Greeks and Romans even continued to build monuments in the formal Egyptian style until the Christianisation of the Roman Empire .
In the end , it was the fanaticism of the Christians that fueled the final onslaught that swept away the culture of the pharaohs .
The last hieroglyphic inscription was carved at the temple complex at Philae in the far south of Egypt in AD394 .
At that point , we can say that the civilisation that began in the Nile Valley in the fourth millennium BC finally ended .
The Egypt of Late Antiquity and the Islamic Egypt of later times would be very different places .

Description
SISCweb is a framework to facilitate writing stateful Scheme web applications in a J2EE environment .
By using continuations , SISCweb does away with the page - centric execution model typical of web programming .
Every time the program sends a response to the browser , its state is suspended , to be then resumed from that exact point when the browser submits a request .
One implication of this approach is that local variables in scope when the response is sent will still be in scope when the subsequent request is received , making much of the session - object data shuffling needless .
Another consequence is that , much like in console - based applications , the conversational state between client and server is constantly maintained -- hence the term " stateful . "
SISCweb is implemented in SISC , a Scheme interpreter for the JVM with support for full continuations .
Features
SISCweb is both a compact engine to manage continuations and a collection of small libraries to ease web development .
Benefiting from both its implementation language , Scheme , and its environment , J2EE , SISCweb offers :
An interactive , REPL - based web application development style .
Developers can write web applications incrementally without ever needing to restart the J2EE context or the application itself .
A powerful , yet unobtrusive SXML - based extension to HTML mostly oriented toward flow control .
For instance , it is possible to define closures on the fly , and associate them to a link .
Solid support for using standard J2EE view components such as JSP / Servlets in place of SXML .
A handy ( if incomplete ) SQL library easily extended to various database vendors through plug - in Scheme modules .
Generation of Graphviz graphs through an SXML version of DOTML .
Requirements
SISCweb needs these software versions installed :

After my post about the “ The Prize ” video there was a short discussion in comments about earlier predictions made by Dr Yergin , and the book “ Energy Future - Report of the Energy Project at the Harvard Business School , ” which he co-authored with Robert Stobaugh .
Now back when those studies came out I was also trying to read the tea leaves to see what sort of a future our own students would have .
At the time coal seemed to get more attention and favor than it now holds , so there is a little more emphasis there .
Let me begin with “ Energy Future ” which begins with an interesting paragraph ( given it was written in 1979 ) .
There were two dramatic oil prices increases in the 1970 ’s , the first which multiplied the price of oil eight - fold by the end of 1974 over that when the State Department sent out the memo , and the second , which came with the fall of the Shah of Iran some five years later , when the price of oil went up another two - and - a - half times .
As a result not only Dr Yergin 's collaborative effort editing a second book “ Global Insecurity – A Strategy for Energy and Economic Renewal ” , ( from which the last sentence came ) but a significant number of other august bodies also began to produce their own projections .
For your amusement I thought you might like to see some of them .
To begin by putting things in perspective , back in 1977 the United States was consuming the following quantities of energy .
You can see , already , in the years since 1970 , that imports had become almost half of American supply , and even back in 1970 they provided 24 % of consumption .
The book “ Energy Future ” was written to suggest a transition from imported oil , to a more balanced , and more domestic , energy supply .
Thus the various chapters examined ways to increase production , or at least maintain existing levels , for the different fuel sources .
Since we are mainly about oil and natural gas ( and because I want to include other references ) let me just very crudely condense the two relevant chapters .
But to give some cover to the authors , it should be remembered that the book was written just after the Three Mile Island incident .
The authors look at two possible solutions , removing price controls and easing drilling restrictions to increase conventional recovery , and unconventional recovery through the processing of oil shale .
They conclude that even by the year 2000 the latter would be unlikely to make any significant contribution , and thus they anticipate that oil production levels would be maintained at 1977 levels , through increased production from conventional wells .
However they go on to state ( page 44 )
Thus , the total oil output in the late 1980 ’s from both known and newly found oil fields and from enhanced recovery will likely approximate 10 million barrels daily , about the same as current production .
Even this level is quite speculative and perhaps on the optimistic side .
To maintain that production level would require the finding of almost four billion barrels annually , but there has been only one year in the last thirty in which more than three billion barrels of reserves have been found .
Administration experts , with the aid of large computer models , argued that domestic production could reach 15 million or even 20 million barrels daily , and that U.S. imports thus could be reduced to zero .
They said this would require an eleven - dollar a barrel oil price ( in 1973 terms ) which , in fact , was not much higher than the 1975 - 78 prices for newly found oil .
First , higher prices might stimulate exploration to such an extent that the discovery of new reservoirs would support consumption in excess of the current 20 tcf per year , say 25 tcf per year or more .
In that case , new electric generating plants might even be permitted to use natural gas .
This seems , on the available evidence , to be the lest likely outcome , but it is possible .
Second , and only slightly more likely , is that higher prices could fail to stimulate more than the current 10 tcf of new discoveries per year .
The third and most likely outcome is that annual discoveries will range between 10 tcf and 25 tcf per year .
Within that range , a figure closer to 10 tcf means further restrictions on the industrial use of gas as boiler fuel and as feedstock , plus stern enforcement of mandates to convert existing gas - fired industrial and electric utility boilers to coal .
However their optimism is mild relative to the experts from 1974 that they quote ( Hmm !
Parts of that sound a bit familiar ) .
The chapter concludes that it would not be realistic to anticipate that domestic production could ( for the reasons cited above ) exceed 1977 values , and thus in order to reduce the reliance on foreign oil , the United States should look to fuel sources other than oil .
Natural Gas had been a regulated fuel in the United States until 1978 , and in a great debate about deregulation of price it was agreed that the nation would be unlikely to see any increase in production beyond the 20 tcf then being provided , but the USGS predicted that at that rate the US would have enough reserves for between 44 and 100 years , while the CIA suggested the reserve would last 50 to 60 years .
It was then in process of deregulation and the authors conclude the chapter with the paragraphsBased on these assumptions , and some discussion of alternative fuelds , the authors ended with a prediction that gave , by the end of the 1980 ’s , the following anticipated progress in fuel supply .
I have added the actual data ( taken from the EIA International Energy Outlook 2005 .
Not having looked at the accuracy of their prediction , I must confess to being a little more impressed than I expected to be ( since my estimates were somewhat different ) .
In the following book , Global Insecurity , the topic became rather the world supply with the prevailing supplies being given as :
Most of the book deals with a nation by nation analysis , and so I will just extract one table , and give the tables for world energy consumption in 1978 and their projected use in 2000 , under two scenarios .
And by now there is some clearer difference appearing in the energy levels coming from different sources .
Unfortunately for their original proposition much more of it is coming from imported oil than they had anticipated .
Next to come out of that dark corner of my bookshelf is a small book “ Coal and Energy ” by the then ex-Chair of the British National Coal Board , Sir Derek Ezra , who made the following predictions in 1978 , for world energy demand comparing 1974 with projections for 1985 and 2000 .
He focused purely on the world outside the then Communist regions .
However , while of limited interest , he did also include projections of oil imports for various nations within those time frames :
In regard to which a book on Coal – Bridge to the Future by the World Coal Study Group in 1980 looked at three possible scenarios for oil production from around the world and came up with :
It is interesting that none of these is considering demand growth from China .
In regard to the increase in prices over the years , the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe wrote a report on Coal :1985 and Beyond , where they anticipated that Oil prices would rise 3.25 times between 1970 and 2000 , Natural gas prices would rise 7.56 times and coal prices would drop to 86 % of the price .
The National Research Council who in 1978 came out with a report on Energy Modelling for an Uncertain Future , projected the introduction of the Fast Breeder Reactor in 2000 , and thus came up with :
This was part of a much larger study that covered more than 6 scenarios with overall demand varying from around 28 mbdoe to about 75 mbdoe .
If there is interest I could reproduce them , but otherwise I will let these examples speak for themselves .
It does appear that the predictions for nuclear energy were the most optimistic , relative to the actual result .
Every movie lives or dies by its villain - Luke Skywalker would have had an uneventful upbringing if not for Darth Vader , Batman would be fighting grime if it were n't for The Joker and James Bond would probably be working in civil service without Blofeld and friends .
But for every intergalactic space bastard or pussy - stroking megalomaniac , there 's a cheap Xerox knock - off , a cardboard cut - out , half - price villain in reserve , the ones that exist only to receive an ass - kicking at the hands of our heroes .
It 's time to celebrate the lamest movie villains of all time , whether they lack the power , the know - how or even the fashion sense of cinema 's finest bad guys .
These hapless chaps could n't take over the world if they were the last ten people on Earth .
10 . GENERAL GRIEVOUS in STAR WARS : EPISODE III
In a saga full of fantastic baddies - including arguably the top movie bastard of all time , no less - there was always going to be a villain that was n't fit to clean the bantha shit off of Darth Vader 's space boots .
With Anakin Skywalker still getting to grips with puberty , the dastardly villain in Episode III was the much - heralded General Grievous , a droid warrior with a fearsome reputation - spot on , if by ' fearsome reputation ' you mean ' intense cowardice ' .
Sure , he carried four lightsabers , but does having lots of pockets make you a force to be reckoned with ?
Factor in his stupid chicken walk , a head modelled on a detergent nozzle and an inexplicable chesty cough and he 's hardly the stuff of legend - give him a pack of Fisherman 's Friends and he'd probably change his whole outlook on intergalactic war .
Ultimate act of lameness : Being shot and killed by a blaster .
How fiendish !
9. PETER SARSGAARD as GENE CARSON in FLIGHTPLAN
First of all , no one is going to buy that this miserable looking girl would ever be capable of true evil : he 's supposed to be the mastermind of a mid-flight scam that sees him frame Jodie Foster 's concerned parent , but sports a look on his face like he 's just shit in his pants .
Secondly , his name is Gene , and no one called Gene has ever been villainous in the entire history of humanity .
Finally , his flawless plan is so fucking retarded , it relies on every single passenger on the flight turning a blind eye to the stinking obvious , a series of extremely improbable incidents taking place and the captain having an IQ smaller than his shoe size .
Carson 's pre-pubescent voice and poor bomb awareness make him a shoe - in for this list ; he even passes up an opportunity to punch Jodie Foster in the face .
Ultimate act of lameness : Being foiled by a recently - bereaved widow and a little girl .
8. MARK PILLOW as NUCLEAR MAN in SUPERMAN IV
Tremble at the might of Mark Pillow !
Okay , so Nuclear Man is a slightly more intimidating name for a villain , but it still does n't change the fact that he 's the shittiest villain the Man of Steel has ever faced .
Admittedly he was born in the most awesome way possible - by a nuclear explosion on the surface of the sun - but an attraction to simple Earth girl Lacy Warfield rendered him an impotent foe ; you never caught General Zod making a booty call or Lex Luthor texting one of his bitches .
Nuclear Man met a predictable death at the hands of an enviro- mental Superman and was thrown into a nuclear reactor , which somehow killed him despite it being the source of his power ; the dolt could n't even die properly .
Ultimate act of lameness : Falling for a humanoid female , and not even a hot one .
7. WILLEM DAFOE as THE GREEN GOBLIN in SPIDER -MAN
In the flesh , Defoe makes for a terrifying villain : his cracked , disturbing face looks like something born from one of your stinkiest cheese nightmares .
But when scientist Norman Osborn undergoes accidental Goblinization , Defoe lets himself down with his choice of costume , encasing himself in a green plastic number that looks more like something you 'd see the Power Rangers fighting against .
With that ghoulish visage hidden behind a cheap - looking Halloween mask , the Goblin is reduced to cackling maniacally , failing to kill his arch - enemy and flying around on his posh little glider , which is kind of like an even more useless Segway .
The Goblin even makes that hallmark rookie villain mistake of dying by his own hand ; at least Dr. Octopus went out with dignity .
Ultimate act of lameness : Pumpkin bombing an elderly guy in a wheelchair .
6. RAUL JULIA as M. BISON in STREET FIGHTER
In digital form , M. Bison is as hard as balls - when he's not setting himself on fire , he 's stomping your ass into the ground and making you curse your fat sausage fingers to hell .
In the flesh , Bison is a less formidable enemy , despite being played by accomplished character actor Raul Julia , a man who played Othello in his time .
Dressed from head to toe in tight , restricting leather , Bison lacked his videogame counterpart 's fisticuff skills and was eventually beaten into a sorry - looking paste by Jean - Claude Van Damme and his fist - punching friends .
Street Fighter : The Movie was to be game over for Julia , as he died shortly after filming - the makers dedicated the film to his memory , a gesture which saw Julia respond in kind by flipping them off from beyond the grave .
Ultimate act of lameness : Wearing a leather hat , straight from the YMCA school of fashion .

Turning plants such as corn , soybeans and sunflowers into fuel uses much more energy than the resulting ethanol or biodiesel generates , according to a new Cornell University and University of California - Berkeley study .
" There is just no energy benefit to using plant biomass for liquid fuel , " says David Pimentel , professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell .
" These strategies are not sustainable . "
Pimentel and Tad W. Patzek , professor of civil and environmental engineering at Berkeley , conducted a detailed analysis of the energy input - yield ratios of producing ethanol from corn , switch grass and wood biomass as well as for producing biodiesel from soybean and sunflower plants .
Their report is published in Natural Resources Research ( Vol. 14:1 , 65 - 76 ) .
In terms of energy output compared with energy input for ethanol production , the study found that :
corn requires 29 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced ;
switch grass requires 45 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced ; and
wood biomass requires 57 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced .
In terms of energy output compared with the energy input for biodiesel production , the study found that :
soybean plants requires 27 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced , and
sunflower plants requires 118 percent more fossil energy than the fuel produced .
In assessing inputs , the researchers considered such factors as the energy used in producing the crop ( including production of pesticides and fertilizer , running farm machinery and irrigating , grinding and transporting the crop ) and in fermenting / distilling the ethanol from the water mix .
Although additional costs are incurred , such as federal and state subsidies that are passed on to consumers and the costs associated with environmental pollution or degradation , these figures were not included in the analysis .
" The United State desperately needs a liquid fuel replacement for oil in the near future , " says Pimentel , " but producing ethanol or biodiesel from plant biomass is going down the wrong road , because you use more energy to produce these fuels than you get out from the combustion of these products . "
Although Pimentel advocates the use of burning biomass to produce thermal energy ( to heat homes , for example ) , he deplores the use of biomass for liquid fuel .
" The government spends more than $ 3 billion a year to subsidize ethanol production when it does not provide a net energy balance or gain , is not a renewable energy source or an economical fuel .
Further , its production and use contribute to air , water and soil pollution and global warming , " Pimentel says .
He points out that the vast majority of the subsidies do not go to farmers but to large ethanol - producing corporations .
" Ethanol production in the United States does not benefit the nation 's energy security , its agriculture , economy or the environment , " says Pimentel .
" Ethanol production requires large fossil energy input , and therefore , it is contributing to oil and natural gas imports and U.S. deficits . "
He says the country should instead focus its efforts on producing electrical energy from photovoltaic cells , wind power and burning biomass and producing fuel from hydrogen conversion .
I was going to read some Penny Arcade , but Robert Scoble invoked me .
Jeremy points out that Google had an IE7 promo page that looked remarkably similar to a Yahoo !
IE7 promo page .
I can only speak for me personally on this .
If Jeremy looked into it and says that it was n’t a template from Microsoft , I believe him .
That would mean that the Yahoo !
page was used as a template for Google ’s IE7 promo page .
I ca n’t say why someone at Google would decide to do that , but to the Yahoo !
UI designer whose page was copied : my apologies .
In my personal opinion , it sucks when someone else copies a page layout without attribution .
It can take a lot of work to come up with creative HTML .
I remember when Google did a bunch of UI research to decide on a distinctive look for AdWords .
We decided to go with pastel boxes with a darker border on the right - hand side of the search results :
Not too long afterwards , Yahoo !
changed their side ads to pastel boxes with a darker border :
Then at some point , Google decided to go for a fresh look .
After a ton of prototypes , testing , and internal research , we decided on a blue background for the top ads , with a blue line separating ads on the right - hand side :
Not too long afterwards , Yahoo !
changed their top ads to a blue background , made the right - hand ads on a white background , and added a blue line separating the ads :
Of course , changing the just UI alone can cause weirdness , so it ’s good that Yahoo !
changed their ads to be the same number of characters as Google .
Yup , getting copied without credit can suck .
I ’m glad that Jeremy was so observant and pointed this out immediately .
Google has already changed the page , but I trust Yahoo will be on the lookout for copying in the future . 😉
Why Windows takes so long to shut down .
.
We all have been there .
It is 4:55 and you want to get out of work …
But you want to make sure your system is shutdown for the night .
You dutifully close all of your applications and start shutting down
5 minutes later it * finally * powers off
It happens to more machines that it should .
I decided to see what the problem might be .
I searched google , forums , and newsgroups for an answer .
The biggest culprit is a problem unloading the current users profile .
This can happen when third party , or even Microsoft applications have not properly cleaned up when exiting .
Windows will keep trying to unload the profile until Windows finally decides that it ca n’t and should shutdown .
Even if you find the application causing the problem – it may be impossible to do anything about it .
This is why Microsoft released the User Profile Hive Cleanup Service
This free utility automatically cleans up user profiles and prevents you from playing the timeout wait game .
Once you run the setup wizard it will look like the installer did nothing .
If you open up your services list ( Click start , then run and type services.msc now click ok ) , you will see that a new service is running in the background :
The idea of this program is to reclaim resources when a task is finished ( memory , handles , etc ) .
It accomplishes this by monitoring for users to log off and verifying that unused resources are reclaimed .
This approach is superior as it works for any known reason that profiles do not unload and also will keep working to address new unknown issues .
Now when you go to shutdown , logoff or restart it will happen within seconds .
Instead of minutes .

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says he speaks for his people
Iran 's foreign ministry said Tehran respected the UN charter and had never used or threatened to use force .
But it also rejected a UN Security Council statement condemning President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over his comments .
An Iranian TV channel broadcast the remark for the first time on Saturday , saying reaction to it was coordinated by Israel in a plot against Iran .
Mr Ahmadinejad made the controversial comments during a speech to students in Tehran on Wednesday .
They were seen by the outside world as a threat and the latest reaction from Iran is an effort to calm the outcry , says the BBC's Frances Harrison in Tehran .
Our correspondent says this is the closest Iran has come to saying it will not attack Israel .
UN ' duplicity '
Israel - which had demanded the emergency Security Council meeting - welcomed Friday 's statement .
" The Security Council condemns the remarks about Israel attributed to Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , President of the Islamic Republic of Iran , " said the declaration , agreed by all 15 members .
But reacting to the statement on Saturday , Iran 's foreign ministry insisted it had no intention of attacking Israel .
It went on : " The declaration published by the Security Council - proposed by the Zionist regime to cover its crimes and give an image at odds with reality - is unacceptable . "
It expressed surprise that the Council had never condemned threats made against Iran by the US and Israel or the " crimes " of the Israeli regime .
Ahead of the UN session demanded by Israel , President Ahmadinejad stood by his " just " remarks .
He attended the Jerusalem Day rally in Tehran which Iran organises every year to show solidarity with the Palestinian struggle .
Thousands of Iranians attended an anti-Israel rally on Friday
Mr Ahmadinejad said : " My words were the Iranian nation 's words .
" Westerners are free to comment , but their reactions are invalid . "
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat has distanced the Palestinian leadership from the Iranian position .
Iranian officials have said there was nothing new about the president 's comments , which quoted a slogan of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
They have blamed the foreign media for blowing the crisis out of proportion and accused the West of seizing on this issue to pressure Tehran over its nuclear programme .
But there is no doubt this incident has damaged Iran 's standing internationally at a time when the country badly needs support to prevent its nuclear dossier being referred to the UN Security Council , our Tehran correspondent says .
Richard Stallman gave the keynote speech at the Turin , Italy , meeting on March 18 about the drafting of GPLv3 , " The Future of Free Software , " and I thought you 'd like to read it .
You can also view a video of it , if you prefer at http://streaming.polito.it/TFOFS [ Ogg ] .
The current draft of GPL v3 is here .
He explains very clearly the more complex proposed changes , such as the clause on DRM ( " Tivo- ization " ) and patents .
I have to frankly tell you that the opening part about not using the phrase " intellectual property " seems to be at least in part about a conversation we had on using the phrase , because I maintained that if you are referring to the law , there is no confusion , that it 's a term of art that has a specific meaning in the law .
Lawyers know the difference between patent and copyright law , even if no one else does , and so when they use that term as an umbrella phrase , they know what they mean .
Obviously he disagrees , for all the reasons he explains in this speech .
I 'm just fessin ' up that he 's responding , I think , to my position and basically saying I 'm all wet .
I realize he 's likely had that conversation with many other people .
But that does n't inhibit me one bit from producing the whole speech , because for all I know he 's right , and anyway , I do n't have to agree with everything he ever says in every area to know it 's worthwhile to listen .
And when it comes to the GPL , there is no one better to tell us the purpose of the license and what is intended than the man who has the final say .
He addresses that too , at the very end .
His explanation of the purpose behind the proposed changes in the GPL is very useful , and I am sure it will clarify the draft license for you .
He also tells what they decided * not* to try to do .
So here is his speech , in full .

Links to documents for more information on the topics covered The transcript Richard Stallman : Before I get into the main subject , which is the plans for version three of the GPL , I want to mention a very important fundamental issue . [ 1h 27 m 06s ]
There is a term that some people use , which causes terrible confusion and should never be used , and that is the term " intellectual property " .
Now , I heard someone mention that term .
I do n't think he was explaining why that term should not be used .
It is devastatingly harmful to use the term " intellectual property " because that term implies the existence of something which does not exist .
Copyright law exists .
Patent law exists .
They have almost nothing in common in terms of the requirements that they put on the public .
Trademark law also exists .
It has nothing in common with copyright law or patent law about what it requires of the public .
So , the idea that there is some general thing which these are instances of already gets people so confused that they cannot understand these issues .
There is no such thing .
These are three separate unrelated issues , and any attempt to generalise about them guarantees confusion .
Everyone who uses the term " intellectual property " is either confused himself or trying to confuse you .
[ applause ] [ 1h 29 m 12 s ]
I came to this conclusion a few years ago and since then I have decided that I will never use that term .
No exceptions .
I will talk about why the term is confusing , because that 's a useful thing to do , but I will never use that term .
I never use it .
I hope you will join me in making this firm policy of never using it .
And if someone else says something about " intellectual property " , I will not respond directly to what he said without first explaining the confusion buried in it , because you see , the confusion buried in a statement is usually more harmful than whatever may be false that he actually tried to say .
The false premises , the false presuppositions are the most important problem .
So , if someone makes a statement about intellectual property and some part of it is the specific point , which I might disagree with , the first thing I will say is why it 's a mistake to talk about intellectual property at all , and then I will try to translate what he said into clearer terms , and then I might say if I agree with it or not .
But that 's secondary , and explaining to people the confusion in the term intellectual property itself is the most important thing to do .
There is a tendency to , we all have it , to follow other people in their choice of terminology .
If someone says an outrageous thing and he uses the term intellectual property , you will feel drawn into responding in the same terms .
So , learn to resist that temptation . [ 1h 31 m 20 s ]
The most important mistake , the most important falsehood in that statement is it's use of the term " intellectual property " in the first place .
And the most important thing about it to respond to , if you could only choose one thing , is that one .
And you can say : " and since your whole picture of the situation is totally confused , clearly the specifics of what you said need to be rethought " .
That 's all you need to do to deal with the specific thing he said .
And , by the way , when the term " intellectual property " is used in the name of a law or a committee , that is an example of the confusion .
It 's almost a certainty that any law named " intellectual property " is a harmful , an unjust law .
Of course , you have to check the details to be sure of that , but you can be almost certain just from hearing the name .
And the reason is that you can tell from the name that unjust premises and confusions went into the design of the law so what could you expect except harmfulness . [ 1h 33 m 00s ]
So , at this point , I should go to the intended topic , which is version three of the GPL .
I designed GPL version one in 1989 , and GPL version two in 1991 .
I thought of making a version three something like five or six years ago .
We did n't intend to wait fifteen years .
It was due to the fact that I was busy , and there were some things that were hard to figure out .
The idea that there would be changes in the GPL was planned from the beginning .
That is , version one already included a plan for transition to future versions .
We suggested that people release their programs under " version one or any later version of the GPL " , and the idea was that when version two came out , it would automatically be usable for all those programs and in the time since version two , we 've been suggesting that people release their software under " version two or any later version " and I believe most GPL covered programs do say that , with the result that when GPL version three comes out , a lot of software will be usable under GPL version three .
The older versions of the GPL also promise that future versions would be " similar in spirit " .
In other words , the changes will not be radical .
Any radical change would be false to the spirit and would be wrong . [ 1h 35 m 17s ]
The changes that we 've proposed in version three are all in small sub-issues .
Some of them are very important , but in the overall framework , they 're small chnges .
And the overall effect of GPL version three will be basically the same as version two , protecting the same four freedoms , but doing it somewhat better , dealing with some problems which we 've encountered and adapting better to various different laws around the world .
One thing that we 've done is that we 've restructured some of the concepts , for instance , we make it clear that many other activities that have the effect of providing copies to other people are treated the same as distribution .
Anything that 's covered by copyright law which has the effect that it enables other people to get copies is effectively equivalent to distribution , and this insulates GPL version three from certain differences between laws in various countries about just what constitutes distribution .
So it has the effect of making the GPL work more the same in all countries , despite precisely how they have formulated their copyright laws .
There are many changes in GPL version three which do something like that , they actually just make it more uniform and more reliably doing the same thing we expected it already did . [ 1h 37 m 20 s ]
But there are some places where we actually have changed the policies in small ways .
One of these concerns software patents .
GPL version two is based on an implicit grant of a patent licence .
The idea is that if somebody says " here is a thing and you can use it " , implicitly he 's promising he's not going to sue you for patent infringement if you go ahead and do what he said , however , since in the past eight years or so some other free software licences have included explicit statements of patent licenses , patent licence grants by people distributing the software , and so we decided to do the same thing , and we 've included an explicit statement that the distributors of the software all promise not to sue anybody who is using any version of that software for patent infringement based on the versions that they distributed .
Basically , whatever their versions do , they 're promising not to sue you for .
However , there 's a subtlety that came up in this .
What if somebody does n't have a patent but he has got a licence for that patent , and he distributes the code to you .
Well , does that licence he got include your exercise of the four freedoms ?
Including your freedom to redistribute copies yourself , with changes ?
Maybe not , but if it does n't , it creates a dangerous and unfair situation .
Unfair to you because he is distributing the software , or distributing his version of the software , and he is not going to get sued for patent infringement because he got a licence .
He distributes it to you under the GPL and the GPL says you are free to redistribute it too , but if you do that you might get sued because his patent license might not cover you . [ 1h 40 m 04s ]
Well , this is unfair , this is something that 's not supposed to happen .
He received this program under the GPL and the GPL says when he distributes a version of it , he must really give you the freedom to do the same .
If he can count on safely doing it , and he knows you will get sued if you do it , by a third party , he 's cheating .
So , GPL version three , along with the explicit patent licence grant , says that if he is knowingly relying on a patent licence for distributing his version , he must take some effective step to protect you as well if you distribute .
Now , the reason it talks about " knowingly relying " is that there are companies that have signed blanket cross licences with other companies , so the company distributing the program , might have some blanket cross licence with some company , and that blanket cross licence might cover a thousand patents , and they do n't even know what those thousand patents say .
So , if they do n't even know that they have a patent licence , they 're not required to pay attention , but if they know about a specific patent that would cover this program , that means they are knowingly relying on a patent licence and that means they have to keep you safe as well .
This is a very controversial decision .
It may seem like a subtle point , it covers a peculiar scenario , but it 's not an impossible scenario .
It could be a very important scenario .
In this scenario , this point is essential to ensure that the GPL really does what it intends to do , which is , make sure that you do get the freedom to redistribute the software that you got .
And this is typical of the ways that we are changing GPL version three .
They apply to complicated scenarios but those scenarios may happen frequently , and in those scenarios we are trying to make sure that you really get the four fundamental freedoms which that free software .
Did someone earlier already describe the four freedoms ?
Then I better do so . [ 1h 42 m 43s ]
Freedom zero is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose .
Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code and change it to do what you wish .
Freedom two is the freedom to help your neighbour , that 's the freedom to make copies and distribute them to others when you wish .
Freedom three is the freedom to help your community , that 's the freedom to publish or distribute modified versions when you wish .
So here we 're talking about what is necessary to ensure that freedom two really exist for you in a certain special scenario , freedom two being the freedom to redistribute copies and also freedom three , it applies to that too . [ 1h 43 m 35 s ]
Another area where we have made changes concerns Digital Restrictions Management .
Now , freedom zero says you are free to run the program as you wish for any purpose .
We are not limiting freedom zero .
If someone wants to run a program to encrypt something , that 's fine .
If someone wants to run a program to decrypt something , that 's fine .
If somebody wants to run a program to produce an encrypted medium that 's difficult to access , that 's fine .
If somebody has some other GPL covered program to access that media and he wants to run it to access the encrypted data , that 's fine too .
And distributing software that could be used for those purposes is also entirely permitted , and will be permitted by GPL version 3 . [ 1h 44 m 58s ]
However , freedom zero does not include imposing you purposes on someone else who is going to run the program , because his freedom zero is the freedom to run the program for any purpose of his .
So , there is no such thing as the freedom to use any software to impose your purpose on someone else , in fact , that should be illegal .
I 'm serious .
And that 's what DRM is .
When somebody distributes a player , that has DRM in it , what he 's doing is trying to restrict your running of your computer for his purposes , which is directly in conflict with the four freedoms that you should have .
And that 's what GPLv3 is in certain ways trying to stop and it does this simply by assuring you all four of the freedoms when you use the software .
You see , because DRM - Digital Restrictions Management - is a plan to restrict the public , anyone distributing a version of a GPL - covered program as a player for DRM media always does something to stop the public from modifying the player , because his purpose in distributing a DRM player is to restrict you , he has to make sure you can't escape from his restrictions , from his power .
That means he is always going to try to deny you freedom one .
Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code of the program and change it to do what you want .
What you want , might be , to escape from his restrictions , and if you have freedom one , you can escape from his restrictions .
So his goal is somehow or other , for practical purposes , to deny you freedom number one . [ 1h 47 m 26s ]
Now , what he might do is , use non -free software , and then completely deny you freedom number one .
In fact , that 's what they usually do .
We can't change that with the GPL because they 're not including any GPL - covered code .
They do n't have to pay attention to the GPL .
There should just be a law against it .
It should be illegal .
DRM should be illegal , but we can't change laws by modifying the GPL .
However , there are those that want to use GPL - covered software for this purpose , and they want to do so by turning freedom number one into a sham , a facade .
So they plan to do something like , make a modified version of the GPL - covered program , which contains code to restrict you , and distribute that to you and somehow arrange that you can't really modify it , or if you modify it it wo n't run , or if you modify it and operate it , it wo n't operate on the same data . [ 1h 48 m 42 s ]
They do this in various ways .
This is known as Tivo-isation because this is what the Tivo does .
The Tivo includes some GPL - covered software .
It includes a GNU + Linux system , a small one , but it does , and you can get the source code for that , as required by the GPL because many parts of GNU +
Linux are under the GPL , and once you get the source code , you can modify it , and there are ways to install the modified software in your Tivo and if you do that , it wo n't run , period .
Because , it does a check sum of the software and it verifies that it's a version from them and if it 's your version , it wo n't run at all .
So this is what we are forbidding , with the text we have written for GPL version three .
It says that the source code they must give you includes whatever signature keys , or codes that are necessary to make your modified version run .
In other words , it ensures that freedom number one is real .
That you really can modify the source code , install it , and then it will run and not only that , we say , they must give you enough to make the modified version operate on the same range of data .
Because , you see , Microsoft 's plan , which they call Palladium , and then they change the name - they change these names frequently so as to evade criticism , to make criticism difficult , to make any kind of comment on their plans difficult .
You talk about their plan and they say " Oh , we 've dropped that , we have a different plan now " .
And probably it is different in some details , but the point is that they generate encryption and decryption keys using a check sum of the program which means that a different program can't possibly access the same data .
Although , that 's just the base level , and then on top of that they implement other facilities where the program simply has to be signed by the authorised signer in order to be able to access the data . [ 1h 51 m 29 s ]
Well , GPL version three says that if they distribute a GPL - covered program in this way , they must provide you with the key necessary so that you can sign your version and make it access the same data .
Otherwise , they would say " Yes , you can run your modified version , but it will have a different check sum , so your version will only operate on data files made for your version , just as our version only operates on data made for our version " .
And what that means is that all the available files will only work with their version and your changed version will not be able to access them .
That 's exactly , in fact , how Treacherous Computing is designed to work .
The plan is that they will publish files that are encrypted and it will be impossible to access those files with any other program , so GPL version three is designed to ensure that you really , effectively , get the freedom to take the program you were given , modify it , and run the modified version to do a different thing on the same data on the same machine .
But , there 's one other way that we 're trying to thwart DRM .
You see , one thing they do is , some countries , including , I 'm sad to say , this one , have adopted unjust laws that support DRM .
The exact opposite of what they ought to do , which is prohibit DRM , and what they say is : when media have been encoded for DRM , then writing another program to access that media is illegal , and the way they do this is they say that DRM constitutes an effective , they call it " protection " I call it " restriction " , measure .
So , what we say is , by releasing a program under GPL version three , you agree that it is not an effective restriction measure .
In other words , you authorise others to develop on their own software to read the output of your program .
This also is a matter of recognising and respecting their freedom to develop software and use their computers .
And this , what I 've described so far , is all that GPL version three says about DRM . [ 1h 54 m 36s ]
Another area in which we 've made large changes has to do with compatibility with a wide range of other free software licences .
We 've always understood GPL version two , and version one , as being compatible with some other free software licences .
Namely , those that do n't require anything except what the GPL requires .
So , for instance , there is the X11 licence , all it requires is that you keep the licence there .
This does n't actually demand anything that conflicts with the GPL , so we 've always interpreted it as being compatible with the GPL , and what it means to say that two free software licences are compatible is that you can take code from a program under licence A and code from a program under licence B and put them together in one program and you have not violated either licence .
If both licences permit the combining of the code , then you can combine the code , and that 's what it means to say the licences are compatible .
Now , it 's very useful to be able to combine the code , so compatibility of the licences is a convenient thing .
Now , it 's impossible for all free software licences to be compatible .
You see , the GPL makes certain requirements and we are not willing to have them taken off , and so another licence , such as GPL version one , that does n't have those requirements , cannot be compatible with GPL version two or three .
That 's impossible .
A licence like the Mozilla Public License has it's own specific requirements , but it requires things the GPL does n't require .
It ca n't be compatible , I believe .
So we can't be compatible with all of them , but we went through other free software licences and we identified certain kinds of requirements that are pretty harmless and we would n't mind if people could attach those kinds of requirements to GPL - covered programs , and we made an explicit list of those kinds of requirements .
Section seven of the draft of GPL version three says you can put your own terms and conditions on code that you add to the GPL covered program , and your terms and conditions can include these kinds of requirements .
You can also give additional permission .
Any kind of additional permission you like .
So your terms on your code can be more permissive than the GPL itself .
And section seven makes it completely explicit that this is compatible with the GPL . [ 1h 58 m 22s ]
Now , these , the added kinds of requirements that you can make , include different requirements as regards credit and notices and how to identify changes on your code .
That 's harmless , that only really is relevant when people change your code , and when they do that they will see your terms at the beginning of your code and they will know what to do .
And it can include a requirement that they not use certain of your trademarks in ways that trademark law forbids .
And this would just be a way of reinforcing trademark law using the copyright on your code .
And that 's harmless because you could actually do that with trademark law in the first place .
So this does n't actually restrict people in any way that they would n't be restricted otherwise . [ 1h 59 m 28s ]
You can put on requirements that -- and this is a non-trivial kind of requirement that we 've decided to let people put on -- requirements that if people run your code , on a publicly accessible server , then it must have a command that the user can use to download the source code of the version that is running .
Which means that if someone makes changes and puts the changes in his version , on his server , he has to make his source code changes available to the users who talk to his server .
This requirement is known as the Affero clause because it's used in the Affero GPL .
The Affero GPL is like GNU GPL version two except it has this requirement as well .
We were thinking of including some kind of requirement like that in GNU GPL version three .
We did n't want to make it apply to everything automatically .
That would be a drastic change , so we would have to make it something that people could activate explicitly for their programs , and then I realised people could activate it explicitly for their programs by putting the Affero GPL on their programs and as long as the GNU GPL says it 's compatible with that , that 's a way you could activate that requirement for your code and it means we do n't have to put any specific thing about that in the GNU GPL , we only have to make the GNU GPL compatible with it and we did . [ 2 h 01 m 33 s ]
There 's another kind of requirement that we 've decided to permit , and this is patent retaliation clauses .
Now , the reason is that there are several other free software licences that have patent retaliation clauses .
Patent retaliation means , if you sue somebody for patent infringement , then you lose the right to use this code .
Of course there are many ways to do that because every patent retaliation clause puts on some specifics , if you sue him or him for patent infringement in certain circumstances , then you lose the right to use this code , and the question is , what are those circumstances , what are the conditions under which the retaliation operates .
Now , we saw that there are some very broad and nasty patent retaliation clauses .
Some of them say , " if you sue me for patent retaliation , for any reason about anything , you lose the right to use this code " .
Now that 's bad because it means , suppose I sue you for patent infringement and you have a patent so you counter sue me , and then my free software licence retaliates against you and you lose the right to use that code , now that 's not fair because in that case you are defending yourself , you 're not the aggressor , so we decided to accept only patent retaliation clauses that are limited enough that they do not retaliate against defense , that they only retaliate against aggression , so there are two kinds of clauses that we identified that do this .
One is , if the clause itself , makes a distinction between defense and aggression , so it says , if you sue somebody for patent infringement and it's aggression , then you lose the right to use this code , but if you are suing in retaliation for aggression , then what you are doing is defensive and then we do not retaliate against you .
This is one kind of patent retaliation clause that we accept . [ 2 h 04 m 21s ]
The other kind is , if you sue , alleging that some free software , relating to this code is patent infringement , then you lose the right to use this code .
In the broad space space of possible kinds of patent retaliation clauses , we picked two kinds , each of which is limited enough that it will not retaliate against people for practicing defense with patents .
It will only retaliate against aggressors .
And we 've said these two kinds of clauses are OK to add to your code in a GNU GPL covered program .
This is a conceptually complicated thing .
There 's no way to make it any simpler , I hope , at least , that I 've explained it clearly .
The GPL itself does contain one very limited kind of patent retaliation , but it 's a different kind .
It says if make changes in a GPL - covered program and then somebody else makes similar changes and you sue him for patent infringement then you lose the right to continue making changes and copying the program to your own machines .
This is a very limited situation and it's meant to protect against one particular kind of abuse on the part of server operators where they make an improvement , which they 're free to do , and run it on their servers and they do n't release their source code and if the code does not have the Affero clause on it then they do n't have to release the source code , and then you decide that you are going to implement a similar improvement and then they sue you for patent infringement .
So , once again , we 're making a change that keeps people honest and makes sure that the four standard freedoms that the four standard freedoms that the GPL has always tried to ensure , really apply in all cases .
This is pretty much it , but there is also one interesting change in the section that deals with modified versions .
There has always been a requirement that if you get a program that prints some kind of notice about the licence when it starts up , you can't take that out .
We 've generalised that so that it applies to various kinds of user interfaces in various ways .
So , for instance , if the program is graphical and it has an " about " box , the about box has to say " this is free software under the GPL " .
And if it starts up interactively and asks for commands , then it has to print the notice at the beginning , and the requirements are a little bit different depending on how obtrusive this would be .
For example , the about box is simply a menu item sitting in a menu , well that does n't bother anybody , so we just say that always has to be there .
On the other hand , printing a notice at start up can be annoying , there are certain programs which should n't print notices at start up .
So what we say is that if the program that you got does n't print a notice and you change it , then your program does n't have to print a notice either .
You know , if you change Bash , well Bash is n't supposed to print a notice when it starts up and we do n't require you make it print a notice , but if you gave it a GUI , with menus , you would have to put in an about box because the about box does n't do any harm . [ 2h 10 m 02s ]
I 've covered all the issues I can think of that are worth discussing , and I am willing to ask for questions however you can discuss a question with me but if you think you see a problem , you should go to the site gplv3.fsf.org and report this problem and get it considered through our discussion committees and they 'll either publish an answer eventually , or they will pass the issue on to me and I 'll think about whether a change is needed .
So , I 'm ready for questions . [ 2h 10 m 55s ] [ applause ] Q1 : I would like to ask , what is the position of Stallman , and to clarify a bit about the different position of the Linux community about Digital Rights Management .
Stallman : I can't speak for them , and I do n't want to try .
All I can point out is that Linux is one of thousands of programs in the GNU + Linux operating system .
These programs already have various different licences .
If some of those programs continue to be distributed under GPL version two while others move to GPL version three or to " GPL version three or later " , that wo n't be any disaster .
The developers of Linux are the ones who will decide which licence to use on their program , but I 'm confident that most of the GNU +
Linux system will be under the GPL version three , regardless of what the Linux developers decide about their program .
I hope that they will move to GPL version three because I want to see Linux resisting Tivo-isation .
Linux , after all , is one of the programs that has already been Tivo-ised .
[ applause ] Q2 : ( Question asked in Italian , something about linking and dynamic languages ) Stallman : Actually , there are changes making it clearer that it does n't matter which kind of linking is being used .
If there are two modules which are designed to be run linked together and it's clear from the design from one or the other that they are meant to be linked together then we say they are treated as one program and so I hope that will make it a little bit clearer although that 's not really a change , it 's a clarification .
That 's what we believe GPL version two means already .
Q3a : I have two different questions .
The first is what happens if anyone released code under GPL version two maybe ten years ago and now is n't happy with version three and says you 're changing the spirit , when I said I would release it under version two and subsequent version , I did n't think of these .
Do you imagine he would be bound to version three .
Stallman : Yes .
Because we 're not changing the spirit .
These are small changes .
Q3a2 : OK , so basically , you 're the one who judges ...
Stallman :
Well , maybe a court might , but I can't believe that anyone not strongly prejudiced would conclude that this is a change in the spirit .
A change in the spirit certainly permits change in the details of the requirements and anyone who released it under version two or later should have seen the changes that were made from version one , which were not as big but they were the same kinds of things .
So yeh , if he released it under GPL two or later you 'll be able to use it now under version three .
Q3b1 : OK , the second question is that , as you know , I 'm involved in these United Nation processes on the Internet governance , so I 'm interested to know , do you think the fight against Digital Rights Managements and Trusted Comp [ interrupted ]
Stallman : Digital Restrictions Management , and Treacherous Computing .
Do n't use the enemy 's propaganda terms , every time you use those terms you are supporting the enemy .
[ applause ] Q3b2 : OK , so the correct term is Treacherous Computing right ?
So on the fight against these new mechanisms , do you think it can only be won by writing free software , releasing free software ?
Stallman : I do n't know .
Q3b3 : Do you imagine that there should be need for intervention or lobbying at the legal level ?
Stallman : I think Treacherous Computing should be illegal .
But I do n't know how we 're going to convince governments to actually do that because governments are mostly not very democratic anymore .
They mostly are the pro-consuls of the mega corporations , their job is to keep us in line under the rule of the empire .
That 's why they run for office , they get into office , they do what the emperor -- the emperor being the mega corporations -- tell them to do , and their job is explaining to us why they can't do what we want them to do .
It 's very very sad and once in a while somebody has enough courage to refuse to obey , somebody like [ sounds like Hugo Chavez ] .
Q3b4 : So do you think it 's not even worth trying ?
Stallman : Oh , it 's worth trying .
It 's just going to be hard , the point is you have to keep putting the pressure on these politicians .
In France , there is a battle going on and we still might win it about the legalisation of peer - to - peer copying on the Internet .
This shows that when enough people get energised , the empire can lose a battle .
It 's very important .
[ applause ] [ 2h 19 m 53s ]
Stallman :
Another thing that people should do is refuse to buy anything that 's based on DRM .
Do n't buy corrupt disks , that is the fake CDs that have music set up so that you 're blocked from copying it .
Do n't buy DVDs unless you have DeCSS and you can copy it .
If you can't copy it - do n't buy it ! [ applause ] [ 2h 20 m 23s ] Q4 : ( Question in Italian , mentions Eben Moglen ) Stallman :
Well , first , I 'm the one who decides what goes into GPL version three , and , of course , whenever I think of language I 'm usually working with Eben Moglen since he 's a lawyer and he's the only one that can tell me if the language will really do what I hope it will do .
Meanwhile , a lot of other people are involved .
For instance , you can go to the gplv3.fsf.org site and study it and if you think you see something that 's not good or whatever kind of problem you think there is , you can report it and your comment will go to a discussion committee and , there are five discussion committees , it will go to one of those committees which will then group your comment with other comments that raise that same issue and then they will study each issue and post the issue and their response to it and your comment will be connected to the issue which they grouped it into so it will be connected to the response as well .
And thus , there are probably hundreds of people participating in checking the draft and trying to make sure it does the right thing .
Q5 : In the end of the process of deciding what will happen , what modifications of the licence will be done there 's one single person , that is you .
Can you explain why this decision and you have not chosen to make some group ?
Stallman : I do n't know other people who can do this .
I hope that the process that 's going on now will help develop some people who can be part of some group activity but at the moment , I do n't know anyone that I could delegate this to .
Obviously I can't always forever be the person doing this , barring unforeseen advances in medical technology or AI and nanotechnology , which I certainly hope will come soon but they 're not likely , but at this point , I think this is the right thing to do .
Q5.2 : Maybe it will change in the future .
Stallman : I hope .
We 're going to have to replace me somehow , sooner or later .
[ applause ] [ 2h 24 m 30s ] Q6 :
You told us about what GPLv3 will be , but what about the issues that are included , the suggestions that you refused .
Can you give us some samples ?
Stallman :
Well , when I decided that we had to do something to resist Digital Restrictions Management , the obvious way to do this would be restrictions on what kinds of jobs the program can be made to do , but I decided that that would be the wrong way to do it and so I thought hard and I came up with a way to achieve the job by directly protecting the freedom of each user without any restrictions on what technical job a version of the program can do .
Another example of what we decided not to do was putting the Affero clause into the GNU GPL in some way .
Another example of something we decided not to do , we decided not to put in very much in the way of patent retaliation clause and the reason is we have doubts about how effective those clauses can be .
We have doubts about whether our community actually has enough power that the threat of our retaliation would scare anyone .
So , these are some examples of changes we decided not to do .
Some for reasons of principle and some for practical reasons .
So , thank you for your attention , and happy hacking .

Correction Appended
WASHINGTON , March 28 - Five former judges on the nation 's most secretive court , including one who resigned in apparent protest over President Bush 's domestic eavesdropping , urged Congress on Tuesday to give the court a formal role in overseeing the surveillance program .
In a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the secretive court , known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , several former judges who served on the panel also voiced skepticism at a Senate hearing about the president 's constitutional authority to order wiretapping on Americans without a court order .
They also suggested that the program could imperil criminal prosecutions that grew out of the wiretaps .
Judge Harold A. Baker , a sitting federal judge in Illinois who served on the intelligence court until last year , said the president was bound by the law " like everyone else . "
If a law like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is duly enacted by Congress and considered constitutional , Judge Baker said , " the president ignores it at the president 's peril . "
Judge Baker and three other judges who served on the intelligence court testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in support of a proposal by Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , to give the court formal oversight of the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program .
Committee members also heard parts of a letter in support of the proposal from a fifth judge , James Robertson , who left the court last December , days after the eavesdropping program was disclosed .
Ayala faces up to nine years in jail over the chilli finger scam
Anna Ayala , 39 , faces up to nine years in jail while her husband Jaime Placencia , 43 , could get 13 years .
Ms Ayala 's claim is said to have cost the third - largest US burger chain $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.3 m ) in lost sales .
The woman had claimed she had bitten into the finger at a Wendy 's restaurant in San Jose , California , in March .
Investigators later found the finger belonged to construction worker Brian Rossiter , who had lost it in an industrial accident and sold it to Mr Placencia for $ 100 .
Ms Ayala initially claimed she had bitten down on the finger which she described as " kind of hard , crunchy " .
She said the incident had caused her " great emotional distress " .
She has since withdrawn her lawsuit against Wendy's .
The fast food chain has insisted all along that the finger did not originate at one of its establishments as no staff had lost a digit and no suppliers had reported any accidents involving hands .
It says it has had to sack employees because of the loss in sales .
The couple have been in police custody since their arrest earlier this year .

I blame Douglas Adams for what happened during our last two days in Tokyo .
It ’s because of him that we always take towels with us whenever we travel .
Sure , the Westin Tokyo has towels , but we were unsure of what to expect from the budget ryokan on our side - trip to Kyoto .
As a result , we lugged a couple of our best bath towels half way around the world “ just in case ” .
Ultimately our towels sat on a bench in our room for the entire trip ( except for our Kyoto trip , where , of course , we ended up not needing them ) .
During our frantic packing spree the evening before our departure we noticed our towels had vanished .
Apparently the cleaning crew had swept them up with our bed sheets and sent them off to be washed .
Upon making this discovery I made what I thought was a harmless inquiry to the front desk .
It did n’t take me long to realize that I should have kept my mouth shut .
The service desk passed my inquiry on to the management , and the cleaning crew , and the cleaning company that washes the Westin Towels , and the Tokyo police department , and possibly several international law enforcement agencies .
They generally set out a dragnet over the whole of Tokyo looking for our towels .
How was I to know they ’d see this as some kind of national shame ?
At first I was amused by the situation .
It must have been the first time in history that a hotel had stolen towels from its guests .
It did n’t take long for my amusement to fade as I spent my last night in Tokyo fielding a series of mind numbing phone calls from various levels of management within the Westin chain .
All of them in very broken English .
All of them extremely apologetic .
Each caller more regretful than the last .
At first they called every hour or so .
Then , as our check - out drew nearer , the phone began ringing every five minutes .
“ Mr. Krausen , [ not my name , but I was n’t about to point that out ] we are looking for your towels right now !
We will not rest until they are found .
We are most sorry ! ”
Meetings were held .
Half the cleaning staff was dismissed , the other half committed ritual suicide and died in shame .
Finally , just before our departure , it all came to an abrupt end as the manager of the Westin arrived at our door to personally apologize and promise that a mistake of this sort would never happen again .
There was some strange ritual involving incense and sake , and then we were presented with two gift boxes which we were assured contained “ only the most high quality Westin bath towel ” .
At that point it appeared that the Towel Incident had finally come to an end .
A very strange way to spend our final hours in Japan .
And so we flew back to Pasadena with our gift wrapped carry - ons ( in addition to our normal carry - ons ) .
I used to wonder who those people are who bring gift wrap packages onto international flights .
What could they possibly be thinking ?
Thanks to the Tokyo Westin I actually became one of those people .
Upon our return the packages got stacked in a corner while we unpacked , decompressed , and generally tried to get back to normal after half a month in Japan .
After a week we had a discussion about the boxes in the corner .
My wife favored hiding them in the closet fully wrapped as last minute emergency gifts .
I favored opening the boxes , taking a shower , and using the towels to dry off .
There was actually a surprising amount of debate over what we should do with those boxes .
Eventually something strange happened — my wife agreed with me .
So we opened the boxes to take a look at our new towels .
Except it turns out that they were n’t towels at all .
They were bathrobes with the Westin name embroidered on them .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
I appreciate those Westin bathrobes , but we ’re still missing two of our best towels .
Instead we have two new bathrobes that say “ Westin Tokyo ” .
That way we ’ll always know where we lost our towels .
I suspect this story will have at least one more chapter .
I ’m expecting a special delivery package from Japan any day now .
Office users will get more options for the way they save files
The initiative covers the Word , Excel and PowerPoint programs from the Office software suite .
The prototype of the first tool to translate between formats will be made available as a free download on 6 July .
Microsoft said it started building the software tools in response to requests from government customers .
File style
Every PC user knows how careful they have to be when moving important files around because of the incompatibilities between different programs , such as word processors , that do the same job .
Saving a file in a format in one program can make it difficult to open in another , without sacrificing some of the way that the information in the file is laid out or formatted
Both Microsoft and the broader technology industry have been working to remove some of these problems by standardising the ways information is saved so it appears the same when opened by different programs .
This tool promises to be a very significant development in the trend towards practical open document standards
Andrew Hopkirk , National Computing Centre , UK
Before now , Microsoft and the technology world have chosen to go their own ways .
The new initiative ends some of this diversity and will make it possible for anyone using programs in the Office software suite to save files in more so - called " open " formats .
Specifically , the tools will make it possible to save and work with files using the Open Document format - a specification developed by the open source community as an alternative to the proprietary formats used by large software firms .
Microsoft has been working towards a more open way of formatting documents based around the Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) .
This helps preserve the structure of data in a document , such as a spreadsheet , so that relationships between figures are preserved as they are opened in different programs or used for other purposes .
" This tool promises to be a very significant development in the trend towards practical open document standards and , critically , customer - friendly means to move between them , " said Andrew Hopkirk , director of the UK's National Computing Centre 's e-Government Interoperability Framework ( e - GIF ) programme , in a Microsoft statement .
Some of the free tools will be add-ins for older versions of the programs in the Office suite , said Microsoft .
Prototypes of the translation tools will be made available via the SourceForge website which allows anyone to participate in the software development process .
The Microsoft - led project is being carried out with three other companies - French firm Clever Age , Aztecsoft in India and Dialogika in Germany .
I just heard about Papert 's tragic accident .
Thankfully , what I am reading suggests that his condition is improving .
Papert is the father of the Logo programming language which , apart from being the first programming language I learned , is one of the most important attempts to use computers , and programming in particular , in education .
Flowers for Seymour is an attempt to create a virutal flower album to provide emotional support for Papert and his family .
This is a nice gesture , and I hope the LtU community will contribute to it .
The album includes only a few flower images created in Logo , which is a shame .
It would be nice to see more images created using the wonderful tool Papert gave us .
Our prayers are with Seymour Papert and his family .
Scientists have used silicon crystals to trap light and slow it down to the lowest speed ever recorded in the material .
The breakthrough is a step towards light - based storage for quantum computers .
Researchers at Japanese telco NTT used man-made photonic crystals , which contain nanoscale holes , to achieve the feat .
The cavity which controlled the light was less than ten millionths of a metre long .
The photon - trapping set - up slowed the light down to just 5.8 kilometres per second - 50,000 times less than the speed of light in a vacuum - by actually trapping it in the cavity for a nanosecond .
Last year , a team at Harvard " froze light " to demonstrate how photons could be used to bear information in an optical computer , replacing electrons .
The Japanese research adds the ability to trap them for RAM - style memory .
The power to control light is seen as a key development for quantum information and communication , which promises a step change in computing power because of the greater number of states a quantum information carrier can take than in current simple electron - driven microprocessors .
Current early applications of quantum information technology centre around cryptography .
More here .
The research is due to be reported in the January edition of the journal Nature Photonics . ®

Circumcision may offer Africa AIDS hope / Procedure linked to much lower rate of new HIV infections
French and South African AIDS researchers have called an early halt to a study of adult male circumcision to reduce HIV infection after initial results reportedly showed that men who had the procedure dramatically lowered their risk of contracting the virus .
The study 's preliminary results , disclosed Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal , showed that circumcision reduced the risk of contracting HIV by 70 percent -- a level of protection far better than the 30 percent risk reduction set as a target for an AIDS vaccine .
According to the newspaper account , the study under way in Orange Farm township , South Africa , was stopped because the results were so favorable .
It was deemed unethical to continue the trial after an early peek at data showed that the uncircumcised men were so much more likely to become infected .
All of the men in the study had been followed for a year , and half the men had been followed for the full 21 months called for in the original study design , according to the Wall Street Journal , which obtained a draft copy of the study .
Begun in August 2002 , the experiment is one of three closely watched clinical trials in Africa to determine whether there is scientific merit to nearly three dozen less rigorously controlled studies showing that circumcised men were much less likely to become HIV - positive .
The hope is that , lacking a vaccine , the nearly 5 million new HIV infections occurring each year could be slowed by circumcision , the surgical removal of the foreskin -- a simple , low - cost and permanent medical intervention that is a common but controversial cultural practice in much of the world .
In Africa , about 70 percent of men are circumcised at birth or during rite - of - passage ceremonies in early puberty .
Medical anthropologists began noticing as early as 1989 that the highest rates of HIV infection in Africa were occurring in regions of the continent where the predominant tribal or religious cultures did not practice circumcision .
Adult HIV infection rates above 30 percent are found in Zimbabwe , Botswana , Swaziland and eastern South Africa , where circumcision is not practiced ; yet HIV infection rates remain below 5 percent in West Africa and other parts of the continent where circumcision is commonplace .
Laboratory studies have found that the foreskin is rich in white blood cells , which are favored targets of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS .
So the theory is that men who are uncircumcised are much more likely to contract the virus during sex with an infected woman , and that the epidemic spreads when these newly infected men have sex with other women within their network of sexual partners .
The lead investigators of the study , Dr. Bertran Auvert of the University of Paris and Adrian Puren of South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases , are not talking .
The results were expected to be discussed at an AIDS conference in Rio de Janeiro in three weeks .
But word about the findings has been circulating among researchers searching for ways to slow the epidemic .
" I would be thrilled if it works , but we will also need the results of other trials , " said Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Ronald Gray , who is conducting , in Uganda , one of two other controlled clinical trials of male circumcision .
Gray 's trial , which has completed enrollment of 5,000 men in the Rakai district of Uganda , is not scheduled to end until 2007 .
A third trial , under way in Kisumu , Kenya , is still enrolling its quota of 2,700 volunteers and is also expected to be completed in 2007 , according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which is sponsoring it .
All three trials were designed to compare the HIV infection rates of two groups of HIV - negative men , one - half of whom would agree to be circumcised , the other to be offered only counseling on AIDS prevention .
The studies were designed to show whether or not circumcision provided a statistically significant protective effect of at least 50 percent .
The South African study -- if the results are confirmed -- suggests that the level of protection afforded is even higher .
Although the apparent protective effect of circumcision has been noted for more than 20 years , doubts linger as to whether circumcision itself is protective , or whether the lower risk may be the result of cultural practices among those who circumcise .
HIV rates are low in Muslim communities , for example , which practice male circumcision but also engage in ritual washing before sex and frown on promiscuity .
Virtually since the Internet ’s creation , its most devoted protectors have been wondering how long it would take for the forces of unrestrained commerce to throttle its freedom and innovation .
Now they have a date :
Some people believe the breakpoint will come as early as Jan. 6 , 2008 .
That ’s when the telecommunications marriage of Verizon Communications and MCI marks its second anniversary and sheds an important restriction imposed by the Federal Communications Commission when it approved the deal in November : a requirement that Verizon comply with the principle known as “ network neutrality ” for two years following the completion of its acquisition .
( The FCC imposed the same provision on SBC Communications and AT&T . ;
But their deal closed in December , so the restriction expires a couple of weeks sooner . )
Absent network neutrality , network operators could dictate to customers which Internet services they could access , and at what quality .
Customers of Apple ’s iTunes music store , say , might find their downloads slowed down , or blocked completely , if Apple refuses to pay a transaction fee to their ISP .
Users of the Vonage Internet phone service might lose their dial tones if their Internet provider wants to sell its own brand of phone service .
The Internet might become more profitable for network providers , and less useful for everybody else .

Under the traditional network model , it ’s none of your ISP ’s business whether you ’re using your connection to view video streams , buy music or make phone calls .
There are only a handful of exceptions , such as actions aimed at containing spam , blocking illegal activity or maintaining the network ’s integrity .
Many in the Web community argue that keeping the network open has been the key to the development of new services .
“ When you introduce discrimination of any kind , it ’s anti-innovative , ” says David Isenberg , a networking pioneer who is currently a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University .
If service providers are charged for preferential transmission , new services that ca n’t afford the fee might be kept out of the marketplace .
The old model , however , is threatened by some recent developments .

One is the consolidation of broadband Internet providers .
Almost all U.S. customers with high - speed Web access get it via high - speed cable TV connections or DSLs offered by phone companies .
But the two largest cable firms , Comcast and Time Warner , control nearly 60 % of their market , and the two largest phone companies , AT&T ; and Verizon , boasted a combined market share of more than 60 % before the recent acquisitions increased their size , according to figures from the consulting firm Kagan Research .
Eventually , customers unhappy with their high - speed service may find themselves without alternatives .
Courts and regulators , meanwhile , are taking a powder .
The Supreme Court last year cleared the way for liberalized regulation of cable Internet service , and the FCC responded by taking the same position on DSL .
Consequently , the battle has shifted to Congress , where critics of the phone and cable companies are trying to prevent a provision protecting network neutrality from being deleted from a revision of telecommunication law currently under consideration .
“ Two years ago , everybody called this a solution in search of a problem , ” says Chris Murray , a Washington - based lobbyist for Vonage .
“ Now everybody sees it as a predicate for allowing deregulation . ”
As it happens , Vonage customers were the victims of the only case of interference yet to draw FCC action -- the blocking of its phone service last year by Madison River Communications , a small North Carolina ISP .
The FCC fined Madison River $ 15,000 .

Neutrality supporters were also unnerved when SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre complained that popular Web services were essentially freeloading on his network .
“ For a Google or a Yahoo or a Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes for free is nuts ! ” he groused to BusinessWeek in November .
Whitacre , who is chairman of AT&T ; , evidently overlooked the charges paid by Web services for the bandwidth they consume , as well as connection fees paid by consumers .
An AT&T ; spokesman says Whitacre was simply arguing that AT&T ; is spending so heavily to build a high - capacity network that it needs new sources of revenue to help cover the cost .
“ AT&T ; is not going to block access to any service or degrade customer service in any way , shape , or form , ” James Cicconi , the company ’s executive vice president for external affairs , told me .
But he says AT&T ; should n’t be barred from selling premium treatment to any service wishing to get digital bits
to customers faster than its rivals .
Critics of this viewpoint say that allowing network providers to offer such preferential treatment leaves the system open to abuse :
What would stop AT&T ; , which owns the broadband phone service CallVantage , from degrading Vonage ’s service to make its own seem better ?
Vonage customers whose calls suddenly sounded lousy would be inclined to blame Vonage and move their business to AT&T ; instead .
( To be sure , AT&T ; has n’t been accused of such activity . )

It ’s by no means clear that the phone and cable companies will win the coming battle on Capitol Hill , as well - equipped with lobbyists and war chests as they are .
Vonage , EBay , Google , Amazon.com and other online companies have launched their own joint lobbying effort to oppose them .
The Internet ’s very future may hang in the balance .
“ Now that the e-commerce companies have weighed in , Congress will have to take a look , ” says Mark Cooper , director of research for the Consumer Federation of America and a firm believer in the value of network neutrality .
“ These are the brand names of the 21st century . ”

Perelman 's proof has caused a sensation
Grigory Perelman 's proof of the century - old Poincare Conjecture has caused a sensation , and not just because of the brilliance of the work .
In August , the Russian became the first person to turn down a Fields Medal , the highest honour in mathematics .
He also seems likely to turn down a $ 1 m prize offered by a US maths institute .
Dr Perelman is said to despise self - promotion and describes himself as isolated from the rest of the mathematical community .
The best piece of mathematics we have seen in the last 10 years
Terence Tao , UCLA
Terence Tao , professor of mathematics at the University of California , Los Angeles , called Perelman 's result " the best piece of mathematics we have seen in the last 10 years " .
Timofey Shilkin , a former colleague of Perelman at the Steklov Mathematics Institute in St Petersburg , Russia , told BBC News : " He definitely deserves the Fields Medal - that is my personal opinion .
I am completely sure he is a genius . "
' Excellent mathematician '
He added : " I 'm afraid he is quite a self - enclosed person .
We know about him approximately the same as you know - not too much .
" I met him when he was a member of our group and our contacts were about once a week , but we had only short discussions .
Grigory Perelman shuns the spotlight
The reclusive Dr Perelman left the Steklov Institute in January , and was last said to be unemployed and living with his mother in her apartment in St Petersburg .
For several years he worked , for the most part , alone on the Poincare Conjecture .
Then , in 2002 , he posted on the internet the first of three papers outlining a proof of the problem .
The Poincare is a central question in topology , the study of the geometrical properties of objects that do not change when they are stretched , distorted or shrunk .
The surface of the Earth is what topology describes as a two - dimensional sphere .
If one were to encircle it with a lasso of string , it could be pulled tight to a point .
On the surface of a doughnut , however , a lasso passing through the hole in the centre cannot be shrunk to a point without cutting through the surface .
Checking the work
Since the 19th Century , mathematicians have known that the surface of a sphere is the only enclosed two - dimensional space with this property ; but they were uncertain about objects with more dimensions .
The Poincare Conjecture says that a three - dimensional sphere is the only enclosed three - dimensional space with no holes .
Proof of the Conjecture eluded mathematicians until Perelman posted his work on the website arXiv.org .
This is a so - called pre-print server , where researchers upload study papers for informal feedback before they submit them to a peer - reviewed journal .
Feuding within the mathematical community now threatens to overshadow Dr Perelman 's achievement .
The Russian had detailed a way to kick down the roadblock that had stymied a solution to the problem .
It was then up to others to check his proof .
It was at this stage of the process - when mathematicians pored over Perelman 's work to assess its accuracy - that much bad feeling started to rise to the surface .
' Complete proof '
In 2005 , a Chinese team consisting of Huai - Dong Cao of Lehigh University and Xi-Ping Zhu of Zhongshan University published what they claimed was " the first written account of a complete proof of the Poincare Conjecture " .
Cao and Zhu took on the task of checking Perelman 's proof at the behest of their mentor Shing - Tung Yau , a Chinese - born professor of mathematics at Harvard University , US .
2006 saw progress in understanding Neanderthal DNA ( Copyright : Natural History Museum )
This drew the ire of others in the field , who said that Yau 's promotion of his proteges ' work went too far .
In a rare interview , Perelman told the New Yorker magazine : " It is not clear to me what new contribution did they make . "
However , speaking to the New York Times newspaper in October , Professor
Yau denied having said there were gaps in Dr Perelman 's work .
Science magazine also named its " breakdown " of the year : the scandal involving South Korean cloning pioneer Hwang Woo-suk , whose report of the production of stem cells from a cloned human embryo was found to have been faked .

The leader of Bracknell Forest BC has suggested people who allow their data to be sold to marketing firms could receive council tax cuts .
Paul Bettison told a Conservative party conference fringe meeting that the information from the council 's smartcard system could be sold if controls on government databases were loosened .
" If I could use the information on the 45,000 residents who carry cards , I believe I could be the first council in the country to have a zero council tax , " Bettison , e-champion of the Local Government Association ( LGA ) , told the Conservative Technology Forum on 2 October .
Such use of the data gathered through the E+ cards , previously known as Edge smartcards , would be voluntary for residents – but for those who did not wish to take part , " it will be £ 1,400 for a band D " , Bettison said .
He added that the data held by the council , such as library books borrowed , indications of income and family , could allow companies to target direct mail with enough accuracy to stop it being annoying , as it would present people with offers that were of genuine interest .
" Targeted junk mail is n't junk mail , " he said .
" It 's welcome if it 's relevant to me . "
Bettison said the council has received just three expressions of concern about the security of the data collected by the smartcards – but added that people trusted local authorities much more than central government .
" There 's nothing more benign than your local council , " he said .
He added that he had offered a government minister the use of the E+ system as national identity cards for Bracknell Forest residents , to save money .
" The cost of our card is £ 4 , " he said , adding that the high projected cost of the national identity card was due to the interview process .
Following the meeting , Bracknell Forest BC issued a statement saying it had no plans to follow up the idea and that it was careful to abide by the terms of the Data Protection Act .
Vincent Paliczka , director of environmant and leisure , said : " Bracknell Forest Borough Council follows the strict guidelines set out by the Data Protection Act when issuing e+ cards and exactly follows residents ' instructions regarding who may have access to the data they provide to us .
We have no plans to use private information for commercial benefit .
" For the avoidance of doubt , it would require the explicit permission of significant numbers of individual card holders before we could even consider such a development .
If this were to ever materialise , the authority given to us by residents would clearly signify a mutually beneficial arrangement . "

There are a lot of options in the Free UNIX market at the moment .
Everyone 's favorite buzzword is Linux , and Sun is in the process of releasing Solaris under a Free Software license .
One family , however , receives less attention than it is due .
Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) has grown into almost a complete replacement for UNIX , with numerous enhancements .
David Chisnall explains why the BSD family has found its way into a large number of systems and what these systems can do for you .

There are a lot of options in the Free UNIX market at the moment .
Everyone ’s favorite buzzword is Linux , and Sun is in the process of releasing Solaris under a Free Software license .
One family , however , receives less attention than it is due .
On March 9 , 1978 , the University of California at Berkeley released a set of patches to the Sixth Edition of the UNIX Timesharing System .
These patches were licensed very permissively — you could do pretty much anything with them , but you had to state that a product that used them did so .
The advertising clause was later dropped , and any distribution in source or binary form was allowed , providing the copyright notice was retained .
The name of this patch set was the Berkeley Software Distribution — BSD for short — and it gradually grew into almost a complete replacement for UNIX , with numerous enhancements .
A few years later , the owners of the UNIX original copyright decided to try to cash in on their system ’s success , and sued UCB .
The upshot was a small number of files containing original UNIX code were rewritten , and a completely unencumbered version of BSD — UNIX being dropped from the name for trademark reasons .
In the early ’90s , Intel released a microprocessor that was capable of running a real operating system .
The Intel 386 included features such as support for paged virtual memory , so it became a potential target for running BSD .
In 1991 , Bill Jolitz released 386 BSD and then neglected the project .
A group of people , frustrated by the difficulty of getting patches accepted to 386 BSD , began distributing a patch set and then a complete system known as FreeBSD .
At about the same time , BSD Networking Release / 2 ( one of the last releases by UCB ) was adopted by a group known as NetBSD .
While the FreeBSD team focused on supporting the Intel 386 , the NetBSD team was keen to retain the portable nature of the original BSD code .
In 1995 , a clash of personalities lead to one of the NetBSD core developers , Theo De Raadt , forking the project and creating OpenBSD .
OpenBSD , being based in Canada , was not subject to the stringent export laws that the USA placed on cryptography at the time , and so became a popular operating system among the security - conscious .
This lead to a thorough code review , which found a large number of bugs and security holes in the code imported from NetBSD .
This code review is an ongoing part of the OpenBSD development process and allows them to boast an excellent security record .
Over the years , BSD code has found its way into a large number of systems .
Many commercial UNIX variants began as forks of BSD code , and a BSD TCP / IP stack was used in earlier versions of Windows .
BSD was also very popular in academia .
One project , the Mach Microkernel at CMU , used a modified version of BSD to run UNIX programs .
The Mach project was used by a company called NeXT as the foundation for their operating system .
When NeXT was bought by Apple , a lot of the old BSD code was replaced with code from the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects .
Mac OS
X can be thought of as a close cousin to the BSD family :
Although it uses Mach as an abstraction layer , much of the kernel is BSD - derived .
It is worth noting that the BSDs are complete systems .
Linux is just a kernel , and to be useful it is usually combined with the GNU userland .
The BSDs include their own userland — although some parts , such as the compiler , are imported from the GNU project .
A BSD system can be installed with no third - party applications — and work .
It is more common , however , to add additional packages such as X.org and a desktop environment ( the same applications traditionally run atop Linux ) .
The FreeBSD project underwent some radical changes between versions 4 and 5 .
Much of the kernel was redesigned to better support multiprocessor systems .
One developer , Matt Dillon , was unhappy with the direction it was going , so he set up Dragonfly BSD , a fork of FreeBSD 4 .
While FreeBSD 5 and later use a system of shared resources and locks , Dragonfly BSD uses message passing between concurrent threads — a process common on microkernel operating systems including Amiga OS ( where Matt Dillon first made a name for himself ) .
Dragonfly BSD is designed as a cluster operating system , and should be able to be installed on a cluster of machines , presenting the appearance of a single large multiprocessor machine to end users .
FreeBSD
FreeBSD is the most popular of the BSD family .
It is traditionally known for stability and performance .
Many web servers are still around running versions of FreeBSD from years ago without a reboot .
FreeBSD is developed in three branches : - CURRENT , -STABLE , and - RELEASE .
Anything new is added to - CURRENT , which may or may not work at any given time .
Once a new feature has undergone testing by the development team , it is added to - STABLE .
Periodically , a release is created .
These releases have a version number and their own branch in the CVS tree .
Only bug fixes are allowed to be introduced into - RELEASE branches — no new features .
This makes tracking a - RELEASE branch the thing to do if you want a completely stable system .
FreeBSD development underwent something of a hiccup around version 5 .
The release schedule was feature - based , and a large number of new features were planned .
Gradually , the release date for FreeBSD 5 slipped farther and farther back .
During this time , the project moved to the same six - month release schedule as NetBSD and OpenBSD .
The current release version is 6.0 , which is the system used on the laptop on which this article is being written .
The 5.x series was highly ambitious and the lack of immediate success gave it a reputation for being unstable and slow — the lack of speed coming from the large quantities of debugging code found in releases .
The 6.x series is intended to avoid the stigma associated with the 5.x series .
One of the most noticeable improvements is the new scheduler , known as ULE .
ULE is not enabled by default because it does not achieve quite as good throughput as the traditional 4BSD scheduler , making it worse for server roles .
For desktop ( or laptop ) use , it is much better .
ULE prioritizes processes that spend most of their time waiting : interactive processes .
On this somewhat aging laptop , it is possible to do a large compile in the background without any loss of responsiveness in X applications .
Installation of third - party software is done using the ports system .
Each port is a Makefile , containing the files that must be downloaded to build the program and a set of patches to make it run on FreeBSD .
The ports system will automatically resolve dependencies when installing programs .
Every port can be compiled into a binary package , and there are copies available from the FreeBSD FTP mirrors ( although they often lag behind the port version by several days ) .
For the few closed - source programs that require Linux , FreeBSD includes a Linux ABI compatibility layer , which translates system call vectors into their equivalent on FreeBSD .
It also includes a Linux - style / proc file system for programs that depend on it .
Shared libraries used by Linux programs can also be installed — the ports tree contains copies of the basic packages found in several popular Linux distributions .
FreeBSD has a couple of features that make it attractive for home users .
First , nVidia release graphics drivers for it , giving it the same level of 3D acceleration available to Linux on nVidia hardware .
Second , it includes Project Evil , a reimplementation of the NDIS driver API used by wireless networking cards on Windows , allowing many WiFi cards to be used without direct hardware support .
Project Evil is also being ported to NetBSD , which also has Linux ABI support .
Note that ABI support is not full emulation .
All UNIX systems have a set of system calls — functions handled by the kernel — which are all assigned numbers .
These numbers and the system call arguments vary depending on the kernel .
The ABI compatibility layer simply remaps the arguments and changes the number , giving almost no performance penalty — in some cases , even faster performance than native due to a better kernel implementation .
Linux is not the only non-native ABI supported by these systems —
NetBSD even includes a rudimentary Darwin ABI that allows some OS X applications to run .
A stroke that destroyed parts of a drug addict 's globus pallidus ( pale areas ) left him depressed but ended his addiction .
Neither drugs nor ( alas ) wine gave him pleasure any longer .
You do n't see this every day :
Jake atdraws due attention to an incredible case report in the American Journal of Psychiatry showing that a lesion in a patient 's brain cured the patient 's drug addiction , apparently by knocking out the reward circuit that made the addiction pleasurable .
( It also made the man badly depressed . )
The article , unfortunately , is pay - per-view , but Jake 's summary is compelling on its own .
To whit :
A 34 - year old long - time drug - user is taken to the ER after he starts acting freaky at a party .
He has a bunch of methadone ( an opiate like heroin ) with him that he downs on the way in to avoid detection .
He proceeds to OD .
There are areas of the brain called watershed regions .
These are areas in the brain where the blood supply of the major arteries is at its sparsest -- at the overlapping edges of two arteries .
When you overdose , you sometimes have strokes in these regions ....
This gets us to the really interesting part .
When the guy comes to , he has something called anhedonia .
Anhedonia is one of the symptoms of depression .
It is the inability to feel joy .
More interestingly , he ALSO has lost his drug addiction .
After this overdose , Mr. A became acutely depressed .. [ with ] anhedonia , low energy , difficulties concentrating and remembering , feelings of hopelessness and guilt , poor self - esteem , social isolation , increased sleep , and a 20 - lb weight gain over the ensuing year .
He reported the disappearance of drug cravings and remained abstinent from all recreational drugs other than an occasional glass of wine with dinner .
He reported that he no longer experienced pleasure from drinking alcohol .
Four serial urine toxicology screens were negative over 6 months .
I thought I would point out this article because it is a very compelling case showing the parallels between lab science and medicine .
Neurology is unfortunately often a science where you need cases like this to prove that we are not totally off base with how we think the brain works .
Quite incredible , and a delicious case study .

I recently had a requirement to create a proof - of - concept " what - if " calculator for a new product I 'm involved in which will launch in the first quarter of next year .
Now , I prefer to write web - based applications because I hate supporting multiple operating systems and client versions ( yes , I 'm aware that different browsers behave differently , but there are a number of toolkits out there that solve most of those problems ) .
However , this calculator required some pretty graphs ( for non-techie types ) and I did n't want to go to the effort of writing and deploying a server - based application for a simple calculator .
I went searching and I found there has been some work recently in the realm of browser - based graphics ( either SVG or the Canvas tag ) but , as with most new things , different browsers handled different things , well , differently .
So I searched a little more and found a library called PlotKit which not only wrapped up the different graphics libraries ( through a Google 's ExplorerCanvas ) , but it also provides a ready - to - use graphing library .
Web - based development is becoming increasingly more powerful and I think we will continue to see the trend towards web - based applications continuing .
Long live the browser !
SPIELBERG CONFUSED BY DECREASE IN UFO SIGHTINGSOscar - winning director STEVEN SPIELBERG is baffled that fewer UFO sightings are made now than were made twenty years ago - because the technology to record would - be aliens is so commonplace today .
The 59 - year - old film - maker has made a string of alien - themed movies - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , ET : THE EXTRA - TERRESTRIAL and WAR OF THE WORLDS - and is disappointed it seems he 'll never get the chance to see evidence of a UFO himself .
Spielberg says , " There are millions of video cameras out there and they 're picking up less videos of UFOs , alleged UFOs , than we picked up in the 1970s and 1980s .
There 's 150 per cent more cameras , so why are we getting less from up there ?
" I think that we all know that we 're not alone in the universe .
I can't imagine that we are the only intelligent biological life form out there .
I 'm a little less sure in my fifties that I was in my late twenties whether we 're actually ever going to find out . "

This is an update on my Faster than the speed of binary search entry .
Maybe it would be good to refresh your memory before proceeding , brave reader ...
Last time I promised some hard data for multi-GB files .
Finally , I had some time to do the measurements .
I was doing the usual space & time profiling ( we are talking about 30 - 60 minute execution times here so each 10 % helps a lot ) and this was a natural extension of tests .
Sadly ( from the viewpoint of a perspective author that introduced the improved binary search algorithm into the application ) I have redesigned the most time - consuming part of our app and the biggest list ( requiring most lookups ) is not used anymore .
Therefore , numbers are not so large as I expected three months ago .
Data is still interesting , especially as the analysis exposed two anomalous cases .
Let 's first take a look at a ' normal ' case .
The list had between 1.596,266 and 1.803,027 entries ( lists are live and in this case entries were removed from the list during the execution ) and program executed 171,191 searches .
Standard binary search needed 20.8 rounds ( bisection steps ) to resolve search query on average while my ' bias ' version needed only 6.7 rounds .
A more detailed distribution of number of rounds is shown in the following graph .
All good and well then , but this was exactly the situation for which the algorithm was designed .
Let 's take a look at the first anomalous case , where biased search exhibits really bad behaviour .
As you can see , the list had from 0 to 37,300 entries ( 0 at beginning ) and there were 37,301 searches .
In fact , each addition to the list was followed by a search request which always found the result somewhere in last 30 entries .
Standard binary search needed 13.9 rounds on average while biased version needed 13.5 rounds , which is almost the same ( and is in fact slower due to the slower inner loop of the biased version ) .
The distribution of rounds in biased search is also weird .
It must either be a bug in the algorithm or a weird data pattern .
It turned out to be the latter .
In this case , the list contained data in clusters with big differences between each cluster .
Something like this list with 40 entries : 1 , 2 , 3 ... 20 , 1.000,000 1.000,001 .. 1.000,019 ( notice the big jump between 20 and 1.000,000 ) .
Even worse , the code tries to find smallest number ( or a number very close to it ) in last cluster ( 1.000,000 in this case ) .
My biased version first sets lower and upper bound of the search and then calculates the bias ( 1000000 - 1 ) / ( 1000019 - 1 ) , which is in this case 0.999981 or almost 1 [ see the code in previous article ] .
That causes selected ' midpoint ' to be equal to the higher bound - 1 . Search loop is then repeated , bias is almost the same and upper bound is again reduced by 1 .
This repeats until upper bound reaches the element we are searching for .
As you 've seen , the search degrades to a simple linear search ( with complicated calculations behind ) in this case .
Which is good when we want to find the last element ( that happens when last cluster has only one element ) or a element very much near the end of the list ( when last cluster is small ) , but degrades quite badly when last cluster is large .
The second anomalous case is actually a special case of the first one , but in this case the cluster was always just one element big .
In other words , the code always searched for the largest value in the list .
In this case , biased search almost always retrieved the correct number in the first attempt , which is significantly faster than the standard binary search ( 16.5 rounds on average ) .
So what can we do to improve the situation ?
One way is to add a special search mode for my ' weird ' data , but I really dislike this idea , as I do n't know what kind of data will be passed to my ( fairly generic ) classes in the future .
Another idea was to limit the maximum bias .
In standard binary search , the bias is always 0.5 ( midpoint between low and high bound ) while in the problematic case the bias is almost 1 .
If we limit the maximum bias to , say , 0.9 , the code never degenerates into linear search .
When such clamping is applied , first anomalous case behaves much better ( average number of rounds has been reduced to 8.2 ) .
That 's fine , but how would that change affect the other two cases ?
The ' normal ' case behaves worse than before ( average number of rounds went from 6.7 to 9.6 ) .
That could be acceptable , but in the second anomalous case the number of rounds increases almost by factor 6 .
It 's clear that this simple solution indeed improves the worst case but degrades all other searches by a noticeable amount .
I had other ideas on how to improve the search algorithm but at the end I left it as it is now ( the ' bias ' version ) .
After all , in the worst case biased search still makes less rounds than standard search ; in the normal case , biased search works as expected and in the best case , biased search works much much better than the standard search .
I hope that I made my point clear - always , but really always analyse the program behaviour on real data , not on test cases .
The other point that is not so obvious is - Excel 2007 charting capabilities rock :) algorithms , searching , binary search , profiling Technorati tags : Delphi

Jason Itzler , the self - anointed world ’s greatest escort - agency owner , prepared to get down on his knees .
When a man was about to ask for the hand of a woman in holy matrimony , especially the hand of the fabulous Natalia , America ’s No. 1 escort , he should get down on his knees .
This was how Jason , who has always considered himself nothing if not “ ultraromantic , ” saw it .
However , as he slid from his grade - school - style red plastic seat in preparation to kneel , the harsh voice of a female Corrections officer broke the mood , ringing throughout the dank visitor ’s room .
“ Sit back down , ” said the large uniformed woman .
“ You know the rules . ”
Such are the obstacles to true love when one is incarcerated at Rikers Island , where Jason Itzler , 38 and still boyishly handsome in his gray Department of Corrections jumpsuit , has resided since the cops shut down his megaposh NY Confidential agency in January .
There was also the matter of the ring .
During the glorious summer and fall of 2004 , when NY Confidential was grossing an average of $ 25,000 a night at its 5,000 - square - foot loft at 79 Worth Street , spitting distance from the municipal courts and Bloomberg ’s priggish City Hall , Jason would have purchased a diamond with enough carats to blow the eye loupe off a 47th Street Hasid .
That was when Itzler filled his days with errands like stopping by Soho Gem on West Broadway to drop $ 6,500 on little trinkets for Natalia and his other top escorts .
This might be followed by a visit to Manolo Blahnik to buy a dozen pairs of $ 500 footwear .
By evening , Itzler could be found at Cipriani , washing down plates of crushed lobster with yet another bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue label and making sure everyone got one of his signature titanium business cards engraved with NY Confidential ’s singular motto : ROCKET FUEL FOR WINNERS .
But now Jason was charged with various counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance , money laundering , and promoting prostitution .
His arrest was part of a large effort by the NYPD and the D.A. ’s office against New York ’s burgeoning Internet - based escort agencies .
In three months , police had shut down American Beauties , Julie’s , and the far - flung New York Elites , a concern the cops said was flying porn stars all over the country for dates .
Reeling , pros were declaring the business “ holocausted ” as girls took down their Websites and worried johns stayed home .
Many blamed Itzler for the heat .
In a business where discretion is supposed to be key , Jason was more than a loose cannon .
Loose A - bomb was more like it .
He took out giant NY Confidential ads in mainstream magazines ( the one you ’re holding included ) .
In restaurants , he ’d get loud and identify himself , Howard Stern style , as “ the King of All Pimps . ”
Probably most fatally , Itzler was quoted in the Post as bragging that he did n’t worry about the police because “ I have cops on my side . ”
After that , one vice guy said , “ it was like he was daring us . ”
Only days before , Itzler , attired in a $ 5,700 full - length fox coat from Jeffrey , bought himself a Mercedes S600 .
Now the car , along with much of the furniture at Jason ’s lair , including the $ 50,000 sound system on which he blared , 24/7 , the music of his Rat Pack idol , Frank Sinatra , had been confiscated by the cops .
His assets frozen , unable to make his $ 250,000 bail , Jason could n’t even buy a phone card , much less get Natalia a ring .
“ Where am I going to get a ring in here ? ” Jason said to Natalia on the phone the other night .
He suggested perhaps Natalia might get the ring herself and then slip it to him when she came to visit .
“ That ’s good , Jason , ” returned Natalia .
“ I buy the ring , give it to you , you kiss it , give it back to me , and I pretend to be surprised . ”
“ Something like that , ” Jason replied , sheepishly .
“ You know I love you . ”
That much seemed true .
As Jason does n’t mind telling you , he has known many women since he lost his virginity not too long after his bar mitzvah at the Fort Lee Community Jewish Center , doing the deed with the captain of the Tenafly High School cheerleader squad .
Since then , Jason , slight and five foot nine , says he ’s slept with “ over 700 women , ” a figure he admits pales before the 20,000 women basketball star Wilt “ The Stilt ” Chamberlain claimed to have bedded .
But , as Jason says , “ you could say I am a little pickier than him . ”
Of these 700 women , Jason has been engaged to nine , two of whom he married .
“ It was really only one and a half , ” Itzler reports , saying that while living in Miami ’s South Beach he married “ this hot Greek girl .
She was gorgeous .
The first thing I did was buy her this great boob job , which immediately transformed her from a tremendous A / B look to an out - of - sight C/D look .
But her parents totally freaked out .
So I got the marriage annulled . ”

This aside , not counting his sainted late mother , Jason says Natalia , 25 , about five foot three and perhaps 100 pounds soaking wet , reigns as the love of his life .
Without Natalia , she of the smoldering brown eyes that have excited who knows how many hedge - fund managers , billionaire trust - fund babies , and NFL quarterbacks , Jason would never have been able to build NY Confidential into the sub rosa superhotness it became .
It was Natalia who got top dollar , as much as $ 2,000 an hour , with a two - hour minimum .
In the history of Internet escorting , no one ever matched Natalia ’s ratings on TheEroticReview.com , the Zagat ’s of the escort - for - hire industry .
On TER , “ hobbyists , ” as those with the “ hobby ” of frequenting escorts are called — men with screen names like Clint Dickwood , Smelly Smegma , and William Jefferson Clinton — can write reviews of the “ providers ” they see , rating them on a scale of 1 to 10 for both “ appearance ” and “ performance . ”
In 2004 , Natalia recorded an unprecedented seventeen straight 10/10s .
On the TER ratings scale , a 10 was defined as “ one in a lifetime . ” Natalia was the Perfect 10 , the queen of the escort world .
“ Yo! Pimp Juice ! … that her ? ”
It was Psycho , a large tattooed Dominican ( psycho was stenciled on his neck in Gothic lettering ) who was referring to Jason by his jailhouse nickname .
Itzler nodded .
There was no need to gloat .
Moments before , Jason scanned the grim visiting room .
“ Just making sure I ’ve got the hottest chick in the room . ”
Like it was any contest , Natalia sitting there , in her little calfskin jacket and leather miniskirt , thick auburn hair flowing over her narrow shoulders .
Besides , half of Rikers already knew about Jason and NY Confidential .
They ’d read , or heard about , the articles Itzler had piped to his pulp enablers at “ Page Six , ” including how he could get “ $ 250,000 an hour for Paris Hilton with a four - hour minimum . ”
But you could n’t believe everything you read in the New York Post , even at Rikers .
Natalia ’s presence was proof .
Proof that Jason , a little Jewish guy who still sported a nasty black eye from being beaten silly in his sleep by some skell inmate , was n’t full of shit when he told the homeys that he was the biggest pimp in the city , that he got all the best girls .
How many other Rikers fools could get the Perfect 10 to visit them , at nine o’clock in the morning , too ?
“ Psycho … Natalia , ” Jason said .
“ Natalia … Psycho . ”
“ Hey , ” Natalia said with an easy smile .
She was , after all , a girl you could take anywhere .
One minute she could be the slinkiest cat on the hot tin roof , wrapping her dancer ’s body ( she was the tap - dance champion of Canada in 1996 ) around a client ’s body in a hotel elevator .
Then , when the door slid open , she ’d look classic , like a wife even , on the arm of a Wall Street CEO or Asian electronics magnate .
She was an actress , had played Shakespeare and Off Broadway both .
Ever the ingénue , she ’d been Juliet half a dozen times .
Playing opposite Jason ’s however - out - of - luck Romeo was no sweat , even here , in jail .
Not that Natalia had exactly been looking forward to coming to Rikers this raw late - spring morning .
Riding in the bus over the bridge from East Elmhurst , freezing in her lace stockings as she sat beside a stocky black man in a Jerome Bettis jersey , she looked out the window at the looming prison and said , “ Wal - Mart must have had a two - for - one on barbed wire . ”
It was n’t that she did n’t miss Jason , or the heyday of when they lived together at 79 Worth Street , the harem stylings of which came to Jason while getting his hair cut at the Casbah - themed Warren Tricomi Salon on 57th Street .
It was just that this marriage thing was flipping her out , especially after Jason called the tabs to announce the ceremony would be held inside Rikers .
“ Every little girl ’s dream , to get married at Rikers Island , ” Natalia said to Jason .
“ What are they going to get us , adjoining cells ? ”
But now , holding hands in the visiting room , surrounded by low - level convicts , just the sort of people who rarely appeared in either of their well - to - do childhoods or in the fantasy life of 79 Worth Street — neither of them , pimp or escort , could keep from crying .
“ Are those happy tears or sad tears ? ” Jason asked .
“ Just tears , ” answered Natalia .
“ Crying because your boy is in jail ? ”
“ That and … everything else . ”
It was a tender moment .
Except then , as he always does , Jason began talking .
“ Do n’t worry about this Rikers marriage , ” he said , back in schemer–boy genius mode .
“ This is n’t the real marriage … When I ’m out we ’ll have the princess marriage … the white dress , everything .
Your mom will be there .
My dad …
This is just the publicity marriage .
You know : getting married at Rikers — it ’s so … rock star ! ”

Natalia looked up at Jason , makeup streaming from her face .
“ It ’s great , is n’t it ? ” Jason enthused .
“ A brilliant idea . ”
“ Yeah , ” Natalia said wearily .
“ Great , in theory . ”
Almost everything Jason Itzler said was great , in theory .
They call it the oldest profession , and maybe it is .
The prostitute has always been part of the New York underworld .
According to Timothy J. Gilfoyle ’s City of Eros , in 1776 , Lieutenant Isaac Bangs of the Continental Army complained that half his troops were spending more time in lower - Manhattan houses of ill repute than fighting the British .
In the nineteenth century , lower Broadway had become , in the words of Walt Whitman , a “ noctivagous strumpetocracy , ” filled with “ tawdry , foul - tongued and harsh - voiced harlots . ”
By the eighties , the image of the New York prostitute encompassed both the call - girl minions of Sydney Biddle Barrows , the famous Mayflower Madam , and the hot - pants - clad hooker trying to keep warm beside a burning 55 - gallon drum outside the Bronx ’s Hunts Point Market .
On Eighth Avenue ’s so - called Minnesota Strip were the runaways in the wan - eyed Jodie Foster–in–Taxi Driver mode .
The nineties brought the “ Natasha Trade , ” an influx of immigrant Russian girls and their ex-Soviet handlers who locked the women up in Brighton Beach apartments and drove them , fifteen at a time , in Ford Econoline vans to strip joints on Queens Boulevard .
The Internet would reconfigure all that .
Today , with highly ad hoc estimates of the New York “ sex worker ” population hovering , depending on whom you ask , anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000 , horny men looking for a more convivial lunch hour do n’t have to cruise midtown bars or call a number scribbled on a piece of paper .
All that ’s needed is a high - speed connection to any of the many “ escort malls , ” such as the highly clickable CityVibe or Eros .
The typical site includes a photo or two , a sparse bio , a schedule of when the escort is available , and a price ( “ donation ” ) list .
There is also the standard disclaimer , detailing how any money exchanged “ is simply for time only and companionship ” and that anything else “ is a matter of personal preference between two or more consenting adults . ”
For , as everyone in the escort business is quick to say , selling “ companionship ” is not against the law .
The system is not without its bugs .
The most common question : “ Is she the girl in the picture ? ” Says a longtime booker , “ About two - thirds of the time , when a guy calls up asking for a girl they ’ve seen on the site , she does n’t work for us , quit six months ago , or we Photoshopped her picture from the Victoria ’s Secret catalogue .
“ The place was full of naked women and underwear .
On the couch is Jason , a phone in either ear , the other one ringing on the coffee table . ”
“ If they ask for Nicolette , I take out the three - by - five card with NICOLETTE written on top .
It lists the contacts of girls who kind of look like the fake Nicolette .
What blows my mind is the stupid bastards spend hours searching the sites looking for their super - fantasy , are willing to shell out $ 700 an hour , and then when someone else knocks on the hotel - room door , they go , ‘ Oh , whatever . ’
They can still go back to Indianapolis , show the girl in the picture to their buddies , and say , ‘ See her ?
Like , awesome , dude ! ’ ”
It was this kind of slipshod , postmodern fakery that Jason Itzler says he started NY Confidential to wipe out .
At NY Confidential , you always got the girl in the picture .
“ That ’s because we were the best , ” says Itzler .
“ At NY Confidential , I told my girls that the pressure is on them because we have to provide the clients with the greatest single experience ever , a Kodak moment to treasure for the rest of their lives .
Spreading happiness , positive energy , and love , that ’s what being the best means to me .
Call me a dreamer , but that ’s the NY Confidential credo . ”
Such commentary is typical of Jason , who , in the spirit of all great salesmen , actually believes much of it .
Not yet 40 , Jason Itzler has a story that is already a mini-epic of Jewish - American class longing , a psycho- socio - sexual drama crammed with equal parts genius ( occasionally vicious ) boychick hustle , heartfelt neo - hippie idealism , and dead - set will to self - destruction .
Born Jason
Sylk , only son of the short - lived marriage between his revered mother , Ronnie Lubell , and his “ sperm dad , ” Leonard Sylk , heir to the Sun Ray drugstore fortune built up by Harry Sylk , who once owned a piece of the Philadelphia Eagles , Jason spent his early years as one of very few Jewish kids on Philly ’s Waspy Main Line .
If he ’d stayed a Sylk , says Jason , “ I would have been the greatest Richie Rich , because Lenny Sylk is the biggest thing in the Jewish community .
He ’s got a trust that gives money to stuff like the ballet , a house with an eighteen - car garage , and a helicopter landing pad .

After his parents ’ divorce , Itzler moved to New York with his mother , whom Jason describes as “ the hottest mom in the world .
She had this Mafia princess –Holly Golightly thing about her .
Her vanity license plate was TIFF .
My mother being beautiful made me into who I am today , because when you grow up around a beautiful woman , you always want to be surrounded by beautiful women . ”
Also a big influence was his mom ’s father , the semi-legendary Nathan Lubell , “ the biggest bookmaker in the garment industry , a gangster wizard , ” says Jason .
“ He owned a lot of hat stores , a bunch of the amusement park in Coney Island , and was hooked up with Meyer Lansky in Las Vegas hotels .
I used to love it when he took me to the Friars Club , where he was a king .
Even as a kid , I could feel the action . ”
With his mom remarried , to Ron Itzler , then a lawyer in the firm of Fischbein , Badillo ( as in Herman ) , Wagner , and Itzler , the family lived in the Jersey suburbs .
Displaying his compulsive intelligence by setting the all - time record on the early - generation video game Scramble , Jason , “ pretty much obsessed with sex from the start , ” wrote letters to Mad magazine suggesting it put out a flexi - record of “ teenage girls having orgasms . ”
Summers were spent in the Catskills , where as a cabana boy at the Concord Hotel he befriended people like Jason Binn , now the playboy publisher of the Hamptons and Los Angeles Confidential magazines , a name Itzler paid homage to with his NY Confidential .
Itzler remembers , “ At the Concord , when Jason Binn said he was the son of a billionaire , and my stepfather told me , yeah , he was , I got light - headed . ”
In the late eighties , after getting through George Washington University , even though he was “ mostly running wet - T - shirt contests , ” Itzler entered Nova Southeastern University , a bottom - tier law school in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , where he embarked on what he calls “ my first great chapter ” as “ the 22 - year - old phone - sex king of South Beach . ”
Advertising a “ Free Live Call ” ( after which a $ 4.98 - a- minute charge set in ) , Itzler ’s company was doing $ 600,000 a month , hitting a million and a half within a year .
“ I had so much money , ” Jason recalls .
“ I bought an Aston Martin Virage , 300 feet of oceanfront property .
Like a moron , I spent half a million decorating a one - bedroom apartment . ”
Alas , it would all soon come tumbling down , owing to what Jason now calls a “ kind of oversight , ” which left him owing $ 4.5 million at 36 percent interest .
Forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997 , he lost everything , including his visionary acquisition of one of the fledgling Internet ’s most valuable URLs : pussy.com .
The demise of Itzler ’s phone - sex company set a pattern that would be repeated in 2000 with his next big act , the SoHo Models fiasco .
With typical overreach , Jason rented an 8,000 - square - foot space at the corner of Canal and Broadway and declared himself the new Johnny Casablancas .
Unfortunately for the young models hoping to find their faces on the cover of Vogue , the true business of SoHo Models was to supply Webcam porn .
For a fee , the voyeur would type in “ take off blouse … insert dildo . ”
Squabbling among gray - market partners soon ensued .
Within months , Jason found himself dangling over the side of the Canal Street building , held by the ankles by a guy named Mikey P .
Jason says he would have gotten through these setbacks more easily if his mother were still alive , but Ronnie Itzler died of cancer in 1994 , “ after which I went kind of a little nuts . ”
Following the collapse of the phone - sex firm , he twice attempted suicide , once running himself through with a steak knife and on another occasion drinking “ a milk shake ” he claims contained “ 75 Valium , 75 Klonopin , and a couple bottles of Scotch . ”
Much to his surprise , he survived both times .
Desperate for money after the SoHo Models disaster , Itzler decided his best option was to go to Amsterdam to buy 4,000 tabs of Ecstasy .
“ In retrospect , it was a totally retarded idea , ” says Jason , who would leave Newark airport in handcuffs .
He was sentenced to five years in the Jersey pen .
The fact that his grandfather , whom he ’d idolized as a gangster , stopped talking to him when he got locked up “ was hard to take . ”
“ Jail is terrible , really boring , ” says Jason .
“ But it does give you plenty of time to plan your next move . ”
On parole after serving seventeen months of his smuggling sentence , living in a funky third - floor walk - up in Hoboken per the terms of his release , Jason started NY Confidential ( he would remain on parole his entire pimp career ) in late 2003 .
Business was spotty at first but picked up dramatically in early 2004 , when Natalia walked into the company ’s place at 54th Street and Sixth Avenue , an office previously occupied by the magician David Blaine .

“ It was my birthday , ” Natalia remembers .
“ I ’d just been cast as Ingrid Superstar in this play , Andy & Edie .
I wanted to be Edie , but Misha Sedgwick , Edie ’s niece , also wanted it , so forget that .
I was eating in a restaurant with Peter Beard , the photographer .
I was a kind of party girl for a while .
I met Peter one night , and we hit it off .
He said I should meet this guy Jason . ”
Beard , a nocturnal bon vivant known for his “ discovery ” of exotic models like Iman , and who had been associated with Jason during the SoHo Models episode , warned Natalia off Itzler ’s new venture .
Eventually , however , Natalia decided to give Jason a call .
“ Being an escort never crossed my mind .
It was n’t something girls like me did .
I was an actress .
From a very nice home .
But I was involved in an abusive relationship , with this Wall Street guy , ” she says .
“ In the beginning , all I wanted was enough money to move out . ”
Jason says , “ When Natalia came over with Peter , I said , Wow , she ’s so hot .
She has one of the all - time great tushes .
But there was this other girl there , too .
Samantha .
When she took off her shirt , she had these amazing breasts .
So it was Natalia ’s butt against Samantha ’s boobies .
I went with the tits .
But when Natalia came back from making a movie , she moved in with us .
Samantha could tell I was kind of more into Natalia .
So we became boyfriend and girlfriend . ”
At the time , Jason ’s top girl was Cheryl , a striking blonde ballroom dancer from Seattle who says she got into the business to buy her own horse .
“ I did NY Confidential ’s first date , ” Cheryl recalls .
“ I had on my little black dress and was shaking like a leaf .
Jason was nervous , too .
He said , ‘ Just go up there and take your clothes off . ’
I told him , ‘ No , you ’ve got to make it romantic .
Special . ’ ”
It was Cheryl who came up with the mantra Jason would later instruct all the NY Confidential girls to repeat , “ three times , ” before entering a hotel room to see a client : “ This is my boyfriend of six months , the man I love , I have n’t seen him for three weeks …
This is my boyfriend of six months , the man I love … ”
“ That ’s the essence of the true GFE , the Girlfriend Experience , ” says Jason .
As opposed to the traditional “ no kissing on the mouth ” style , the GFE offers a warmer , fuzzier time .
For Jason , who says he never hired anyone who ’d worked as an escort before , the GFE concept was an epiphany .
“ Men see escorts because they want to feel happier .
Yet most walk away feeling worse than they did before .
They feel dirty , full of self - hatred .
Buyer ’s remorse big - time .
GFE is about true passion , something genuine .
A facsimile of love .
I told guys this was a quick vacation , an investment in the future .
When they got back to their desks , they ’d tear the market a new asshole , make back the money they spent at NY Confidential in an hour .
“ What we ’re selling is rocket fuel , rocket fuel for winners . ”
Jason decided Natalia would become his great creation , the Ultimate GFE .
It mattered little that Natalia , for all her French - Scottish sultriness , might strike some as a tad on the skinny side .
Brown - eyed , dark - haired , olive - skinned , not to mention lactose - intolerant , she did n’t fit the usual description of a big ticket in an industry filled with PSE ( Porn - Star Experience ) babes with store - bought bazangas out to here .
Jason took this as a challenge .
If he was into Natalia , he ’d make sure everyone else was , too .
It was a simple matter of harnessing the available technology .
The main vehicle was the aforementioned TheEroticReview.com , “ the Consumer Reports of the escort industry , ” according to the site ’s founder and owner , the L.A. - based Dave Elms , a.k.a. Dave@TER .
“ The most important thing was to break Natalia out big , ” Jason says .
“ To get the ball rolling with a number of fabulous reviews , I sent her to some friends , to sort of grease the wheel .
I knew those 10/10s would keep coming , because no man wants to admit he got less .
They ’re brainwashed that way . ”
If any hobbyist had the temerity to hand out a paltry 8/8 , or even a 9/10 , he would be contacted .
“ Do n’t break my girl ’s streak , this is history in the making , ” Jason cajoled , offering to throw in a couple hours of free time to get the customer to do a little recalculating .
If that did n’t work , good reviews could be ensured by the $ 5,000 everyone working at NY Confidential ( except Jason ) swears was FedExed to Dave@TER on the 15th of every month .
Dave , who says he “ would not argue with that ” when asked if he is the single most important person in the escort business , vehemently denies any payoffs , from NY Confidential or anyone else .
With her 10/10s piling up , Natalia ’s hourly rate jumped from $ 800 to $ 1,200 with a two - hour minimum .
( The split : 45 percent for the escort , 45 percent for the agency , 10 percent for the booker . )
If clients haggled , they would be told to call back when they were “ more successful . ”
Jason says , “ I always ask prospective clients to give me strong points about themselves , where they went to school , if they ’re good - looking .
It established rapport but also put them on the defensive , let them know that I was interviewing them , to see if they were good enough to go out with our girls . ”
Jason ’s hyping sometimes was faintly embarrassing .
“ Jason would be saying , ‘ Natalia is the greatest escort in the history of the world , as good as Cleopatra or Joan of Arc , ’ ” says Natalia , “ and I ’d be like , ‘ Jason !
Joan of Arc was not an escort , she was a religious martyr . ’
Then he’d be saying I was the greatest escort since Mary Magdalene .
” But all the hype in the world ( an Asian toy manufacturer wanted to mass - produce Barbie - style Natalia dolls , complete with tiny lingerie ) would n’t have helped if Natalia , who never imagined she ’d wind up staying in “ every expensive hotel in New York , ” had n’t turned out to be a natural .
“ I ’m a little moneymaking machine , that ’s what I am , ” she says as she takes a languorous drag of her Marlboro while stretching out on her apartment couch in a shiny pink satin corset , Marlene Dietrich style .
Then she cracks up , because “ you know , the whole thing is so ridiculous sometimes . ”
People wonder what it is about Natalia that made her the Perfect 10 .
“ From the start , you know this is going to be fun , ” says one client .
“ It is like having sex in a tree house . ”
Says another , “ Nat is n’t this all - knowing geisha thing .
But in a way , it ’s deeper , because she gets to a place inside where you used to be free . ”
And another : “ With her , there ’s none of that shit like this is costing enough for a first - class ticket to London and the girl ’s in the bathroom for , like , half an hour .
Natalia ’s this one , total this - is - all - about - you . ”
“ Yes , he sold the shit out of me , but he sold me as myself , someone who really likes sex .
Because the truth is , I do .
I loved my job , totally . ”
Suffice it to say , it ’s in the pheromones .
According to Natalia , she ’s always gotten along with men .
“ Jason understood who I was , ” she says .
“ Yes , he sold the shit out of me , but he sold me as myself , someone anyone can be comfortable with , someone who really likes sex .
Because the truth is , I do .
I loved my job , totally . ”
It is another old story , along with the heart of gold , that many “ providers ” actually like what they do .
But even if she professes to be “ horrified ” by stories about sexual trafficking and “ sickened ” by nightmarish exploitation of the street prostitute , Natalia says , “ At the level NY Confidential was at , the guys I was meeting , I would have gone out with 80 percent of them anyway .
People have so many misconceptions , preconceptions , about my life .
Last year , I got a call to play an escort in a Broadway play .
But the part was so dark , so icky .
I said no .
It did n’t fit my experience at all . ”
You never knew who might be behind the hotel door .
Once , she was summoned to a guy ’s room , told only that he was a famous , championship athlete .
“ I ’m not a big sports fan , but I recognized him , the quarterback .
He turned out to be very laid - back .
He mostly wanted to make me happy .
In the middle , he looks up and says , ‘ Well , you know me , I ’m more of a giver than a receiver . ’ ”
What no one could have predicted , least of all Natalia , was how driven she would be .
“ I knew she was talented , ” Jason says .
“ But once she started going , she was unstoppable , like the Terminator . ”
A glance at Natalia ’s booking sheets raises an eyebrow .
Annotated with Jason ’s exhortatory commentary ( “ Awesome guy ! — $ 5200 , wants to be a regular ! ” “ Big Wall Street guy ! ” “ Software king . ”
“ Hedge fund heavy !
Says he will give investment lessons ! ” ) , the records of Natalia ’s bookings through June and July of 2004 reveal a workload exceeding 250 hours , or nearly a normal nine - to - five , at an average of $ 1,000 per hour , not counting little presents like fancy $ 350 underwear from La Perla .
“ Victoria ’s Secret is all right , ” Natalia says .
“ But you know you have a good client when you get La Perla . ”
Some weeks were particularly frenetic .
From July 29 to August 1 , she had a four - day date in the Florida Keys for which Itzler charged $ 29,000 .
The very next day was a four - hour appointment .
August 3 was filled with a ten - hour appointment and another two - hour job .
August 4 , three hours .
August 5 , a three - hour followed by another four - hour .
August 6 , two hours .
August 7 , one four - hour job and a two - hour .
August 8 , she was off .
But the 9th was another ten - hour day , followed by a pair of two - hour jobs on August 10 .
“ It was like a dream , ” Natalia says .
“ I never got tired . ”
Asked if the work affected her relationship with Itzler , Natalia says , “ Sometimes he ’d say , ‘ Everyone gets a chance to spend time with you except me . ’
I ’d say , ‘ You ’re the one booking me . ’ ” As for Jason , he says , “ If she ever did it with anyone for free , it would have broken my heart . ”
Moving from 54th Street following a nasty fallout with partner Bruce Glasser ( each party claimed the other had taken out a contract on his life ) , Itzler ran NY Confidential out of his parolee apartment in Hoboken .
One visitor describes the scene : “ The place was full of naked women and underwear .
It was a rain forest of underwear .
In the middle on the couch is Jason with all these telephones , one in either ear , the other one ringing on the coffee table . ”
Seventy - nine Worth Street , with its twenty - foot ceilings and mezzanine balconies , where Jason and Natalia would move to in the summer of 2004 , was a whole other thing .
“ Right away , we knew this was it , ” says Natalia .
“ The loft felt like home . ”
As per usual , Jason would take much of the cost of the lease from Natalia ’s bookings — money she would never receive .
But money was never an issue with Natalia .
If Cheryl , Jason ’s first superstar , experienced “ a rush of power when the guy handed me the envelope , ” for Natalia , collecting the “ donation , ” while essential , had a faintly unseemly feel .
“ Maybe it sounds crazy , ” she says , “ but I never felt I was in it for the money . ”
For Jason , the loft was an opportunity to make real his most cherished theories of existence .
“ To me , the higher percentage of your life you are happy , the more successful you are , ” says Jason , who came upon his philosophy while reading Ayn Rand .
“ I was really into the ‘ Who is John Galt ? ’
Atlas Shrugged thing .
I thought I could save the world if I could bring together the truly elite people , the most beautiful women with the most perfect bodies , best faces , and intelligence , and the elite men , the captains of industry , lawyers , and senators .
This would bring about the most happiness , to the best people , who most deserved to be happy . ”
Years before , Jason wrote out the precepts of what he called “ The Happiness Movement . ”
Assuming his findings to be big news , Itzler packed up the manifesto , a copy of his half - finished autobiography , and a naked centerfold picture of Elisa Bridges , his girlfriend at the time , and mailed it to Bob Woodward .
“ I stuck it in this $ 3,000 Bottega Veneta briefcase so he ’d notice it .
He said I was a nut job and to leave him alone .
I was so bummed I told him to keep the stupid briefcase . ”
On Worth Street , however , Jason ( who says “ the best thing about bipolarity is how much you accomplish in the manic phase ” ) saw the chance to manifest his ideal .
One of his first acts was to approach painter Hulbert Waldroup .
Waldroup , a self - proclaimed “ artist with attitude ” who has been collected by Whoopi Goldberg and once appeared on the cover of Newsday along with his epic memorial to Amadou Diallo , was selling his work on the West Broadway sidewalk .
“ You ’re the greatest painter I ’ve ever seen , ” Jason said .
When Waldroup heard Itzler wanted to commission a ten - foot - by - ten - foot canvas of a “ hot - looking ” woman , he said the picture would never get in the door .
No problem , Itzler said , Waldroup could do the painting inside the loft .
Waldroup soon had a job working the phones .
“ It was like I went in there and never came out , ” says Waldroup , now on Rikers Island , where he resides a couple of buildings away from Jason .
Seventy - nine Worth Street became a well - oiled machine , with various calendars posted on the wall to keep track of appointments .
The current day ’s schedule was denoted on a separate chart called “ the action board . ”
But what mattered most to Jason was “ the vibe … the vibe of the NY Confidential brand ” ( there was franchising talk about a Philadelphia Confidential and a Vegas Confidential ) .
To describe what he was going for , Jason quotes from a favorite book , The Art of Seduction , a creepily fascinating tome of social Machiavellianism , by Robert Greene .
Discussing “ seductive place and time , ” Greene notes that “ certain kinds of visual stimuli signal that you are not in the real world .
Avoid images that have depth , which might provoke thought , or guilt …
The more artificial , the better … Luxury — the sense that money has been spent or even wasted — adds to the feeling that the real world of duty and morality has been banished .
Call it the brothel effect . ”
Accentuated by the fog machine at 79 Worth Street , people seemed to come out of the shadows , float by , be gone again .
“ It was full of these familiar faces … like a soap - opera star , a politician you might have seen on NY1 , a guy whose photo’s in the Times financial pages , ” says one regular .
In addition to Sinatra , music was supplied by the building ’s super , a concert pianist in his native Russia , who appeared in a tuxedo to play on a rented Baldwin grand piano .
“ It was like having my own clubhouse , ” says Jason now , relishing the evenings he presided as esteemed host and pleasure master .
He remembers discussing what he called a “ crisis in Judaism ” with a top official of a leading Jewish - American lobby group .
Jewish women were often thought of as dowdy , Jason said .
If the American Jew was ever going to rise above the prejudice of the goyishe mainstream , creativity would be needed .
A start would be to get Madonna , the Kabbalist , to become the head of Hadassah .
The official said he ’d look into it .
Seventy - nine Worth Street was supposed to be Jason and Natalia ’s home , where they would live happily ever after .
They had their own bedroom , off - limits to everyone else .
“ We were actually trying to live a semi- normal life , carry on a real relationship , ” says Natalia .
“ Jason felt abandoned after his mother died ; my father left when I was very young .
We sort of completed each other . ”
Natalia wrote her mom that she ’d moved into a beautiful new place with a highly successful businessman .
Her mom , a sweet cookie - baking lady leery of her daughter ’s life in New York , wrote back that she ’d like to come down to visit .
Natalia was going to put her off , but Jason insisted .
Looking around the loft at the naked women , Natalia asked , “ How am I going to have my mom come here ? ”
Jason said he would close the place , and take the loss , for the time Natalia ’s mom was in town .
Family was the most important thing , he said .
“ Well , ” Natalia says , “ Jason never closed the loft .
My mom and I stayed in a little apartment uptown .
Jason was supposed to come by to meet her , but it started getting late .
Then the doorbell rings at 2 a.m .
It ’s Jason , in his knee - length coat with these two 19 - year - old girls .
I ’m totally flipping out : Like , what the fuck are you doing ?
He looked like the pimp from Superfly .
My mom is saying , ‘ This is him ? ’
But then Jason sits down and starts telling my mom I ’m a great young actress and my career is going to take off , how living in New York is so terrific for me .
He charmed her , completely .
She left saying , ‘ Well , your boyfriend is kind of weird .
But he ’s very , very nice . ’
“ It was always like that . ”
Few expected 79 Worth Street to last very long .
There were too many , as Natalia puts it , “ variables . ”
For Jason , the main difficulty in running New York ’s hottest escort agency while on parole was the curfew .
Even though his lawyer on the Jersey Ecstasy case , Paul Bergrin , was eventually able to extend Jason ’s lights - out time to 3 a.m. , he still had to leave his Worth Street happiness house to sleep in his apartment in Hoboken .
“ Everyone ’s partying , having the best time in the world , and the Town Car is outside to take me back to goddamn New Jersey . ”
“ It was a big strain , ” says Natalia .
“ I finally get home from my appointments .
All I want to do is sleep in my own bed , and Jason is screaming about how we ’ve got to go back to Hoboken .
He hated to be alone out there .
We had horrible fights .
One night , I jumped out of the car right at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel and ran away .
Broke my heel on a cobblestone . ”
The parole situation led to other traumas .
Court - mandated drug tests caused Jason to alter his intake .
Always “ on the Cheech - and - Chong side of things , ” Itzler could n’t smoke pot , which turned up on piss tests .
Instead , Jason , who never touched coke and often launched into Jimmy Swaggart–like speeches about the evils of the drug , dipped into his personal stash of ketamine , or Special K , the slightly unpredictable anesthetic developed for use by veterinarians .
“ They did n’t test for it , ” Jason says by way of explanation .
He was also drinking a $ 200 bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue a day .
Natalia ’s drug use cut into her Perfect 10 appearance .
One night , she cracked her head into the six - foot - tall statue of an Indian fertility goddess Jason had purchased for their room .
Knocked cold , she had to go to the emergency room .
Still , the business charged on .
It takes a singular pimp to think it is a good idea to stage a reality - TV show at his place of business , but Jason Itzler is that kind of guy .
“ It was incredible , ” says independent producer Ron Sperling , who shot the film Inside New York Confidential .
“ Big - shot lawyers and Wall Street bankers flipped when they saw the cameras .
Jason told them the movie was no problem .
That it was a good thing .
If they did n’t want to be in it , they should just walk behind the camera .
That ’s Jason .
If he was a billionaire and no one knew about it , it would n’t be anything to him . ”
Despite misgivings about legalities , VH1 expressed interest in Inside New York Confidential .
Arriving late , Jason swept into the meeting with several girls .
Along for the ride was a young Belgian tourist whom Itzler had encountered only moments before on West Broadway .
“ You ’re beautiful , ” Jason told the young woman .
“ But your clothes look like shit . ”
Itzler bought her $ 2,500 worth of threads in about ten minutes , convincing her she would be great in his TV show .
“ He asked for a million dollars an episode , ” says a VH1 exec .
“ We told him that was insane money , so he got mad and left . ”
Jason ’s manic spending increased .
One afternoon , splashing on Creed Gold Bottle cologne ( $ 175 per bottle ) as “ kind of a nervous tic , ” he bought 26 antique crystal chandeliers at $ 3,000 apiece .
“ We had so much furniture , there was nowhere to walk .
I used to jump over the stuff for exercise , ” says Natalia .
“ We had this room upstairs we called the Peter Beard Room .
Peter likes to sit on the floor , so we got these beautiful Moroccan pillows .
One day , I come home , and there ’s a Playboy pinball machine there , with Hugh Hefner ’s face on it .
Then I knew there was no point saying anything . ”
Jason ’s class insecurities also cropped up .
One night , upstairs at Cipriani’s , Itzler went over to where Lizzie Grubman was sitting with Paris Hilton .
He asked Grubman about representing NY Confidential .
Grubman , whom Jason regarded as just another Great Neck girl with a rich dad under the glitz , supposedly sneered , “ I do n’t do pimps . ”
Returning to his table , Jason said , “ I hate that bitch .
She runs over sixteen people and thinks she ’s better than me . ”
Jason ’s Utopian house of happiness turned into a stage for an ongoing paranoid soap opera .
Feeling his grip slipping , Itzler begged his former fiancée Mona to help with the day - to - day running of the place .
Mona , who had helped organize things in the earliest days of NY Confidential , ran a tight ship .
But there were complications .
It had been only eight months since Mona had been Jason ’s girlfriend , living with him in Hoboken .
They broke up , leading to an enormous screaming match during which Mona called the police , claiming Itzler attacked her .
Jason disputed this , allowing he “ might have squeezed her hand too hard , trying to get my keys back . ”
Mona would drop the charges , but not before Itzler spent some time under house arrest .
Jason says , “ Maybe I ’m just soft , because after Mona wrote the judge a tear - stained letter how I never beat her up and how she loved me , I forgave her . ”
With Jason ’s parole problems increasingly keeping him in Hoboken , Mona soon filled the power vacuum at 79 Worth Street .
Her key ally would be Clark Krimer , a.k.a.
Clark Kent or Superman , a muscle - bound young banker hired by Itzler to manage credit - card accounts .
This way , those wanting to disguise their use of NY Confidential services would appear to be spending their $ 1,200 or so at venues like the fictitious Gotham Steak .
Clark and Mona soon became an item , consolidating their power .
The Clark - and - Mona regime upset “ the vibe ” of 79 Worth Street , turning it into , in the words of one working girl , “ just another whorehouse . ”
First to feel the fallout was Natalia .
As queen of the castle , Natalia always dismissed the jealousies of the other escorts as “ stupid girl stuff . ”
This was different .
She says , “ Mona was a psycho - bitch .
She hated me , and now she was running the place . ”
When clients called , instead of Jason ’s rapturous invocations of Natalia ’s charms , Mona said , “ I ’ve got this girl , she ’s six - one , a rower on an Ivy League college scull team .
She ’s cheaper than Natalia and way better . ”
Natalia ’s bookings fell off .
One November afternoon , Natalia arrived at the loft to find Mona standing in front of the door to her room — her room !— demanding she turn over her keys to the loft .
“ This is where I live .
My home , ” Natalia screamed .
Eventually , however , Natalia decided to move out .
Through this , people began telling Jason he ’d better cool things out , not keep bringing parties of vacationing second - grade schoolteachers by the loft for fun .
With guys in Con Edison vans watching the place from across the street , the least he could do was make sure the front door stayed locked .
“ What do I have to hide ? ” Jason scoffed .
“ I ’m not doing anything illegal . ”
Much of this self - deluding assessment was based on the contract Jason , utilizing his best Nova U. legalese , worked up between himself and the NY Confidential escorts .
The document , signed by all the girls , stated they were “ specifically forbidden ” to have sex with the clients .
Itzler showed the contract to Mel Sachs , the floridly attired defender of Sante Kimes , Mike Tyson , and , more recently , the pint - size exhibitionist - rapper Lil’ Kim .
Sachs made a couple of adjustments and said the contract passed muster , which was just what Jason wanted to hear .
“ I ’m bulletproof .
Rich people do n’t go to jail , ” Jason proclaimed .
He was certain that if anything came up , Sachs and Bergrin , a former Army major , could handle it .
“ Mel ’s my personal Winston Churchill , and Paul ’s the tough Marine general , ” Jason rhapsodized , either unaware or not caring that Bergrin is currently under federal investigation for his alleged part in the death of a police informer slated to testify against one of his drug - dealer clients .
“ Mel became my best friend , ” says Jason , always impressed by a man in a fancy suit .
“ He was always in my place .
We all loved Mel . ”
Asked about these visits , Sachs , after some deliberation , said , “ Well , Jason is a personable guy .
I liked talking to him .
It was an interesting place , full of fascinating conversation .
A lot of business people , financial people , professional people . ”
Amid this gathering train wreck , one incident in November 2004 stands out as the beginning of the end .
That evening , accompanied by a mutual friend , two mobsters , members of the Genovese family , according to Jason , stopped by the loft .
“ I never did any business with them .
I just thought it might open a new line of high - priced clients , ” says Jason , who bought a $ 3,500 Dior suit for the occasion , with a matching one for his bodyguard , a former Secret Service agent .
The meeting had barely begun when a girl named Genevieve burst through the door .
A tall blonde , she was returning from her first NY Confidential date , reputedly stoned out of her mind , and was demanding to be paid immediately .
Told to wait , Genevieve started yelling , threatening to call the police to adjudicate the matter .
“ What ’s wrong with that girl ? ” one of the mobsters asked .
Itzler asked the bodyguard to quiet Genevieve down .
But as the bodyguard approached , Genevieve pulled a can of pepper spray from her handbag and blinded him .
With the bodyguard writhing on the floor , Genevieve locked herself in a room and called 911 .
A dozen cops and an engine company of firemen arrived .
There was some debate about whether to open the door , but the mobsters said , “ It ’s the cops , you got to let them in . ”
“ I ’m looking at the security - camera monitors , ” remembers one witness .
“ In one is the cops , another the gangsters , the third the screaming girl , the fourth the Secret Service guy rubbing his eyes .
That ’s when I thought I ’d take a vacation from this place . ”
The encounter would end relatively harmlessly .
“ It looked like one of the cops recognized one of the gangsters , ” says the witness .
“ They started talking , everyone exchanged business cards and left . ”
After that , the cops started coming to the loft almost every day .
“ They ’d knock on the door , come in , look around , and leave , ” remembers Hulbert Waldroup .
Almost always , they took a stack of Jason ’s distinctive metal ROCKET FUEL FOR WINNERS business cards .
The card had become something of a collector ’s item at headquarters , one cop says .
“ Everyone wanted one . ”
Rumor has it that one ended up on Mayor Bloomberg ’s desk , to the mayor ’s amusement .
When the big bust inevitably came down on January 7 , the loft was nearly empty .
Krimer and Waldroup were at an art gallery when someone ’s cell phone rang .
The caller said no one was picking up at NY Confidential .
That was a bad sign , Waldroup said .
Frantically , Krimer and Waldroup attempted to connect to the Webcam security system Itzler had installed so he could watch the activities at 79 Worth Street from his Hoboken apartment .
The cam was available from any wired - up computer .
But no one could remember the password .
“ Fuck ! ” screamed Krimer .
Eventually the connection was made .
“ The place is being raided , and we ’re watching it on the Internet , ” says Waldroup .
“ The cops were like ants , over everything , taking all the files , ledgers , computers .
On the couch were these people I ’d worked with for months , in handcuffs .
It was very weird . ”
Jason would n’t find out about the bust until sometime later .
“ I was shopping for rugs with Ed Feldman , who is kind of a legend in the fashion business , ” Jason says .
It was Feldman who , years before , had given the young Jason Itzler a copy of Budd Schulberg ’s all - time delineation of the Hebrew hustler , What Makes Sammy Run ?
“ Read it , ” Feldman said .
“ It ’s you . ”
Jason says , “ I immediately checked into the Gansevoort Hotel and began partying .
Had a couple of girls come over because I figured I would n’t be doing that for a while .
When the cops came , I thought , ‘ Well , at least I ’m wearing my $ 2,800 rabbit - fur - lined sweater from Jeffrey ’s , because who wants to look like a guy in a sweatshirt ? ’
When they snapped on the handcuffs , all I remember thinking was how I thought NY Confidential would last for 25 years . ”
Almost six months later , Jason is still in jail .
In the beginning , he was confident that his lawyers , Sachs and Bergrin , after all that money and all those free drinks , would bail him out .
That did not happen .
With none of his regulars , the trust - fund babies and famous artists Itzler considered his friends , rushing to his aid , Jason wound up in front of Judge Budd Goodman at the 100 Centre Street courthouse , penniless and lawyerless , tearfully asking to defend himself , a request that was denied .
“ Ask me if I feel like a sap , ” Jason says .
Down deep , he always knew that when all was said and done , after everyone had had their fun , he ’d be the one to pay for it .
With the Bush administration coming down heavy on sexual trafficking — the religious right ’s top human - rights issue — Robert Morgenthau ’s office is not of a mind to offer deals to loudmouthed brothel owners , not this election year .
As a “ predicate ” felon from his ill - considered Ecstasy importation , Itzler ’s facing a four - and - a - half - to - nine - year sentence .
Even if he beats that , there is the matter of his busted parole in New Jersey .
Sitting in Rikers , playing poker for commissary food , once again Jason has a lot of time on his hands .
One of the things to think about is what happened to all the money that was made at NY Confidential .
A common theory , one Itzler advanced in a recent Post story , is that Clark Krimer , who may or may not be cooperating with the D.A. , took it all .
“ He stole $ 400,000 , ” Jason says .
“ He should be in jail .
If anyone laundered money , it ’s him . ”
Asked if it was possible that he , Jason , had managed to spend a good portion of the missing money , Itzler scoffs , saying , “ Who could spend all that ? ”
When it comes down to it , however , Jason says he does n’t want to think about Krimer or the fact that Waldroup remains in jail even if he only answered the phones .
“ I ’m staying optimistic , ” Jason says , free of bitterness .
“ It is like I told the girls , if you smile a fake smile , keep smiling it because a fake smile can become a real smile . ”
“ The problem with NY Confidential was it did n’t go far enough , ” Jason says now .
“ If you really want to put together the elite people , the best - looking women and the coolest guys , you ca n’t stop with a couple of hours .
It has to be a lifetime commitment . ”
Jason has consulted his prison rabbi , who presided over the recent Passover ceremony during which Itzler got to sit with recently arrested madam Julie Moya ( of Julie ’s ) during the asking of the Four Questions .
The rabbi told Jason that as a Jewish pimp who sold women to Jewish men , he was liable for the crime of kedesha .
The rabbi did not , however , think this transgression necessarily prevented Jason from becoming a shadchan , or a traditional matchmaker .
“ I ’m thinking about the future , the next generations , ” Jason says from his un-air - conditioned prison dorm .
“ I think I have a chance to do something good before I die .
Who knows , the answer to the question ‘ Who is John Galt ? ’ could be ‘ Jason . ’ ”
As for Natalia , she is “ keeping a low profile . ”
Last week , she went to see Jason again .
Thankfully he did n’t talk too much about getting married inside the prison .
Mostly they talked about the strange times they ’d been through and how , even if it turned out the way it did , somehow it was worth it .
“ I was a young actress who came to New York like a lot of young actresses , and I wound up with the role of a lifetime .
I was the Perfect 10 .
I totally was .
It was n’t the rabbit hole I expected to tumble down , but Jason and I … we were happy … for a time , really happy . ”
Since she received hardly any of her booking money and is pretty broke these days , people ask Natalia if she ’s planning on coming back to “ work . ”
The other night , a well - known provider , who said she used to hate Natalia when she was getting those 10/10s , offered to “ pimp her out . ”
“ That would be a feather in my cap , ” said the escort .
“ To be the one who brought back the famous Natalia . ”
“ No , thanks , ” said Natalia , which is what she tells her old clients who call from time to time .
“ I say I ’m retired , in repose .
They say , ‘ Come on , let me buy you a drink .
I ’ll be good . ’
I tell them , ‘ Look , we had fun and I love you .
But that is over . ’
Mostly , they understand .
Some are willing to stay friends , some ca n’t wait to get off the phone .
They ’ve got other numbers in their book . ”
That does n’t mean a girl has to stay home at night .
New York , after all , is a big place , full of opportunity .
In a way , things have gone back to the way they were before she met Jason .
“ Wiser , but not necessarily sadder , ” Natalia says .
Tonight she ’s going downtown .
It is always good to look good , so Natalia goes through what was a familiar ritual back in the days when she was the Perfect 10 — getting her nails done at the Koreans ’ on 29th Street , combing out her wavy hair .
For old times ’ sake , she ’s got on what she used to call her “ money dress , ” a short satin pink number with gray jersey inserts , with the shoes to match .
About ten , she ’s ready .
She goes out into the street , lifts her arm , gets into a cab , and disappears into the night .
a collection offree screen saversfor X11 , macOS , iOS and Androidby Jamie Zawinski and many others .
XScreenSaver is the standard screen saver collection shipped on most Linux and Unix systems running the X11 Window System .
I released the first version in 1992 .
I ported it to macOS in 2006 , to iOS in 2012 , and to Android in 2014 .
On X11 systems , XScreenSaver is two things : it is both a large collection of screen savers ; and it is also the framework for blanking and locking the screen .
On macOS systems , these screen savers work with the usual macOS screen saving framework ( X11 is not required ) .
On iOS devices , it is an application that lets you run each of the demo modes manually .
On Android , the savers work as both Daydreams and as Live Wallpapers .
The concept of Web OS – having all your applications and data available on the web through the browser irrespective of the hardware and OS of the system you are using – and its requirement is understood for quite some time now .
But there have n’t been any good implementations .
Till now .
Recently I discovered Goowy .
And I was amazed .
Though it is still far from becoming a Web OS , they have done a pretty good job packaging the entire thing with an interesting user experience .
The entire website has been built in Flash .
That explains the nifty animations sprinkled around the site .
Here ’s a screenshot
The applications available currently are –
Email – you get a @goowy.com address with 2 GB space .
To - do lists RSS Reader Calendar Lots of Flash - based games Small applications like Stock ticker , weather monitor , Flickr viewer , Google Search etc .
The Mac - like application bar at the bottom of the website makes the intention of Goowy developers clear – it ’s gonna be the web equivalent of a desktop OS .
Flash vs AJAX
The fact that folk at Goowy decided to use Flash instead of AJAX to provide the “ rich internet application ” experience seems to have paid up .
Goowy has almost bridged the gap between the UI of web and desktop applications .
With Flash , creating animations is far easier – that ’s the primary thing it is known for .
Things like accessing the right - click menu are not even possible in AJAX ( yet ? ) ( for example , in Goowy , you can right - click on an email and select the delete option from the menu that pops up – this is n’t easily doable through AJAX )
However , all this does n’t come free of cost .
The load time for Goowy is slightly on the higher side – all those nifty animations need higher bandwidth than what would have been required for a simpler AJAX implementation .
There is a lag in entering text while composing an email , even on my super powerful workstation .
Feature ideas
I ’m sure the developers at Goowy are working full - steam to add new features to their wonderful app .
There is so much for them to do right now .
Some features are already in the pipeline – they are just grayed out on the main page – like sharing files and instant messaging .
I do n’t know how Techcrunch got the screenshots of IM working in Goowy .
I ’d like to see widgets for storing bookmarks .
Also , some kinda post - it notes would be very useful .
But the most important feature would be to somehow allow third party developers to develop widgets / applications for their site .
I ’m not sure how they should be doing that but if they can get the attention of third party developers , the usability and acceptance of Goowy will increase a lot .
And yes , resizable windows for minis would be a nice improvement .
PS : Protopage is a good starting point for a software that could later expand into a full - fledged Web OS , but it seems to have constrained itself to be a Web Desktop only ( with online bookmarks , personal notes and RSS Reader )
Vorweg möchte ich sagen , dass nicht jede Thai - Massage jede hier aufgeführte Wirkung hat .
Es hängt zum großen Teil vom Masseur ab , seinen Erfahrungen , seinem Wissen und seinen Fähigkeiten .
Ich habe mich hier dafür entschieden , aufzuzeigen zu welchem Zweck Thai - Massage eingesetzt werden kann .
Ich möchte aber ausdrücklich betonen dass Thai - Massage kein Allheilmittel ist .
Fakt ist einfach , dass Thai - Massage nie systematisiert wurde wie wir das von westlichen System der Körperarbeit her kennen , und so ein weites und schier unüberschaubares Spektrum an Behandlungstechniken zur Verfügung steht .
Es ist bislang niemandem gelungen , dieses System in seiner Gesamtheit vollständig darzustellen , und es liegt in der Natur der Sache , dass das auch niemandem gelingen wird , denn selbst wer für Jahre Thailand bereist und recherchiert , wird nicht jede Technik von jedem Masseur erfassen können .
Mittlerweile ist das thailändische Gesundheitsministerium bemüht Qualitätsnormen für Thai - Massage einzuführen und genau zu bestimmen , welche Techniken „ Thai - Massage “ sind und welche nicht .
Dies wird jedoch von vielen Massage - Therapeuten nicht gutgeheißen , vor allem weil eine große Anzahl an Techniken so in Gefahr raten verloren zu gehen , weil sie nicht im Curriculum des Gesundheitsministeriums auftauchen .
Thai - Massage tut gut : Körper und Geist werden in Einklang gebracht .
Zu den generellen Wirkungen einer kunstfertig ausgeführten Thaimassage gehören :
tiefe Entspannung
Stresslinderung
spendet neue Energie und wirkt vitalisierend
bessere Körperhaltung
bessere Durchblutung ( was auch heißt : bessere Sauerstoff - und Nährstoffversorgung in den Geweben und Organen )
Koordinationsvermögen wird verfeinert
Entwicklung eines besseren Körpergefühls
reduziertes Risiko von Rückenverletzungen
Schmerzenlinderung
Kräftigung der internen Organe
Stabilisierung der Wirbelsäule
Stabilisierung der Gelenke
Stimulation des endokrinen Systems
Schadstoffablagerungen werden aus dem Bindegewebe freigesetzt und können den Körper verlassen ( deshalb nach Massage möglichst viel Wasser oder Tee trinken ! )
Flexibilität von Muskeln , Sehnen und Bändern wird verbessert
Muskel - und Bindegewebsverklebungen werden aufgelöst
Energiefluss wird angeregt
Muskelverspannungen werden reduziert und aufgelöst
Körpersymmetrie wird verbessert
Lymphsystem wird stimuliert ( und somit der Abtransport von Schadstoffen verbessert )
Klarheit im Geist , verbesserte Strukturierung von Gedanken
Schwellungen gelindert
Stoffwechsel wird angeregt
löst Kopfschmerzen auf
die natürlichen Rhythmen des Körpers werden wieder in Einklang gebracht
Schlaf wird tiefer und erholsamer
Menstruationsschmerz wird gelindert ( Dysmenorrhea )
emotionale und energetische Blockaden werden aufgelöst
unbewusst gespeicherte Erinnerungen kehren ins Bewusstsein zurück
langanhaltendes Wohlbefinden , sowohl körperlich wie auch emotional
innere und äußere Erfahrungswelt werden in Einklang gebracht
Heilungsprozess bei überstrapazierter Muskulatur wird beschleunigt
vorbeugend gegen Osteoporose
setzt Endorphine frei – die körpereigenen , natürlichen Schmerzmittel und ist deshalb besonders hilfreich für Patienten mit chronischen Schmerzen und postoperativen Schmerzen .
Oft können schmerzbetäubende Medikamente runterdosiert oder sogar abgesetzt werden
Die hier aufgelisteten Krankheiten , sind Krankheiten die in Thailand auch mit Thai - Massagen behandelt werden .
Wenn
Sie unter einer der unten aufgeführten Beschwerden leiden , rennen Sie damit jedoch bitte nicht zur nächsten Thai - Massage - Praxis .
In den meisten Fällen sind sie mit einem Arzt oder Heilpraktiker Ihres Vertrauens besser beraten , in einigen Fällen kann Thai - Massage als Ergänzung zu einer medizinischen Therapie helfen .
Lähmungszustände ( besonders halbseitige Lähmungen nach Schlaganfall )
Migräne
Asthma
Schwindelgefühl
Appetitlosigkeit
Muskelkrämpfe
Depression
Angstzustände
Erbrechen und Übelkeit
Nebenhöhlenentzündung ( Sinusitis )
Schlafstörungen
Impotenz
Verstopfung
Sodbrennen
Husten und Erkältung
Epilepsie
Inkontinenz
Magengeschwüre
Schockzustände
Tinnitus
Fieber
Beruhigung von Kleinkindern wenn sie zahnen
Menstruationsbeschwerden
Lange Zeit war es in Thailand für wohlhabende Familien auch üblich , einen Massage - Therapeuten zu holen , nachdem eine Frau in Kind geboren hat .
Die Mutter bekam dann tägliche Massagebehandlungen .
Ich hoffe es ist mir gelungen , einen kleinen Einblick in die vielen Anwendungsgebiete der Thaimassage zu geben , wie sie in Thailand eingesetzt wird .

Just about everything that runs on batteries -- flashlights , cell phones , electric cars , missile - guidance systems -- would be improved with a better energy supply .
But traditional batteries have n't progressed far beyond the basic design developed by Alessandro Volta in the 19th century .
Until now .
Work at MIT 's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems ( LEES ) holds out the promise of the first technologically significant and economically viable alternative to conventional batteries in more than 200 years .
Joel E. Schindall , the Bernard Gordon Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ( EECS ) and associate director of the Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems ; John G. Kassakian , EECS professor and director of LEES ; and Ph.D. candidate Riccardo Signorelli are using nanotube structures to improve on an energy storage device called an ultracapacitor .
Capacitors store energy as an electrical field , making them more efficient than standard batteries , which get their energy from chemical reactions .
Ultracapacitors are capacitor - based storage cells that provide quick , massive bursts of instant energy .
They are sometimes used in fuel - cell vehicles to provide an extra burst for accelerating into traffic and climbing hills .
However , ultracapacitors need to be much larger than batteries to hold the same charge .
The LEES invention would increase the storage capacity of existing commercial ultracapacitors by storing electrical fields at the atomic level .
Although ultracapacitors have been around since the 1960s , they are relatively expensive and only recently began being manufactured in sufficient quantities to become cost - competitive .
Today you can find ultracapacitors in a range of electronic devices , from computers to cars .
However , despite their inherent advantages -- a 10 - year - plus lifetime , indifference to temperature change , high immunity to shock and vibration and high charging and discharging efficiency -- physical constraints on electrode surface area and spacing have limited ultracapacitors to an energy storage capacity around 25 times less than a similarly sized lithium - ion battery .
The LEES ultracapacitor has the capacity to overcome this energy limitation by using vertically aligned , single - wall carbon nanotubes -- one thirty - thousandth the diameter of a human hair and 100,000 times as long as they are wide .
How does it work ?
Storage capacity in an ultracapacitor is proportional to the surface area of the electrodes .
Today 's ultracapacitors use electrodes made of activated carbon , which is extremely porous and therefore has a very large surface area .
However , the pores in the carbon are irregular in size and shape , which reduces efficiency .
The vertically aligned nanotubes in the LEES ultracapacitor have a regular shape , and a size that is only several atomic diameters in width .
The result is a significantly more effective surface area , which equates to significantly increased storage capacity .
The new nanotube - enhanced ultracapacitors could be made in any of the sizes currently available and be produced using conventional technology .
" This configuration has the potential to maintain and even improve the high performance characteristics of ultracapacitors while providing energy storage densities comparable to batteries , " Schindall said .
" Nanotube - enhanced ultracapacitors would combine the long life and high power characteristics of a commercial ultracapacitor with the higher energy storage density normally available only from a chemical battery . "

JavaScript and " serious " programmers
For at least a year I 've been worried about the total lack of relation between JavaScript and " serious " programmers .
Unfortunately it seems as if JavaScript is still beneath their notice .
That starts to annoy me .
The advent of Ajax makes a solution to this problem mandatory .
Who will create the Ajax applications ?
Those who do n't know how to write an application , or those who do n't know the language the application will be written in ?
Who will create the AJAX apps ?
For the past few months I 've been thinking about the gory production details of the Ajax hype .
We 'll get a brave new wave of web applications that leverage the power of XMLHTTP .
However , before these applications appear online , somebody must create them .
Who ?
Basically there are two options :
Ajax applications are created by client side programmers ( XHTML , CSS , JavaScript , accessibility , usability ) , or by server side programmers ( Java , PHP , . NET , Perl , databases , SQL ) .
Neither option suits me .
Client side programmers : no
Now that I 'm getting more and more requests to create complex scripts that run into the thousands of lines , I 'm increasingly starting to notice that I do n't know much about application design .
Obviously , I 'm going to have to learn the basics of designing applications , or run the risk that my complicated scripts fall apart at the slightest pressure .
In July I was requested to review a book about Ajax .
Although I could n't make as much time as the book required ( publishers should start paying serious money if they want serious reviews ! ) , I was immediately captured by the few chapters I read about application design .
It was , quite literally , a new world .
I had already laboriously discovered some of the design principles the book described without outside help , but others were totally new and exciting .
I want to know more about this topic .
Can anyone recommend a good , language - neutral book about application design principles ?
More in general , I think that client side programmers can use a bit of education in application design and software development .
Typically , our scripts are rather small , both in extent of user interaction and in number of lines , and they do n't constitute a serious design challenge .
For this reason , I doubt whether client side programmers are most suited to create Ajax applications .
They just do n't have enough experience in application design and serious programming .
Server side programmers : no
On the other hand , I feel that server side programmers are unsuited to create Ajax applications , too .
Sometimes I get the feeling that they do n't want to learn JavaScript , with the possible exception of the ones that visit this and other standards aware sites .
Besides , the unthinking nonsense reflex that " this applications is so advanced that it's never going to be accessible anyway " starts to work on my nerves .
In my opinion , server side programmers should learn modern web development techniques and theory if they want to write Ajax applications .
But they do n't .
( OK , OK , I 'm exaggerating .
No doubt there will be server side programmers that want to learn .
The majority does n't , though ) .
A beautiful example of server side disdain for JavaScript is given by the practical chapters of the same book I referred to earlier .
Although , as I said , I loved the theoretical chapters about application design , I was shocked and awed by the raw disinterest displayed in the other chapters .
Apparently the writer had taken a few days to read up on JavaScript , and then just started to write stuff .
Apart from detail errors like using the item ( ) method that is unnecessary in JavaScript , the writer entertained curious notions about CSS ( font sizes in points ? ) , DOM trees ( the < body > as the root element ? ) , and the W3C DOM specification in general ( the getElement ByTag ( ) method ? ) .
Unfortunately for his readers , he was a new amateur who did n't have the faintest idea what he was doing .
The worst is : I do n't think this is an isolated incident .
I 'm afraid it 's an accurate indication of the way some ( many ? ) " serious " programmers think about JavaScript .
It 's just that simple client stuff , right ?
It does n't even need any objects , right ?
Even if I 'm exaggerating , I still feel that the average server side programmer needs to know something about modern web development theories , especially those related to accessibility , and has to take the time to actually learn JavaScript .
Without these crucial knowledge components he 's not suited to create Ajax applications .
JavaScript libraries - substitutes for knowledge ?
In response to my previous entries about the New Amateurs , more than a few people said that one of the big problems with JavaScript development right now is the lack of good libraries .
I 've got mixed feelings about these remarks .
As some of you will know , I dislike JavaScript libraries .
Despite this , I 'm willing to take a second look at them if " new amateur " programmers who 'd really like to do JavaScript right maintain that good libraries are a necessary tool for their trade .
I 'm willing to extend my hand across the gap between client and server side .
Nonetheless , before doing so I 'd like to ask two questions and make one remark .
The first question is :
Suppose you 're my boss and order me to write a Java application for you , despite my abysmal ignorance of all things Java .
I buy a technical reference book , ask around for the best libraries in town , and with these aids start to create my application .
Would you , being my boss , consider this a healthy situation in which I 'm guaranteed to deliver a quality product to our clients ?
Personally , I 'd say No .
I feel that libraries are sometimes regarded as substitutes for knowledge .
Without knowing a programming language you can't use it .
Libraries are just tools , not magic wands .
Besides , the true geek reflex would be : " Are there no good libraries ?
I 'll write my own , even if I have to learn JavaScript ten times over ! " .
The second question is :
Would hiring or becoming a JavaScript professional solve the problem ?
It 's odd , really , that a software house that uses a certain language refuses to employ experts for that language .
Finally , the remark .
The study of browser incompatibilities is a necessary part of learning JavaScript .
You must at least once experience the frustrations of trying to manage a herd of obnoxious browsers by hand .
You do n't have to know all incompatibilities by heart , that 's what sites like this one are for .
However , no compatibility table or library will ever teach you the same lessons as actually managing live browsers .
Once you can identify and avoid common causes of their little head - and heartaches , you can revert to libraries , especially since you yourself can now check and maintain them .
Knowledge sharing
As we 've seen , client side programmers know little about application design , and server side programmers know little about modern web development theories .
But both sides know a lot about the topics the other side needs to learn .
Serious knowledge sharing between client side and server side programmers would seem to be the obvious solution .
Unfortunately , in order to have serious knowledge sharing , we must have mutual respect , first .
After all , if you do n't respect someone you wo n't take his knowledge and opinions seriously .
And it 's here that we encounter the problem .
I cannot avoid the impression that many " serious " programmers look down on JavaScript , and do n't want to learn it because it 's too simple .
Instead , they tell an intern to go download a library .
This arrogant and condescending way of thinking annoys the hell out of me .
Worse , it 's unprofessional .
This blatant piece of New Amateurism stands in the way of the true two - way knowledge sharing client side and server side programming so badly need .
No doubt there are companies that understand the ins and outs of both modern web development and application design , and give them equal weight .
You may even work for one , lucky you .
Nonetheless , the overall pattern seems to tend towards arrogance rather than cooperation .
That has to change .
( And no , I 'm not going to give the name of the book I reviewed .
After my review the publisher seems to have decided the practical chapters needed to be reworked .
I have n't yet seen the final version , so I can't really judge it .
It might be much better than the draft I read . )

It 's Undeniable Friday !
Every Friday , in addition to an odd little factoid , UndeniableFacts.com gives you a fun puzzle , illusion , or activity to enjoy and share .
Today : The Floating Apple TrickOnce again , we 're looking at some excellent party - trick potential .
The effect is impressive and the setup is just too easy .
The key to this trick is the liquid in the measuring cup .
With some basic chemistry using household items and a little heat , we can turn ordinary tap - water into a crude " mass fluid " - a vapor which is far heavier than many solids , but which behaves much like a gas .
To create the mass fluid , you 'll need the following ingredients : 1 tbsp salt1 1/2 tbsp alum3 tbsp brewer 's yeast1 / 2 cup high fructose corn syrup3 cups water Preparation :
Mix these ingredients together about two hours before you want to perform the trick and place them in the refrigerator .
A little before your guests arrive , take the fluid out and begin warming it up on the stove .
Execution :
Once you have everybody gathered in your kitchen , turn the heat up on the stove .
Once the fluid is boiling , carefully place an apple in the container , and let science do the rest .
How it works :
This mixture is a slight variation on the first mass fluid , discovered in 1867 by Russian physician Vladamir Kalinknikov who was searching for a cure for malaria .
According to legend , when Kalinknikov placed the final ingredient - an apple - into the concoction he had been mixing , the apple rocketed up and killed him .
Since no modern recreation of Kalinknikov 's experiments has resulted in the apple traveling at faster than 20 mph , historians consider this legend unlikely .
More probably , Kalinknikov finally fell victim to the disease he was trying to fight - along with millions of his compatriots .
The Kalinknikov fluid works because of enzymes which yeasts release when they consume salt .
The alum is broken down by the enzymes , forming tiny clusters of sulfur and aluminum bound together by waste proteins left by the yeast .
These clusters are incredibly heavy but interact exactly like water molecules .
When boiled , the vapor released contains billions of these clusters , making it extremely heavy .
Anything less dense than this heavy " gas " will float .
So why do we have to use an apple ?
All fruits contain a substance called pectin which is concentrated in their skins .
When heated , this pectin changes into a form which , chemically , is almost identical to helium .
Unfortunately , most fruits have extremely porous skins , so this " fool 's helium " immediately dissipates into the air .
An apple 's peel , on the other hand , completely traps the heated pectin , making it extremely light .
Without this little extra push , a primitive mass fluid like Kalinknikov 's would be unable to lift the apple .

Several blasts struck in quick succession
It was the most devastating series of attacks in Iraq 's capital in a single day since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The bombings in Sadr City were followed by mortar attacks on Sunni areas .
The Iraqi authorities have put Baghdad under curfew and closed the airport , and Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki went on TV to appeal for restraint amid the violence .
" We denounce sectarian practices that aim to destroy the unity of the nation , " Mr Maliki said .
Panic
Leaders of Iraq 's Shia , Sunni and Kurdish communities also appealed for calm , while Iraq 's most prominent Shia cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , " urged people not to react illegally and maintain self - restraint and calm , " one of his officials said .
There were pools of blood on the street and children dead on the ground

Death toll hits record high
Who are the armed groups ?
In Washington , a White House spokeswoman said they condemned " such acts of senseless violence that are clearly aimed at undermining the Iraqi people 's hopes for a peaceful and stable Iraq . "
UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett also condemned the " barbaric " attacks , saying that such actions " show how little the terrorists have to offer the Iraqi people and the importance of building national reconciliation " .
The blasts brought panic to the streets of Sadr City , a densely populated , largely Shia neighbourhood , as distraught residents searched for family and friends .
Several car bombs , at least three of them believed to be suicide attacks , exploded minutes apart .
Among the targets were a busy square , a food market and a street where people catch buses .
" I was out shopping .
As the bombs went off , everyone started running and shouting , " news photographer Kareem al - Rubaie told Reuters new agency .
" I saw a car from a wedding party , covered in ribbons and flowers .
It was burning .
There were pools of blood on the street and children dead on the ground . "
People tried to pull bodies out of the mangled wreckage of cars and minibuses and put out fires .
Several mortar rounds were also fired into hit Sadr City , police said .
Curses
The number of casualties put major pressure on transport and hospitals .

Suicide bombers attack Shia festival - goers in Karbala and Baghdad 1 Feb 2004 - 105 dead
Twin attacks on Kurdish parties ' offices in Irbil
The injured filled Sadr City 's hospitals , with dozens lying bleeding in the corridors .
Angry residents and armed Shia militiamen came out onto the streets , shouting curses at Sunni Muslims , the Associated Press news agency reports .
The Iraqi health minister , Ali al - Shammari , accused Sunnis and loyalists of the former ruling Baath party of being behind the attacks .
" They were killed in cold blood by Sunni extremists and Baathist criminal remnants , " he told the BBC Arabic Service .
The bombs exploded shortly after dozens of gunmen had attacked the health ministry in Baghdad , clashing with Iraqi guards and soldiers before they were beaten off .
Brazen attacks
Sadr City is largely controlled by the Mehdi Army , the best - known of the Shia Iraqi militias , which has been accused of carrying out many sectarian attacks .
Shortly after the blasts , a dozen mortars hit the Adhamiya district , a predominantly Sunni area , injuring 10 people , the interior ministry said .
The Iraqi authorities put Baghdad 's seven million residents under curfew on Thursday evening , saying all people and vehicles must stay off the streets until further notice .
The Iraqi authorities have also closed Basra 's air and sea ports in the south , as well as the international airport in Baghdad .
The daily attacks in Baghdad are now more brazen and more sectarian , says BBC Middle East analyst Roger Hardy .
On Wednesday , the United Nations said violent deaths among civilians hit a record high in October , with more than 3,700 people losing their lives - the majority in sectarian attacks .
TAXI
SLEEP deprivation is an uncomfortable experience .
In drivers and workers it can lead to fatal accidents .
In those under interrogation it can lead to confession .
But why it does what it does is mysterious — as , indeed , is the purpose of sleep itself .
Many theories have been proposed to explain why the pressure to sleep builds up until it becomes irresistible .
The latest , presented at the recent annual meeting of the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping , in Florence , Italy , starts from the obvious proposition that the longer you stay awake , the more you learn .
Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin proposes that this extra learning makes the brain more and more expensive to maintain .
Sleep prunes back the grey matter so that , come the morning , the brain is once again economical to run .
If this pruning cannot take place , the organ becomes less and less efficient , and dire consequences result .
Even at rest , the brain is costly to run , consuming 20 % of the body 's energy production .
Most of this energy goes towards maintaining synapses , the junctions across which impulses jump from nerve cell to nerve cell , keeping the brain alert even when it is not doing anything .
When a person learns something new , certain synapses are strengthened relative to others .
Over the course of the day , there is a net increase in the strength and number of the brain 's synapses .
And , as Dr Tononi observes , stronger synapses consume more energy .
In addition , making them requires more protein and fats and they take up more space .
Given that an organism has limited supplies of all of these things , something must happen to prevent the cost of having a brain from gradually spiralling out of control .
That something , Dr Tononi believes , is non-rapid eye movement ( non - REM ) or slow - wave sleep .
Knitting up the ravel 'd sleeve of care
Until recently , most sleep research focused on REM sleep .
This is the time when people dream , and dreams have had a grip on the scientific imagination since the days of Freud , and on the popular imagination at least since biblical times .
Lately , though , researchers have started to wonder whether they have been looking in the wrong place for the significance of sleep , for REMming occupies only about a fifth of the night .
During the other 80 % of sleep — the part that is non-REM — the firing pattern of the brain 's nerve cells sets up slow electrical waves that start at different points in the cerebral cortex and travel across it .
These travelling waves occur hundreds of times a night , and most commonly at a frequency , 1 cycle per second , which has been shown to depress the activity of synapses .
Within an hour of a person falling asleep , slow waves will have covered his entire cortex , affecting every nerve cell in it .
At first , these waves are big and powerful , but their size decreases through the night .
Dr Tononi believes that the function of these slow waves is to “ downscale ” synapses , reducing their size , chemical activity and electrical activity — and thus the strength with which they connect their nerve cells together — all over the brain .
The trick , he thinks , is that this downscaling is done in proportion to the existing strength of each synapse .
When a sleeper awakens , the strength of each synapse is thus the same relative to all the others , but all synapses are weaker than they were when he went to sleep .
Indeed , the weakest of them may vanish completely , taking part of the previous day 's memory with them .
In earlier experiments , designed to replicate normal learning , Dr Tononi found that the part of the brain showing most slow - wave activity during sleep was the same as the part that had been activated during the experiment .
This fitted the prediction that the downscaling slow - waves would be strongest in those parts of the brain where the most changes had taken place during the day .
The team 's latest work draws not on human subjects , but on fruit flies .
Flies , too , sleep .
Their genetics — including the genetics of sleep — have been studied for almost a century , and many of the genes that play a role in human sleep resemble those that control sleep in fruit flies .
Best of all , experiments on fruit flies are not subject to vetting by ethics committees .
With the help of Chiara Cirelli , who also works at the University of Wisconsin , Dr Tononi has created a mutant fruit fly that sleeps only two or three hours a night .
( A normal fly sleeps between eight and 14 hours . )
The mutation itself is in a gene for a nerve - cell protein of a type known as an ion channel .
Ion channels sit in a cell 's outer membrane and let electrically charged atoms ( ions , as they are known in chemical jargon ) in and out of the cell .
In this case , the ion is potassium .
It is the movement of potassium ( and also sodium ) ions that causes the electrical impulses that nerve cells carry — including the impulses found in slow - wave sleep .
Moreover , the particular protein that the flies lack is most concentrated in brain areas involved in learning and memory .
To nobody 's surprise , therefore , though the mutant fly is capable of learning things , it forgets them within minutes .
Healthy flies retain learned information for hours or even days .
The researchers ' discovery finds an intriguing echo in a human disease called Morvan 's syndrome .
This is a rare brain disorder that is caused by an autoimmune response which destroys the human equivalents of the ion channels that are affected in the mutant fruit fly .
Patients with Morvan 's syndrome suffer from severe insomnia and have been known to go for months without sleeping .
Eventually , this extreme sleep deprivation kills them .
Dr Tononi's hypothesis is , it must be said , controversial .
Many researchers hold almost precisely the opposite opinion — that sleep serves to re-activate synapses that were strengthened during the day , and thus reinforces their strength rather than diminishing it .
There is , however , a certain logical sense to the Tononi view of the world .
It is impossible to remember everything , so a process of winnowing must take place somehow .
The idea that , after a period of expansion , the brain pares back its workforce to become leaner and meaner is somehow rather appealing .
… old people must really be stupid and lazy .
http://www.paulgraham.com/sfp.html is a report on what happens when you give seed capital to 18 - 21 - year - olds so that they can start little tech companies .
My personal theory is that most supranormal profits are the result of people who understand one class of customer better than anyone else .
College - aged kids generally have n’t spent enough time with customers to know anything at all .
They might have a lot of energy , skill , and dedication , but have not seen customers first - hand .
The programmers who built SAP , for example , spent years at IBM doing consulting work .
After having seen 10 + companies ’ problems and built 10 + similar solutions they decided to go off on their own , rewrite it all , package it up , and sell it .
Graham has introduced some bias into the experiment by hand - picking companies to fund .
The teams that he funded were the ones who came to him with the ideas that he liked best .
On the other hand , if these guys are succeeding as well as he suggests it must mean that the competition is very weak .
Who are the competitors ?
Older programmers working in bureaucracies at larger companies , which have strong brands and near - infinite capital .
So basically what Graham is proving is that these folks are incredibly unproductive and their aggregate work product is almost worthless .

telling me that they received a stuffed envelope with coupons rather
then my application .
They informed me that it they are not pleased that
they footed the bill for the crap I sent them .
I reply with " It says
Business Reply Mail "
I 'm suggesting coupons to you to ensure that your
business is more successful .
They promptly hang up on me .
< wolf >
Now , I did this for about a month before it got boring , so I got an
added idea !
I added exactly 33 cents worth of pennies to the envelope
so they paid EXTRA due to the weight .
I got a call informing me about
the money , I said it was a mistake and I demanded my change back .
After
yelling at the clerk and then to the supervisor they agreed to my
demands and cut me a check for the money .
I hold in my hand at this
very moment a check from GTE Visa for exactly 33 cents .

For the longest time nvidia have failed to provide specifications for their hardware or a working free accelerated 3d driver for inclusion with X.org .
Thus leaving the many users of their videocards on popular UN * X systems such as Linux with only the option of using a 2d only driver or using nvidia ' notorious proprietary driver .
With the advent of technological improvements to the underlying system to allow desktop effects this leaves a great number of users out in the cold .
A project does exists to reverse engineer a driver for the existing nvidia cards , however this is a hard task which will require many man hours to complete .
Thus the aim to present the Nouveau team with this no strings attached donation of at least $ 10.000 USD to further their nobel effort in developing this driver .

IF TALK of synergistic processing elements , parallel floating - point shader pipelines , vector units and 1080 p high - definition video sets your pulse racing , you are probably looking forward to the launch of the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) , Sony 's new video - game console , which goes on sale in Japan and America next month .
Most people find such technical trivia baffling , however .
As a result , the video - games industry 's relentless pursuit of ever more computing power and graphical detail might ultimately prove counterproductive .
That is the view of Satoru Iwata ( pictured ) , the president of Nintendo , the Japanese company that dominated video - gaming in the 1980s before being deposed by Sony .
Its new console , called the Wii , is also launched next month .
But it is a very different beast from the PS3 , inspired by a radically different strategy .
Video gaming is a cyclical industry in which new consoles are launched every five or six years .
In the last cycle , which began in 2000 , Sony 's PlayStation 2 emerged as the clear victor , far outselling Microsoft 's Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube .
The next cycle will pitch Microsoft's Xbox 360 , launched last year , against the PS3 and the Wii .
With each cycle the power of the hardware increases , making possible better graphics and more complex games .
But Mr Iwata believes the industry has reached a crossroads : by designing products for existing gamers and neglecting non-gamers , it undermines the prospects for future growth .
There have even been signs in Japan that the market was starting to shrink .
“ We need something radical to change the situation , ” says Mr Iwata .
The main problem with modern games , he says , is that they require players to invest enormous amounts of time .
As lifestyles have become busier , leaving less time for gaming , the industry has moved towards epic games which take dozens of hours to complete .
This is leading some occasional gamers to stop playing and deterring non-gamers from giving it a try , says Mr Iwata .
There are other factors too : novices are put off by the need to master complex controllers , festooned with buttons , triggers and joysticks .
And not everyone wants to escape into a fantasy gaming world .
“ That attracts avid gamers , ” he says , but can make it “ difficult for people to become interested in games ” .
Nintendo set out to reach beyond existing gamers and expand the market .
This would involve simpler games that could be played for a few minutes at a time and would appeal to non-gamers or casual gamers ( who play simple games on the web but would not dream of buying a console ) .
They would be based on new , easy - to - use controls .
And they would rely on real - life rather than escapist scenarios .
This was not an entirely new approach : dancing games that use cameras or dance mats as controllers have proved popular in recent years .
But Nintendo began to design entire games consoles around such ideas .
The testing - ground for Nintendo's new strategy was the DS , a handheld console launched in 2004 .
It has two screens , one of which is touch - sensitive and can be tapped or written on with fingernails or a stylus .
This made possible games that did not rely on complicated combinations of buttons .
“ We did n't know , if the DS did n't make it , what kind of products would be needed , ” says Mr Iwata .
But in the event the DS was a smash hit and has sold more than 21 m units worldwide .
This month Nintendo raised its profit forecast for the current year because of unexpectedly strong sales of DS consoles and software .
The most popular DS game is “ Nintendogs ” , in which the player takes dogs for walks , teaches them tricks and enters them in competitions .
The dogs can be taught to respond to voice commands issued via the DS 's built - in microphone and petted via the touch screen .
“ Nintendogs ” has proved particularly popular with female players .
Also successful are the “ Brain Training ” games , which consist of puzzles designed to keep the player 's brain young and nimble .
Unlike most games , which sell well for a few weeks before sales tail off , “ Brain Training ” sold consistently for months , and Nintendo 's research found that 60 % of sales in Japan were to new users who bought DS consoles specifically to play it .
Just as “ Nintendogs ” appealed to female gamers , “ Brain Training ” has helped to bring gaming to an older audience .
The Wii is an attempt to apply the lessons of the DS to a fixed console that plugs into the television .
Its key innovation is its wand - like controller , which resembles a simplified TV remote - control rather than the usual button - strewn joypad .
Motion detectors translate the movement of the wand into on - screen action , making possible tennis , fishing and sword - fighting games .
( Some games use an add - on controller held in the other hand . )
The Wii can also display news and weather information from the internet , organised alongside the games as a series of “ channels ” .
Old games from Nintendo's back catalogue can be downloaded to draw in lapsed gamers .
This is , admittedly , a harder sell than the DS , says Mr Iwata , since a portable console lends itself to word - of - mouth promotion .
His hope is that existing gamers will act as ambassadors , encouraging friends and family to give the Wii a try .
And by providing non-gaming functions such as news and weather too , the aim is to overcome non-gamers ' aversion to consoles , so that eventually they might flick to the “ games ” channel and give something a try .
The contrast with Sony is striking .
It is pushing the PS3 as the most advanced console , with a powerful new processor chip and a high - definition “ Blu- ray ” optical drive .
But its complexity has so far proved a liability rather than an asset , pushing up its price ( to $ 500 , compared with $ 249 for the Wii ) and delaying its launch by several months .
The PS3 will not appear in Europe until next March , and the console will be in very short supply for months .
This week Sony said its profits in the latest quarter had been wiped out by PS3 problems and a massive recall of faulty batteries supplied to other computer - makers .
This has dented Sony 's reputation just as it is trying to emphasise its technical prowess .
The industry had been preparing for a showdown between Sony , the current champion , and Microsoft , its deep - pocketed challenger .
Nintendo was expected to be an also - ran , peddling its familiar game brands , such as Mario and Zelda , to children and die - hard fans .
But its unusual new strategy means that Nintendo is now the company to watch .
As it sets out to broaden the gaming population , Nintendo is not fighting against Sony and Microsoft , says Mr Iwata .
Its real enemy is the indifference that many people still feel towards gaming .
Of course , says Mr Iwata , he would be happy if Nintendo became the leading console - maker again as a result of its new approach .
But a victory over Sony and Microsoft in a shrinking market , he says , would not be a victory at all .

BBC News , Washington
With electronic stun guns now being used by a growing number of UK police forces , BBC News examines the controversy in North America , where a series of deaths have put Tasers under fresh scrutiny .
Robert Bagnell died after police shocked him with 50,000 volts
When Robert Bagnell died in Canada last June , his family were told he had suffered a probable cocaine overdose .
The truth emerged in fits and starts , however .
They eventually learned that police had jolted him with 50,000 volts of electricity from a Taser gun .
Officers said they had to subdue Mr Bagnell to save him from a fire .
But a year on , questions over his death are still unanswered , while concerns over the safety of stun guns refuse to go away .
The " less - than - lethal " weapons have been involved in 74 deaths in the United States and Canada , according to Amnesty International .
These reports clearly indicate that the Taser technology , while not risk - free , is among the safest use - of - force options our law enforcement officers have

It also claims Tasers have been used gratuitously - against children or the elderly or on people posing no real threat .
In a sign of mounting concern over the effects of the weapons , Chicago police halted deployment of Tasers in February after a teenager suffered cardiac arrest and a man died after being stunned .
For Patti Gillman - Robert Bagnell 's sister - too many mistakes are being made .
" It is far more than a coincidence that my brother was shot by a Taser , then died of a heart failure .
" We believe he was having a seizure at the time police stunned him .
But he was unarmed , not posing a threat .
" The first response should have been medical attention , not assaulting him with a weapon . "
Vancouver police say they are still awaiting a final report into the death , but believe stun guns are safe to use .
Tasers ' relatively safe '
The widely used M26 Taser gun delivers a 50,000 - volt shock through two barbed darts , which incapacitate people for five seconds .
The effects of the Taser gun are felt by officers training with it
Rick Smith , CEO of Taser International , says that while it is " not risk - free " it is " among the safest use - of - force options our law enforcement officers have " .
He blames Amnesty 's report for a downturn in business which has seen Taser 's stock lose more than 60 % of its value in the first quarter of this year , wiping $ 1.4bn off its market value .
In a statement he said : " Anyone living in the real world in which law enforcement officers worldwide have to make split - second life or death decisions knows that Amnesty International 's report and position is out of step with the needs of law enforcement concerning our proven life - saving technology . "
A report in March by the US Potomac Institute for Policy Studies said current research suggested stun guns were " relatively safe " when used appropriately .
It noted that in all the cases in the Amnesty report , other factors like drug use and pre-existing heart conditions could also have led to the deaths .
But the institute called for more research , particularly in understanding exactly how the weapons work on the body - and what the long - term side effects could be .
' Learn from mistakes '
Meanwhile , the US National Institute of Justice ( NIJ ) is funding several studies in to what is describes as " less lethal weapons issues " .
I hope the British police , having given Canada and the US a bit of a head start , will tread carefully and learn from our mistakes
Patti Gillman
Q&A : The stun gun
Last September it gave a $ 490,000 grant to the University of Wisconsin to study the effects of electro - muscular devices and how electrical currents move through the body .
It is also funding a International Association of Chiefs of Police study on best practice in use of the weapons .
The moves come as a number of UK police forces - where officers are not routinely armed - are embracing the weapons .
In May , a Police Review survey of 100 officers found 80 % thought that all officers on frontline duties should be issued with stun guns .
More than half the public also want to see Tasers being deployed , according to the magazine , which polled 1,000 citizens .
The UK Home Office believes Tasers are safe to use , but says their use should be restricted to firearms - trained officers .
Patti Gillman , still searching for answers on her brother 's death , sounded a cautionary note .
" The Taser issue is controversial in Canada only in certain circles , but is mostly ignored by the mainstream public , " she said .
" But I suppose it 's only background noise to most , until it enters your life as it did ours .
" I hope the British police , having given Canada and the US a bit of a head start , will tread carefully and learn from our mistakes . "

COVER STORY
My Racial Education ( Part I )
Personal accounts of what led AR readers to racial consciousness
The White Children Were Totally Unprepared
I grew up in a white neighborhood in Akron , Ohio .
I watched “ The Little Rascals ” on TV , and the black child on this program was my only exposure to blacks .
In 1961 , I graduated from grade school and was happy to be going to Jennings Junior High School , which also served a small section of a black neighborhood .
Finally , I was going to have black friends .
I do n’t remember my parents having any opinion about the school , or about blacks .
They told me that when I was a baby , Mom had a black lady who helped with chores .
They also told me the lady got into a fight with her husband and bit off one of his fingers , but they told this story in a way that did not degrade blacks .
So here I am , walking to school , excited at the thought of new adventure .
I was also a little shy and nervous .
As I got near the school , which was located just inside the black neighborhood , I started seeing blacks .
Then I heard screams and yelling like I had never heard before .
I could see a group of agitated blacks swarming like bees .
I was uneasy and moved to the opposite side of the street .
There were white children watching at a distance , and I asked what the blacks were doing .
Someone said this group of 15 to 20 blacks was attacking a white child .
There were so many blacks I could not see the person they were attacking .
I had never seen such a frenzy , and was quick to get into the safety of the school .
I never heard what happened to that white child ; maybe he is an AR subscriber now .
The school turned out to be anything but safe .
Although only 20 percent of the students were black , they all stuck together as a race , and they had control .
All of them had flunked at least once , some twice , and one was reported to be 19 years old .
Lunch time was pure hell .
Blacks would get in the lunch line and intimidate the whites into buying them lunch .
Some blacks would simply wait until a white child sat down to eat , and then take his lunch from him .
When you left the lunch room you had to walk down a hall that was flanked by blacks on both sides .
The intimidation was so great that many whites gave up money and other valuables without objection .
The white children had come from completely different backgrounds , and were totally unprepared for this kind of treatment .
Several times a year all the students were sent to stand by their lockers while teachers patted you down and searched your locker .
My teacher told me they could n’t search and take weapons from blacks without searching us , too .
One day , a black kid named Roger was tormenting a white kid .
I was hearing it all and was so fed up with it !
Without thinking , I got up and attacked Roger , beating him only as well as a 7th grader could .
I survived the rest of the day without being mobbed , but I went home and made some crude weapons .
I found a steel bar in my dad ’s shop to use as a club , and shaped one end of it into a handle .
I also cut a piece of chain in case I needed to extend my reach .
I went to school the next day and waited for the attack , since blacks had a history of ganging up on whites .
The weapons would not save me , but I was n’t going to go down without doing as much damage as possible .
To my surprise , the blacks slapped me on the back , and called me “ Roger ’s Man . ”
All the blacks knew me , and I got their protection .
This came as quite a surprise , and saved a lot of money .
The other white kids had to pay for protection .
Apparently , the blacks were so stunned that a white would fight , that they gave me free protection .
I was the oldest of five children , and my parents were not going to let us all go through three years of this school , so we moved to the country .
What amazes me to this day is that in 1960 a 20 - percent black population could terrorize the whole school .
All the school officials were white .
They must have been in as much fear as we were .
It was my experience with blacks at Jennings Junior High that formed my racial views .

A Genuine Lefty
I began as a genuine lefty : member of the ACLU and People for the American Way , contributor to the Southern Poverty Law Center , and a subscriber to the Washington Post Weekly Edition , The New Republic , The Nation , etc .
My conversion to reality was incremental , though not all increments were equal .
Three events remain strongly in my memory , so I will credit them with my conversion , although they may only be representative of many similar events .
(1) Decades ago I read in the Washington Post Weekly Edition a story written by a woman on the editorial staff .
It described how a group of young blacks had invaded her “ fashionable Georgetown home , ” burgled the place , beat up and hog - tied her husband , and gang - raped her .
She wrote of how , during the oral - sex phase of the gang - rape , she told her attackers her mouth was too dry to continue .
They brought her a glass of water and “ touchingly ” waited for her to drink it so she could continue .
Her view was that these were poor , oppressed victims of white villainy , striking out in the only way they knew how , and she refused to cooperate in their apprehension and prosecution .
Such idiocy led me to believe there was something sick about American liberalism .
(2) In 1993 I was living in South Texas .
I worked late one evening , and as I was driving home in the dark a carload of Mexican kids forced me off the road and attacked me with baseball bats .
They nearly killed me .
Of the many cars that drove by , one elderly couple stopped , and with flashing lights and honking horn , scared the Mexicans away .
The couple was , of course , white .
They were apologetic for having wisely stayed in their car with the doors locked , but since they probably saved my life I felt extremely grateful to them .
The Mexican cop who arrived found my situation humorous , and chuckled and spoke Spanish with the emergency medical technicians ( Mexican also ) who treated me .
At the hospital , X - rays showed that , amazingly , my skull was not fractured .
I had a concussion , a lacerated cornea , and needed 30 - odd stitches to resecure my scalp , but I lived .
To follow up on my case I was to contact “ Sgt. Rodriguez . ”
I called a dozen times , but he was never there and never returned my calls .
A friend from work knew a former Texas Ranger , then a private investigator .
The PI laughed at me for going through channels .
The police report had pretty well described the perpetrators ( thanks to the elderly couple — I was a little foggy ) and the car , including license number .
He suggested that for $ 500 he could get another Mexican gang to kill my assailants .
I did n’t care to end up in front of a Mexican jury , so I tried to put the whole thing out of my mind .
It cost me about $ 1,000 in medical expenses after my insurance paid its share .
(3) Growing up among the historical markers in Middle Tennessee , I became an amateur War Between the States historian at the age of seven ( when I bought R. S. Henry ’s Story of the Confederacy ) .
I have continued to collect books and artifacts of the Confederacy ever since .
Many of my ancestors fought for the Confederacy .
While browsing the Internet one day in the late 1990s , I stumbled across the story of the vandalization of Robert E. Lee ’s portrait in Richmond .
I have read a great deal about Lee , and was outraged .
Via the Internet I found American Renaissance , the Council of Conservative Citizens , Nationalist Times , Southern Patriot , etc. and have not turned back .
My older brother and father are cowards .
They live in the hills , isolated ( for the time being ) from the real world .
When I bring up , even obliquely , what is happening to our country their ears fold forward and they tremble in horror , as if the FBI had bugged every space in America and will throw people into jail just for listening to non-PC opinions .
I am afraid most white Americans share the mentality of my brother and father .
I am not hopeful .
Perhaps ignorance is bliss .

What Pushed Me Over the Edge
My racial consciousness had been quietly forming for years before I became fully aware of the fallacy of egalitarianism and the folly of integration .
What pushed me over the edge were the differing reactions of blacks and whites to the O. J. Simpson verdict .
Terrence Silva , Columbus , Ohio
Assumptions Put to the Test
Like most white Americans , I was taught to believe in assimilation .
I felt a certain sympathy for blacks because I thought many were treated badly .
I sincerely believed integration and civil rights would let blacks compete successfully in American society , and that the only thing holding them back was racism .
These assumptions were put to the test when I moved to the San Francisco Bay area , and on three different occasions was subject to criminal attacks or harassment by blacks .
Once I was almost raped by a young black man .
Another time I got into a physical confrontation with one .
I was also held up at gun point by a black man and his Hispanic girlfriend .
Later I moved from the Bay Area to a safer part of the state , and tried to put those incidents behind me , but I was reminded once again of the incompatibility of blacks and whites by two pivotal events : the riots in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict , and the O.J. Simpson trial .
The riots in LA stunned me as I watched a cowardly white - run government cave in to arson , looting , and the wanton murder of whites .
It was also instructive to see that the only people who had the sense to defend themselves were Koreans who — unhindered by white guilt — armed themselves and stood guard over their businesses .
They did not apologize for wanting to survive nor did they scurry off like rats when the riots were over .
This is what whites have been reduced to : A population in a constant state of flight .
Even more enlightening was the O.J. Simpson trial and its aftermath .
I watched much of the much of the trial on television .
Mr. Simpson was obviously guilty but he got away with it because he was black , rich , and could afford to hire the best lawyers who blatantly used race to deflect attention from the evidence .
As I watched blacks cheer the verdict , I realized that these people hate us .
And they hate us because we are white .
Who planted that hatred and nourishes it even today via the media , academia , and the government ?
That would be America ’s ruling class .
One can only conclude that , white or not , America ’s ruling class hates white people nearly as much as any minority group does .
Some of them may look like us , but they are not us .
There are calls for breaking away and forming a new country , and that may be our last hope .
Barring that , I see whites disappearing as they interbreed , are killed off by minorities , or are reduced to a state of servitude by our ruling class .
Many whites are so blinded by guilt that they can hardly wait to sign up for their own destruction .
What do I have in common with these people even if they are white ?
Nothing .

‘ What a Bunch of Weirdo Nazis ! ’
I am the child of two professors , who are , like most of their profession , dogmatically multiculturalist .
From 1993 to 2002 , I was a graduate student in comparative literature , and when I started out , I agreed with the Marxist , deconstructionist , multiculturalist intellectual orientation of the field .
Although I soon began to be irritated by the mindless celebration of diversity , the lack of intellectual rigor , and the obscurantism of my field , it was not until much later that I started seriously to doubt the orthodox view of race that is at the basis of all contemporary work in literary studies .
Race is a major preoccupation of today ’s literary critics .
Look at any one of the countless introductions to literary theory , and you will find at least one chapter devoted to work on the representation of race in literature .
Such literary criticism , whose premises are unchallenged within the field , is devoted to exposing the ways in which whites have misrepresented people of other races in the interests of dominating them .
For literary critics , racial differences are entirely the result of our cultural history , and they see it as their duty to change our culture in ways that will make these differences disappear .
My shift away from racial orthodoxy began when I became familiar with evolutionary psychology , the field that argues that all aspects of human behavior have an innate cause and that culture merely influences the unfolding of our innate nature .
I began to go to conferences and read Internet discussion groups that dealt with evolutionary psychology .
J. P. Rushton , Glayde Whitney , and Charles Murray regularly posted on Ian Pitchford ’s evolutionary psychology listserv , where other research on human racial differences , such as that of Richard Lynn , was discussed .
I read some of the books of these thinkers .
Although I felt a bemused revulsion for them at first , I soon came to realize how plausible they were .
I read other books about the links between genetics and behavior , and learned that all human personality traits show substantial heritability ; even how we hold our hands , how often we laugh , and the strength of our religious beliefs appear to be heritable .
So , when you see that there is an average difference of 15 points between the IQs of American whites and American blacks , and of 25 points between American whites and African blacks , the conclusion that at least some of this variance must be due to biology naturally follows .
The same conclusion follows from the large and well - documented variances between whites and blacks in criminal behavior .
I started to realize that my culture is founded on a massive denial of the truth that is sustained by what must be the most pervasive and successful propaganda campaign in history .
I began to notice confirmations of the ideas of the “ racist scientists ” in the world around me .
For example , as J. P. Rushton shows , blacks are higher in self - esteem than whites and willing to deny the most obvious facts about the world in order to maintain their high opinions of themselves .
I witnessed a striking instance of this trait .
I taught an English composition class , and I had many black students .
A few were decent , and a very few even outstanding students , but most were not .
About half were abysmally dull and unteachable , but they had no problems finding ways to blame me for their troubles .
Slowly , I came to realize the true meaning of black culture .
Although I live in a neighborhood of downtown Buffalo that is still majority - white , the ghettoes are very close , and one feels their influence everywhere .
Blacks had heckled me many times , had bullied me once , and even mugged me once .
But I had not reflected on these experiences before I started reading about race .
I now became fully conscious of the insecurity and disgust that my neighborhood inspired in me .
Blacks were the primary reasons for these feelings , but I found the Hispanics and Arabs who also congregated in my neighborhood scarcely better .
I also began to notice the genetic deterioration in our society .
My neighborhood thronged with the retarded , alcoholics , drug addicts , and the homeless , who were housed in downtown “ group homes . ”
It added to the offense that rich bureaucrats who lived in upper - class neighborhoods would put these people in my midst and keep them away from their own homes .
It horrified me that these people might be reproducing .
I am amazed that people consider eugenic sterilization inhumane , but do n’t consider it inhumane to subject residents of downtown neighborhoods to a parade of freaks .
Were these people — the blacks , Arabs , Hispanics , the handicapped , and the homeless — making my life richer and more vibrant , as liberal propaganda claimed they were ?
I had been inclined to think so before .
I had thought it rather romantic to live in such a cosmopolitan environment , and I had even taken a sort of pleasure in the presence of freaks .
But I came to realize that I had never genuinely enjoyed the daily sight of these people ; they were offensive , discouraging , and alienating .
The vibrancy and richness that remained came from the white people who were still clinging to their downtown neighborhoods .
The consequence of the American racial problem that was most personally relevant to me was its utter desolation of the humanities .
When I started graduate school , I thought multiculturalist activism in literary studies was a peripheral phenomenon .
Surely , underneath it all , I thought , remained some of the great intelligence that one sees in the classic works of literary scholarship written before the 1970s .
For nine long years , I persisted in the belief that there was something at the core of my field that was worthwhile .
But when I finally finished my Ph.D. , after having written a 350 - page dissertation on Scott and Byron , published three research papers in scholarly journals , and gained the respect and friendship of the most intelligent people in the field , I realized I had been wrong .
In fact , it was the intelligent people who were at the periphery of the field ; the core was rotten .
People in my field have , by and large , ceased to be interested in producing interesting and challenging readings of texts .
Rather , literary studies boils down to a competition among whites in which each tries to prove that he loves blacks more than his colleagues do .
After reading hundreds of vapid books and articles in academic journals , I concluded that the only way to get ahead in today ’s academy was to argue that some classic literary text was even more racist than previous critics had believed .
I had no interest in spending any more time in such an abominably trivial community .
Like a few other people in literary studies , I had tried to integrate the interpretation of literature with evolutionary psychology .
I found that evolutionary psychology had the potential to bring about a sea-change in the interpretation of literature because it offers theories of sexual behavior , social relations , perception , and language that are vastly more interesting and well - grounded than the established ones .
As an example , I wrote an article that examined the way in which innate aggressive impulses were reconciled with modern norms forbidding violence in the historical novels of Scott .
The evolutionary psychologists that I talked to took such interpretations to be obviously plausible , but I could never get most of my colleagues to grant my premise that a biological human nature existed , no matter how much hard evidence I gave them .
There are many reasons why people reject evolutionary psychology , but surely the primary reason is that multiculturalists believe that once people start thinking seriously about the biology of human behavior , they will start to have subversive ideas about the causes of racial differences .
They are right about this ; that had , in fact , been my own experience .
I came to realize that I was in a field that had effectively barred the way against any progress in the understanding of its subject matter , because of its practitioners ’ need to uphold the dogma of racial equality .
I found that , in order to be accepted in literary studies today , one must not only tolerate the fallacious view of race that inspires so much of the work in the field , but one must actively affirm it .
The academy is pervaded by a nasty , policing atmosphere .
My colleagues were always prying to make sure that I held the correct view of race .
A conversational gambit they frequently use is asking someone how his ideas relate to racial issues .
A propos of nothing , literary critics say things like , “ Well , I think we should bring race into this discussion ” or “ We should look at that argument from a post - colonial perspective . ”
I became aware of AR ’s website in 2001 , late in my graduate career .
I learned of it through one of my evolutionary psychology listservs .
At that time , even though I had come to accept the reality of racial differences in behavior , I had not yet accepted the idea of a political project based on these ideas .
My initial reaction to AR was therefore the same as my initial reaction to so - called “ racist science ” — bemused revulsion .
The first thing I remember reading on the website was an article called “ Rearing Honorable White Children . ”
It was about families that had entirely seceded from American culture because they could no longer recognize it as having anything to do with themselves .
They discouraged their children from watching television and blocked out most of the programming that came in through it because they did n’t want their children to be exposed to our culture ’s massively distorted values .
Instead , during the evening they played chess , watched classic films , and read and listened to classic Western literature and music .
They home - schooled their children because they hated the anti-white atmosphere of our schools , and did not want their children to consort with the children of criminals .
My initial reaction , which had been programmed into me by years of multiculturalist propaganda , was , “ What a bunch of weirdo Nazis ! ”
But my impulse as an intellectual , an impulse that is so rarely in evidence in the academy today , is to get past the obvious and ready - made reaction , and to consider problems with some objectivity , to try to see things from a different perspective .
And I realized that I could n’t stand most of what was on TV either , that I disliked the version of history taught at American schools , and that what these parents enjoyed — playing chess , reading 19th century literature , listening to Beethoven — was exactly what I enjoyed doing myself .
These people were , in fact , very much like me .
Not only that , they were like many of the white intellectuals I knew who had never doubted the orthodox view of race .
My father , for example , is a professor of religious studies who is always going off to Africa or the Caribbean to teach blacks “ liberation theology , ” a sort of commingling of Marxism and Christianity .
But what does he do in the evening ?
Listen to rap music ?
Watch Martin Lawrence movies ?
No , he reads Dickens , plays chess , and listens to the great 19th century German composers .
Without knowing it , he too acts according to a spirit of racial loyalty , and while the expressed purpose of his life is to liberate blacks , he has no real sympathy with their lives and culture .
After I finished my Ph.D. last summer , I took a job doing low - level office work .
I do n’t like the pay , and I do n’t like the tedium , but I do like the anonymity .
No one cares what I think , so no one pressures me to engage in ritualistic affirmations of multicultural dogma , as I was forced to do in the academy .
So I bide my time , wondering whether I am just a disappointed and bewildered crank approaching middle age or the harbinger of a coming Renaissance .

Yggdrasil Caught My Attention
I am from a small town in the Pacific Northwest and had almost no contact with people of other races until after age 21 .
I am in my forties now .
I was completely “ liberal ” about race until my early thirties .
I was aware since my teens that the average IQ score of blacks is 15 points lower than that of whites , but I thought the cause was cultural factors .
I remember thinking that there are different subspecies ( races ) of birds , but they all fly well even if they have distinctive colors , and that it was therefore unlikely that different races of people would have a significant difference in the most essential characteristic of humans : intelligence .
In my upbringing race was never mentioned at all .
My family hardly ever spoke about politics , either , but I am sure they were Democrats .
When I was a child I remember seeing television footage of black protesters being pushed back with fire hoses , and hearing that they were excluded from Southern “ whites - only ” restaurants .
I remember thinking that we Yankees were morally superior , since it was obvious that all you had to do to get along with black people was treat them courteously and fairly .
I learned Spanish and went to live in Mexico for a year after dropping out of college .
I was amazed at the corruption .
I had to pay many bribes to police despite having done nothing wrong .
Ordinary people were very dishonest , too .
I do n’t remember thinking about immigration at all .
This was the early 1980s , before immigration became really massive .
I was still “ liberal ” on race but I was n’t afraid to recognize negative cultural differences between us and Mexicans .
When I returned to the US I found people were uncomfortable if I told them about my experiences with corruption , even though I refrained from making any racial or cultural generalizations .
I moved to the Southwest and attended a trade school that was about 40 percent black .
That was the first time I had been around large numbers of black people .
I dated black women and even wound up living with one for three years .
Race was not a factor in our eventual break up and ( thank goodness ! ) we had no children .
At that time I worked in a company where 50 percent of the workers were black .
My opinion of black people was starting to erode but I still clung to the idea that blacks are culturally deprived .
Ebonics and cursing grated on me , but I attributed all “ differences ” to social class and deprivation .
I can remember a few incidents that roused the first traces of race - consciousness .
I remember telling a dirty joke to one of my black co-workers , which included the word “ prostitute , ” and it dawned on me that he did n’t know the meaning of the word !
I know he understood the concept because he once invited me to go look for “ hos ” after work , which I found repugnant .
I once told another black co-worker I had lived in Mexico and spoke Spanish , and it became clear he did n’t know where Mexico was , and did n’t know that Mexican - Americans speak Spanish rather than “ Mexican . ”
He also did n’t know the locations of any of the states in the Pacific Northwest .
The change in my thinking was taking place on a more or less unconscious level .
I was still living with my black girlfriend .
She had an IQ of 105 and spoke Standard English , so gave me no reasons to re-examine my thinking , but I do remember something that made me wonder whether our relationship was a good idea .
I was watching a television talk show about racially - mixed people , and a woman in the audience said she was mixed because some slave master raped one of his female slaves .
It occurred to me that she probably knew nothing about her ancestors , and that it was just as likely she had an ancestor who was a prostitute impregnated by a white customer .
It was striking to me that even mixed - race people demonize whites .
I could imagine my great - great - grandchildren with this black woman being just as anti-white , and saying they were mixed because I had raped her .
Some time after I broke up with her I got a new job in a place with full - blown affirmative action .
The workforce was 80 percent black , in an area that was about 20 percent black .
Management was 80 percent black , too , and blacks seemed to feel freer to be themselves in such an environment .
Every day I would hear the word “ mother - f*r ” shouted out within 30 seconds of coming to work .
I once saw a middle - aged black man pantomime anal rape , saying “ Ah’m gonna be oooon yo’ ass , m*f*r , Ah’m gonna be f*ing on yo ’ mother - f*ing ass ! ! ”
I had been making allowances for blacks but now I began to see an unmistakable , dramatic difference between blacks and whites of the same socioeconomic class .
Affirmative action completed my mental transformation .
I had uncritically accepted the media view that it was an extra effort to search for qualified minorities , but at this new job it was obviously about lowering standards .
I saw a white man with a BA passed over for a promotion that went to a black nincompoop who must have had an IQ of 75 .
I was enraged at how the mass media insist whites are not hurt by affirmative action .
My first full - blown heretical thought was : “ They really are as stupid as they sound ! ! ”
I started looking for information — on the Internet because I did n’t want to have to explain ordering a “ racist ” book in a bookstore .
I started lurking in the Usenet group alt.politics.nationalism.white .
The posts of someone calling himself Yggdrasil caught my attention and I started collecting them .
I had been thinking of getting some of the books he mentioned , and by chance I came across a couple of them in a used book store .
The first racialist book I read was Jared Taylor ’s Paved with Good Intentions and the next was America Balkanized by Brent Nelson .
Since that time , almost ten years ago , my interest in ethnic conflict has prompted me to read about 200 books , though many of them are on broader subjects , like general political science .
I have n’t had much success in changing anybody ’s mind .
I ’ve tried talking with relatives about immigration but it just makes them uncomfortable .
Most people are committed to conformity .
I did get one person to read about a dozen carefully selected books , but his reaction was very odd .
He started babbling about how at one time the Irish were n’t even considered white , which was hilarious because none of the books said anything about the Irish .
It was like trying to deprogram a cult member .
I have moved back to the Pacific Northwest .
Anonymous
I Was a Red-Diaper - Baby
If the definition of a liberal is someone who has never been mugged , then to know my history is to understand my political journey .
I was a red - diaper - baby .
That is , my father was a card - carrying member of the Communist Party USA .
Years later , he came partly to his senses , but remained a liberal on all issues , including race .
Predictably , my parents encouraged their children to go forth and enjoy the multi-racial joys of New York City .
I even marched with Martin Luther King when he made his famous speech , but his dream became our nightmare .
Multi-racialism resulted in a private , and on some level deserved , holocaust for my family and me .
I am the eldest of five .
One of my sisters , who was 13 at the time , was raped when she attended a party on our block .
One of the blacks repeatedly asked her to go upstairs to see his apartment .
After several rejections , he accused my sister of racism .
As a well - indoctrinated , guilt - ridden liberal , she had no choice but to go with him .
Out of fear and shame , my sister did not share her story with us until she landed in a mental ward a couple of years later .
Another sister was raped by a black open - enrollment “ student ” at City College in a locker room after she attended a co-ed swim class .
The prosecuting attorney told my sister it was an open - and - shut case because she did everything she was supposed to do :
She reported the event immediately , gave a detailed description of the accused ( including a bizarrely shaped goatee ) , and then went directly to the hospital .
However , after all the evidence was given , when the jury was polled , the whites voted to convict , but the tribe hung together and hung the jury .
Ironically , before her trial even began , another black tried to rape her in the elevator of her own building .
He entered the elevator after her , and sent it down to the basement .
There he cut her neck and was about to have his way with her , when someone luckily brought the elevator back up .
The following term , when my sister attended her first political science class , she found that the black who had raped her after the swim class was to be her classmate .
She marched off to the administration office in a fury , where she loudly threatened to sue the school for its lack of security .
They settled then and there by agreeing to pay for her to complete her education in Israel .
My mother ’s wrist was broken when an African American relieved her of her pocketbook .
I , myself , had a gun at my head twice on the streets of New York when blacks mugged me .
During the period of my family ’s holocaust in the late ‘ 60s and early ‘ 70s , I was starting my career as a teacher at George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn .
It had recently opened as the city ’s first deliberately - integrated high school .
At first , it offered a good education , but I was struck by the differences in the abilities , work ethic , and behavior of the races .
I also noticed that the students segregated themselves in the cafeteria .
Integration can be defined as the period from when the first black moves in until the last white moves out .
As the school began to tip in the expected direction , there was racial violence and several race riots .
This festering condition culminated in the infamous Day of Knives .
On the last day of the school year , as the students were going home , many blacks menaced their white classmates with knives , and warned them not to come back .
The whites got the message and stayed away .
I served as dean of boys during the last of my eight years at that school .
We averaged five arrests a day out of a student body of about 3,000 .
One of my duties was to convince fearful parents of victims to press charges .
Every day a paddy wagon came from the local precinct to process the day ’s catch .
Sometimes we ran out of handcuffs .
There were junkies nodding out in the cafeteria , and the aroma of pot was everywhere .
It seemed as if more students roamed the halls than attended class .
Every six weeks or so , a teacher could be expected to be sent to the hospital .
I remember one young handicapped woman who walked with a cane .
Someone pushed her down the stairs , and she did not come back until the following year .
After only a few days someone pushed her down the stairs again .
She never came back .
I also recall the day a substitute cop was assigned to my office .
At first , he put his feet up on the desk and expressed pleasure with such an easy assignment .
By the end of the day he was complaining he was working harder than a desk sergeant .
One Senior Day started with water pistol battles , graduated to entire waste baskets full of water , and then fire extinguishers .
The school had to be evacuated because the water was ankle deep .
In one five month period , five of our students had either committed murder or had been murdered .
One teacher who was assigned to the school left for lunch on his first day and never came back .
By the 1980s I had developed an interest in the race question .
My family and former friends would call it an obsession .
They typically dealt with The Problem by running away from it .
To me , how liberal a person is on the topic is usually a function of his geographic distance from it .
I have always been interested in statistics , and my first exposure to racial stats came when I was watching a television program about the Bernie Goetz case .
[ Mr. Goetz was a white New Yorker who shot several young blacks who were trying to mug him . ]
I was stunned when the announcer said blacks were ten times more likely to commit a violent crime than whites — stunned not by the number , but to learn that this information was available and being discussed .
I sent for the transcript , and found myself compiling a collection of articles on crime .
My next great discovery was Charles Murray ’s Losing Ground .
In 1992 , I learned about Jared Taylor ’s Paved with Good Intentions from the Bob Grant radio program .
The rest , as they say , is history .
It has not been easy for me as a New York Jew , embracing the views that I do .
I am regarded as a pariah when I express myself .
Mostly by choice , I am estranged from my family .
My comrades are my gentile wife and retired former colleagues who have shared my professional experiences and who have drawn similar conclusions from their observations .

BOOK REVIEW
Heart of Darkness
A portrait of the African mind .
Heike Behrend , Alice Lakwena & the Holy Spirits Translated by Mitch Cohen , Ohio University Press , 1999 , 210 pp. , $ 19.95 ( softcover )
Africa is a great repository of what could be called archeology of the human mind .
Beliefs and superstitions that have largely disappeared elsewhere are still common , and occasionally make their way into brief newspaper accounts of witches being burned in South Africa , “ penis snatchers ” in Nigeria , and magical cures for AIDS in Ivory Coast .
Only rarely does this sort of thing get serious book - length treatment , which makes Heike Behrend ’s account of the Holy Spirit movement in Uganda so welcome .
Prof. Behrend , who teaches anthropology at the University of Cologne in Germany , writes in a disjointed , jargon - bound way , but she has given us as full a picture as we are likely to get of a fascinating contemporary example of mass delusion .
In brief , this is the story of Alice Auma , a perfectly ordinary Ugandan peasant woman , who became possessed by spirits , raised a rebel army of some 10,000 soldiers , and came close to overthrowing the government of Yowri Museveni .
Miss Auma ’s story moves from one fantastic episode to another , like an opera plot , but as Prof .
Behrend makes clear , Miss Auma is just one especially piquant character in Africa ’s continuing saga of the weird and outlandish .
Civil Wars
Miss Auma was at the height of her powers from 1987 to 1988 , at a time when northern Uganda was rife with war and banditry .
Prof .
Behrend explains that tribal warfare had been endemic in this part of Africa until the British established order .
After independence , tribal warfare resumed under a different guise , with whichever tribe holding government power using it to enrich itself and persecute enemy tribes .
The Acholi people of northern Uganda , of whom Miss Auma was one , were constant targets of persecution under Idi Amin , Milton Obote , and most recently Yowri Museveni .
In 1985 , one of their own , Tito Okello , took over in a coup , and the Acholi had a six - month go at doing the persecuting before Mr. Museveni drove out Mr. Okello .
The 1980s were a thoroughly awful time for northern Uganda , with war , rebellion , banditry , and routine mass killings .
Miss Auma ’s story begins with that of her father , Severino Lukoya , a colorful figure in his own right .
In 1958 , according to one version of the story , Mr. Lukoya fell from his roof and blacked out .
According to another , his wife beat him into a stupor .
In any case , his soul thereupon went to heaven , where it met Moses and Abraham , had various adventures , and learned that one of Mr. Lukoya ’s several children had been chosen to receive messages from spirits .
When he came to , Mr. Lukoya looked his children over but could not tell which was the chosen one .
Alice Auma was then two years old .
Mr. Lukoya ’s curiosity remained unsatisfied until Jan. 2 , 1985 , when Alice , now almost 30 , began to preach the word of God .
In April , Mr. Lukoya invited all the people in the village to witness this revelation of the chosen child , but they laughed at him .
On May 27 , 1985 , Miss Auma was possessed by a spirit called Lakwena ( meaning “ messenger ” in the Acholi language ) , which spoke through her .
Lakwena claimed to be the soul of a Christian Italian who had died near Murchison Falls about the time of the Second World War , and spoke 74 languages “ including Latin . ”
He ordered Miss Auma to take up healing , to which he gave the name Holy Spirit .
Although she managed a few cures , she was not a great success .
About a year later , Lakwena changed his mind and told her to go to war , explaining that it did no good to heal people if government soldiers were just going to shoot them up anyway .
A few days later , Miss Auma , now known as Alice Lakwena , performed her first military miracle .
Some time before this , an Acholi named Odong Latek had put together a group known as the Uganda People ’s Democratic Army ( UPDA ) .
It was supposed to fight government depredation , but its several hundred men soon took to brigandage .
On August 17 , 1986 , a few UPDA men were chasing a man who took refuge in Miss Auma ’s house .
They took a few shots at her , but the bullets bounced off her body and turned into clouds of smoke .
The men were much impressed .
On the strength of this incident , she asked Odong Latek to turn over his command .
Mr. Latek declined , but did not object when 150 of his men voluntarily joined Miss Auma .
Thus began her command over what became known as the Holy Spirit Mobile Forces .
On Nov. 12 , 1986 , just a few days later , government soldiers attacked her camp but her men routed them .
On Dec. 25 , the Mobile Forces overran a fairly strong government position .
Miss Auma ’s reputation soared and men flocked to join her .
As Prof . Behrend explains , the Holy Spirit movement , with its Christian coloration , was a considerable departure from traditional witchcraft .
According to Acholi tradition , all misfortunes are caused by evildoers using witchcraft .
If someone died fighting the government , it was because someone had bewitched the enemy ’s bullets and steered them into the victim .
If someone died of AIDS , it was because someone cast a spell .
When the dead were buried , a witchdoctor would ask the corpse who caused his death , and the corpse would give a full report .
This was good business for witchdoctors because the deceased would invariably finger some malefactor against whom a witchdoctor had to be hired to seek revenge .
This vicious cycle terrified everyone .
Lakwena , speaking through Miss Auma , ordered a full - scale fight against witchcraft .
His was a Christian movement , and all Holy Spirit fighters were to renounce witchcraft and seek purification through initiation .
The men sat on the ground , praying and singing Catholic hymns .
They then spat in the mouth of a pig , which was supposed to absorb evil just as the Gadarene swine did in the Book of Mark .
The pig was then killed and burned .
There were similar purification rituals before battle , which were supposed to protect the men from enemy bullets .
In like manner , the war against the government was elevated into a fight against the forces of witchcraft , which were said to be the source of the government ’s strength .
All Holy Spirit members had to memorize and abide by a set of 20 Holy Spirit Precautions , which were modeled on The Ten Commandments .
These included prohibitions against cigarettes , alcohol , murder , theft , and quarreling .
HS members were not to kill snakes , eat pork or mutton , or argue with a military commander .
They were also to abstain from adultery and fornication , a prohibition which , as Prof .
Behrend explains , “ presented many soldiers with great difficulties . ”
The 20th Precaution was “ Thou shalt have two testicles , neither more nor less , ” since among the Acholi a man with only one testicle was thought to bring misfortune .
Lakwena stressed that men who kept the rules could not be killed in battle , and that the genuinely pure would be rewarded with a car and a pretty house .
Prof .
Behrend says both the Holy Spirit soldiers and government men liked to watch cheap American action movies and Taiwanese karate films , and got some of their ideas from them .
However , the Holy Spirit ’s military tactics have a heavy African overlay , and were perhaps the weirdest in the history of warfare .
First of all , soldiers were never to take cover , but to advance towards the enemy erect , with torso bare .
Before engagements , soldiers sang hymns for a set period of time , sometimes for as long as 45 minutes .
After a time - keeper blew a whistle , they marched toward the enemy shouting “ James Bond , James Bond ! ” ( one of Miss Auma ’s top assistants called himself James Bond ) .
Each commander carried a rock wrapped in a cloth , and on signal , threw it toward the enemy .
An invisible protective screen would spring up where the rocks landed , and kept out enemy bullets .
HS soldiers were not to advance past that point until commanders retrieved their rocks and threw them again .
At first , the Mobile Forces tried to fight without violating the Precaution against killing .
Before a battle , Lakwena would order rifles issued to perhaps only half the men , and would specify the number of rounds to fire .
He also had the soldiers make wire models of the enemy ’s weapons and cook them in a stove to disable them .
In an engagement , on signal from commanders , men with rifles would fire the specified number of rounds but were ordered not to aim at the enemy , since 140,000 friendly spirits would guide the bullets to their targets .
The mobile forces were also helped by bees that would sting the enemy , and snakes that would bite him .
Some men also threw special stones , which were supposed to explode like grenades , killing 25 enemies apiece .
So long as the men were pure and did not violate the Holy Spirit Precautions , these tactics would ensure victory .
Any man who was killed or wounded had , by definition , failed to abide by the Precautions .
Prof .
Behrend points out that this was a great improvement over previous explanations for casualties , since it required no witchcraft - in - revenge .
In the early days of the movement , these methods reportedly brought repeated victory .
Prof .
Behrend does not try very hard to explain just how they worked , but notes that government soldiers believed in witchcraft , and sometimes ran away when they heard the Mobile Forces singing .
Holy Spirit soldiers were under strict orders not to loot or kill civilians , and were careful to offer receipts and promises of repayment for anything they requisitioned .
This won the movement a certain amount of local support .
The locals also adopted some Holy Spirit practices .
Lakwena had a recipe for medicine made of honey from his allies , the bees .
It had to be shaken for half an hour , and cured gunshot wounds and other troubles .
Prof .
Behrend writes that as late as 1990 , Holy Spirit medicine was widely made and used throughout northern Uganda .
Lakwena was not the only spirit that spoke through Miss Auma .
There was also Wrong Element , a bossy American , who spoke loudly in an American accent , and was greatly feared by the troops .
Ching Po was either Korean or Chinese — no one is quite sure — and was in charge of replenishing supplies and making the stone grenades explode .
There were other spirits as well , and sometimes several would speak through Miss Auma in the same session .
Ordinarily , she was possessed by spirits at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. , and before battles .
The Holy Spirit movement kept detailed records in English , many of which survived and provided Prof.
Behrend with much useful information .
HS bureaucrats carved wooden stamps with which they authenticated some of the documents .
Wrong Element ’s stamp is shown on this page .
Miss Auma insisted that she and the spirits were entirely separate entities .
She was much admired , and surrounded by retainers and bodyguards , but if anyone asked her advice on military matters she would say she was a simple woman who knew nothing of such things , and that Lakwena had the answers .
To underline this separateness , the spirits would occasionally berate her for lapses in discipline , and order that she be beaten .
Victory attracts recruits , and at one point Miss Auma had nearly 10,000 men under her command .
Many Acholis left local Christian churches to join the Holy Spirit movement , and even men from other tribes signed up .
Lakwena decided to send the Mobile Forces against the capital Kampala itself , and root out witchcraft at the source .
The prohibition against killing appears to have faded into the background , and Lakwena started issuing rifles to all the men .
Still , national insurrection appears to have been more than the movement could handle , and the Mobile Forces were decisively beaten in several major battles .
Many men were killed , and in December 1987 Miss Auma fled with a handful of loyalists to Kenya , where she received refugee status under the UN High Commissioner .
The spirits left her and , according to Prof .
Behrend , she was last sighted in a Kenyan bar , wearing a white blouse and a blue skirt , drinking gin and Pepsi .
Her career as a military leader lasted a little over a year .
Prof .
Behrend writes that many former Holy Spirit soldiers are convinced that the only reason they could not take Kampala was that the soldiers and even Miss Auma herself did not follow all the rules .
They say that as time went on , Miss Auma became dictatorial , and assumed authority that was rightly that of the spirits .
The Lakwena story did not end with Miss Auma .
Her father , Severino Lukoya , had tried to step in and take over the movement when his daughter began to get a following , but she sent him packing .
After she fled to Kenya , Lakwena started speaking through Mr. Lukoya , and he collected many of Miss Auma ’s scattered soldiers .
Wrong Element and several other of her spirits rallied to Mr. Lukoya , but Ching Po did not .
Mr. Lukoya claimed the new Holy Spirit movement was going to be a non-military , healing mission , but he dabbled in soldiering , too .
In an unsuccessful attempt to capture Kitgum City on March 18 , 1988 , his forces are said to have lost more than 400 soldiers .
That August , Mr. Lukoya announced he was going to expand the healing business into the Gulu District .
This was a mistake .
Gulu was the preserve of yet another Acholi chieftain , Joseph Kony , who claims to be a nephew of Miss Auma ( and therefore grand - nephew of Mr. Lukoya ) .
He was running something known as The Lord ’s Resistance Army , and did not want competition .
In August 1988 , his men kidnapped Mr. Lukoya , and beat him whenever spirits took hold of him .
A year later , Mr. Lukoya escaped and reportedly went on a praying mission , but this time government soldiers caught up with him .
Prof .
Behrend writes that last he was heard of , Mr. Lukoya was still in their hands .
Mr. Kony has generally had little tolerance for rivals .
Earlier in the 1980s , a man known only as O became a healer , and immersed people in the manner of John the Baptist .
In 1984 and 1985 he was so popular people had to wait up to two weeks for a cure , and his followers built a hotel to house the crowds .
Later the spirits left O , and Mr. Kony kidnapped him .
He held him for two years , after which O fell into government hands .
Soldiers tried to shoot him , but he would n’t die , so they had to cut him in pieces with machetes .
Joseph Kony now claims to wear Miss Auma ’s mantle , such as it is , and a good many survivors of Miss Auma ’s movement have joined him .
At least until mid-1988 , his men fought according to Holy Spirit Tactics and followed the Precautions .
They sang before battle , threw stone grenades , and did not take cover .
However , Mr. Kony has no truck with Lakwena , and communes with other spirits .
He also lets some of his men deal with spirits ; one claims to speak for John the Baptist , and another for the apostle Paul .
His army reportedly has five brigades named Stocree , Sinia , Gilva , Shila and Control Altar .
Each has a three - man command structure composed of men known as the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost .
Mr. Kony is ostensibly fighting the Museveni regime , and has received support from neighboring Sudan to destabilize Uganda , but Prof .
Behrend says he is no better than a pirate .
He now has a reputation for atrocity well beyond that of the government .
His men rampage through villages , press - ganging boys and kidnapping women .
Mr. Kony is said to have a harem of anywhere from 33 to 88 women , and he doles out sex slaves to lieutenants .
Boys who have escaped from The Lord ’s Resistance Army say they are forced to mutilate and kill fellow youngsters who are insubordinate or try to escape .
Mr. Kony occasionally breaks into the Western press as he did in April 2002 , when his men attacked a funeral party , and made the mourners eat the corpse before slaughtering them .
Whenever President Museveni ’s men close in on him he reportedly slips across the border into Sudan .
However , last year , after Mr. Kony ’s men started killing and raping Sudanese civilians , the Sudanese announced they would join the hunt for him .
Academic Prejudices
Prof .
Behrend has provided us with a fascinating glimpse of all this , but her book is a frustrating , confusing piece of work .
First of all , she is an out - and - out lefty who laces her book with observations like : “ Today , wars take place because the enormous war economy necessitates the testing of new and the scrapping of old weapons technologies . ”
This book is translated from German , so it is hard to know exactly whom to blame , but she appears to love jargon .
Every idea , explanation , thought process , or discussion is a “ discourse , ” and when she really hits her stride , it may even be a “ semantic field . ”
Her book is also a jumble of repetition and events out of chronological order .
Prof .
Behrend is terrified she might feed stereotypes .
She writes that before she went to Uganda to do research , she thought the Holy Spirit Movement was a peasant revolt against a heartless government .
She discovered that the fighters were mostly in it for thrills , loot , and revenge , that many of them had fought in one civil war or other , developed a taste for killing , and would not go back to being peasants .
She nearly dropped the project , she writes , “ since I saw no possibility of depicting the Holy Spirit Movement and its history except by idealizing it unjustifiably or repeating stereotypes that would have been too close to colonial images of warlike , ‘ violent ’ savages . ”
She admits that given a choice , she has succumbed to “ a certain tendency to idealization , ” but concedes that in Africa , war often has very little political content and is hard to distinguish from large - scale crime .
One wonders what a brutally frank account would be like .
Prof .
Behrend strains to avoid passing judgment , but it seems there is just about nothing the Acholi can not be made to believe .
This book is an account of credulity of a nature entirely different from the horoscopy , channeling , or pyramids in which white people sometimes dabble .
Much as she would deny it , Prof .
Behrend has written a portrait of the African mind — perhaps even the African soul — a portrait that is to us disturbingly alien .
IN THE NEWS
O Tempora , O Mores !
Coming to a City Near You
The first of 12,000 Somali Bantu refugees will start arriving this spring .
The US State Department plans to resettle them in 43 cities , including Atlanta , Dallas , Houston , Phoenix , and Salt Lake City .
This is the most ambitious resettlement since thousands of primitive Laotian Hmong were shipped in after the Vietnam War , but it still represents a small percentage of the 807,000 refugees admitted to the US over the past ten years .
The Bantu were originally from what is now Malawi , Mozambique and Tanzania , but were taken to Somalia as slaves in the 1800s .
They were freed by European colonists but remained at the bottom of Somali society , performing the most menial tasks .
Other Somalis call them adoon ( slave ) , gosha ( foreigner ) , or jareer ( which refers to their kinky hair ) .
When civil war broke out in Somalia in 1991 , many Bantu were massacred and raped .
Thousands fled to refugee camps in neighboring Kenya , where they have lived ever since .
The UN High Commissioner of Refugees originally planned to resettle them in Mozambique , one of their ancestral homes , but when that country turned them down in 1997 , the State Department volunteered to bring them here .
The Somali Bantu are extremely primitive .
Hardly any speak English , and most are illiterate in their native tongue .
Until they began receiving 10 - day instruction classes in American culture , most had never seen telephones , flush toilets , or clocks .
They have a very elastic view of time , and refer to important events by whatever natural phenomena were occurring at the time .
Sasha Chanoff , who works with the Bantu for the International Organization for Migration , wrote recently about trying to bring them into the 21st century :
“ How does one begin to teach the relevance of time and dates and schedules ?
What about sensitizing people to the nuances of shopping and cooking and eating , when they wo n’t recognize food in the supermarket ?
How does one prevent children from sticking a finger into an electric socket or garbage disposal , falling down stairs , scalding themselves with a faucet or straying into the road ? ”
“ Do not assume they open a door just because it has a doorknob , ” he adds .
People in the cities the State Department has chosen have no say in the matter .
Last fall , the city council of Holyoke , Massachusetts , one of the lucky towns , voted to reject a $ 320,000 federal resettlement grant , saying that even with the money it could not house and educate Bantu .
Cities cannot legally prevent people from moving in , so the vote was only symbolic .

The Enemy Within
“ Fragging ” is Vietnam - era military slang for the murder of ( usually ) officers by enlisted men , and comes from the preferred weapon for the job : a fragmentation grenade .
Between 1969 and 1972 there were reportedly 788 fraggings , which killed 86 soldiers .
Fragging usually occurred in rear - area units that had high levels of drug use and racial tension .
In many cases the officers were white and the murderers black .
The practice came to public attention in 1971 with the trial of Billy Dean Smith , a black soldier charged with fragging two white officers .
Mr. Smith managed to turn his trial into a forum on military racism and was ultimately acquitted .
On March 23 , black American Muslim Sgt. Hasan Akbar revived the practice of fragging when he rolled hand grenades under three command staff tents of the 101st Airborne Division while it was stationed in the Kuwaiti desert preparing to invade Iraq .
He then opened fire with a rifle , shooting an officer in the back .
The attack killed two white officers — Army Captain Christopher Scott Seifert and Air Force Major Gregory Stone — and wounded 14 other soldiers .
As he was being led away by MPs , witnesses heard Sgt. Akbar shout , “ You guys are coming into our countries , and you ’re going to rape our women and kill our children , ” but Army officials say they have not found a motive for the attack .
They do admit Sgt. Akbar appears to have had an “ attitude problem , ” and that the five - year veteran had recently been disciplined for insubordination .
Sgt. Akbar was born in Louisiana with the name Mark Fidel Kools , but legally changed it after he converted to Islam .
His family says military racism was too much for him .
William Bilal , his stepfather , says Sgt. Akbar resented the military and complained that it was difficult for blacks “ to make rank . ”
“ Everybody ’s got a breaking point , ” explains Mr. Bilal .
“ If he did this , he was driven . ”
Sgt . Akbar faces the death penalty for murder .

Perhaps not coincidentally , support for war with Iraq differs sharply by race .
According to a Washington Post - ABC
News poll , only 35 percent of blacks support the war , with 61 percent opposed .
Whites support the war 78 percent to 20 percent .
In a separate poll , Hispanic support was found to be mid-way between that of whites and blacks , with 61 percent supporting the war and 27 percent opposed .

Air Farce
In March , Albuquerque police arrested four active - duty airmen from nearby Kirtland Air Force Base on charges stemming from an alleged cross-burning .
Officials at Kirtland used the incident to remind base personnel of the importance of diversity .
Capt . Kimberly Adamski , Kirtland ’s Equal Opportunity
Officer , wrote , “ Diversity poses unique challenges , but it is also what has made our nation so successful and our Air Force the most formidable in the world . ”
She adds that it is not ( yet ) illegal to display a Confederate flag , but doing so will “ get you looked at ! ”
She continues : “ If I know you are a card - holding member of a supremacist organization or I know you have confederate [ sic ] flags displayed in your home or on your vehicle , I will likely draw the conclusion that you are a racist — whether you are or not . ”
Lt. Col. Neil Whiteman , Staff Judge Advocate , suggests that anyone not keen on diversity is an enemy of the Constitution .
Military personnel , he wrote , “ are expected to conform to and support the core values of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence : all people are created equal . . . ”
The colonel adds that “ active participation ” in “ racist ” organizations — marching in rallies , recruiting , fundraising distributing literature — is prohibited , and though “ passive ” participation is not prohibited , it can ruin a career .

Cool Killer
On October 24 last year , Lee Malvo was arrested along with his mentor John Muhammad for the series of sniper killings that terrorized the Washington , DC , area and left ten people dead .
Police interviewed Mr. Malvo at length in the days after the arrest , but the transcripts have only now been made public .
They show Mr. Malvo , now 18 , to be a cool , contemptuous killer , who regrets nothing .
He said the purpose of the killings was to sow terror and extort $ 10 million in return for calling them off , adding that he shot whatever victims came into his sights .
He preferred “ head shots , ” he explained , because of their “ horrific effect : ” presumably the shocking appearance of an exploded head .
He graphically described the ways in which victims fell when they were hit , pointing eagerly to where bullets entered their bodies .
“ He was hit good , ” he said of one victim ; “ Dead immediately . ”
He described another killing as “ a perfect shot . ”
He bragged that he and his partner , Mr. Muhammad , never missed , and were always careful to fire only once : “ One shot means I ’m in control . ”
He said the two men sometimes stayed on the scene to watch how police and the media responded .
More than once he asked police officers what had happened , and that they sometimes asked him if he had seen anything suspicious .
He said the two men went in and out of police road blocks several times to test police behavior .
Like so many black killers , Mr. Malvo shows no regret .
“ I would n’t change my life a bit , ” he said .
“ I ’d do the exact same thing . ”
And like so many blacks , he does not lack self esteem .
“ If I ’m in jail , I wo n’t be there all my life , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t build a jail strong enough to hold me . ”
Mr. Malvo ’s lawyer , Michael Arif , says he will challenge the admissibility of the statements in court .

German Democracy
Last month we reported on the Vlaams Blok ’s victory in a lawsuit filed to ban the Belgian nationalist party .
Germany ’s National Democratic Party ( NDP , or NPD in German ) , a small , nationalist party , which its detractors say incites hatred against immigrants and minimizes the Holocaust , has just had a similar proceeding thrown out of court .
In 2000 , the German government together with both houses of parliament petitioned the Constitutional Court — the country ’s highest judicial body — to declare the party a threat to democracy and disband it .
The government ’s case fell apart when judicial investigators discovered that some of the most extremist and fanatical members of the NDP were government plants .
The authorities later admitted that between 1997 and 2002 , it had at least 30 informers among the 200 top national and state party leaders , but the government refused to disclose who its people were and what they did .
On March 18 , presiding judge Winfried Hassemer noted that since the government made it impossible to know which were the actions and positions of the NDP and which were those of agents of the government , the most common refrain on the seven - judge panel was , “ We have problems with the facts — how can we arrive at the truth ? ”
“ The proceedings ” he said , “ have been dismissed . ”
Since the Second World War , the Constitutional Court has banned only two parties : a successor to the Nazis in 1952 and the Communist Party in 1956 .
The Schroeder government invested a great deal of moral capital in this case , which has only served to raise the profile of the NDP and highlight the lengths anti-nationalists are prepared to go to quash dissent .
The NDP has never won more than 4.3 percent of the vote — this was back in 1963 — but as a recognized political party it receives state funding and is permitted to hold public rallies .
Supporters have pointed out the hypocrisy of the larger parties in claiming to defend democracy by trying to snuff out an electoral choice for the German people .

No Pigs , No Buns
Sixty percent of the pupils at Park Road Junior Infant and Nursery School in Batley , West Yorkshire , England , are from Pakistan or India , and 99 percent of this group are Muslims .
The head teacher , Barbara Harris , has decided to ban storybooks that mention pigs , because they might offend Muslims , who do not eat pork .
The ban affects only those classes for children age six and under , since teachers read out loud to them .
Pig books will be permitted in classes for older children who can presumably choose their own books .
“ I very much regret that anyone should find this controversial , ” says Miss Harris , “ as all we are doing is trying to ensure that all of our children are awarded the respect that all human beings deserve . ”
[ Pig Tales Ban is ‘ About Respect , ’ Daily Post ( London ) , March 5 , 2003 . ]
School children may also soon do without hot cross buns , even though the British have been eating them for nearly 2,000 years .
In pagan times , the cross represented the moon and its four quarters , but Christians claimed the buns in 1361 when Father Thomas Rockcliffe started distributing them to the poor of St. Albans , and hot cross buns have long been traditional Easter fare at schools .
Local governments are now ordering schools not to serve them for fear they will upset non-Christians .
The Liverpool local council , for example , banned them because they have the “ potential to offend , ” although the schools cook up special dishes for such exotic festivals as Chinese New Year , Italian National Day and even Russian Independence Day .
York , Wolverhampton , Wakefield , and some of the London boroughs have joined the bun boycott .
“ These people are silly asses , ” says Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe : “ It seems that anything that comes from an ethnic minority is fine , while anything Christian is wrong . ”
A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain calls the bans “ very , very bizarre . ”
“ I wish they would leave us alone , ” he says , adding : “ We are quite capable of articulating our own concerns and if we find something offensive , we will say so .
We do not need to rely on other people to do it for us .
British Muslims have been quite happily eating and digesting hot cross buns for many years and I do n’t think they are suddenly going to be offended . ”
He suggested that if the British were really concerned about offending Muslims they might reconsider the war with Iraq .

No Free Speech for ‘ Racists ’
Ralph Crow , a Spanish teacher at Evarts High School in Harlan County , Kentucky , has been fired because of an email message he sent to about 40 members of the school staff .
He wrote that achievements of whites are ignored so “ non-achieving minorities can have the spotlight , ” that the main accomplishment of Martin Luther King was the “ introduction and promotion of communism , ” that blacks commit “ about 90 % ” of violent crime , and that students were being taught about King and Rosa Parks at the expense of the Founding Fathers .
“ The truth is n’t necessarily kind , ” he wrote .
“ If Martin Luther King Jr. were white , would there be a holiday for him ? ”
The superintendent of the district promptly fired Mr. Crow , saying he had violated county and school regulations against harassment and discrimination , and that his letter could cause “ great harm ” to the district .
The ACLU is considering defending Mr. Crow , who says his right to free speech was violated .
Erma Murphy , 71 , a black whose grandson was in Mr. Crow ’s Spanish class several years ago , says she is surprised by the fuss .
“ He and I have conversations on the phone until 12 o’clock at night , ” she says .
“ We talk about cooking and all sorts of things .
If he ’s a racist , that ’s news to me . ”

Arab - killer Caught
Larme Price , a 30 - year - old black man , has been arrested for a series of killings in February and March , in which all but one of the victims were Middle Eastern .
His mother says the Sept. 11 attacks unhinged him .
Mr. Price , who prowled Brooklyn and Queens with a handgun , killed four people and wounded several more .
One day when he could not find any Middle Easterners , he decided to kill someone who was “ not good . ”
This turned out to be a 32 - year - old Russian immigrant named Albert Kotlyar who worked at a laundromat where Mr. Price was loitering .
Mr. Kotlyar asked him to leave and got a bullet in return .
Mr. Price turned himself in to police on March 29 , explaining he had been reading the Bible , and was moved by the injunction , “ Thou shalt not kill . ” [ Larry Celona Et. Al. , 9/11 Made ‘ Psycho ’ Slayer Go Nuts : Mom , New York Post , March 31 , 2003 . ]
Blacks Good , Whites Bad
The Smithsonian ’s American History Museum in Washington , DC , has opened an exhibit on West Africa that will run through the end of August .
The exhibit is titled “ Captive Passage : The Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Making of the Americas , ” and includes the following explanation : “ Slavery had existed in Africa as it had in other parts of the world , for centuries , but it was not based on race and it did not result in dehumanization and death , as did transatlantic slavery . . .
Because the economies of Africa did not depend on slave labor , the number of enslaved people was small until European traders arrived . ”
When a reporter asked Julia Hotton ( race unspecified ) , curator of the exhibit , why African slavery was not “ dehumanizing , ” she said it would not be wise “ to concentrate on that particular phrase . ”
When pressed , she conceded , “ I ca n’t guarantee that somewhere along the way a slave somewhere did not die because of mistreatment . ”

Border Banditos
Anapra is a notorious Mexican slum just across the border from New Mexico .
The tracks of the Union Pacific railroad run right by Anapra , and for years residents have made a practice of robbing trains .
They come through a hole in the border fence , hop onto the slow - moving freights , and trip the emergency brakes that stop the train .
Then they break into containers and carry the loot back to Mexico .
The FBI , in cooperation with the Mexican police , decided to catch the crooks .
About 70 agents and border patrol officers took part in a raid on Sept. 12 , some hidden in containers on the train , others waiting near the track .
On the other side of the border there were about 70 Mexican police and customs agents .
The bandits attacked in their usual way , and about 20 men broke into a container in which three FBI agents were hiding .
They got into a fight with the agents , one of whom was a woman ( what fool gave her that assignment ? ) .
Samantha Mikeska managed to get handcuffs on the ringleader , Eduardo Calderon , before one of the robbers broke one of the bones in her face with a baseball bat .
She held on to Mr. Calderon , while his accomplices dragged both of them through the fence into Mexico .
Another agent , who also got a skull fracture in the fight , went across the border to get Miss Mikeska back , and the two bleeding agents staggered back to US territory while the Mexicans escaped .
Later , Mexican authorities rounded up ten people and turned them over to the Americans .
The aftermath has been as much a fiasco as the raid .
Of the ten arrested Mexicans , eight were released by a judge who ruled there was not enough evidence to hold them , and only two still face charges .
But the worst of it is that the Mexican press has reported widely that FBI agents crossed the border that night and made arrests in Mexico .
This is hotly denied by the Americans , but firmly believed in Mexico , where it is known as “ the FBI invasion . ”
In March , a federal prosecutor in nearby Juarez even called for the arrest on charges of treason of the Mexican agents who turned over the ten suspects , and a judge is reportedly considering issuing arrest warrants .
The residents of Anapra are likewise in high dudgeon .
Some can look from their hovels across the border at the pleasant American community of Sunland Park , with its well - tended country club .
“ I do n’t think it is fair for us to have so little , ” says one slum - dweller .
The people of Anapra think the train robbers are Robin Hoods .
They argue that if the railroad put up with robbery for so long , it was because it could afford the losses .
A spokesman for Union Pacific will not say how much the company lost to bandits , but points out that there have been no successful robberies since the September incident .

Crisis of Succession
Nigeria has hundreds of traditional local monarchs who once had absolute power and still have considerable influence .
On March 7 , the “ Oba ” or king of Lagos Island died at age 92 .
Adeyinka Oyekan II was monarch of the part of Nigeria ’s capital city that includes the high - rise financial district as well as a number of poor , densely - packed residential neighborhoods .
He ruled from a set of 19th - century colonial - era bungalows , where traditional chieftains met on March 14 to plan his burial and succession .
Neither was likely to be uneventful .
Lagos state governor Bola Tinubu declared a dusk - to - dawn curfew to keep warring Yoruba tribal factions from coming to blows over the succession .
Many residents of Lagos stayed home voluntarily because they did n’t want to become part of a different Yoruba practice : human sacrifice .
Traditionally , the Oba does not go to his grave alone , but must be accompanied by freshly killed slaves .
Oyekan II is not known to have had slaves , and the locals were taking care not become substitutes .

Blame the Test
Like 18 other states , California requires highs school students to pass an “ exit examination ” in order to graduate .
The language section of the test is at a 10th - grade level and the math section requires a knowledge of basic algebra , which many students learn in 9th grade .
The test is given several times a year , and students can retake any part they fail .
Of the current crop of 459,588 juniors in the state , only 48 percent have passed both parts .
271,300 have either failed the math portion or not yet taken it , and 103,300 have failed it twice .
The figures for the language portion are a little better : 140,000 and 48,800 .
Needless to say , blacks and Hispanics fail the test far more often than whites and Asians , and are complaining about bias .
They have organized demonstrations in Los Angeles , San Jose , San Diego , and elsewhere , and Assemblywoman Loni Hancock of Berkeley ( race unspecified ) introduced a bill in February to let students graduate without taking the test .
Here are some sample questions :
1 ) Stephanie is reading a 456 - page book .

Black or Not ?
The Democratic Party of Florida has officially recognized the establishment of a new Caribbean Caucus — to the fury of members of the Black Caucus .
American blacks do n’t want Haitians , Jamaicans , and other black islanders forming a group that could dilute black power and black solidarity .
As the president of the Black Caucus Dorothy Jackson explained : “ We think this does n’t unify us as black people .
Even though they are Caribbean , they are [ first and foremost ] people of color . ”
Samuel Jackson of Miami , also a member of the Democratic Black Caucus , puts it bluntly : “ Once you come to these shores you are black . ”
Caribbean blacks say they want a group that will attract more attention to the issue they care about but that American blacks ignore : immigration .
There are now 300,000 blacks from the Caribbean living in south Florida , and they want to consolidate their power and make it easier for yet more of them to immigrate .

Insane Asylum . . .
Last year , 111,000 asylum seekers entered Britain , an increase of 20 percent over the previous year .
Over the last two years , asylum seekers have cost British taxpayers the astonishing sum of £ 3.5 billion in direct and administrative costs — a figure that could rise .
In February 2000 , a Libyan man arrived in Britain seeking asylum .
His claim was delayed because the government sent forms to the wrong address , but the problem was eventually straightened out and he won asylum in May 2002 .
He is now suing the government , saying the uncertainty caused by the “ long and troubling ” delay gave him what a psychiatrist says was a “ major depressive disorder . ”
He wants £ 30,000 , and Mr. Justice Stephen Silber of the High Court has ruled that the suit may go forward .
The government is appealing the ruling .

Sane Solution
On April 1 , the British government passed a law that will let it revoke the citizenship of immigrants who got it by fraud or who act against Britain ’s vital interests .
The first person likely to be stripped of citizenship is Abu Hamza al - Masri , a radical Muslim clergyman who believes the Sept. 11 attacks were a Jewish plot , and that the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed by God because it was carrying Christians , a Jew , and a Hindu .
“ He wants to turn Britain into a Taliban - style state , and has no place in this country , ” says Labor MP Andrew Pismire .

Gap Gaff
Teachers are under great pressure to narrow the racial gap in test scores , and Terri Dieker , principal of Nettle Heartnett Elementary School in Leavenworth , Kansas , thought she would give black students a pep talk .
Just before the state assessment tests were to be administered in February , she called about 20 black fourth — and fifth - graders to her office in small groups to explain that because minority students often score lower than whites , they should work hard and do their best .
Miss Dieker is white , so was of course misunderstood and pilloried .
“ She said black kids are dumber than white kids , ” says ten - year - old Spencer Hildebrandt .
“ I thought it was appalling that they would even consider doing this without the consent of the parents , ” says his father George .
“ They actually assume those kids are dumb to start with , when they have n’t even taken the test . ”
Miss Dieker formally apologized to parents and students , but she says she felt she had to do something about the performance gap : “ If we are to help all kids learn better , the information had to be put on the table .
I apologize for doing it the wrong way . ”

‘ A Pretty Bad Thing ’
On March 22 , white 17 - year - old Dana Marie Pliakas went to a party in the Pittsburgh - area apartment of Rodney Burton , a 21 - year old black man .
She spent the afternoon drinking 151 - proof rum and smoking marijuana , and at one point got into an argument with Mr. Burton ’s black girlfriend , 19 - year - old Brittany Williams .
The argument turned violent when Miss Williams punched Miss Pliakas and tore her clothing .
According to an eyewitness , Miss Pliakas was then beaten and tortured for several hours while she begged for her life .
It is not clear whether Mr. Burton took part in the assaults , but Miss Pliakas was reportedly stripped , whipped with a belt , and hit with a plastic bottle .
According to the witness , Miss Williams threatened her with a gun , and at one point put a plastic bag over her head , saying , “ You could be dead . ”
Miss Pliakas tried to run out the front door , but Miss Williams and Mr. Burton caught her .
Late that night , the two eventually let Miss Pliakas get dressed , left the apartment with her , and returned shortly afterwards without her .
Residents report hearing a single gunshot at about three a.m. , and at about seven in the morning , a passerby spotted Dana Pliakas ’ body lying at the bottom of a flight of concrete stairs near a viaduct .
She was wearing only jewelry and socks , and had been shot once in the back of the head .
Her body was to be tested for evidence of sexual assault .
On March 25 , police arrested Mr. Burton and Miss Williams .
They think Mr. Burton fired the fatal shot , since their witness says he heard him say he shot her in the head so she would not tell police what happened .
At a news conference , Police Superintendent Kenneth Fulton said Miss Pliakas “ probably spent eight or nine hours under the hand of these two individuals .
For young people , this ranks right up there .
To be tortured , stripped , beaten and shot in the back of the head is a pretty bad thing for a junior in high school . ”

Decent Blacks Speak Out
Over the first weekend in April , the city of Daytona , Florida , braced for the 150,000 black revelers expected to attend this year ’s Black College Reunion .
Daytona police assign more officers to this event than to any other , and many residents leave town to escape the drunkenness , mayhem , and lewdness .
Black spring break started in 1984 , when Grady Irvin , then - student body president of black Bethune - Cookman College ( BCC ) , invited students from rival Florida A&M to a beach party to try to soothe tensions that arose from a dispute over ticket sales from their annual football game .
The next year BCC and Florida A&M invited other black schools , and within a few years students from 50 colleges were showing up for the party .
By 1989 , appalled by the behavior of the partygoers , BCC withdrew .
Then - student body president Gerald Yancey , now an assistant school principal , says he thinks most of those who attend are just looking to drink , fight and take drugs , and are not even students : “ [ I ] f there ’s any violence , if there ’s anything negative , it always sounds like it was black students .
It sickens me .
They should change the name . ”
The founder , Mr. Irvin , agrees : “ That function as it exists today puts black college students in a bad light .
Those who participate in the event do n’t have the principles that were initially espoused . ”

Hijacking Hip-Hop
According to David Mays , founder of the Hip - Hop magazine The Source , “ For over 20 years , Hip - Hop culture has been this country ’s single most powerful force in the battle to improve race relations and destroy the racism and racial profiling that continues to pervade our society . ”
Mr. Mays credits Hip - Hop with helping “ make sure that myself and my generation of white youth had a better understanding and respect for the struggles of African - Americans in this country . ”
Now all this is under threat from unscrupulous whites .
As evidence , Mr. Mays cites a letter from a schoolteacher who was telling her class Martin Luther King paved the way for Hip - Hop by “ promoting freedom of expression for all races , ” when a white boy butted in and said , “ What are you talking about ?
Eminem created Hip - Hop and he ’s better than any rapper out there . ”
The teacher adds : “ It is sad that it appears mainstream America has embraced Eminem as Hip - Hop ’s creator and king , just [ as it did ] with Elvis Presley when he stole the credit for Rock ‘n Roll from Chuck Berry . ”
Today , says Mr. Mays , Eminem ’s marketing machine “ is actually allowing white youth to dismiss the historical and current existence of racism , while embracing a so - called new form of ‘ Hip - Hop ’ as their own . ”
If Eminem is not stopped , Hip - Hop will be “ co-opted , ” and discussing this threat will force people to “ take a real honest look at ourselves and the way racism is programmed into our society . ”

LETTERS FROM READERS
Sir —
Stephen Webster ’s April article on the history of immigration legislation is basically accurate but over - emphasizes the contribution of the Kennedy brothers , and especially President John F. Kennedy .
Mr. Webster does note the central role of Jewish organizations in organizing and funding the anti-restrictionist movement .
JFK was indeed a strong anti-restrictionist , but his efforts would have had no effect without the prolonged , intensive , and consistent drumbeat of all the major Jewish activist organizations .
Indeed , the fact that JFK ’s book , A Nation of Immigrants , was originally published by the Anti-Defamation League in cooperation with the Joseph Kaplan Project in Intergroup Education is itself evidence of how Jewish activist organizations orchestrated the campaign for immigration reform .
There were no other organized forces in favor of multi-ethnic immigration or opposed to the national origins provisions of the 1924 law during the pre-1965 period apart from those emanating from Jewish organizations ( K. MacDonald , The Culture of Critique : An Evolutionary Analysis of Twentieth - Century Intellectual and Political Movements ; Bloomington , IN : 1stbooks Library , 1998 /2002 ) .
Indeed , many Jewish organizations and individuals proudly describe their role .
As Hugh Davis Graham recently noted :
“ Most important for the content of immigration reform , the driving force at the core of the movement , reaching back to the 1920s , were Jewish organizations long active in opposing racial and ethnic quotas .
These included the American Jewish Congress , the American Jewish Committee , the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith , and the American Federation of Jews from Eastern Europe .
Jewish members of the Congress , particularly representatives from New York and Chicago , had maintained steady but largely ineffective pressure against the national origins quotas since the 1920s . . .
Following the shock of the Holocaust , Jewish leaders had been especially active in Washington in furthering immigration reform .
To the public , the most visible evidence of the immigration reform drive was played by Jewish legislative leaders , such as Representative Celler and Senator Jacob Javits of New York .
Less visible , but equally important , were the efforts of key advisers on presidential and agency staffs .
These included senior policy advisers such as Julius Edelson and Harry Rosenfield in the Truman administration , Maxwell Rabb in the Eisenhower White House , and presidential aide Myer Feldman , assistant secretary of state Abba Schwartz , and deputy attorney general Norbert Schlei in the Kennedy - Johnson administration . ”
( Collision Course : The Strange Convergence of Affirmative Action and Immigration Policy in America ; New York , Oxford University Press , 2002 , pp. 56–57 )
Rather than a cover- photo of the Kennedy brothers as “ architects of immigration , ” it would have been far more accurate to have a pantheon of Congressman Celler , Senator Javits , and a legion of other Jewish activists going back to the early years of the 20th century and posing in front of the offices of the Anti-Defamation League or the American Jewish Committee .
Despite the fact that liberal immigration reform was part of the Democratic Party platform in 1960 and Kennedy had voiced public support for it during the 1960 campaign , immigration reform was not a priority of the Kennedy administration ( Graham , ibid , p. 55 ) .
Kennedy made no specific proposals about immigration reform until the summer of 1963 , despite considerable anticipation among both restrictionists and anti-restrictionists that his administration would make an initiative in that area .
When immigration reform finally came , after JFK ’s death , it was due far more to the death of Congressman Francis Walter , the wily foe of immigration reform in the House , and to LBJ ’s landslide Democratic victory in the election of 1964 that produced a liberal Congress on his coattails .
It was in the broader context of the Great Society and the Civil Rights Movement — the latter also a major interest of Jewish activist organizations — that the intensive effort of over 40 years by major Jewish organizations to remove the national origins provisions of the U.S. immigration law and to initiate high levels of multi-racial immigration finally came to fruition , thereby inaugurating the incredible transformations of the past 35 years .
Kevin MacDonald , Laguna Hills , Cal .
Sir — Your “ O Tempora , O Mores ! ” section of the April issue reported our foreign secretary Jack Straw as saying that “ many of today ’s worst international problems are Britain ’s fault , ” and that “ in India and Pakistan we made some quite serious mistakes . . .
The consequences [ disputes between the two countries ] are still there . ”
This statement reveals an almost unbelievable ignorance of British history .
The first and only historical period during which the entire Indian sub - continent was ever under unified rule was that of the British Empire .
When in 1946 the then - Labour government sent a plenipotentiary to Delhi to try to negotiate a transition to all - Indian independence , he was confronted by an intractable conflict between the Indian National Congress ( which was predominantly Hindu but also included many Muslims ) and the Muslim League ( which was exclusively Muslim ) .
Pakistan was originally established and its frontiers drawn only after every effort to grant independence to a still - united India had failed .

Unidentified lights appear to hover over San Francisco Bay north of the San Francisco Airport Wednesday night .
The lights mimic each other�s movements .
By Lance Iversen / San Francisco Chronicle Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Strange lights reported all across state 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Residents across California and people as far east as Las Vegas reported seeing strange lights in the sky late Wednesday , according to Vandenberg Air Force Base on the central coast .
Base command staff at Vandenberg , Travis and Edwards Air Force Bases said there were no military aircraft in the sky that would have caused the lights .
The Air Force bases also said there were no test missile launches Wednesday .
Such tests have , in the past , resulted in light patterns that can be seen across the California coast .
The bases did not send aircraft to check on the reports of lights .
The Federal Aviation Administration 's West Coast office had no reports of the lights and no aircraft were unaccounted for .
San Francisco resident Tim Sinclair said the lights appeared to be near the cross at the top of Mount Davidson Park .
Sinclair , who lives near the park , described them as a series of solid lights that appeared to be hovering .
When viewed through binoculars , the lights appeared to vibrate , he said .
JULY 21 -- Meet Patrick Tribett .
The Ohio man was nabbed yesterday morning for " abusing harmful intoxicants " as he attempted to make a purchase at Bellaire 's Dollar General Store .
The 41 - year - old Tribett , it seems , had been huffing spray paint and needed a refill .
According to a Bellaire Police Department report , Tribett 's pupils were constricted and he replied slowly to their questions .
Oh , and " officers observed the paint on face and hands , " as can be seen in this mug shot .
Tribett , who was previously busted for assault , domestic violence , and inhaling harmful intoxicants , was booked into the Belmont County Sheriff 's Office lockup .
His booking photo immediately joins TSG 's pantheon of favorite kooky mug shots like this one , this one , this one , and , of course , this one .

Squeak : toy or instrument ?
18 October , 2006
A message by Giuseppe Luigi Punzi sparked an interesting “ philosophical ” discussion on the nature of Squeak .
Giuseppe remarks that for many developers who work with other languages , Squeak looks like a children toy with no serious applications built with it .
To this Matthew Fulmer replied :
Squeak is a toy .
That is a good thing .
Squeak is a toy , and therefore it looks like a toy .
Aversion to
toys is ( in my not - so - humble opinion ) the worst thing that is
taught to programmers ( adults ? ) today .
Playing is the only way
to make new ideas .
One must enjoy playing before they can
understand the purpose of Squeak .
Until they realize “ Squeak is
a Toy , and I am OK with that ” , they are missing the point .
A
clean object memory , simple syntax , and easy debugging are just
implementation issues .
The point of Squeak is to have fun
building ; after that , everything else falls into place .
.
This caused a follow up by Alan Kay , that wrote :
The “ other ” kind of thing that “ can be played with ” is an
“ instrument ” ( musical , wood or metal shaping , etc. ) .
Instruments are
partly “ mess around toys ” and partly “ serious toys ” .
And Art enters
in when one starts to play on an instrument and around with an
instrument .
Dan and I had this in mind when we designed and built Smalltalk .
Other Squeakers , both old and new , gave their contribution to the discussion .
So , what do you think ?

Click to viewNot only do keyboard shortcuts boost my productivity , the mouse is also one of the biggest causes of RSI in my right hand .
So I hate leaving the keyboard to grab for my mouse .
Advertisement
In my mission to abandon the mouse forever , this week I 've put together a small freeware application called Mouser that operates your mouse from the comfort of your keyboard .
Read on to see how it works and download it for yourself .
Advertisement
Note :
The idea for this program came to me via Gina , who told me about a great app demo'ed at Hack Day by Google employee Jordan Sissel .
In this slideshow , Jordan illustrates ( with screenshots ) an application that continuously splits the screen in half to zoom the mouse in on a desired location , all from the keyboard .
I loved the idea , so I sat down with my trusty friend AutoHotkey and went to work .
I 'm calling the little app Mouser ( very original , no ? ) .
Check out the video below to see Mouser in action .
Download Mouser
Download Mouser AutoHotkey source
Note :
The yellow highlighting around the mouse is not an effect of Mouser - it 's just intended to help you keep an eye on the mouse for the low - res screencast .
Most of the moves I make can be accomplished with Firefox shortcuts , but it serves as a good illustration for how Mouser works .
As you can ( sort of ) see from the video , Mouser provides sort of an on - screen binary search for you mouse .
Whenever you want to move your mouse , just hit Ctrl - M to activate Mouser ( you can modify the shortcut and other settings by right - clicking Mouser in the system tray ) .
By default , a red box around the mouse cursor will blink to help you find your mouse 's location .
You can navigate your screen by using either the arrow keys or a set of pre-defined home row keys ( the home row is my personal preference ) .
Once your mouse gets to its destination , hit enter to click .
If you prefer keeping your hands on their home row positions to moving down to the arrow keys , the keyboard shortcuts are :
i : up
j : left
l : right
, ( comma ) : down
k : left - click r : right - click
Escape : exit script without click
Advertisement
Each time you move your mouse in any direction , the screen area you moved away from is off limits .
You continue halving the distance in the remaining screen real estate until your mouse is at the exact pixel you want ( or , more realistically , until whatever you want to hit is clickable - although you can click with pixel - precision if that 's what you 're looking for - normally it 's not ) .
You may think that Mouser would require a lot of moves to get you where you want to go , but as Jordan describes it with fancy mathematics I 've long since forgotten ( did I ever understand it ? ) , the worst case scenario for a 1920x1200 pixel screen is a total of 21 moves to get to any pixel on the screen .
Rest assured , though , on average it will take 8 moves or less to get to the areas you 'll be clicking on .
Advertisement
Although the Mouser visualizations are very helpful , you 'll find that once you get used to using the program , you need them less and less .
Additionally , turning off the visualizations in the settings allows you to move around the monitor somewhat more quickly than you can with the visualization turned on .
Advertisement
While Mouser may not ultimately replace your mouse ( let 's be honest - the mouse is certainly a helpful tool , and it'll always have its place on the desktop ) , it 's a good step toward making your mousing actions more accessible via the keyboard .
In the age of battery - powered wireless mouses , with Mouser you 'll never be totally out of luck in the event that your battery goes dead ( which happens to me more than I 'd like to admit ) .
Also , as an added bonus , Mouser turns the mundane act of mousing around your monitor into a something new and fun .

It was something we did n't catch at CES , but it 's about to make a big splash in vehicle navigation systems .
A prototype , created in a collaboration between Volkswagen 's Electronics Research Lab , Google and the graphics chip maker , nVidia , was shown at CES that incorporated the images from Google Earth into a navigation system that is as close to 3 - D as it gets .
Traditional web - based navigation features , such as overlaying points of interest like restaurants , gas stations and dealerships , along with real - time traffic updates , are incorporated into 3 - dimensional satellite imaging .
In addition to looking much cooler than your standard 2 - D system , the 3 - dimensional system is more accurate and efficient than what 's currently available , according to the release .

VOLKSWAGEN AND GOOGLE TEAM UP TO EXPLORE FUTURE VEHICLE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
Virtual Reality : Prototype with Google Earth creates realistic 3D , satellite - based map
AUBURN HILLS , Mich . – Volkswagen of America , Inc. and Google recently presented the future of vehicle navigation at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , and it ’s closer to virtual reality than ever before .
Volkswagen , Google , and graphics chipmaker , nVidia , are working on an in - car navigation map system and display that is 3 - dimensional and more real looking than anything that ’s available today .
Driver and Passenger will be able to instinctively recognize where they are in relation to the surrounding topography , especially in urban areas that are depicted with depth and accurate size relationships between buildings and roads .
Volkswagen , working through its Electronic Research Laboratory ( ERL ) , in Palo Alto , Calif. , together with Google and nVidia , is also working on other advancements , including automatic personalized content updates for its vehicle navigation systems .
Highlights of Volkswagen ’s prototype vehicle include a vehicle - centric touchscreen interface to Google Earth with state - of - the - art graphics , accurate 3D maps and real - time traffic updates and routing .
This open system harnesses the power of the web to maintain a dynamic database of current information on restaurants , dealerships , gas stations and other points of interest that can be overlaid directly onto the user ’s 3D map .
With the increasing accuracy of GPS , dead - reckoning and laser - radar imaging , as well as ever - improving car - to - infrastructure communication , this prototype will be available on showroom floors in the near future .
High - quality 3D and satellite - based representations of the world are becoming an exciting feature in on - line search engines and navigation .
These photo - realistic , high - resolution 3D images are not only more engaging for the user , but they are also more efficient and accurate at conveying information than traditional 2D mapping representations .

I have two presentations at OSCON last Thursday , and as usual , I promised to post the slides .
A little delayed , perhaps , but here they are .
I recommend them in the order I list ’em … although there ’s no audio to accompany it , you can still probably glean some good infos !
< span id =" more - 8247 " ></ span >
Speaking of audio… would anyone be interested in purchasing an audio track to go along with the slides for these presentations or the Javascript Bootcamp ?
I did n’t get recorded at OSCON ( should have thought of that ) , but if there ’s any interest , I ’d be willing to record my talks and offer them up for about $ 35 - 50 / ea ( depending on : bandwidth costs , the difficulty / cost of syncing a slideshow with audio if even possible for someone who ’s not a big company , etc . )
Let me know yes or no… drop me an email ( amy aht infocookie dawt com ) or comment .

When Interface Design Attacks !
Download :
Talk Description
Little things like the way a person enters a date on a form , or where you stick the “ home ” link , can make a big difference in a user ’s experience of your web application .
When these seemingly trivial design decisions come to rest on the shoulders of product managers , developers , and others , things can go terribly wrong .
But only because these folks have n’t had background training in the basics of interface design — a discipline that is less an art and more a science , and yet one that is sometimes feared and sometimes downright derided by technical people .
How much user empathy do you need — and how much is too much ?
When should you listen to your customers about specific interface / feature requests , and when should you serve as a judicious editor of their demands ?
Should you follow the interface lead of your competitor ?
What is , after all , the ultimate goal of your interface ?
And what on earth is the best way to lay out forms ( everyone ’s most - hated design task ) ?
These questions are less tricky than they may first appear , and they are chief among the topics covered in When Interface Design Attacks !.
Anyone is capable of improving his or her interface design skills .

Note : I wanted to post the slides ASAP , but I ’ll update this page later today with links to ALL the resources I mentioned in the presentation .

Berkman Fellow David Weinberger interviews Paul Graham , software guru , entrepreneur , essayist and painter .
In a recent essay , “ Taste for Makers , ” Paul argues that successful design , from math to software to painting , relies on the same aesthetic principles .
Taste is therefore not a matter of subjectively appreciating fine works but is a required capability for creating great software .
But is taste as timeless as Paul suggests ?
Do the design principles Paul points to result from aesthetic or functional characteristics ?
And why should we think that the visual and the programmatic , the artistic and the functional , the physical and the virtual might all be beautiful in similar ways ?

Ronald M. Green , an ethicist at Dartmouth College and an adviser to Advanced Cell Technology , said he hoped the new method “ provides a way of ending the impasse about federal funding for this research . ”
He said he believed the method should be seen as compatible with the Dickey - Wicker amendment , the Congressional action that blocked the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo is destroyed or exposed to undue risk .
Dr. James Battey , head of the stem cell task force at the National Institutes of Health , said it was not immediately clear if the new method would be compatible with the Congressional restriction , since removal of a blastomere subjects the embryo to some risk .
But the embryos that are P.G.D. - tested seem to grow into babies as healthy as other babies born by in - vitro fertilization , Dr. Battey said .
President Bush allowed federal funding for research on human embryonic stem cells , provided they were established before August 9 , 2001 .
Although that might seem to rule out any new cell lines derived from blastomeres , Dr. Battey said it was not clear if that would be the case , since the embryo is not destroyed , and that he would seek guidance on the point .
Critics , however , have a range of objections to the research .
Catholic bishops , in particular , oppose both in - vitro fertilization and P.G.D. testing , and therefore still object to the research , even though the cells would be derived from an embryo that is brought to term .
Richard Doerflinger , deputy director for pro-life activities at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the church opposed in - vitro fertilization because of the high death rate of embryos in fertility clinics and because separating procreation from the act of love made the embryo seem “ more a product of manufacture than a gift . ”
Asked if he meant the parents of an in - vitro child would love it less , Mr. Doerflinger said he was referring to the clinic staff .
Why ?
Why we ’re releasing our latest album for free on the Internet
In preparing to self - release our new album , we thought long and hard about how best to use the internet .
Given our unusual history , and a long - held sense that the practice now being demonized by the music biz as “ illegal ” file sharing can be a friend to the independent musician , we have decided to embrace the indisputable fact of music in the 21st century , put our money where our mouth is , and make our record , Little By Little … , available for download via Bittorrent , and at our website .
We ’re not streaming , or offering 30 - second song samples , or annoying you with digital rights management software ; we ’re putting up the whole record , for free , forever .
Full stop .
Please help yourself ; if you like it , please share with friends .
Of course , the CD will also be for sale on the site , as well as in fine independent record stores across the country , in a deluxe package that includes a 30 - minute bonus disc that serves as a companion piece to the record proper ( retail price for the package is $ 11.99 ) .
We embark on this experiment with both enthusiasm and curiosity — and , ok , maybe a twinge of anxiety .
Why are we doing this ?
The short answer is simply that we want a lot of people to hear the record .
However , it ’s important that people understand the free download concept is n’t a frivolous act .
It ’s a key part of our promotional campaign , along with radio and press promotion , live shows , and videos .
It ’s a bet that the resources of the Internet can make possible a new way for musicians to find their audience – and forge a meaningful artistic career built on support from cooperative , not adversarial , relationships .
We realize that digital files are the primary means by which a huge segment of the population is exposed to new music ; we also believe that plenty of music lovers in the world will buy a record once they ’ve heard it – whether via radio or computer .
We also believe there ’s an inherent qualitative difference at work — not only between MP3s and CDs , but between clicking a mouse and finding a record on the shelves of a good record store .
These experiences are not mutually exclusive – they ’re interdependent facets of music fandom , and equally important considerations for a band in our position .
Even with the proliferation of websites and magazines paying attention to independent music these days , it remains difficult for bands — especially rock bands — to get exposure , regardless of how good they may be ( or how successful they once were ) .
Making the record freely downloadable removes the main barrier that exists between an artist and the world of potential listeners .
And we do mean world ; the web ’s reach is everywhere .
Whether or not people will buy something they can get for free is obviously a big question , and there are facts and figures to support both sides of the argument .
We think it ’s not only possible , but likely .
The more fundamental challenge is ensuring people have access to your work to begin with .
At the risk of sounding Pollyanna - ish , making records has never been about making money for this band .
If the worst thing that happens is a whole bunch of people hear Little By Little … and no one buys it , we ’ll know our experiment was costly .
But that wo n’t make it a failure .
This is by no means a manifesto .
We do n’t pretend to be the first band to spin a variation of the shareware distribution model .
We love record labels and record stores .
We buy lots of CDs and are committed to supporting independent music .
We ’re not a bunch of fake Marxists .
We ’re just trying to be smart capitalists so we can sustain our lives as musicians .
This is an experiment .
We ’ll let you know how it goes .
Meanwhile , please enjoy the record .
Everything else is secondary .
I recently caught up with Microsoft 's general manager for competitive strategy , Bill Hilf ( you 've seen him before on Channel 9 ) , to talk about , what else , open source software and Microsoft 's position on it .
Sure , we have shared source , etc , but what is Microsoft doing in the open source software space ?
Why do we have an open source lab , what 's going on there , and what was Mozilla doing there recently ???
Bill and team have a lot of respect for Channel 9 and created an off - shoot that targets the open source community , called Port 25 ( https://port25.technet.com/).
What is Port 25 and why ?
We also cover the questions :
Why do n't we produce open source software at Microsoft ?
Why do n't we not " open source " products like Office ?
This is a very frank , honest and fun conversation sans marketing hyperbole , which is why we love talking to Bill !
The people of Lebanon are facing their " hour of greatest need " , the UN said yesterday in launching an emergency appeal for $ 150 m ( £ 81 m ) to help an estimated 800,000 civilians whose lives have been disrupted by Israeli bombing of Lebanon .
The relief plan would focus on providing food , water , healthcare and other essential services , Jan Egeland , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said .
The situation in Lebanon is " very bad , and deteriorating by the day " , said Mr Egeland .
On Sunday he described the bombing of south Beirut as " a violation of humanitarian law " .
But last night he had harsh words for Hizbullah as well , rebuking the Shi'ite group for cravenly using civilians as human shields .
" Hizbullah must stop this cowardly blending ... among women and children , " Mr Egeland said .
A UN report accompanying the appeal highlighted the scale of the devastation during 12 days of warfare , saying :
· The ongoing [ Israeli ] military operation has caused enormous damage to residential areas and key civilian infrastructure such as power plants , seaports and fuel depots .
· Hundreds of bridges and virtually all road networks have been systematically destroyed , leaving entire communities in the south inaccessible .
· Skyrocketing prices for basic goods ( eg : the price of sugar has risen by 600 % and cooking gas by 400 % ) further deplete the coping mechanisms of the Lebanese .
· The longer the hostilities last , the more dramatic the humanitarian situation will become .
Food , water , health , fuel , and other basic needs will increase ; so will the number of internally displaced persons .
· Reports indicate that there is a lack of essential goods , with needs particularly acute in villages along the Israeli - Lebanese border , which have been isolated by the conflict .
There are reports that food supplies in some villages have been exhausted .
· The widespread destruction of public infrastructure ... as well as the targeting of commercial trucks , has seriously hampered relief operations .
· As many as 800 persons live in a school designed for 200 to 300 children .
School water systems cannot cope with the extent of needs .
Neither can sanitary facilities ... a resurgence of diarrhoea cases has been noted in some centres .
In addition to this list , Mr Egeland said there was one school housing 1,000 people which had only six toilets .
He warned that fuel was becoming critical in many areas and power failure would affect water supplies and sewage , bringing increased health risks .
Calling for an immediate ceasefire , he said : " Only cessation of hostilities can really make it safe for us [ to deliver aid ] . "
Failing that , the UN was hoping to arrange a " notification scheme " which would allow safe passage for humanitarian goods .
The UN already had 100 trucks contracted or on their way to deliver aid within Lebanon , Mr Egeland said .
The first convoy could head south from Beirut to Sidon and Tyre as early as tomorrow , and the UN was working on details with the Israeli military , he said .
The UN is asking Israel for safe passage through three Lebanese ports .
Initially , it hopes to have two ships ferrying supplies into Beirut from Cyprus , with the ports of Tripoli , in the north , and Tyre , in the south , to be added later .
It has also asked Israel to grant safe passage for convoys from Syria .
Mr Egeland said the plan was to set up a staging area on the border to receive aid and prioritise it for distribution .
" We are hopeful that in the course of this week you will see a real difference on the ground .
By next week we will have a major operation really started , " he said .
The White House said yesterday that George Bush had ordered helicopters and ships to Lebanon to give humanitarian aid .
" Humanitarian supplies will start arriving in Lebanon tomorrow by helicopter and by ship , " said White House spokesman Tony Snow .
" We are working with Israel and Lebanon to open up humanitarian corridors . "
He described the move as " a significant US commitment " .
Mr Bush still opposed the idea of an immediate ceasefire , he added , saying there was no reason to believe it would stop violence in the Middle East ; instead the world should confront Hizbullah and its practice of using the Lebanese people as " human shields " .
Last summer , my friend Sian was threatened with arrest for having a picnic in Parliament Square .
The police had said her meal was a political demonstration , as she had the word " Peace " iced on a cake .
Under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act ( Socpa ) , which restricts the right to demonstrate near the square , she should have got permission from the police six days before getting the victoria sponge out of its Tupperware container .
As the law insists that one person counts as a demonstration , anyone wearing a CND , trade union or Vote Conservative badge in Parliament Square could , in theory , be arrested for demonstrating without permission .
Most people know that this rule was brought in by Labour to kick the peace campaigner Brian Haw out of Parliament Square .
What many do not know is that it does not just apply to the square , but to a designated zone covering a sizable part of central London .
So if you wanted to stand outside the Channel 4 building , 10 minutes ' walk away from the square , with a badge saying " Please do n't repeat Friends any more " , you would need police permission .
While some have chosen to challenge the law by noncompliance - such as Maya Evans , who was arrested and fined last December for reading out the names of those killed in the Iraq war by the Cenotaph - others have chosen a less confrontational approach .
If the police need to issue licences for each and every lone demonstrator , they said to themselves , what would happen when a whole load of lone demonstrators arrive at the same time for individual permissions to demonstrate ?
So , the past three months have seen mass lone protests , in which about 150 people test police bureaucracy by getting licences for each and every one of them .
The police can only refuse to issue the licences on the grounds of public safety or public order
Inspired by these mass actions , I decided that I would demonstrate all over the Socpa zone - and , being an upright citizen , get permission to do it .
So , last week , I nipped into Charing Cross police station to apply to have 21 individual demonstrations on the same day in the designated area .
Through earlier protests , I have got to know the man who coordinates the requests quite well .
PC Paul McInally now handles most of the Socpa applications .
" What can I do for you today , Mark ? " he asks , as we sit in the interview room .
" I 've got 21 forms for you . "
" Right then , " he says in a businesslike fashion , " let 's go through them . "
I like PC McInally .
We sort of bonded a few months ago when I handed in an application to demand the immediate sacking of Superintendent Terry .
" You want to sack my direct superior ! " PC McInally had spluttered .
" Yes , please . "
" I 've got to go and ask him if you can have a demonstration calling for him to be sacked ? "
" I believe so . " I said .
And although he shook his head when he left the room , he was smiling .
The area covered by Socpa is covered by several police stations , and now PC McInally sat flicking through the 21 forms sorting out which would deal with which request .
" This one is on the Belgravia patch ; so is this one .
Ah . . . " he pauses , " this one is Parks police . "
All in all , four police groups are needed to give me the permission I need : Charing Cross , Belgravia , Lambeth and the Parks police .
Nick Woodward from Belgravia gets in contact about the demos on his " patch " .
He is altogether a different type of officer - he handles a moustache like he fought in the Battle of Britain and sports Coldstream Guards cufflinks .
If Terry - Thomas had ever joined the Nazis , he would behave a little like Woodward .
" Mark , Nick Woodward , " he bays down the phone .
" Hi , how are you ? "
" I 'm well , thank you , " he says .
" Though I am a little disappointed that you have decided to waste our time in this manner .
I 've now got to open eight separate files on this . "
" As you know , I am very concerned about these issues , " I tell him .
" As you can see , my first demonstration is to reduce police paperwork . "
" Yesss , " says Nick .
But I know he really wants to say , " You 're a bloody shower . "
But permission is given , and this Monday I set off with the aim of doing 21 demonstrations in the Socpa zone in five hours and 15 minutes .
Each demonstration would be 10 minutes long , with five minutes travelling time between them .
The police agreed that I could have two assistants to keep time , check the route and carry the banners .
Sam is the banner caddy .
Originally we wanted to use a golf bag to carry the placards .
" Ah , Downing Street , sir , " he would have respectfully intoned .
" You 'll need a ' Hang Blair Banner ' . "
Unfortunately , we do n't know anyone with a golf bag , so I recondition my wheelie bin to carry the placards .
Tony is my timer and route checker .
And this is how I do ...
10 am , Parliament Square : Demonstration to Reduce Police Paperwork
The place is swarming with cops who have turned up to police the unapproved Sack Parliament demonstration .
On arrival in Parliament Square , we are all promptly photographed by the Forward Intelligence Team for police files .
Big Ben strikes 10 and up the banner goes .
10.15 am , Portcullis House ( MPs ' offices ) : Demand that MPs Don't Take Other Jobs - One is Enough !
We arrive two minutes early and the timer insists we keep the banner face down until we are officially allowed to start .
A line of police officers face us .
Tony the timer counts me in " Three , two , one , demonstrate ! "
New police arrive , shoving warning notices into our hands about unlawful demonstrations .
The cops who have been standing opposite us remonstrate with their newly arrived colleagues .
" They 've got permission , they 're OK . "
The new cops look confused and Sam opens the lid of the wheelie bin , where we have stuck copies of our police approval to the inside of the lid .
The police peer into the wheelie bin , and say , " Right .
OK then . "
And skulk off .
10.30 am , Tattershall Castle pub boat at the Embankment : Demonstration to demand that Pub Boats Give us Fishing Rights off the Bows or Give us Death !
10.45 am , Hungerford Bridge : Demonstration to demand Trolls for London Bridges
Stopped by the police , who check permission .
Cross the bridge shouting , " We need trolls !
We are overrun with goats !
These goats coming over here , stealing our jobs , getting the best houses !
It would n't happen if we had trolls .
And I bet they would keep the underside clear of dead Italian bankers , too . "
I really should get a proper job .
11 am , Jubilee Gardens : Demonstration to Ban Static Mimes
Those mimes who dress up and paint themselves silver and then stand still for money - what is the point of a mime that does not move ?
To me , this is just an advanced form of begging .
I sit immobile with a hat in front of me .
No one puts any money in .
I must have twitched and spoiled the purity of the moment .
11.15 am , London Aquarium : Demonstration to Stop the Killer Rays - For Steve Irwin's Sake !
The old GLC building , County Hall , was sold to a private consortium by Mrs Thatcher et al and is now private property .
So I spoke with the landowners to try to get permission .
" We do n't allow demonstrations , " said a clipped voice .
" This is private property . "
" By the Thames embankment ? "
" Yes , we own it and security will ask you to leave . "
Security are on the lookout on the day , but I sneak under the radar with a small unapproved banner .
Sian arrives with tea and a cake ; this one has " Stop The Killer Rays ! " iced on it .
We eat our cake in illegal protest pleasure .
11.30 am , St Thomas ' Hospital :
How are you going to stop MRSA when the soap dispensers in the gents were bust last week ?
Just a quick one here , as time is tight .
11.45 am , MI5 Building : Give MI5 a Nameplate
MI5 has no sign outside of it saying it is MI5 , and I am convinced that they are not getting all of their post .
12 noon , Magistrates Court : Demand that Judges Wear Clown Wigs
Neil Goodwin is up before the judge today ; his crime is dressing as Charlie Chaplin and standing in front of Downing Street with a sign saying " Not Allowed " .
He was arrested for demonstrating without permission .
He pleads guilty and is given a conditional discharge .
12.15 pm , Channel 4 : Big Brother is Shit
PC McInally had said , " What about the three nuns and the schoolkids who walk past ?
They could find the wording offensive . "
So I take a covering banner just in case .
Sam and Tony are to shout " Nun ! " if they see anyone likely to take offence and I will cover the offending word with a banner saying " Not Very Good . "
12.30 pm , Adam Smith Institute : Freemarketeers ?
You could n't survive without government contracts
After I have been shouting up at their offices for a bit , someone from the institute appears and says , " It 's the Adam Smith International Institute that gets all the DFID [ Department for International Development ] government work - different organisation . "
Shout " Sorry " to the three floors of office workers who are now looking out the window , scrape dignity off floor and go !
12.45 pm , Department of Trade and Industry : Stop the Export of Torture Equipment
Self - explanatory .
1 pm , New Scotland Yard : Sack Blair as Commissioner , Replace Him with PC McInally
Very popular choice as a lot of passing cops smile in support .
Do a quick interview with Channel 4 News .
" Do n't the government need this law in times like this ? " they ask .
" Are you implying that this law will help fight terrorism ? "
" Yes . "
" If all that stands between us and a terrorist attack is a licence from the police , we are all doomed , " I reply .
1.15 pm , St James
Park tube station : Sack the Private Tube Companies .
Speaks for itself .
1.30 pm , EU Commission : Take Kongra Gel Off the Terrorist Organisations List
Kongra Gel is a Kurdish organisation which the EU and UK have wrongly claimed is a terrorist group .
Nick Woodward warned me that I could get arrested if I do anything to support Kongra Gel , as this would break the anti-terror law .
Cunningly , my slogans are in Kurdish , which means he will have to get them translated to check .
1.45 pm , QE2 Conference Centre : Stop Hosting the AGMs of Arms Companies
2 pm , Westminster Abbey : God is Dead , Shut the Abbey
A bloke told me I had a first - class ticket to hell .
2.15 pm , the Treasury : Gordon , Burn Everything Before the Tories Get Back In !
Shout out , " Tell him to destroy everything !
And do n't you lot cooperate with them when they get in ! "
Raises a few smiles with the civil servants .
2.30 pm , the Citadel : Cut the Ivy , It 's Spoiling the Concrete !
Ivy is horticultural terrorism !
On our way to the next demo , we bump into police on horseback .
2.45 pm , Department of Health : Stop Patricia Hewitt Speaking Like a Patronising Tw*t
" What are you demonstrating about ? " grumbles a rather fierce - looking elderly gent with glasses and a frown that suggests he once worked in a prep school .
I hold up the banner .
" Oh , I quite agree .
She 's awful , " he says before getting on a red omnibus home .
3 pm , Parliament Square : Make Protesting Mandatory
The square is full of police , whose massed fluorescent jackets hurt the eyes and prob - ably breach EU light - pollution regulations .
On Whitehall , the police explain that although I am allowed to demonstrate in Parliament Square , because the police are still arresting folk from the anti-war demonstration , there might be difficulty .
The cop in charge arrives .
" Right then , I am assigning these two officers to you .
They will escort you into the square , find a bit of it that is n't in the thick of the melee , and make sure you can legally demonstrate without getting any hassle from any of the other cops . "
With that , I am given my own personal escort through a landscape of cops and protestors .
They walk either side of me ; I feel like the Noël Coward of protestors - " Demonstrating without a personal police escort ?
Simply not done this season , old boy . "
A surreal end to a surreal day .
However , I have now set the record : 21 demonstrations in five hours and 15 minutes in the Socpa zone .
Anyone care to try to beat it ?
· Mass lone demonstrations are held every third Wednesday of every month in Parliament Square .

In its constant search for any phony non-issue that it can cite as evidence that Christians in this country are under attack , last year the Right fabricated the idea that there was some sort of “ War on Christmas ” that was supposedly tied to some “ liberal plot ” that was behind everything from efforts to legalize gay marriage to opposition to Samuel Alito ’s nomination to the Supreme Court .
Having exploited the issue for all it was worth last year , the Right began ramping up this year ’s efforts back in August and looks to be planning on riding the issue straight through until the end of the year .
While the Right claims that they are merely seeking to thwart an “ accelerating effort by secularists in America to annihilate expressions of Christmas and Christianity , ” its effort to generate a controversy where none exists has been a rousing success – in more ways than one :
For Conservative Christian groups , this year ’s hot gift is a weapon for fighting back in the “ War on Christmas , ” be it a button , a bumper sticker or a memo with advice to the troops .
The Mississippi - based American Family Association says it has sold more than 500,000 buttons and 125,000 bumper stickers bearing the slogan “ Merry Christmas : It ’s Worth Saying . ”
The Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal aid group that boasts a network of some 900 lawyers standing ready to “ defend Christmas , ” says it has moved about 20,000 “ Christmas packs . ”
The packs , available for a suggested $ 29 donation , include a three - page legal memo and two lapel pins .
And Liberty Counsel , a conservative law firm affiliated with the Rev. Jerry Falwell , says it has sold 12,500 legal memos on celebrating Christmas and 8,000 of its own buttons and bumper stickers . …
The conservative Christian groups declined to provide all the numbers behind their Christmas efforts , but some did disclose how many items they had sold and distributed .
Alliance Defense Fund , an Arizona - based Christian legal group , has shipped 20,000 “ Christmas packs ” this year , said spokesman Greg Scott .
The value of the “ goods and services ” included is $ 4 , receipts show .
The rest of the money goes into ADF ’s general fund , Scott said .
A majority of the packs were sold for less than the suggested $ 29 donation , he added , though he declined to provide details .
By its own accounts , 2006 has been a very good year for the American Family Association .
Through mass e-mails and other forms of public pressure , the Mississippi group says , it “ forced Wal - Mart … to stop donations to homosexual groups . ”
AFA also says it convinced the television network NBC to pull “ the anti-Christian program ‘ The Book of Daniel ' ” and cut a scene from a televised concert in which pop star Madonna sings from a crucifix .
AFA raised the flag in the “ Christmas wars ” in August by criticizing “ holiday ” catalogues .
Benefiting from the early start , the association sold more than 500,000 buttons and 100,000 magnets encouraging supporters to “ be an unspoken witness for Christ ’s birthday . ”
The “ Merry CHRISTmas ” magnets were available for a $ 3 suggested donation ; the buttons were $ 7 for a pack of 10 .
Bulk rates also were offered .
Wildmon , while declining to give specifics , said the products brought in a “ slight profit . ”
The project was so successful , he said , he plans to make Easter buttons this year .
“ It ’s a pleasant surprise , ” he said .
“ It allows us to do a few more things . ”
Orders are also brisk for Liberty Counsel ’s Help Save Christmas Action Pack , said Staver , the group ’s president .
The $ 25 pack includes “ The Memo that Saved Christmas , ” which offers legal advice on celebrating the holiday at work and in public schools , along with buttons and bumper stickers .
The nonprofit law firm also offers the buttons separately .
Costing 40 cents to make , they ’re sold 10 for $ 10 and at bulk rates , Staver said .
Basic math says the Liberty Counsel has pulled in an estimated $ 300,000 + , the Alliance Defense Fund an estimated $ 500,000 + , and the American Family Association an estimated $ 600,000 + from selling their “ War on Christmas ” wares .
George W. Bush has been vilified by the Left , but his harshest critics should be on the Right .
One of the most momentous consequences of the Bush presidency is the destruction of the philosophical core of modern conservatism .
Like most political movements , American conservatism incorporated various strains of thought , some at odds with one another .
But the movement had a fundamentally anti-statist orientation .
Central was a commitment to individual liberty , limited government , and constitutional republicanism .
None of these principles characterize today ’s conservative movement and Republican Party , which sells itself as “ conservative . ”
The president and his followers denigrate personal freedom , support expanded state power , dismiss constitutional limits , and advance global intervention .
A number of commentators have spoken of “ Big Government conservatism ” or a conservatism based on “ authority ” rather than liberty .
But the philosophy is barely recognizable as conservatism .
Set aside the Bush administration ’s socially conservative rhetoric and there is little difference between Great Society Democrats and George Bush Republicans .
Oft noted has been conservatives spending like liberals .
Federal outlays have been rising at levels comparable to those under Lyndon Johnson .
Could anyone imagine unified GOP government under Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan being more expensive than united Democratic rule ?
Moreover , at least Democrats focused on big programs that allegedly met great national needs , such as poverty .
The symbol of Bush conservatism is the earmark , like the notorious bridge to nowhere .
Despite huge deficits and endless embarrassment , Congress refuses to kill abusive pork , and the president refuses to veto even one appropriation .
Yet spending is merely one conservative disappointment .
Between the president and Congress , nothing is seen as lying beyond the competence of the federal government .
Promoting marriage counseling , overriding state laws allowing medical use of marijuana , creating a national medical database , and interfering with an end - of - life family dispute may or may not be good ideas , but conservative they are not .
Republicans once claimed to value federalism .
Now conservatives no less than liberals attempt to micromanage the affairs of 300 million Americans .
But not just of 300 million Americans .
Conservatives who routinely denounced social engineering at home believe they have been anointed to rule 6 billion people abroad .
Whereas Woodrow Wilson once inspired Democrats , now Republicans see him as their godfather as they seek to spread democracy through war .
Hardheaded conservative realists who once counted the cost in American lives and treasure now wax lyrical about encouraging democracy abroad .
Politicians who once respected small cultural differences among U.S. states now ignore vast cultural gulfs among foreign nations  and the hundreds , and sometimes thousands , of years of history that define other peoples .
A presumed universal yearning for freedom is confused with a commitment to the complex tradeoffs of a liberal society .
Even in its discussion of national security , the conservative movement has become degraded , abandoning deterrence , which contained Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong , history ’s most prolific mass murderers .
Preventive war is now the strategy of choice .
Indeed , many conservative war advocates wax enthusiastic about unleashing death and destruction upon other societies , largely unconcerned about the consequences .
“ Kick Saddam ’s butt ” became the slogan of choice for those who viewed war as a game , not a process in which thousands  American and Iraqi soldiers , as well as Iraqi civilians  would die .
Today conservatives worry , appropriately , about whether U.S. troops charged with atrocities are being arraigned fairly .
But few war proponents seem discomfited , let alone anguished and appalled , as they should be , by the innocent civilians routinely killed at roadblocks , by air strikes , and in normal military operations .
Yes , innocents always die in war .
However , we bear a heavy responsibility for those killed in a war of choice that we , or those representing us , initiated under false pretenses swathed in humanitarian rhetoric .
In fighting this conflict , conservatives have abandoned their onetime belief in checks and balances .
Republicans worried about executive aggrandizement under Democratic Presidents Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Lyndon Johnson .
Today conservative intellectuals form a Greek Chorus suggesting that the U.S. government consists of the president , backed by an unimportant congressional supporting cast .
Of course , the threat of terrorism and war will inevitably strengthen the president .
But when Attorney General Alberto Gonzales argued that the congressional authorization of force allowed the president to ignore the statute governing NSA surveillance , he was really suggesting that the chief executive could ignore all duly enacted laws at his discretion .
Conservatives lauded rather than dismissed this outlandish interpretation .
Indeed , conservatives have even stopped demanding honesty and competence from the executive branch .
Federal officials lied about the cost of the Medicare bill before Congress .
The Pentagon did not outfit U.S. soldiers with sufficient body armor and armored vehicles .
Republican legislators remained supine .
That the conservative movement has lost its philosophical guts is evident from a simple thought experiment .
Imagine President William Jefferson Clinton going to war on grounds that subsequently proved to be false .
Imagine him sending the secretary of state before the UN Security Council to make a speech wrong in every detail .
Imagine President Clinton , after invading Iraq , making a series of erroneous projections about the ease of occupation and progress in guerrilla operations , and failing to send adequate numbers of troops or quantities of equipment to do the job .
Imagine him ignoring Congress and concentrating power in his own hands .
Imagine a continuing stream of rosy predictions despite a steadily rising body count .
Then imagine the emergence of a series of crises  rising Taliban activity in Afghanistan , Iran and North Korea steadily pursuing nuclear arms , the Mideast teetering on the brink of widespread war  with the U.S. tied down in Iraq .
What would conservative Republicans be saying about President Clinton ?
Just imagine .
The failure of the Bush presidency is painful to watch .
He is a decent man , and his most vociferous critics are mostly unattractive .
But after being blessed with extraordinary opportunities , President Bush will leave America in extraordinary difficulties .
Unless the conservative movement detaches itself from his administration , it risks going down in flames with him .
Worse , it risks eternal shame in backing him as he does the nation grievous harm .
It 's tricky to directly compare Apple 's Mac OS X Leopard and Microsoft 's Vista , because the two products will be sold to very different markets in different ways .
Here 's a look at how both differ as products in the marketplace .
The Indirect Choice
Apple is strongest where Microsoft is weakest , and vice versa .
Despite the intense interest in pitting Apple against Microsoft , Leopard and Vista simply are n't direct competitors .
Part of the reason for this is that Apple is only making Leopard available for users of its own Mac hardware , while Vista runs on a wider range of PCs than Apple even ships , including of course , all of Apple 's Intel Macs .
Anyone interested in a tablet , an ultra compact laptop , or a $ 299 PC simply can't choose Leopard , because Apple does n't make Mac versions of any of those products .
Door Three ?
Similarly , the vast majority of high volume office fleet PCs purchased by the Enterprise wo n't be deciding between Leopard and Vista , but rather between sticking with Windows XP for the time being or rapidly rolling out support for the new Vista .
Of course , there are also wide markets uninterested in both : a majority of the installed base of Windows PCs lacks the ability to run either Vista or Leopard , and a small but growing segment of desktop market is only interested in one of the several Linux distributions or other free and open source alternatives .
There really wo n't be anyone trying to decide between buying Vista and buying Leopard .
Instead , the real choice will be whether to buy new Mac hardware than can run both , or PC hardware than can only run Windows .
The Problem of Macs Running Windows
That choice is something Microsoft does not like to talk about ; when asked about selling Windows on Macs , Microsoft executives evade the question and say that they prefer to think about " real PCs . "
Why would they turn down potential sales ?
If Microsoft 's decision makers were confident about Windows as a product , they'd be ecstatic to sell additional copies to Mac users .
After all , the company makes far more profit selling individual Windows retail boxes at $ 299 or more than it does on the individual volume OEM licenses that ship with new PCs ; OEM licenses can be as little as $ 25 .
The problem for Microsoft is that every PC user who moves to the Mac suddenly has the choice to stop using Windows all together .
The Shoe on the other Foot
That turns the tables on Microsoft , putting the company in the uphill battle position of its 1990 's competitors , who struggled to sell their alternative OS to users who already had Windows pre-installed on their PC .
Every new Mac sold will give Microsoft a taste of the bitter struggle of DR - DOS , OS / 2 , NeXTSTEP , BeOS , Linux , and every other would - be contender that suffered from a market distorted by the Windows Price Paradox .
That 's a big problem for Microsoft : while the new Macs can run Windows , unlike other PCs they do n't have to run Windows .
Microsoft will be forced to actually sell Windows to Mac users , rather than just signing an agreement with a manufacturer that results in the effortless , ongoing , automatic OEM sales which contribute 80 % of Microsoft ’s Client ( Windows ) business division revenues .
This Series
But just as politics are a bad motive for choosing a war , so they can be a doomed engine for running a war .
In an interview with Tim Russert early last year , Mr. Bush said , " The thing about the Vietnam War that troubles me , as I look back , was it was a political war , " adding that the " essential " lesson he learned from Vietnam was to not have " politicians making military decisions . "
But by then Mr. Bush had disastrously ignored that very lesson ; he had let Mr. Rumsfeld publicly rebuke the Army 's chief of staff , Eric Shinseki , after the general dared tell the truth : that several hundred thousand troops would be required to secure Iraq .
To this day it 's our failure to provide that security that has turned the country into the terrorist haven it had n't been before 9/11 -- " the central front in the war on terror , " as Mr. Bush keeps reminding us , as if that might make us forget he 's the one who recklessly created it .
The endgame for American involvement in Iraq will be of a piece with the rest of this sorry history .
" It makes no sense for the commander in chief to put out a timetable " for withdrawal , Mr. Bush declared on the same day that 14 of those Ohio troops were killed by a roadside bomb in Haditha .
But even as he spoke , the war 's actual commander , Gen. George Casey , had already publicly set a timetable for " some fairly substantial reductions " to start next spring .
Officially this calendar is tied to the next round of Iraqi elections , but it 's quite another election this administration has in mind .
The priority now is less to save Jessica Lynch ( or Iraqi democracy ) than to save Rick Santorum and every other endangered Republican facing voters in November 2006 .
Nothing that happens on the ground in Iraq can turn around the fate of this war in America : not a shotgun constitution rushed to meet an arbitrary deadline , not another Iraqi election , not higher terrorist body counts , not another battle for Falluja ( where insurgents may again regroup , The Los Angeles Times reported last week ) .
A citizenry that was asked to accept tax cuts , not sacrifice , at the war 's inception is hardly in the mood to start sacrificing now .
There will be neither the volunteers nor the money required to field thewholesale additional American troops that might bolster the security situation in Iraq .
WHAT lies ahead now in Iraq instead is not victory , which Mr. Bush has never clearly defined anyway , but an exit ( or triage ) strategy that may echo Johnson 's March 1968 plan for retreat from Vietnam : some kind of negotiations ( in this case , with Sunni elements of the insurgency ) , followed by more inflated claims about the readiness of the local troops - in - training , whom we 'll then throw to the wolves .
Such an outcome may lead to even greater disaster , but this administration long ago squandered the credibility needed to make the difficult case that more human and financial resources might prevent Iraq from continuing its descent into civil war and its devolution into jihad central .
Thus the president 's claim on Thursday that " no decision has been made yet " about withdrawing troops from Iraq can be taken exactly as seriously as the vice president 's preceding fantasy that the insurgency is in its " last throes . "
The country has already made the decision for Mr. Bush .
We 're outta there .
Now comes the hard task of identifying the leaders who can pick up the pieces of the fiasco that has made us more vulnerable , not less , to the terrorists who struck us four years ago next month .
New research from Tufts University indicates that diverse groups perform better than homogenous groups when it comes to decision making and that this is due largely to dramatic differences in the way whites behave in diverse groups -- changes that occur even before group members begin to interact .
" Traditional arguments in favor of diversity often focus on ethics , morality and constitutionality , " said Samuel R. Sommers , Ph.D. , assistant professor of psychology in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University .
" I wanted to look at the observable effects of diversity on performance . "
In a study involving 200 participants on 29 mock juries , panels of whites and blacks performed better than all - white groups by a number of measures .
" Such diverse juries deliberated longer , raised more facts about the case , and conducted broader and more wide - ranging deliberations , " said Sommers .
" They also made fewer factual errors in discussing evidence and when errors did occur , those errors were more likely to be corrected during the discussion . "
Surprisingly , this difference was primarily due to significant changes in white behavior .
Whites on diverse juries cited more case facts , made fewer mistakes in recalling facts and evidence , and pointed out missing evidence more frequently than did those on all - white juries .
They were also more amenable to discussing racism when in diverse groups .
Study expands traditional psychological , legal assumptions
" Traditionally , most psychologists and legal scholars have assumed that the influences of racial diversity result from the contributions of minority group members , who in effect bear the burden of bringing new perspectives and experiences to the table , " said Sommers .
" This study offers the novel hypothesis that majority group members are also responsible for effects of diversity , and that performance advantages to jury diversity are not limited to white and black jurors bringing different experiences to the jury room and sharing different perspectives . "
The study is published in the April issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .

Sommers studied 121 individuals from a jury pool at a Michigan courthouse and 79 jury - eligible individuals recruited through newspaper advertisements .
All were randomly assigned to six - person panels , most with an alternate , that were either all white or included four white and two black members .
Panels watched a 30 - minute video summarizing the trial of a black defendant and white victims .
Jurists were then polled in writing as to the guilt of the defendant .
Half the jurists in all - white panels thought the defendant was guilty , compared with 34 percent of whites on diverse panels .
" Changes in whites ' behavior began as soon as they were aware of the composition of their group , before jury deliberations began , " said Sommers .
The research also showed that whites were much more willing to talk about race in a diverse setting .
In all - white panels , when one juror brought up race , another member would try to change the subject , minimize discussion or suggest that race was irrelevant .
Implications go beyond legal system
While the research examined the benefits of diversity in criminal juries , Sommers believes that the study has significant applications for business , higher education and other institutions that grapple with difficult or controversial issues .
" Because the study examines group decision - making in a realistic setting , the findings have potential implications for a variety of contexts -- from the classroom to the boardroom , or wherever a premium is placed on fact - finding and reaching a good decision , " he said .
" Diverse groups show a number of advantages and benefits when it comes to this type of decision making . "
But many families visiting test - optional colleges have a different preference .
“ I think SAT - optional is great , it ’s wonderful , ” said Lynne Brandes , of Hanover , Mass. , who took her daughter , Jacqueline , on a New England college tour this summer .
“ Some families have the money to pay for tutoring , but some do n’t .
I ’d love to see the SAT ’s abolished . ”
At test - optional colleges , admissions officers say they look forward to students ’ liberation from testing .
“ We hope that now that there are more test - optional schools , students will think about not taking it , and putting their time and money into other activities , like music or writing or community service , ” said Jane B. Brown , vice president for enrollment at Mount Holyoke , which dropped the SAT requirement in 2001 .
“ We hope they will have more interesting lives . ”
But most admissions officials at selective colleges continue to rely on standardized test scores .
“ They ’re especially useful for evaluating the rural Midwestern kid who ’s No. 1 in a graduating class of nine at a high school you do n’t know , ” said Paul Thiboutot , dean of admissions at Carleton College .
William Shain , the dean of admissions at Bowdoin , has seen the pros and cons .
Last year , he was at Vanderbilt , where tests are required .
At Bowdoin , the first and most selective college to become test - optional — admitting fewer than a quarter of its applicants — Mr. Shain is mindful that each student admitted without scores displaces one with stellar scores and grades .
He also said test scores become more helpful as high school transcripts provide fewer clear indicators of students ’ abilities .
“ Many schools wo n’t do rankings , there ’s enormous grade inflation , and parents help write some of the essays , ” he said .
“ It ’s not so easy to disentangle from SAT’s .
Even the bond - rating people , when a college borrows money , look at SAT scores . ”
True , neither the Ivy League nor most large universities are about to drop their testing requirements .
At the Ivies , anything that helps differentiate among hordes of highly qualified applicants is useful .
And many large public universities do admissions by the numbers .
But some state universities have minimized their use of SAT scores .
For example , Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school classes are automatically admitted to the University of Texas or Texas A&M .

“ WELL , it was time somebody spoke up , was n't it ? ” Quite a few Westerners , by no means all of them Christians or fans of the Vatican , will have muttered something like that as they watched Pope Benedict touring Turkey and speaking up for the rights of Christians and other non-Muslims .
By linking Turkey 's hope of a European future to a change in its attitude to minority faiths , the pope has given heart to a growing body of people who demand “ reciprocity ” in relations between the Muslim world and the West .
Their argument is that since Muslim minorities are free to practise their faith in historically Christian countries , the Western world should expect Muslim countries to show more respect for the rights of local Christians ( and , indeed , Jews ) .
In countless ways , the argument goes on , those rights are violated — ranging from Saudi Arabia 's ban on non-Muslim worship to the more subtle pressure on the Copts of Egypt who fear the rising power of Islamism .
In divided lands like Nigeria and Sudan , Christians in Muslim - dominated regions say they are subject to sharia law at its harshest .
In Iran , around 300,000 Christians and 30,000 Jews report harassment , discrimination and hostile propaganda from the official media ; followers of the Bahai faith suffer even more .
At its crudest , talk of “ reciprocity ” can sound grim .
The West should treat all religious groups fairly on principle — not as a part of any trade - off .
Even if the fate of Christians in the Islamic world were far worse , that would not be a reason for the West to mistreat Muslims .
But religious minorities in Muslim lands should be a cause for a concern — among all Westerners , not just church leaders .
Apart from the general principle of human rights , religious diversity is a safeguard against the “ clash of civilisations ” between Islam and the West that extremists expect or want .
A settled , law - abiding Muslim population in the West , and content , secure religious minorities in the Islamic world , can be counters to the view that every place “ belongs ” to just one faith or culture .
One problem is that church leaders such as the pope are not best placed to make that case .
As he has found in Turkey , many Muslims fear that their Christian neighbours are fifth - columnists for hostile Western powers .
That fear grows when Westerners lobby for fellow believers in the East .
Who , then , is the ideal advocate for the rights of religious minorities in the Muslim world ?
One group of people who should join the fray are Muslim thinkers who live in the West and are hence free to interpret their own religion , and interact with other faiths , in a more generous spirit than tends to be possible in the more conservative atmosphere of most Muslim - majority societies .
As beneficiaries of a culture of religious tolerance , they are especially well placed to explain its merits to co-religionists in Islam 's heartland .
As the pope learned in Turkey , the Ottoman treatment of minorities was less harsh than that of some Christian regimes .
But it certainly should n't be idealised either , and nor should anyone argue that traditional Muslim theocracy — which protects the other “ peoples of the book ” , the Christians and Jews , but also treats them as second - class citizens — is any basis for a modern state .
The old theocracy served a purpose , perhaps , in a different age , before the ideals of universal suffrage and human rights had been put forward .
But it can have no place in today 's world , and more Western Muslims should find the courage to say so .
BOSTON , July 11 — Four concrete slabs , each weighing at least three tons , fell from the ceiling of a Big Dig tunnel here on Monday night , crushing a woman to death in a car .
The accident set off recriminations from top elected officials who sought the firing of the head of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and started a criminal investigation .
It was the first time in the long history of the project that someone riding in a tunnel was killed by what seems to be a construction failure , the state police said .
The accident , which led to the closing of the tunnel highway that connects the city and Logan International Airport , follows leaks , cost overruns and other problems that have raised questions about the $ 14.6 billion Big Dig , the central highway system through Boston .
Until now , officials have said the problems did not threaten motorists ’ safety .

C++ for C Programmers by JT Kalnay is available in multiple formats for free .
This is a textbook of C++ examples intended for C programmers .
This book is not a starting point for new C++ programmers who do not know C .
It is a transition tool for C programmers .
These lecture notes are designed for an introductory course on programming , using the imperative core of C++ , and given to MSc ( Computing Science ) students at Imperial College London at the very beginning of their course .
The students attend an intensive series of lectures and laboratory sessions over two weeks , carrying out lab work using the GNU g++ compiler on PCs running a flavor of UNIX .
Since the course is intended for graduates from disciplines other than Computer Science , very little previous programming experience is assumed .

More For Everyone
There is hard evidence that Wal - Mart has grown the economic pie available to be divided among its various stakeholders .
Lessons From The Past
Savings to customers far exceed the costs that Wal - Mart allegedly imposes on society .
This opinion piece , first published in thein August 2005 , has been updated by Pankaj Ghemawat for HBS Working Knowledge .
Mighty Wal - Mart 's headquarters in Bentonville , Arkansas , must feel less like a hotbed of retailing and more like a war room .
There is a groundswell of criticism of the world 's largest company , primarily focused on its treatment of workers .
The recent spate of books on the company is no exception .
Some are overtly critical , for example Anthony Bianco 's The Bully of Bentonville : How the High Cost of Wal - Mart 's Everyday Low Prices is Hurting America .
But even books that purport to be balanced and coolly analytical raise questions about the company 's economic impact .
A case in point is Charles Fishman 's The Wal - Mart Effect , which describes the company as having a " decidedly mixed economic impact " largely on the basis of a study claiming that the retailer destroyed more jobs in 2005 than it created .
Indeed , from low wages to limited healthcare coverage , the company has a number of employee - related issues to tackle , as well as many nonmarket ones .
( Wal - Mart announced August 8 an increase in starting wages at a third of its stores and wage caps at all stores . )
But questioning whether Wal - Mart 's overall economic impact has been positive or negative reflects a failure to engage properly with the data .
First , there is hard evidence that Wal - Mart has grown the economic pie available to be divided among its various stakeholders , instead of just slicing up a fixed pie in a way that favors one group over another .
Consider , for example , the conclusions of the McKinsey Global Institute 's study of U.S. labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 .
In the words of Robert Solow , a Nobel laureate in economics and an adviser to the study , " By far the most important factor in that [ growth ] is Wal - Mart .
" Second , most of the value created by the company is actually pocketed by its customers in the form of lower prices .
There is general agreement that Wal - Mart prices are significantly lower than its competitors .
Assuming that the company 's prices are 8 percent lower — at the low end of the estimates from various studies summarized in a recent report by Global Insight — and applying that to Wal - Mart 's domestic sales volume , U.S. consumers save on the order of $ 18 billion per year .
And because Wal - Mart forces its competitors to charge lower prices as well , this figure is a fraction of the company 's real impact .
These kinds of savings to customers far exceed the costs that Wal - Mart allegedly imposes on society by securing subsidies , driving employees toward public welfare systems , creating urban sprawl , and destroying jobs in competing operations .
Thus , juxtaposing these customer savings against the estimate cited by Fishman and others that Wal - Mart destroyed 2,500 jobs ( on a net basis ) in 2005 yields customer savings of more than $ 7 million per year for each job lost .
( Fishman actually works with higher numbers for customer savings , so if he had done this calculation , he would have come out in the $ 12 – $ 60 million range . )
The savings to Wal - Mart customers also appear large in relation to the surplus that it passes on to stockholders .
In recent years , the retailer has netted just 1.5 to 2 percent of revenues as income for its shareholders — compared with 8 - plus percent for its customers .
It is worth adding that shareholder surplus — over and above the cost of the capital employed in the business — would be completely wiped out if Wal - Mart 's million - plus employees were to receive a $ 2 - per - hour pay increase , modest though that sounds .
And since such a scenario would be unacceptable to Wal - Mart 's shareholders , the millions of Americans who shop at Wal - Mart would likely end up paying higher prices .
In The Wal - Mart Effect , Charles Fishman raises another specter : Wal - Mart as giant boa constrictor , squeezing the life out of capitalism through sheer market dominance .
This seems far - fetched .
Wal - Mart still accounts for less than 10 percent of total nonautomotive retail sales in the United States , and its growth rate in the last twenty years has steadily declined from 30 - plus percent to below the 10 percent mark in 2006 .
Wal - Mart has also been slowed by rapid increases in particular cost elements such as healthcare , pressure on its stock price , and a move to reposition the company to be " more like Target " — that is , more differentiated — even though this move does n't fit particularly well with Wal - Mart 's existing locations or capabilities .
History also provides perspective on the current clamor around Wal - Mart .
When catalog pioneers Sears and Montgomery Ward seemingly threatened small - town retailers with extinction in the nineteenth century , those retailers mounted an energetic counterattack .
The rise of chain stores in the 1920s also provoked outcries from independent dealers and whole communities , resulting in thirteen states passing anti-chain - store tax laws .
The lesson for Wal - Mart is that successful new retailing formats tend to provoke vigorous reactions — in the nonmarket as well as the market sphere .
This all suggests that the debate around Wal - Mart is n't really about a Marxist conflict between capital and labor .
Instead , it is a conflict pitting consumers and efficiency - oriented intermediaries such as Wal - Mart against a combination of old - line retailers and labor , community , and development activists .
Particularly in retailing , policies in the United States favor consumers and offer fewer protections to other interests than is par for the course elsewhere .
Is such proconsumerism a good thing ?
The answer , at least in relation to Wal - Mart , depends on the identity of these " consumers " — the ones getting most of the benefits from the company 's low prices .
Wal - Mart operates 2 - 1/ 2 times as much selling space per inhabitant in the poorest one - third of states as in the richest one - third .
And within these states , it focuses on poorer districts and consumers .
Without Wal - Mart , therefore , the rural poor in particular would pay several percentage points more for the food and nonfood merchandise that — after housing — is their second - largest household expense .
So in the debate about what to do about Wal - Mart , let 's keep in mind who 's reaping the benefits of " everyday low prices " — and , by extension , where the real conflict resides .
Planning vs. Affordable Housing
by Doug French by Doug French
Local government growth - management planning has been a bone of contention during debates in Nevada between Democratic gubernatorial candidates state Sen. Dina Titus and Henderson Mayor Jim Gibson .
Titus championed a bill in the 1997 Legislature that would have limited development in Clark County .
The measure , based upon restrictions used in Portland , Ore. , would have severely limited development outside of a “ ring around the valley . ”
Titus believes that her ring idea , if implemented , would have led to higher property values and “ caused more planned , rational growth . ”
Titus is likely correct that property values would have increased , but is that a good thing ?
Growth controls and growth - management planning lead to increased home prices and declines in housing affordability , according to a new study from The Independent Institute , authored by Randall O’Toole , a senior economist at the Thoreau Institute .
“ Smart growth ” initiatives create artificial housing shortages that push up the price of housing and keep low - income families from affording a home .
Although housing prices have increased significantly in the past few years , cities with growth - management planning saw price increases from 4 to 14 percent per year , while cities without these planning initiatives experienced price increases of only 1 to 3 percent .
O’Toole found that more than 30 percent of the aggregate value of homes in America is attributable to housing shortages produced by growth planning .
Last year alone , homebuyers paid an estimated $ 275 billion more for homes because of restrictive planning , according to the study .
Growth - planning schemes such as Titus ’s “ ring around the valley ” plan increase property values to the benefit of wealthy and middle - class homeowners , while blocking low - income people from enjoying the numerous benefits of homeownership .
In a paper published in the Journal of Urban Economics , professors Richard K. Green and Michelle J. White found that one of the primary benefits of homeownership is the effect on children .
In fact , Donald R. Haurin , professor of economics , finance and public policy at Ohio State University suggests that education can be improved more effectively by promoting home ownership than by funneling more tax money directly to schools .
Haurin ’s research found that homeowners are less likely to relocate than renters , thus providing a more stable environment for children .
Haurin also points to a better physical home environment , a more emotionally supportive environment , and greater connection to neighborhood networks as benefits to children of homeowners .
Homeowners have a financial incentive to take care of their dwellings and save money for payments and repairs .
The financial responsibilities and habits required of parents to manage homeownership are invaluable in instilling the same sort of values in their children .
“ Homeownership also leads to measurable increases in self - esteem and neighborhood stability , ” O’Toole explains , “ which probably contributes to the better educational outcomes . ”
Las Vegas and Reno , while not yet saddled with direct growth - management planning , suffer from an artificial land shortage created by the federal government ’s ownership of 90 percent of state land .
O’Toole believes that increasing resistance from environmental groups to BLM land sales “ might be considered a form of growth - management planning , and it explains why Nevada cities have become unaffordable despite the lack of any state or local growth - management planning . ”
O’Toole estimates that homebuyers in Reno and Las Vegas have paid $ 64 billion more for housing because of the government - created land shortage .
He estimates the cost was $ 100,000 to $ 130,000 per home in 2005 .
A lack of supply creates housing affordability problems , not increased demand .
Some of the fastest - growing cities in the nation — such as Atlanta , Houston and Raleigh — have not seen the price increases that slow growth California cities have .
Three factors make up the price of homes : construction materials , labor and land .
Labor and materials are very mobile and thus are similar in all markets .
What is not mobile is land .
And because housing is an inelastic good — small changes in supply lead to big changes in price — supply restrictions lead to large home price increases , according to O’Toole .
Thus , smart - growth plans like those put forth by Titus and the Clark County Community Growth Task Force last year would further compound the affordability problem we already have in Southern Nevada .
And , as O’Toole points out , the most disturbing aspect of the planning penalty is how regressive it is .
Planning harms low - income families and first - time homeowners the most , “ while it provides windfall profits for wealthy homeowners . ”
Growth - management laws serve only to increase home prices and exclude more people from enjoying the benefits of home ownership .
Government should get out of the way and let homebuilders provide affordable housing that will change the lives of low - income people for the better .
As O’Toole emphasizes , “ Barriers to homeownership can only be regarded as un-American . "

BACK in the 1960s , the contraceptive pill unshackled sex from human nature .
Could a new class of tablets be about to do the same for sleep ?
Introducing CX717 , a drug being developed by Cortex Pharmaceuticals of Irvine , California .
It 's the first of what promises to be many aimed at detaching people from the daily routine of eight hours each for work , rest and play .
Tests conducted on rhesus monkeys last year suggest that CX717 can wire users to remain awake for 36 hours without the jitters , euphoria and eventual crash that come after mega - doses of caffeine or amphetamines .
Further down the line are even more radical compounds — stimulants that can wipe out sleep for several days at a stretch , and pills that deliver a whole night 's shut - eye in two hours .
Prompted by some energetic marketing on the part of drugmakers , scientific journals are already ablaze with excited talk of “ conquering sleep ” , asking whether humans will become the first species to dominate both daytime and night - time .
The commotion , however , raises the more pertinent question : how much sleep do we actually need ?
Lux eterna
Before the advent of the electric lightbulb , it was n't much of an issue — people hit the hay after a couple of hours by candlelight , and stirred at daybreak .
But the invention of artificial lighting , and the subsequent introduction of shift working , has progressively “ detached us from the 24 - hour cycle of light and dark , ” says Russell Foster , professor of molecular neuroscience at Imperial College , London .
Today , our culture of long hours at work and the 24 - hour availability of almost everything from convenience stores to television and e-mail have demoted sleep in our priorities .
To manage fatigue , says Dr Foster , “ we 've fallen into a stimulant - sedation loop , where stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine are used for wakefulness during the day and sedatives such as hypnotics and alcohol are used at night to induce sleep . ”
The eight - hours mantra has no more scientific basis than the tooth fairy .
That has compressed the sleep cycle .
A report published last year , entitled “ Insomniac Britain ” , by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy found that adults in the United Kingdom sleep an average of six hours 53 minutes each night .
Is that enough ?
Not according to the ancient formula of eight hours of rest , eight hours of work and eight hours of play , which many physicians and therapists still swear by .
And it 's not enough for the survey respondents , many of whom considered themselves “ sleep - deprived ” .
But a new , contrarian school of thought is emerging .
The eight - hours mantra has no more scientific basis than the tooth fairy , says Neil Stanley , head of sleep research at the Human Psychopharmacology Research Unit at the University of Surrey in Britain .
He believes that everyone has their own individual “ sleep need ” which can be anywhere between three and 11 hours .
“ If you 're a three - hour - a - night person , you need three ; if you 're 11 , you need 11 . ”
To find out , he says , simply sleep until you wake naturally , without the aid of an alarm clock .
Feel rested ?
That 's your sleep need .
Core sleep beats deep sleep
The global get - to - sleep industry — pills , lotions , “ no - turn ” mattresses , foam “ memory ” pillows and the like — has conditioned us to think we 're not getting enough , adds Jim Horne , director of the sleep research centre at Loughborough University in Britain and author of the new book , “ Sleep Faring : A Journey through the Science of Sleep ” .
What really matters , he says , is the “ core ” sleep , the first few hours that nourish the higher sections of the brain .
Anything beyond that — including deep REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep — is “ non-essential ” and taken for pure pleasure .
Consider the domestic cat : feed it well , and it sleeps a lot ; withdraw the food , and it 's out hunting .
As long as you 're not a zombie the next day , you 're probably sleeping enough , says Dr Stanley .
He appeals to the concept of “ non-restorative sleep ” recently put about by the German Society of Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine .
In Germany , there has been a shift in emphasis : traditionally , treatment focused on reducing sleep “ latency ” — the interval between settling in for the night and the onset of sleep — and thus prolonging total sleep time .
Now , the focus is on restoring the recuperative value of sleep and ensuring daytime functioning on a social , psychological and professional level .
In truth , however , no one really knows whether ten hours a night is any better than five .
The science of sleep has not advanced an awful lot since 1834 , when the first book in the English language on the subject —
“ The Philosophy of Sleep ” by a Glaswegian physician called Robert MacNish — was published .
Of course , we can now plot brainwaves , track hormones and add new taxonomies to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders ( 89 , at the last count ) .
We can link sleep problems to driving and industrial accidents ; to a higher rate of divorce ; to increased risks of heart disease , breast cancer , diabetes , colo-rectal cancer and obesity .
We 're also confident of the role of sleep in reinforcing memory , learning and cognitive performance .
But the real fundamentals — such as why we sleep , and why some people can function on less than others — elude us .
Used infrequently , drugs such as CX717 might be a handy standby for the odd occasion when — for whatever reason — you absolutely , positively , have to stay awake .
But talk of banishing sleep for ever is “ spectacularly naive , ” says Dr Foster .
“ We do n't understand the physiology of sleep , but we seem happy to regard it as something to ‘ cure ' and then throw away . ”
Cortex Pharmaceuticals provides more information on CX717 .
“ Insomniac Britain ” is available online .
America 's National Sleep Foundation and Sleepnet.com offer tips on getting a good night 's rest , information on sleep disorders and more .
But he told the Australasian Sleep Association Conference in Perth that while this might help pay off a " sleep debt " , it came at a cost .
" We 've discovered that these sleep - ins are actually putting your body out of whack enough to change your Sunday night bedtime and set you up for Monday blues , " Professor Lack told AAP .
His research team tested the theory by tracking 16 people over a weekend , asking them to go to bed a little later than they would on a weeknight but sleeping - in an extra two hours .
By comparing saliva samples and hormone tests he found participants ' body clocks had been delayed by 45 minutes .
" That might not sound like a lot but it means that you 're not quite as sleepy on Sunday night at the normal bedtime and you 'll be much sleepier the next day , " Prof Lack said .
Questionnaires completed on Monday and Tuesday showed much higher levels of self - reported fatigue and tiredness compared with pre sleep in days .
This was because the subjects ' circadian rhythms - which determine patterns of alertness and tiredness - had been disturbed , creating an effect similar to jet lag .
By mid-week most people manage to get back on track but then they start staying up later , getting into " debt " once again and perpetuating the cycle .
" These days , we 're pushing ourselves a lot , particularly during the week and the weekend is our only refuge , " Prof Lack said .
The problem , he says , is that this comes at a price .
" It 's a bit like paying off a mortgage - you take out a big one and you 'll have a lot to pay off later on . "

China 's destruction of a defunct weather satellite is a dramatic display of the ancient battering - ram strategy brought up to date with 21st century knowhow .
Security experts believe China launched a medium - range KT - 1 ballistic missile to intercept the satellite , which struck with sufficient force to obliterate it without the need for an explosive warhead .
To prove they had the capability to track , target and destroy an object in space , it was the easiest solution : Chinese officials would have known the exact position , speed and altitude of the satellite .
The rocket would have been launched and targeted using a ground - based tracking station to guide it .
Once on the right trajectory , experts believe the rocket will have switched to on - board radar and possibly infra-red sensors to home in .
The satellite occupied a region of space just over 500 miles high called low - Earth orbit .
It is lowest of the satellite orbits available and is favoured by the military for spy satellites , since it gives them the best possible images of the ground .
Despite picking off one of its lowest satellites in the test , China has developed two longer - range missiles , known as the KT - 2 and KT - 2A , which carry boosters and are believed to be capable of reaching more critical satellites in higher orbits .
The GPS satellites that are crucial for smart weapons , such as cruise missiles , orbit at about 8,000 miles above Earth , and broadband communications satellites orbit at around 22,000 miles in geostationary orbits .
Together , GPS and communications satellites are Achilles ' heels of modern warfare .
During the last Iraq war , 83 % of communications between allied forces were sent via satellites .
" It would have an enormous impact if a country were able to destroy those satellites , " said Pat Norris , chair of the Royal Aeronautical Society 's Space Group .
China 's destruction of a satellite is not a first .
Both the US and Russia developed developing anti-satellite technology in the late 1950s , although early air - launched missiles were abject failures .
The first successful satellite strike was in 1985 when a US missile destroyed a satellite called Solwind .
Tests of missile - based anti-satellite systems was suspended shortly after because another danger was apparent - the debris threatened other satellites and astronauts directly .
A study by the US Union of Concerned Scientists found that the Chinese test would have produced about 800 fragments larger than 10cm and 40,000 fragments between one and 10 cm .
The US has instead shifted its efforts to new technologies .
Plans exist to develop space - based " directed energy weapons " , usually lasers , which could target satellites from space .
A project favoured by Donald Rumsfeld , the former US defence secretary , is known as " rods from the Gods " , in which metal rods are dropped from space , building up kinetic energy on the way down , is still under consideration .
Other technologies being investigated by the US include louvres for satellites , which would defend against blinding lasers used to dazzle satellites .
Specter warns of ' confrontation ' over NSA hearings Chairman scolds Cheney , still seeks White House cooperation YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Security Agency ( NSA ) Senate Dick Cheney GOP or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Senate committee chairman warned of a " constitutional confrontation " with the Bush administration Wednesday over its domestic surveillance program , threatening to subpoena administration officials or phone company executives in a congressional review .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter publicly complained about the Bush administration 's refusal to cooperate with his panel Tuesday and sent a stinging letter to Vice President Dick Cheney after learning Cheney had lobbied other Republicans on his committee without his knowledge .
" I 'm not looking for courtesy , " the Pennsylvania Republican told CNN .
" What I 'm looking for is judicial review of wiretaps , which is the tradition in America .
( Watch Specter detail reasons for feud -- 7:22 ) " What I 'm looking for is sufficient information for the Congress , the Judiciary Committee , to handle our responsibility for congressional oversight on a constitutional issue , " Specter said .
Specter wants the administration to submit the National Security Agency 's no-warrant domestic surveillance program to a review by a secret federal court .
He called the program a " flat violation " of the 1978 law that set up that court .
But Specter said he was willing to hear out the administration 's argument that President Bush has the authority as commander in chief of the military to authorize wiretaps to prevent terrorism .
In his three - page letter to Cheney , Specter said it was " neither pleasant nor easy to raise these issues with the administration of my own party . "
( See the full letter -- PDF )
But he demanded cooperation from the White House , warning that he would ask his committee to issue subpoenas if necessary -- a process that requires a majority vote .
" The committee would obviously have a much easier time making our case for the enforcement of subpoenas against the telephone companies , which do not have the plea of executive privilege , " he wrote .
" That ultimately may be the course of least resistance . "
A Specter aide later told CNN that the letter did not necessarily constitute a threat to subpoena administration officials .
Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride told CNN the vice president " has not had a chance to study the letter . "
But she said the administration plans to continue to " work with members of Congress in good faith " on oversight of the NSA program .
Specter chastised the vice president for not disclosing his lobbying efforts on Tuesday when they shared a buffet at an event with other Republicans .
" I was surprised , to say the least , that you sought to influence , really determine , the action of the committee without calling me first or at least calling me at some point , " Specter wrote .
Specter accused the administration of repeated stances to expand executive power , " frequently at the expense of Congress ' Article 1 [ constitutional ] authority . "
He cited Bush 's use of presidential signing statements attached to legislation ; an FBI search of the Capitol Hill office of Democratic Rep. William Jefferson in a bribery probe ; and Justice Department assertions of authority to prosecute journalists .
Deal isolates Specter
The mounting frustrations since the December revelations of the NSA program to eavesdrop on telecommunications without court - issued warrants boiled over after a pair of hearings Tuesday that left Specter somewhat isolated .
Specter and other committee members were annoyed the Justice Department had sent a mid-level official to testify but who would not respond fully to their questions on the potential prosecution of journalists who published leaked material about the program .
Hours later , as a session on calling major telephone companies to testify on the NSA program was about to begin , Specter learned the vice president had circumvented him and won backing from other GOP members on the panel to prevent the testimony .
The lobbying maneuver engineered by Cheney and Sen. Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican , left Specter 's hands tied .
Hatch said he had won assurances from Cheney that the White House would at least review legislation on the program submitted by Specter in March .
Faced with a lack of support , Specter reversed course and said he would not call on the phone companies to testify about allegedly providing the NSA with records of millions of phone calls .
Democrats pounced on Specter , charging he had " caved " on a promise to call the phone executives .
Specter to ' keep pushing '
Bush acknowledged the existence of the program in December after The New York Times reported that the government was listening in -- without obtaining court orders -- on phone calls involving people suspected of having ties to terrorists , as long as one party was outside the United States .
Some legal scholars have said the program is an illegal and unwarranted intrusion on Americans ' privacy .
The Bush administration defends it as a necessary tool in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network .
The Foreign Intelligence Security
Act requires that the government obtain a court order from a secret FISA court to tap the phones of American citizens inside the country .
Specter 's legislation would require the FISA court to rule on the constitutionality of the program .
" Notwithstanding my repeated efforts to get the administration 's position on this legislation , I have been unable to get a response , including a ' no , ' " Specter wrote in his letter .
The committee is scheduled to resume business Thursday morning , and the NSA surveillance program is again on the agenda .
Specter said Wednesday that he would " keep pushing " for congressional oversight of the highly classified program .
" I 've waited many weeks , a few months .
I can wait a few more days , " he said .
" But I 'm insistent on the protection of civil liberties and insistent on the Congress 's right to oversight on constitutional issues . "

The only side - effect of the hormone appered to be weight loss
Boosting oxyntomodulin limits appetite and raises activity levels at the same time - leading to speedy but healthy weight loss rates , a UK study suggests .
The hormone tells us we are full after a meal , but the obese have less of it .
The fact dieting tends to lead to reductions in activity often makes weight loss harder , the International Journal of Obesity study says .
It 's not like one of those nasty drugs where you have to take some horrible chemical for years
Professor Steve Bloom
Research author
Professor Steve Bloom head of the Division of Investigative Science at Imperial College London said earlier studies had shown oxyntomodulin decreased appetite .
But this was the first time it had been shown to increase physical activity levels .
The fact that oxyntomodulin was naturally found in the body was also an advantage as it was unlikely to have unpleasant side - effects , he said .
" It 's not like one of those nasty drugs where you have to take some horrible chemical for years .
" It is naturally a occurring hormone .
We are using the body 's own method of limiting appetite . "
There are some conditions where people have high levels of the hormone after certain types of injuries to the gut , for example , and they tend to lose a lot of weight and stay very thin .
And there do not appear to be any harmful effects of having high levels of oxyntomodulin , he said pointing to some medical conditions that produce this .
The only side - effect appears to be sustained weight loss , he said
Increasing exercise
Fatter people tend to have lower levels of the hormone and therefore cannot recognise when they are full .
So treatment would restore obese and overweight people 's levels of the hormone to their correct levels .
He envisages people giving themselves daily injections like diabetes patients do with insulin .
" If people strip half naked in the street , exposing themselves to the public to undertake this exercise called jogging then I can't see that they would have a problem with taking this hormone , " he said .
The study looked at 15 healthy overweight male and female volunteers , aged between 23 and 49 .
They were divided into two groups , with one being given doses of oxyntomodulin three times a day for four days and others saline .
Obesity epidemic
On the fourth day , volunteers returned to have their energy expenditure and food intake measured .
After the first meal volunteers ate on average 128 kcal or 17.4 % less , while energy expenditure increased by 143 kcals or more than a quarter .
The team also found body weight was reduced by 0.5 % over the four days .
This would translate to a weight loss of around a pound or half a kilo a week , Professor Bloom said .
" The discovery could provide doctors with a whole new way to treat the obesity epidemic .
We need to get away from the focus on food and start to think about how to increase exercise , " he added .
Dr Colin Waine , Chairman of the National Obesity Forum , said the research was very exciting and opened up a potentially exciting new way of tackling a major health issue .
He said it does not negate the need for people to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly , around 30 minutes daily , he said .
" But it really increases our physiological understanding of the problem and opens up a new therapeutic approach . "
The Islamist radicalism that inspired young Muslims to attack their own countries – in London , Madrid , and Bali – has not yielded similar incidents in the United States , at least so far .
" Home - grown " terror cells remain a concern of US law officers , who cite several disrupted plots since 9/11 .
But the suspects ' unsophisticated planning and tiny numbers have led some security analysts to conclude that America , for all its imperfections , is not fertile ground for producing jihadist terrorists .
To understand why , experts point to people like Omar Jaber , an AmeriCorps volunteer ; Tarek Radwan , a human rights advocate ; and Hala Kotb , a consultant on Middle East affairs .
They are the face of young Muslim - Americans today – educated , motivated , and integrated into society – and their voices help explain how the nation 's history of inclusion has helped to defuse sparks of Islamist extremism .
" American society is more into the whole assimilation aspect of it , " says New York - born Mr. Jaber .
" In America , it 's a lot easier to practice our religion without complications . "
In a nation where mosques have sprung up alongside churches and synagogues , where Muslim women are free to wear the hijab ( or not ) , and where education and job opportunities range from decent to good , the resentments that can breed extremism do not seem very evident in the Muslim community .
Since 9/11 , however , concern is rising among Muslim - Americans that they are becoming targets of bias and suspicion – by law enforcement as well as fellow citizens .
It 's a disquieting trend , say the young Muslims – one that might eventually help radicalism to grow .
It 's impossible to pinpoint the factors that produce home - grown terrorists , analysts say .
But it 's also impossible to ignore the stark contrast between the lives of Muslims in European countries where bombings have occurred and those of Muslims in America .
" What we have here among Muslim - Americans is a very conservative success ethic , " says John Zogby , president of Zogby International in Utica , N.Y. , whose polling firm has surveyed the Muslim - American community .
" People come to this country and they like it .
They do n't view it as the belly of the beast .
With very few exceptions , you do n't see the bitter enclaves that you have in Europe . "
Life in America vs. life in Europe
Part of what so shocked Spain about the Madrid train bombers , and then Britain after the London subway and bus bombings in July 2005 , was that most of the perpetrators were native sons .
In each case , the young men , allegedly inspired by Al Qaeda ideology , came from poorer neighborhoods heavy on immigrants .
( By contrast , a plot foiled in August to blow up airplanes over the Atlantic involved suspects from leafy , middle - and upper - middle - class neighborhoods in Britain . )
America , too , has poorer neighborhoods with large Muslim concentrations , but they tend to be interspersed with other ethnic groups and better assimilated into society .
Another difference , some suggest , is the general profile of Muslims who have come to the US and raised their families here .
Most Muslim immigrants came to America for educational or business opportunities and from educated , middle - class families in their home countries , according to an analysis by Peter Skerry of Boston College and the Brookings Institution .
In Europe , the majority came to work in factory jobs and often from poorer areas at home .
European Muslims today live primarily in isolated , low - income enclaves where opportunities for good jobs and a good education are limited .
In the US , 95 percent of Muslim - Americans are high school graduates , according to " Muslims in the Public Square , " a Zogby International survey in 2004 .
Almost 60 percent are college graduates , and Muslims are thriving economically around the country .
Sixty - nine percent of adults make more than $ 35,000 a year , and one - third earn more than $ 75,000 , the survey showed .
In Britain , by contrast , two - thirds of Muslims live in low - income households , according to British census data .
Three - quarters of those households are overcrowded .
British Muslims ' jobless rate is 15 percent – three times higher than in the general population .
For young Muslims between 16 and 24 , the jobless rate is higher : 17.5 percent .
" The culture is qualitatively different [ in the American Muslim community ] from what we 've seen from public information from Europe , and that actually says very positive things about our society , " says Jonathan Winer , a terrorism expert in Washington .
" We do n't have large populations of immigrants with a generation sitting around semi-employed and deeply frustrated .
That 's a gigantic difference . "
Jaber , the AmeriCorps volunteer , who is studying to become a medical doctor , says he has not experienced anti-Muslim bias .
In part , he says , that may be because he does n't have an accent or look particularly Middle Eastern – his father is Palestinian and his mother Filipino .
But he also credits America 's melting - pot mentality , as does Ms. Kotb , the Middle East consultant .
" We were n't isolated growing up .
We were part of the culture , " says Kotb , who grew up outside Washington in a family that inculcated a success ethic .
" Religion was important , but not so much that you 'd have to cover your head or if you do n't pray five times a day , that 's it – nothing like that .
There were a lot more progressive attitudes " within her local Muslim community .
In mosques in America , it 's fairly common for imams to preach assimilation , says Mr. Zogby .
That 's not as true in Europe , particularly in poorer neighborhoods where sermons can be laced with extremism .
" The success of ... Saudi - inspired religious zealotry in Europe was in large part because the Saudis put up the money to build mosques and pay for imams , " says Ian Cuthbertson , a counterterrorism expert at the World Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research .
" The American Muslim community was rich enough not to require Saudi money to build its mosques . "
In Europe , it 's estimated that millions of second - and third - generation Muslims have not been well assimilated in their adopted countries , so have little or no fealty to either the European country they live in or the one their parents were born in .
" They are much more susceptible to the Internet , returning jihadist fighters , and extremist imams , " says Thomas Sanderson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" There 's no doubt that Europe has an incubator environment and we have a somewhat sterile environment for radicalism . "
To be sure , the United States has brought charges in several terrorism - related cases involving American Muslims .
Some have resulted in convictions , notably the 2002 case of six Yemeni- Americans from Lackawanna , N.Y .
Other cases are pending .
( See chart on Page 2 . )
Identifying and tracking home - grown terrorists is a complicated task – one that risks alienating or even infuriating the general Muslim - American citizenry if tactics are seen as unfair .
Feeling a chill
The young Muslims interviewed for this story chose their words carefully , but their inference is clear :
They worry that suspicion toward Muslims has been building since 9/11 , and they suggest that US intervention in Iraq and its support for Israel cause angst among many Arab - Americans .
US foreign policies " in the long term are going to hurt the US , " says Mr. Radwan , the human rights activist , who works in Washington .
" They , along with the crackdown on Muslim - Americans [ by law enforcement ] , feed a feeling of resentment and the perception that the US acts on the basis of a double standard . "
Indeed , America 's Muslim community would wage the war on terror differently .
According to the 2004 Zogby survey , three - quarters say the best way is for the US to change its foreign policy in the Middle East by recognizing a Palestinian state and being less supportive of Israel .
A newer concern for America 's Muslims is their standing in post - 9/11 society .
Many sense that the ground under their feet is shifting – and young people like Florida - born Radwan , in particular , feel it .
A 2001 graduate of Texas A&M University , Radwan wanted to become a doctor and began working as a medical researcher .
One month after the 9/11 attacks , he was let go – at the end of a three - month probationary period .
Afterward , he says , he could n't get even an interview for a job that used his biochemistry degree or research skills .
Eventually he abandoned his hopes of a medical career and shifted to human rights work .
That experience leads him to suggest another reason the US has n't seen European - style homegrown terror cells : the intense scrutiny the FBI has focused on Muslim - Americans .
" That is good in the short term , but bad in the long term , " he says .
" The Bush administration policies feed resentment that ... will stay in the Arab - American psyche for a long time . "
The FBI says it does n't target any community , neighborhood , or religion .
Agents simply go where the leads take them , says John Miller , the FBI 's assistant director of public affairs .
But he adds : " We have put a growing effort into community outreach because we understand the discomfort the amount of pressure our attention can bring to a community . "
The ' home - grown ' threat :
Is it overstated ?
A small but growing number of analysts believe that some US officials have overstated the threat of homegrown Islamist radicalism in the United States .
While Al Qaeda and foreign terrorists remain determined to attack in America , they say , the focus on potential American cells may be leading the US to misdirect its antiterror efforts .
" My theory as to why we have n't found any [ homegrown Islamist terrorist cells ] is because there are n't very many of them ....
They are n't the diabolical , capable , and inventive people envisioned by most politicians and people in the terrorism industry , " says John Mueller , a political scientist at Ohio State University .
" The danger is that we 've wasted an enormous amount of money with all of the wiretaps [ and ] investigations , and diverted two - thirds of the FBI from criminal work to terrorism work . "
The FBI calls such conclusions " uninformed , " citing alleged plots by radicalized US citizens .
The most notable was the case of the Lackawanna Six , so named for the six Yemeni- Americans from Lackawanna , N.Y. , who went to Al Qaeda training camps in the spring of 2001 .
" The people who make these claims [ about threats being exaggerated ] are never the ones responsible for preventing these attacks , " says John Miller , the FBI 's assistant director of public affairs .
" The point is that if you 're the dead guy , or you 're a family member of one of those guys , all you know is that you wanted someone to develop the intelligence and take the actions to prevent it . "
Still , a lack of public evidence pointing to extensive Islamist extremism in the US is leading a small but growing number of experts to agree with Professor Meuller 's assessment .
Like Meuller , though , they add a cautionary note .
" There 's not zero threat in any community , but it is good news and we have to hope that reflects an underlying reality that [ homegrown extremist cells ] do n't exist here , " says Jonathan Winer , a terrorism expert in Washington .
" You 've always got lone nuts in every imaginable ethnic group grabbing every imaginable ideology to justify terrorism . "

A bizarre video of Britney Spears belching and ranting at her husband has shocked fans worldwide .
The pop star - who appears confused as she speaks to the camera - moans about being ugly and whinges at husband Kevin Federline while eating what appears to be takeaway chicken and chips .
She also moans that she has " missed out on life . "
Scroll down to the bottom of the page to watch the video clip of Britney
When pushed further on the topic she says , quite irrationally : " Things !
Y'know !
Huh ?
Where 've I been ?
Huh ?
" I wanna drink at home !
Have you seen Back to the Future ? "
The dishevelled girl on camera is a far cry from the megastar fans once knew , when she had a string of chart hits and a glamorous lifestyle .
The video , which has already been seen by two million people on the internet in the past few days , reveals Britney burping , scratching her legs incessantly and rambling about random thoughts such as time machines .
The 24 - year - old , who is seven months pregnant and mother to baby Sean Preston , says she believes travelling through time is a possibility .
Referring to the film Back To The Future , she asks : " Is that possible ?
To time travel ...?
Yes it is Kevin .
I think other people are ahead of us . "
Federline , who is not seen in the video , replies : " Maybe , but they would n't tell the world .
Can you imagine how many people would go back and change s***? " .
The pop star , who is wearing a baseball cap and vest , also says : " I 'm ugly .
My jaw hurts . "
As she let out an enormous burp , her husband tells her : " Dude , we 're going to do clips of you burping . "
A vice investigation prompted by classified ads on craigslist has led to 12 women being charged with prostitution offences in Bucks County , Pennysylvania .

Monopoly Revisited by Ian Stewart

So what are the true probabilities ?
The Markov chain method can also be applied to the real game ; I have to warn you , however , that the analysis is complex and requires substantial computer assistance .
Let me first remind you how Markov chains are used for Monopoly .
A player can be in any one of 40 squares on the board , which , for convenience , we number clockwise from zero to 39 , starting with GO ( which is zero ) .
Given any two squares A and B , there is a quantity called the transition probability - the probability that a player who starts from A will reach B at the conclusion of his or her turn at throwing the dice .
If this move is impossible , then the transition probability is zero .
There are 40 x 40 = 1,600 transition probabilities in all , and they can conveniently be encoded in a square matrix M with 40 horizontal rows and 40 vertical columns .
For example , the entry in the sixth row and 10th column describes the probability of moving from Reading Railroad to Connecticut Avenue in one turn .
The initial probabilities for a player are 1 for position 0 and 0 for all the rest ; they can be encoded as a vector v = ( 1,0 , ... , O ) .
The theory of Markov chains tells us that the evolution of this probability distribution is given by the sequence of vectors v , Mv , M2V , Mlv and so on : each throw of the dice corresponds to the matrix M operating on the vector v .
The resulting vectors can be calculated by standard matrix methods , available on any good computer algebra package .
Such packages can also calculate the so - called eigenvectors and eigenvalues of M . A vector u is an eigenvector with eigenvalue c if Mu = c x u , where c can be a real or complex number .
Markov's key theorem is that the longterm probability distribution is given by the eigenvector whose eigenvalue has the largest absolute value .
So in order to analyze the fairness of Monopoly , all we need to do is compute M and apply matrix algebra .
For my simplified model this was easy , but for the real game we must also take into account multiple rolls of the dice , special squares such as GO TO JAIL and instructions on cards that players draw when they land on CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST
Many readers sent me their analyses of the game .
The most extensive were from William J. Butler of Portsmouth , R.I. , Thomas H. Friddell , a Boeing engineer from Maple Valley , Wash . , and Stephen Abbott of the mathematics department at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minn. , who collaborated with his colleague Matt Richey .
Butler wrote a Pascal program , Friddell used Mathcad and Abbott used Maple .
The discussion that follows is a synthesis of their results .
( All models of Monopoly make assumptions about the degree of detail to be incorporated ; there were insignificant differences in the assumptions made by various correspondents . )
The first modification of my original model is to take full account of the rules for the dice .
A pair of dice is thrown , and if the result is a double , the player throws again , but three consecutive doubles lands him or her in Jail .
The throw of the dice is a tiny Markov chain in its own right and can be solved by the usual method .
The result is a graph of the probability of moving any given distance from the current position [ see illustration at left ] .
Notice that the most likely distance is 7 , but that it is possible to move up to 35 squares ( by throwing 6,6 ; 6,6 ; 6,5 ) .
Yet the probabilities of moving more than 29 squares are so small that they fail to show up on the graph .
These results are incorporated into M by appropriately changing each individual entry .
Next the effect of the GO TO JAIL square must be included .
The Jail rules pose a problem , because players can elect to buy their way out or stay in and try to throw doubles to get out .
( Or at later stages , when jail becomes a refuge from high rents , they can stay in and hope not to throw doubles ! )
The probabilities associated with this choice depend on the player 's psychology , so the process is non-Markovian .
Most correspondents got around this poser by assuming that the player did not buy his or her way out .
Then jail becomes not so much a single square as a Markov subprocess - a series of three ( virtual ) squares where players move from just in jail to In jail One Turn Already to Must Come Out of Jail Next Turn .
The GO TO JAIL square itself has probability zero because nobody actually occupies it .
The next step is to modify M to account for the CHANCE and commUNiTY CHEST cards , which may send a player to jail or to some other position on the board .
This refinement can be made quite straightforwardly ( if laboriously ) by counting the proportion of cards that send the player to any given square .
The extra probability is then added to the corresponding position in M .
Having set up an accurate transition matrix , one can work out the steady state probabilities either by numerically computing its eigenvalues and eigenvectors or by calculating the effect of a large number of moves from the powers M2 , M3 and so on .
Thanks to Markov 's general theorem , these two methods are mathematically equivalent .
The long - term probabilities of occupying different squares are shown in the table [ see illustration at left ] .
The most dramatic feature is that players are almost twice as likely to occupy the jail square ( 5.89 percent ) as any other .
The next most frequented square is Illinois Avenue ( 3.18 percent ) .
Of the railroads , B&O is occupied most often ( 3.06 percent ) with Reading ( 2.99 percent ) and Pennsylvania ( 2.91 percent ) just behind ; however , the probability of occupying Short Line is much less ( 2.44 percent ) .
The reason for this is that unlike the others , Short Line does not feature a CHANCE card .
Among the utilities , Water Works ( 2.81 percent ) wins out , with Electric Company ( 2.62 percent ) being marginally less probable .
GO ( 3.11 percent ) is the third most likely square , and the third CHANCE square ( 0.87 percent ) is the least likely@xcept for GO TO JAIL ( O percent occupation by logical necessity ) .
Friddell went further and analyzed Monopoly 's property market , which is what really makes the game interesting .
His aim was to find the break - even point for buying houses - the stage at which income starts to exceed costs - and to determine the best strategies for buying houses and hotels .
The exigencies of the property market depend on the number of players and which version of the rules is being adhered to .
Assuming that houses can be bought from the start , a number of general principles emerge :
Although it costs more to buy houses early , the break - even point will be reached more quickly if you do .
With two houses or fewer , it typically takes around 20 moves or more to break even .
Three houses produces a definite improvement .
Between Go and Indiana
Avenue the property square that offers the quickest break - even point for three houses is New York Avenue , which breaks even in about 10 turns .
Many other readers contributed interesting observations , and I can mention a few .
Simulations by Earl A. Paddon of Maryland Heights , Mo. , and calculations by David Weiblen of Reston , Va. , confirmed the pattern of probabilities .
Weiblen points out that these probabilities do not really affect how " fair " the game is , because all players face the same situation .
Developing this point , he notes that " if the rewards for landing on lowprobability squares were out of proportion to that lowered probability , then there would be a problem .
When out of sheer luck , a player in a game gets a big advantage , the game is unfair . "
He concludes that Monopoly is not unfair in that manner .
Bruce Moskowitz of East Setauket , N.Y. , remarked , " In my youth I played Monopoly many times with my brothers and friends , and it was common knowledge that the tan- colored properties , St. James Place , Tennessee Avenue and New York Avenue , are especially valuable since there is a relatively high probability of landing on one of them when leaving jail . "
This suggestion receives confirmation from the calculations , given that all three of these properties figure among the top 12 in the chart of probabilities .
Jonathan D. Simon of Cambridge , Mass. , chided me for suggesting that cheap properties were put near the start to help even out the game .
" Monopoly was ... created during the Great Depression by a single designer , Charles Darrow , with lots of presumably unwelcome time on his hands .
Under the trappings of wealth , the illustrated fat and rich men , it is ( slyly ) a poor man 's game .
In virtually all Monopoly contests ... the cheap ' properties turn out to be the most vital to Monopolize ....
The ' lucrative ' properties ... are expensive to own and prohibitively expensive to build without a source of income provided by ownership of a cheap group with houses . "
Point taken , though I would still argue that putting a lucrative property on the first half of the board would definitely be unfair , by Weiblen 's criterion that no player should gain a big advantage purely by chance .
And I 'm not convinced that buying up lots of cheap properties and renting them out is a poor man 's strategy !
This article explores the fundamental basis that object orientation is built on .
The article is intended as a beginner 's introduction to the concepts of object orientation and as a re-orientation for those that have lost their way .
I 've been teaching object orientation since the early 1990s when the craze first hit the mainstream .
Since then I 've seen it reduced to a sort of folk objects which misses the basis of what object orientation has always been about .
All object oriented languages , systems , designs and thinking are supported by three pillars :
Objects are responsible for their own behaviour .
Objects communicate via messages .
Objects are specialised .
These three are common to all object oriented systems of whatever kind .
I 'm going to describe these in more detail and also explore some of the things that people tend to see as defining qualities of object orientation .
What I 'm not going to do though is give any examples of languages in any way .
The reason is that I want to focus on the principles involved and not get bogged down in discussions about how to see the structure and features of differing languages .
Behaviour
In order to control its behaviour an object has to have two things : memory and code .
The memory is there because it must know what has happened in the past so that knowledge can influence its future actions .
The code is there so that the behaviour can actually do something .
An object must have both of these things .
Normally these are called attributes for the data members and methods for the member functions .
This part of the definition of object orientation can be looked on as taking encapsulation , as used within the structured programming paradigm , to its logical conclusion ( a viewpoint I discuss more fully in Encapsulation is a Good Thing™ ) .
Nearly every object oriented language is able to manipulate executable code as first order objects .
The simple ramification of this is that functions can be passed as arguments and the languages also support closures .
Many languages take this one step further and do n't recognise any difference between an attribute and a method at all .
Because most object oriented languages treat data and code in much the same way it means that most support algorithmic programming in a way which is very close to the way it is done in functional languages .
In many object oriented languages functional idioms can be used directly .
Message passing
This is the most important and probably the least well understood aspect of object orientation .
In essence it is very simple , but the ramifications and the different ways that languages deal with it has a huge impact on what is easy and what is hard to do in them .
When I explain this in a classroom I pick some poor unfortunate near the front of the room and thell them to stand up .
I then turn to the person next to them and hand them a piece of paper with “ stand up ” written on it .
I will then ask the second person their name and hand the first some paper with the question written on it .
The idea here is to quickly show three things :
It is up to them how they react to the command , but more importantly I can't directly control their muscles and make them stand .
The medium that carries the message is n't important , but the action that they carry out upon receipt of the message is .
Messages can be broadly categorised as commands ( stand up ) or queries ( what is your name ) .
If I as an object want other objects to do things ( like make people stand ) then I have to communicate that command to them .
Similarly if I want to ask them something ( like their names ) then I have to communicate that query to them and wait for their response .
I can't look inside their heads and divine their names .
This disconnect between
wanting something to happen ; sending a message to try to affect that action ; and the receiving object actually doing something
is what the message passing in object orientation is all about .
All object oriented systems , at least conceptually , have this notion .
At heart this is embodied into a message delivery mechanism ( the implementation of which is normally called the message dispatcher ) and it is the features of this mechanism that most strongly characterises different object oriented languages and systems .
In my classroom example the message dispatcher included the message medium ( air or paper ) as well as the recipients cognition of the command or question , but ends at the point where they start to do something ( stand or answer ) .
Message dispatchers have two broad functions :
Arranging for the message sent by one object to be delivered to the intended recipient ( and secondly passing any result back again ) .
To negotiate which code is run by the object in response to that message .
There are a huge number of different message dispatching systems implemented in all sorts of ways .
Many languages have a single message dispatcher that is always used , and other languages let the programmer choose between one of several depending on what is being done .
Nearly all object oriented systems also allow other message dispatchers to be created by the programmer as part of a system .
Some languages take this to an extreme and may run different objects in different threads using literal message passing as the communications medium .
In large systems it is common to group objects into separate processes which can then be run individually , often on different physical ( or virtual ) machines .
In order for the message dispatcher to know how to match the message to an object method there is normally some notion of a message signature that is compared .
Some languages use a single token ( just a name ) , others use multiple tokens ( typically one for each argument ) and still others use a complex mechanism built from a name and the types of the arguments .
As always other possibilities are possible ( or example an identifying number ) .
Specialisation
By object specialisation we mean that objects are specialists ( as opposed to generalists ) , not that they specialise over time ( although this may also happen ) .
This idea is very closely tied to the notion of cohesiveness and is the one pillar that is n't supported directly by object oriented languages other than through their support for being able to deal with multiple object definitions .
Normally the capabilities of an object ( the form of its specialisation ) is defined by its class ( or type ) , but not all object oriented languages have a notion of type , in fact many are untyped .
In all cases though it is up to the programmer to determine the suitable level of specialisation and how this is to be implemented .
Good object oriented designs typically give each object a single , well defined responsibility .
Where this responsibility can be broken down into sub-parts then these in turn are managed by separate sub - objects which are managed by their owner .
Another form of specialisation often seen in object oriented systems makes use of class hierarchies through inheritance .
The super - class will implement the general rules for performing its task and then delegate the details to sub-classes .
Secondary features
There are a number of other things that are not defining themes of object orientation but do tend to be present .
Inheritance
For many people this is the defining aspect of object oriented systems .
Historically inheritance has been an important aspect of implementing in object oriented languages .
Later languages leveraged the concept in order to provide stronger type guarantees ( most object oriented languages are untyped or very weakly typed ) and this in turn has led to an increased focus on inheritance as the defining property of object orientation .
In practice the form of inheritance varies considerably between different object oriented languages , but whatever form it takes the simplest way of looking at the reasons for using inheritance involve one or more of :
Programmer convenience — this used to be the only reason to use inheritance .
It was looked upon as a way to conveniently package common functionality and nothing more .
To implement operational polymorphism — this is the view that so long as two objects understand the same message they can be used interchangeably irrespective of any other relationship between their types .
To support inclusional polymorphism — this is the notion that the definition of a type includes all of its sub-classes .
Inclusional polymorphism can be seen as a formalism of operational polymorphism where the messages are defined as those that the super - class understands .
This forms the basis of the type system within most strongly typed object oriented languages .
Inheritance is so convenient as an implementation tool and as a way of enforcing type constraints that nearly every object oriented programming language supports at least some notion of inheritance .
It is however a much abused and much misunderstood feature .
Because inheritance seems so simple and obvious it is often the main feature of object orientation that is taught ( rather than the more difficult to grasp message passing ) .
As an analysis tool though it leaves much to be desired .
It tends to promote a view of object oriented design which is based around classifying ( or taxonomising ) the problem domain , rather than the process oriented and dynamical analysis promoted by thinking in terms of message passing .
Classes
This seems so fundamental to object oriented systems that it seems nonsensical that it is n't required .
There are however perfectly good object oriented systems that do n't have classes .
The purpose of a class is to provide a definition for which attributes and methods all instances of that class posses .
Object oriented languages that have classes normally fix this within the class definition and do n't allow the objects to be extended during their lifetime .
Systems without classes typically treat attributes and methods in a unified manner and allow these to be added to ( and removed ) during the object 's lifetime .
There are of course languages that allow the attributes and methods at construction to be specified for all objects of a given type , but still allow them to be changed later .
Clearly languages that do n't have classes have a hard time with inheritance , but in practice this turns out not to be a problem .
Meta-classes and factories
For object oriented systems that have classes there must be a way of creating the objects .
Some object oriented languages allow the objects to be created directly from the class definition , but in others there must be something that performs this build step .
Where systems have meta- classes then there will typically be a single meta- class instance for each class present in the system .
These can be viewed as either object instance manifestations of the class or as singletons .
These meta -class objects often serve two purposes :
Perform the construction of the objects of the class they represent , and sometimes of related classes .
Provide a central location through which all of the object instances of their class can communicate and store common state .
If a language does n't allow for meta - class objects then there will often be factory functions which perform the creation of the object instances .
Of course some languages support meta-class instances , factory functions and direct creation of the objects from their class definitions .
Polymorphism
It 's not possible to leave this without taking a proper look at the issues of polymorphism .
I 've already mentioned two forms of polymorphism , operational and inclusional .
There is also another form known as parametric polymorphism .
In a language which supports parametric polymorphism it is possible to state the features of a type that are acceptable .
This form of polymorphism is rare in object oriented languages , but is quite common in functional programming languages .
Most object oriented languages use operational polymorphism .
As mentioned , this means objects are considered compatible if they understand the same messages sent to them .
This form of polymorphism is also common in functional programming languages ( where the use of operator in the name is more obvious ) .
Inclusional polymorphism is used by strongly typed object oriented languages and involves the substitution of sub-classes for any of their super classes .
Whatever sort of polymorphism is employed it is a necessary consequence of treating the messages as an abstraction in their own right .
It is impossible to think in terms of message passing and not have polymorphism .
Once the message becomes something in its own right it is decoupled from the objects and can be re-routed , morphed , delayed or ignored .
This makes operational polymorphism the most natural form of polymorphism in object oriented design , even when a given language does n't support it directly .
The purpose
Finally I think it 's important to raise the issue of why use object orientation at all .
The very first object oriented system was Simula and the reason why it was created was a simple one : to help manage the complexity of the simulation software being worked on .
Most programmers today understand the difference between accidental difficulties and essential difficulties .
Object orientation , as a tool , is concerned with helping us to manage the essential difficulties .
It is not , and never was , about removing accidental difficulties — that was left to individual languages and systems to deal with as they saw fit .
A survey of object oriented languages will show a wide range of different techniques that deal with different types of accidental difficulty .
The very high encapsulation and the specialisation of objects makes then easier to reason about , implement and test because this implies high cohesion within any given object , or group of co-operating objects .
The interstitial messages used by objects provides a very sharp knife that can be used to create highly decoupled systems .
We can all point to object oriented systems where the designs have failed to live up to these ideals , where the tools have not been used properly .
Like any tool it takes time to learn how to use object orientation and many systems have been designed by those who misunderstood it , or were inexperienced .
This does n't really tell us anything about the effectiveness of the tool when used by those who know it better .
So long as people look to object orientation as a way to remove accidental difficulties they will always consider it a failure , and they 'll be missing the point .
The rest of us will continue to wield object orientation as our prime tool to manage the essential difficulties we face every day .

Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift is the Navy lawyer who successfully defended Salim Ahmed Hamdan all the way to the Supreme Court .
Two weeks after that decision in the case that was reached , he received word that he had been passed over for promotion and that , under the “ up or out ” rules , he will be forced to retire in March or April .
Coincidence ?
Who knows .
All I know is that Swift looks to be a straight arrow , the kind of guy you ’d want for a brother or a son .
And when he talks , we should listen .
Keith Olbermann interviewed him recently :
SWIFT : Thomas Paine said famously , “ He who would seek liberty must first defend his enemies from oppression lest he set a precedent that would reach himself . ”
And when we say that you can have a full and fair trial without the accused present , [ or ] you can use techniques such as waterboarding to extort a confession , and use that and that ’s fair , then inevitably that ’s going to haunt us and it ’s going to haunt our children .
We have a chance , still , to stop this and I am dedicated to preventing that from happening .
President Vladimir Putin is set to keep US oil companies out of a lucrative gas field in the latest sign of the deteriorating relationship between Moscow and Washington .
The Russian leader is expected to favour Norwegian companies and reject bids by America 's Chevron and ConocoPhillips after failing to secure backing from the United States for his country 's attempt to join the World Trade Organisation .
The tit - for - tat snub will be a blow to US companies scrambling for access to Russia 's huge gas reserves at a time of high energy prices .
It comes after Putin failed to resolve differences with US President George Bush over trade and human rights at the G8 conference in St Petersburg last week .
The two leaders were barbed about each other 's democratic records at a tense G8 press conference .
Putin later publicly praised Norsk Hydro and Statoil , the Norwegian firms that are competing with US companies for a role in developing the highly prized Shtokman gas field .
' There is very little chance the American majors will win that tender now , ' a Russian oil analyst said yesterday .
' Putin was hoping WTO membership would be wrapped up in time for St Petersburg .
The failure to do that is a blow to his prestige . '
A final decision on awarding the contracts - which involves extracting and transporting gas from Shtokman in partnership with Gazprom , the Russian state - controlled company - was also originally expected before the G8 summit but has been postponed until next month at the earliest .
As well as the US and Norwegian companies , Total of France is also on the shortlist to develop the 3.7 trillion cubic metre gas field , which is located in the Barents Sea , near the Arctic Circle .
Igor Shuvalov , a Putin aide , warned in April that the US firms ' chances of participating in the undersea drilling project were tied to US support for Russia 's WTO bid , although this has since been denied by the Kremlin .
Last week , however , Putin singled out the Norwegian bidders for praise when asked by reporters about energy deposits in the Barents Sea .
' You have probably heard that we are holding talks with several countries on the development of different fields , but companies from Norway are among the first on this list , ' he said .
He added : ' They do n't go around with their noses in the air .
They work objectively , very professionally . '
Viktor Khristenko , the Russian energy minister , also praised the Norwegian firms ' record on protecting the environment last week .
Analysts have tipped the Kremlin to pick the Norwegian contractors following the recent resolution of a Barents Sea territorial dispute between Oslo and Moscow .
But the Shtokman project is also important to Russia 's long - term relations with the US , since most gas from the field is to be shipped to north America in the form of liquefied natural gas .
Participation by Chevron or ConocoPhillips could help ease access to the US market .
Russia has been very reluctant to allow foreign oil groups access to its energy reserves other than as junior partners on joint ventures with Gazprom .
Russia supplies 25 per cent of the European Union 's gas but has also resisted EU demands that it loosen Gazprom 's control over the country 's pipeline network .
A dispute over gas prices earlier this year between Russia and Ukraine led to temporary disruptions in the flow of gas to western Europe and prompted Dick Cheney , the US vice president , to accuse Moscow of using energy as a tool of ' intimidation and blackmail ' .
But these diplomatic ructions have not extinguished the appetite of western investors for Russian energy stocks .
Last week the oil group Rosneft successfully floated in London and Moscow with a $ 10.4 bn placing .
Despite its size , the IPO represents only a small fraction of Rosneft 's total equity , and the company remains majority - controlled by the Russian state .
When you bought your digital camera , were you told how many million pixels it had ?
You 're always told that more is best : the higher the number of pixels , the better the picture resolution - and the steeper the price .
Early digital cameras offered 1 m pixels , while the latest boast more than 8 megapixels and counting - expensive models that sales assistants are always keen to sell .
But research being done at Rice University in Texas by Richard Baraniuk and Kevin Kelly promises to turn digital camera technology on its head .
Their dream is to have a digital camera with just one pixel , yet lose none of the picture quality .
Compressed data
" Digital cameras are very inefficient in their use of the pixel data they acquire , " says Baraniuk .
" We wanted to attack some of the inherent inefficiencies in conventional digital photography , in particular the fact that we sample digital images with millions of pixels but then need to compress the resulting data . "
Once you 've taken a picture , the pixels are represented by millions of numbers - far too many for your camera to store .
A battery - hungry microprocessor does some rapid calculations to find fewer numbers to approximate or compress the image .
This not only drains your batteries but also throws away most of the original image information .
The days of increasing megapixels are now limited , as 10 megapixels roughly equals the resolution of film .
" So you might ask yourself - is there a better way ?
Well , some new mathematics has popped up over the past two years or so that suggests there is , " says Baraniuk .
Over the past year , Baraniuk and Kelly have been testing a new type of digital camera .
While the images they 've produced appear fuzzy , the way they 've been created is nothing short of revolutionary .
It involves what they describe as " pretty deep stuff " - new mathematical algorithms for compressed sensing .
As with the JPEG format , compression is the key , but in a bizarre way .
To create an image equivalent to that from 5 m pixels , you might only need 200,000 measurements .
The light levels are recorded and then complex calculations tease the picture out .
A weird feature of the maths means the best kind of measurements to take are random ones .
To build their camera , Baraniuk and Kelly used something normally found in digital projectors : a digital micromirror device ( DMD ) .
This has 786,432 bacterium - sized metal mirrors which can be electrostatically tilted , and which fit on to a chip about the size of a postage stamp .
The number matches the total reconstructed pixels in the final image .
In a digital projector , the microscopic mirrors reflect light to the lens to make a bright pixel on the screen , or are tilted away to leave it dark .
The experimental camera 's DMD is run backwards by replacing the light source with a photodiode - in effect , the single pixel for the experimental camera - and filters for each colour .
A lens focuses the image to be photographed on to the DMD , while another directs the combined mirror reflections to the photodiode .
Only half of the mirrors reflect light onto the photodiode at one time .
Mirror selection is entirely random and , says Baraniuk , is like white noise on a untuned television .
The light measurements - repeated thousands of times in quick succession - are of the averaged intensity of just the random " on " mirrors and not the whole picture .
A computer then extrapolates an image from the data - also working backwards rather like the DMD - thanks to some mathematical magic .
" The bottom line is that we can take a picture with potentially millions of pixels but using just a single detector element , " says Baraniuk .
So far , their experiments have only involved photographing static objects such as dice , a ball and a coffee mug .
The big drawback ?
Five minutes to take a picture .
To reach a stage where their Cyclops camera might challenge an ordinary digital model may take several years of miniaturisation work and the development of faster algorithms .
" The idea is that it would give the same quality pictures but using less power and with potentially less overall complexity , " says Baraniuk .
" We 're not claiming we 'll replace conventional digital cameras tomorrow . "
Nigel Allinson , professor of image engineering at the University of Sheffield , has concerns about the method because of possible artefacts in image reconstruction , the extra computing power needed and the loss of light ( which means less sensitivity in low - light situations ) .
Nevertheless , he reckons that single detectors might be useful for infrared , ultraviolet or x-rays .
Exciting ideas
" Ideas such as the single - pixel camera are exciting .
The field has yet to be fully explored since , as always , there will be limitations .
The potential of a single detecting element is that you can work much more easily outside the visible part of the spectrum , " says Allinson .
The two American researchers are thinking along the same lines , and they 're interested in building a terahertz camera for high - resolution imaging .
Terahertz radiation will penetrate cloth , paper or plastics to see what lies underneath and has the potential of distinguishing between liquids - something that airport security might find very useful .
But should the single - pixel digital camera ever reach the high street , that pushy sales assistant is going to be lost for words .

There should be at least one universal response to this in Britain .
Why is Tony Blair still Prime Minister after leading his country into such a disastrous war ?
Any large company would by now have got rid of a managing director guilty of a mistake on that scale .
Any institution you care to name would have done the same .
Why is Blair immune from the normal requirements of high office ?
Why , instead of being allowed by the cabinet to establish six new policy committees designed to entrench his legacy , has he not been impeached and thrown out of office ?
Even if his Iraq policy was formed in good faith , the scale of the error surely requires us to ask him and all those concerned with this disaster to leave .
It does n't matter now whether you were pro-war , strongly opposed to it or somewhere in between , the policy in the Middle East has been an unmitigated failure , an outcome that was built into the earliest planning for the enterprise .
People 's views four years ago do n't count now because Britain is at the heart of a world - changing catastrophe and as far as our interests go , there has not been a single advantage , not even the one of keeping the special relationship alive .
How did we get here ?
The answer is still not entirely clear .
We think we know that Blair manipulated the situation , but we still do n't have all the evidence .
What is needed is for people to come forward and for the past to be examined more intensively than before .
For instance , it is well worth returning to a memo written by a young diplomat named Matthew Rycroft , which is still significantly undervalued as evidence of the Prime Minister 's drive to war and of the innate negligence of American planning for the period after the invasion .
Rycroft is now safely tucked away in Sarajevo as British ambassador to Bosnia .
But in the summer of 2002 , aged 34 , he was Tony Blair 's private secretary for foreign affairs .
In this capacity , he attended a secret meeting at Downing Street which included Tony Blair , Foreign Secretary Jack Straw , Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon , Sir Richard Dearlove , the head of MI6 , John Scarlett , the head of the Joint Intelligence Committee , Lord Goldsmith , the Attorney General , and Blair 's military chiefs and the sofa cabinet - Alastair Campbell , Sally Morgan and Jonathan Powell .
He then wrote a memo to his boss , Sir David Manning , Blair 's chief foreign policy adviser .
It is really a minute of the meeting .
The crucial passage reads : ' C [ Sir Richard Dearlove , head of MI6 ] reported on his recent talks in Washington .
There was a perceptible shift in attitude .
Military action was now seen as inevitable .
Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy .
The NSC [ the US National Security Council ] had no patience with the UN route and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime 's record .
There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action . '
The Downing Street Memo , as it became known , was published in the Sunday Times on 1 May 2005 , five days before the general election .
It certainly made an impact but by the end of that week , it had been washed away with the rest of the pre-election clamour .
Blair had won a third term and his mysterious hold over the British electorate managed even to vanquish these revelations about British and American thinking eight months before the war .
It took a while for it to surface in the press in the US although its consequence was immediately grasped in the blogosphere .
In Britain , the memo became part of the inconclusive miasma of the Hutton report into David Kelly 's death and of the Butler review of intelligence on WMD ; and it decomposed in the public 's understanding at roughly the same rate .
Indeed , one often wonders if Blair has been saved by the amount of material produced by public inquiries ( Hutton is 740 pages ; Butler 192 ) .
The more that is published , the more the issues blur .
But the memo is the goods .
It establishes Bush 's resolve to find a pretext for war , regardless of the facts on WMD and Saddam 's links to terrorism .
It further makes plain that there was little or no thinking about the postwar period , an error that now must be regarded as equal to or greater than the invasion .
No surprise is expressed in Rycroft 's account of the meeting about what was going on in America , which leads one to assume that among a very small group , the idea of invasion was a fully fledged possibility , even though Blair was assuring the public and cabinet colleagues outside the inner circle that nothing had been decided .
There was much more in the original Sunday Times report on the meeting .
Jack Straw and Lord Goldsmith had doubts about the legal case for war , while Blair was committed from the outset to supporting US plans for regime change .
At the time , no one seems to have remembered what Tony Blair had said in his evidence to Lord Butler 's report into the intelligence on WMD , published eight months before the memo came to light .
Blair said : ' I remember that during the course of July and August , I was increasingly getting messages saying , " Are you about to go to war ? " and I was thinking , " This is ridiculous " and so I remember towards the end of the holiday actually phoning Bush and saying we have got to put this right straight away ... we 've not decided on military action . '
If not a direct lie , it is hardly the truth .
On the September dossier , Tony Blair said : ' The purpose of the dossier was simply to say , " This is why we think there is intelligence that means that this is not fanciful view on our part . " '
It is clear now that he knew the Americans were fixing their intelligence for war and that he had to get his act together .
In all the emails that emerged during Lord Hutton 's inquiry , the pressure to make this case is clear .
Here is one from young Rycroft : ' Part of the answer of " why now ? " is that the threat will only get worse if we do n't act now - the threat that Saddam will use WMD , but also the threat that Iraq 's WMD will somehow get into the hands of terrorists . '
Rycroft was helping to build the dishonest case he knew was being forged on the other side of the Atlantic .
There is a lot still to be discovered .
I believe we need to know exactly what happened in 2002 in order to decide what we are going to do now .
The collapse of allied purpose is clear , Iraq is in free fall , yet we still have not found out exactly how a small group of politicians and officials hijacked policy and took us to war against the clear wishes of the nation .
As the situation deteriorates in Iraq , Britain 's need to distance itself from Blair 's policy increases by the day .
We need more answers .
The call on the political establishment outside Number 10 is urgent .
The House of Commons must show it is not been entirely debauched by party politics and bring the government to account and that includes Labour members .
In the meantime , my mailbox is open all hours for the slightest information that may cast light on the path to war .

· Bishop admits right to life for newborns is not absolute · Nuffield inquiry to publish guidelines on premature births
Church of England leaders want doctors to be given the right to withhold treatment from seriously disabled newborn babies in exceptional circumstances .
The move is expected to spark massive controversy .
The church leaders ' call for some children to be allowed to die - overriding the presumption that life should be preserved at any cost - comes in response to an independent inquiry , which is to be published this week , into the ethics of resuscitating and treating extremely premature babies .
The decision by religious leaders to accept that in some rare cases it may be better to end life than to artificially prolong it is a landmark for the church .
The Rt Rev Tom Butler , Bishop of Southwark and vice chair of public affairs of the
Mission and Public Affairs Council , states in the church 's submission to the inquiry , that 'it may in some circumstances be right to choose to withhold or withdraw treatment , knowing it will possibly , probably , or even certainly result in death ' .
The church 's report does not spell out which medical conditions might justify a decision to allow babies to die but they are likely to be those agonising dilemmas such as the one faced by the parents of Charlotte Wyatt , who was born three months prematurely , weighing only 1lb and with severe brain and lung damage .
The report also suggests the enormous cost implications to the NHS of keeping very premature and sick babies alive with invasive medical care and the burden on the parents should also be taken into consideration .
Doctors wanted to switch off Charlotte 's life support machine because they said her severe mental and physical handicaps left her in constant pain with an ' intolerable ' quality of life .
They pointed out that every time she had an infection , staff would have to give injections or set up drips that caused yet more pain .
After the case went through the courts , the child , now three , survived but with severe disabilities .
She is now in care as her estranged parents found it too hard to meet her 24 - hour healthcare needs .
The church 's call comes in their submission to the Nuffield Council on Bioethics , an independent body that publishes guidelines on how doctors should deal with ethical issues .
The council set up the inquiry nearly two years ago in order to consider the implications of advances which enable babies to be born halfway through pregnancy and kept alive .
Their statement comes the week after one of Britain 's royal medical colleges called for a public discussion over whether to permit the euthanasia of the sickest babies .
The proposal from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was welcomed by geneticists and medical ethicists , but described it as social engineering by others .
In its submission , the Church of England said that although it could not accept the argument that the life of any baby was not worth living , there are ' strong proportionate reasons ' for ' overriding the presupposition that life should be maintained ' .
' There may be occasions where , for a Christian , compassion will override the " rule " that life should inevitably be preserved , ' wrote Butler .
' Disproportionate treatment for the sake of prolonging life is an example of this . '
The church states that it would support the withdrawal of treatment only if all reasonable alternatives had been fully considered ' so that the possibly lethal act would only be performed with manifest reluctance ' .
But it accepted there were a range of reasons why the final decision to withdraw or refuse treatment should be made , including the question of cost .
' Great caution should be exercised in bringing questions of cost into the equation when considering what treatment might be provided , ' wrote Butler .
' The principle of justice inevitably means that the potential cost of treatment itself , the longer term costs of healthcare and education and opportunity cost to the NHS in terms of saving other lives have to be considered . '
Very premature babies run a higher risk of brain damage and disability .
If they are born at 22 weeks , 98 per cent of them die , though by 26 weeks the chances of survival has risen to 80 per cent .
Different counties have different policies for very tiny infants .
Babies born before 25 weeks are not given medical treatment in the Netherlands and in certain conditions , euthanasia is permitted .
When the Nuffield Council produces its long - awaited report on Thursday , it is expected to reject a Dutch - style limit , with hospitals required to let a baby below a certain age die , arguing that even two infants born at exactly the same age can vary widely .
Instead , they are likely to call for much clearer guidelines to doctors about the issues of viability .
Parents of very premature infants will also be asked to start talking to doctors at a much earlier stage about the likely health outcome of their babies , so that they can be prepared for the worst .
The church 's submission counsels parents against expecting too much from medics , and asks doctors to refrain from giving parents false hope .
' The principle of humility asks that members of the medical profession restrain themselves from claiming greater powers to heal than they can deliver , ' it said .
' It asks that parents restrain themselves from demanding the impossible from the medical profession and indeed from themselves and their own capacity to cope . '

Sarcasm is so ubiquitous these days , it almost goes unnoticed .
But , as David Beckham proved , when he was sent off this week for seemingly clapping a referee who had just booked him , not everyone is a fan .
The trick is to use sarcasm intelligently , and sparingly .
They say sarcasm is the lowest form of wit .
Yeah , right .
Assuming " they " are the same experts who tell us " Look before you leap " and " He who hesitates is lost " , then I think we all know how incisive and invaluable their advice is .
What would we do without it ?
What have these geniuses got against sarcasm ?
Well , it 's rude .
It is a put - down , and often unkind .
If someone says to you , " That was really clever " , you would prefer them not to be sarcastic .
Also , it 's crude .
It 's about as clever as pointing and laughing .
Compared to the incisive brilliance of Oscar Wilde or Dorothy Parker , simply saying the opposite of what you mean does not impress anyone with your razor - sharp repartee .
When David Beckham got himself sent off for clapping the referee who had booked him , that so boosted his standing in the nation , did n't it ?
( Incidentally , the England captain had the last laugh , when it was later judged he had n't meant to insult the ref . )
Beckham and Wayne Rooney - both red-carded for sarcastic clapping But " they " are n't so big and clever themselves , putting down sarcasm .
For a start , surely the lowest form of wit is loud flatulence , not sarcasm .
It can be a beautiful and impressive thing ( sarcasm , not the other , though each to their own ) .
So may I offer , in all due sincerity , my tips on how to love sarcasm and make it work for you .
Note first of all that we are all sarcastic , often without noticing it .
" Oh , very funny , " we say , without cracking a smile .
When the cat suffers an upset tummy on the lounge carpet : " That 's all I need . "
Some phrases are only ever used sarcastically :
My heart bleeds .
Wise guy .
My hero .
Big deal .
Our beloved leader ( in Britain , anyway ) .
And any phrase at all that begins " oh so ... " ( " He 's oh so smart " ) .
Some phrases have been used sarcastically for so long they now mean the opposite of what they once did : " Too bad , " was once an expression of sympathy , till the sarcastic crowd got their hands on it .
But if you 're willing to move on from everyday sarcasm to something bigger and better , you will find it an art , with a noble tradition .
Learn from the masters .
Follow the bard
It goes back as far as the Biblical prophets .
When the prophets of Baal fail to call down fire from heaven in a contest with Elijah , he cries : " Pray louder !
He is a god !
Maybe he is daydreaming or relieving himself , or perhaps he 's gone on a journey !
Or maybe he 's sleeping , and you 've got to wake him up ! " ( Good News version ) Benedick , right , makes light of the cattle drover 's reputation for dishonesty Some of the great figures of comedy , from Beatrice and Benedick to Chandler Bing , have endeared themselves to discerning audiences with sarcasm .
" Why , that 's spoken like an honest drover " says Benedick , in Much Ado About Nothing , when Claudio lies to him : " so they sell bullocks . "
" Ooh , " says Chandler as Ross attaches his nicotine patch , " I 'm alive with pleasure now " .
Then there 's Eddie Izzard , recounting how he saw a London Underground guard checking an unattended bag by shaking it : " Oh , Captain Clever !
Rattle it , if it does n't go off it can't be a bomb ! "
And the king of sarcasm , Basil Fawlty , when Mrs Richards complains about the view of Torquay : " What did you expect to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window ?
Sydney Opera House perhaps ?
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon ?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically ...? "
So there is no reason why sarcasm has to be dumb .
Just as there are corny puns and inspired ones , and funny and feeble versions of three men going into a pub , so the glories of sarcasm are only limited by your wit .
Learn from the examples above : apply a flair for words , wit , a pinch of attitude , and maybe a toilet reference , and the world will marvel .
How hard can it be ?
People repellent Could " they " be equally wrong about sarcasm being especially rude and unkind ?
As if .
Almost all jokes are at someone 's expense after all , apart from puns .
And if sarcasm is particularly apt for putting the fools in their places , it can equally be self - deprecating , or just a complaint about the outrageous trials of life that beset good people like us .
Modern - day master of the sarky quip , Jack Dee
That said , it can be a powerful anti-personnel device , when the personnel around you really deserve it .
But a couple of caveats .
Firstly , make sure you 're right .
Like all powerful weapons , you do n't want sarcasm to blow up in your face .
I once worked for an uptight , hyper - organised and over - sarcastic supervisor , and was sent in my first week to an interview .
" Still here ? " she demanded , shortly before it .
" Do you want to be late ? " " No . .. "
" Because you 're going to be , are n't you ? "
" No , it 's next door in half an hour . "
" Oh . "
She left a humbled tyrant , and I enthroned on the adoration of my peers , which I like to believe was sincere .
Secondly , do n't overuse it .
It 's like chilli .
A little here and there spices things up and shows them who 's boss , but you do n't make many friends by sprinkling it in everything .
Finally , my secret weapon against overly sarcastic people : fail to understand sarcasm - take everything they say at face value .
" Well that 's just great ! " they snarl .
" Really ? " you reply sweetly , " I thought you 'd be upset . "
Keep it up and they 'll be banging their head against the wall .
And we would n't want that now , would we ?

Your enjoyable ( really ) article makes the usual mistake of confusing sarcasm with irony .
I believe a little research will confirm that sarcasm is cutting and insulting and not always witty and intends words to be taken for what they mean , while it is IRONY that twists an expression into its opposite .
" You have the face of a pig " is sarcasm : " Your face is so beautiful ..... for a pig " is ironic .
Richard , Wellingborough I used to work in a section that was lorded over by a not wholly un-attractive man .
He used and abused his good looks to ogle the women in the section .
I was not long in the section and I accidentally put mail for someone else on his desk .
He roared down the office that this letter was for " Tim , the ugly guy " .
I replied ( just loud enough to be heard ) " I see how I got confused " .
Cue much derisory laughter aimed at him and much adoration ( nudge , nudge ) from the women in the office .

My ex used to think he was the greatest at sarcasm .
Unfortunately , most of the time he was just actually being rude to me and could n't understand why constant , never - ending sarcasm actually felt like abuse a lot of the time .
That 's why he 's my ex .

It all reminds me of that character on the " Mary Whitehouse Experience " ( played , I think , by Rob Newman ) who had the unfortunate affliction of sounding sarcastic when he was being sincere , and only sounding sincere when he was trying to be sarcastic .
Got him into all sorts of trouble .
I still use his catchphrase " Oh what a personal disaster " ( said in sarcastic tones ) .
John Myhill , Northampton , UK Yeah , great article .
Steve R , London , UK
What annoys me about sarcasm is people 's general inability to distinguish it from irony .
Irony and sarcasm are two separate and distinct subjects , although they do overlap at times .
Michael S , Lancaster , UK I find in these politically correct days sarcasm is the only tool you have against the PC Nazi's , they simply do n't understand it , so they can not ban it .
Matthew Graal , Stoke - on - Trent
They say sarcasm is the lowest form of wit , they are of course wrong .
Michael Jackson jokes are of course the lowest form of wit as they require absolutely no form of imagination or intelligence to create .
However we still smile a little smile and laugh a shallow sarcastic laugh happy to know where the true butt of the joke lies .
Dan , UK People are so sarcastic these days that if someone 's not on the ball , they can often get the wrong end of the stick .
Dan , Bristol
As a defence to sarcastic wit , when I was younger , my manager used to ask me to stop being facetious ... to which I would reply to spell it and I 'll stop it .
Any right minded person faced with that challenge would return with the 100 % correct spelling and shut me ( a smart mouthed 19 year old ) up , but no , I must have used that line as a reply at least 10 times inside 6 months without ever being challenged .
Joe Postin , Tamworth UK
The problem with the written word is that with no verbal clues it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether a comment is sincere or sarcastic .
Great article , by the way .
Adam , Leicester , UK Being rather proud of her still youthful looks she asked : ' Do I look 50 ? '
' Not any more '

I 've noticed , particularly at work , a lot of people like to think of themselves as sarcastic , when all they do is say the opposite of everything , and smirk .
Hmmm , endlessly entertaining .
Paul G , Fleet , Hampshire Sarcasm is to the British , what Sincerity is to the Americans .
and it 's easily proved .
Just say " Have a nice day ! "
Oli , Deeside
If you have been sarcastic , and the victim retorts by saying , " sarcasm is the lowest form of wit " , simply ask them to name higher forms of wit .
They will respond , rather sharply , by saying , " ...erm , er " .
Mike , London
The people who regard sarcasm as the lowest form of wit are the dullards who ( a ) think up a witty riposte some eight hours after it would be useful and ( b ) are most often its victims .
Since sarcasm of the non-footballer variety requires intelligence , it 's only natural that it should be resented by them .
Jason , Herts , UK
Anyone who thinks that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit has obviously never seen a custard pie thrown in someone 's face .
Or heard of " happy slapping " .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday October 18 2006
In the article below , we referred to " a military base in Amara called Abomaji " .
We meant to say Abu Naji .
As the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglians prepared to set out on patrol through central Basra yesterday , risking mortar attack and possibly more , all the talk was of their boss 's suggestion that they were making the situation worse .
General Sir Richard Dannatt 's comments that the British military presence in southern Iraq " exacerbates the security problems " and that they should get out " sometime soon " was met with a mix of frustration and quiet agreement in the heavily fortified Palace compound , a former Saddam palace in southern Basra that now houses the consulate as well as 1,200 coalition troops .
" I can't believe they are saying these things , " one embassy official said .
" This whole thing is to do with politics and Tony Blair .
It 's not about what is happening on the ground here , but what is happening there . "
Three and a half years after British forces , in the general 's words , " effectively kicked the door in " to southern Iraq , many squaddies still believe they are making a difference , and that if they were to withdraw now there would be a messy collapse into open civil war .
Inside the army base yesterday , a tall , thin , 20 - something private was preparing his Warrior for a patrol into the city centre .
His camouflaged uniform has long since faded under the scorching sun , and his flak jacket was covered with grease .
The private , who has been in Iraq for five months , and has a few weeks to go before being relieved , was unimpressed by the general 's comments .
" He 's just saying this because he wants to take us to another fucking war , in Afghanistan or somewhere else , " he said .
" He does n't care . "
The extent of the deterioration of the security situation in the south of Iraq , however , is unmistakable .
Eighteen months ago , when I was last embedded in Basra , the British army still patrolled in berets and without flak jackets .
Today they will only emerge in heavily armoured Warrior vehicles , wearing heavy - duty helmets with protective screens across their faces , and body armour to cover their shoulders and upper arms .
Where the army once was able to patrol around the city relatively freely , they now know there are certain parts of it where they will be vulnerable to attack .
Patrols often involve a visit close to a Sunni mosque , just to reassure worshippers that the forces are there .
Part of the difficulty is identifying the enemy .
Basra has become riddled with organised gangs , militias and death squads , and its police force is corrupt .
According to senior coalition advisers , there are around 20 different security and police groups in the city , ranging from the directorate of education police to the justice police ; the governor alone has 200 armed gunmen protecting him .
Some of the police units are active in organised crime and have been infiltrated by militias , others work as death squads .
There are also around a dozen religious militias .
" We are in a tribal society in Basra and we [ the British army ] are in effect one of these tribes , " said Lt Col Simon Brown , commander of the 2nd Battalion .
" As long as we are here the others will attack us because we are the most influential tribe .
We cramp their style . "
He can see the general 's point .
" There is so much poverty and frustration in the streets of Basra , as long as you are in the street , someone will shoot at you .
We complicate the situation .
We give the disaffected and frustrated a chance to empty their frustrations by shooting at us . "
One recent episode illustrates this .
A military base in Amara called Abu Naji had been held by the British for months , attracting heavy mortar attack .
In late August it was handed to the Iraqi army ; within 48 hours , according to the commander of the unit , everything on the base had been looted .
The decision was taken to set up a mobile base in the desert , shifting position every 48 to 72 hours .
Staying in one place to be shot at , it would seem , was n't worth the trouble .
" We cannot substantially influence the situation .
Our powers are diminishing , " said a British civilian contractor attached to the British embassy .
" The army is holding the ring and they are buying us and the Iraqis time , but the talk of the troops is misleading .
There can't be a military solution to what is happening in Iraq . "
In the sweltering back seat of a Warrior , sweat running down his face , 2nd Lt Matt Lamber said he could n't afford to get distracted by the general 's comments .
" I try not to think of that .
I try to look at the smaller picture of what we are doing , and enjoy the small victories on the ground , the bad guys we arrest . "
On unofficial military web forums , meanwhile , other soldiers were more willing to speak out in support of Sir Richard .
" A man in the right position saying the right things NOW , " one soldier serving in Iraq wrote on the British Army Rumour Service website .
" We should be happy to have such a man in place who is on side and supports the army . "
Another wrote : " The most impressive comments I have heard from someone of his seniority for a long time . "
A third added : " I am thoroughly heartened by this and have the beginnings of a thaw in the cynicism which has dogged my service thinking since 2003 . "
An internet poll conducted by the website showed overwhelming support for the general , with 76 % saying he had been " absolutely right " and 16 % saying he was right from a military point of view .
Just 2 % said he had been " rather wrong " .
But one soldier calling himself Merkator criticised Sir Richard 's media appearances , which followed his newspaper interview yesterday .
He said : " You claim to be standing up for the men and women that serve under you , but your backtracking this morning has dispelled that notion . "

Objections to Bush library mount at Texas university
RAW STORY
Published : Monday December 18 , 2006 Print This Email This Print page sponsored by Velvet Revolution .
As planners moved closer on deciding where in Texas to site President George W. Bush 's library , members of the community at one candidate university expressed objections about the establishment of the facility at their school .
Southern Methodist University is one of the three schools that may play host to the presidential library of George W. Bush , along with the University of Dallas and Baylor University .
The blog of Paul Burka , the senior executive editor of the magazine Texas Monthly , includes excerpts of a letter written to SMU 's president by faculty , administrators , and staff of the university 's Perkins School of Theology , worrying about siting the library at the university .
In it , they say they would : ... regret to see SMU enshrine attitudes and actions widely deemed as ethically egregious : degradation of habeas corpus , outright denial of global warming , flagrant disregard for international treaties , alienation of long - term U.S. allies , environmental predation , shameful disrespect for gay persons and their rights , a pre-emptive war based on false and misleading premises , and a host of other erosions of respect for the global human community and for this good Earth on which our flourishing depends .
An article following up on the story , written by Scott Jaschik and published in the journal Inside Higher Ed , notes that SMU is considered the frontrunner among the three schools hoping to host the library .
It also reports that the organizers of the letter and the critics of the library have been trying to make the debate on the library focus on academic standards instead of Bush bashing .
According to the article , Susanne Johnson , an associate professor of Christian education , said she " would understand the value of an archive of the Bush administration , and sees how many SMU scholars would benefit from having such a collection on campus .
But she said that the campus has been left ' uninformed and naive ' about President Bushs plans to create a policy center to promote his view of the world . "
Jaschik 's article further explains that if the Bush library is sited at SMU , two graduates of the school have stated their plans to lobby to have " Methodist " removed from the university 's name .
Paul Burka 's blog can be accessed at the Texas Monthly website .
The Inside Higher Ed article can be read in full at this link .
An excerpt is provided below .
#
Some faculty members are not happy generally to be associated with the library of a president who  his librarian wife notwithstanding  is nt seen as a big fan of intellectual life .
When the reported price tag of $ 500 million for the library was publicized last month , professors didnt like their institution being linked to the jokes being told .
( Conan OBrien :  President Bush is putting together his presidential library and apparently the library is going to cost $ 500 million , which will work out to $ 200 million a book . " )
Johnson said that there are also real problems with the message the library could send .
SMU historically has had a reputation for attracting wealthy students  a reputation that the university has tried to fight in recent years by offering generous scholarship to low - income students .
 I think it might be a setback in terms of trying to attract a different constituency among students ,  Johnson said .
 Children of wealthy , leading Republicans in this state come to SMU , and then they are groomed here to become Republican leaders in all sectors of society .
We shouldnt be in the business of just replicating Republicans . 
Brad Cheves , vice president for external relations at SMU , said Sunday evening that officials couldnt comment on the faculty letter , when it hasnt been delivered and it is unclear how many people have signed .
Likewise , he said he couldnt comment on the Daily News article because the university was communicating on library matters strictly with the selection committee working with President Bush .
However , Cheves stressed that SMU has and continues to celebrate a diversity of thought . 
Duuuuuuuuude : like , an analysis , right .
( A study of global usage of words of the form ' duu*de ' )
Ever wondered how many u's should be used in the word duuuude ?
Well now we know .
These data came from google.com on 20th February , 2006 .
Repeating the same experiment gave fairly different results each time , but we can still speculate wildly about the meaning of the graph .
Its features and my related conclusions are explored below .
Initial Peak .
The initial peak , of course , represents the number of occurences of the word ' dude ' out there .
The word ' dude ' remains the most popular of all its derivative forms - nobody should be afraid to use it .
The initial peak , of course , represents the number of occurences of the word ' dude ' out there .
Secondary Peak .
The second peak is at x=4 , i.e. the word ' duuuude ' is more popular than ' duude ' or ' duuude ' ( although ' duuude ' comes a close second and may beat ' duuuude ' on repeat runs of the experiment ) .
I guess this is because some people wanting to emphasize ' dude ' slightly , have a tendency to avoid ' duude ' lest it be considered a typo , or maybe because they just do n't consider it emphasized enough .
Either way , if you would like to type a slightly - extended dude , use four u's .

Either way , Primary Trough .
The second peak is followed by a trough .
We can deduce that it 's simply not fashionable to type words such as duuuuuuuuuuude , with more than 7 but fewer than 16 u's .
Do n't do this .
Get a life and join the short - duuuude or long - duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude camps .
The second peak is followed by a trough .
We can deduce that it 's simply not fashionable to type words such as duuuuuuuuuuude , with more than 7 but fewer than 16 u's .
Exponential Decay ( wow ! ) .
Note that between approximately ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ' ( 20 u's ) and ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ' ( 40 u's ) the graph appears roughly linear .
As the scale is logarithmic , what this is really showing is an exponential decay .
This pattern would support a behavioural model of someone typing a long ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ' by holding down the 'u ' key .
However , after each 'u ' is added , they have a fixed but small probability of getting bored ( or deciding that enough is enough ) and letting go of the key .
When typing long ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude 's therefore , it is considered normal to follow this model and simply hold down ' u ' until you 've had enough .

Noise Floor .
Finally , above ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ' ( 40 u's ) the exponential decay pattern continues , but we see an increasing amount of random noise enter the data due to the small quanitities of search hits involved .
The noise seems to originate from single sources which have been copied onto multiple web pages , for example the peak at ' duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ' ( 66 u's ) results from some wild crazy person using it as their signature when posting to ' Magic The Gathering ' forums .
Wow .
Think what you like about this .
If you are interested , you can inspect the raw data and dirty kludgy harvesting script yourself .
That concludes this little study .
I hope you have found it interesting and informative , and that you are impressed by the rich benefits that information technology and mathematics offer our modern society .

With everything from Major League Baseball to my neighborhood dance parties all sporting the scarlet plus sign , I have suddenly seen more contrarians starting to pick up the idea that the Red Cross is not all it 's cracked up to be .
As a former volunteer for the organization and as someone who has read over their tax filings more carefully than most members of the public , I 'd like to scribble down a few of the ways in which the organization is dysfunctional .
The Red Cross is no longer much of a first - response disaster organization .
It is mostly a monopolistic biomedical supplier .
Of its $ 2.3 billion budget , $ 2.1 billion are for its biomedical division .
( Another $ 147 million was for ongoing 9/11 work , because Congress made them promise to spend all 9/11 donations on 9/11 , even long after the money was no longer needed . )
They are in large part a seller of donated body parts .
But when it comes time to fundraise , they always show firefighters carrying children , as though they had anything to do with firefighting or injured children .
In fact , they do n't .
They do almost no direct medical care anymore .
When I was a volunteer in the early 1990s , I was an EMT and was in a region that still let us treat minor wounds .
But even then , because of liability concerns , most geographic units of the Red Cross would n't let their staff touch an injured person .
Nor do they fight fires .
What they do is after a disaster , they try to restore people to the lifestyle they had before .
Which leads to :
They group 's goal of restoring people to pre-disaster conditions means they provide millionaires with pallet - loads of donated furniture , books , food , whatever comes in the door .
And for the destitute homeless guy whose gutter got closed by fire ?
He 's lucky to leave the shelter with a new refrigerator box to sleep in .
OK it 's not quite that bad .
He will receive a toiletry kit .
The worst was revealed after 9/11 .
The New Yorker reported SoHo loft - dwellers using their Red Cross checks to redo their kitchens -- at last , a chance to get that Wolf Range and SubZero fridge I 've been wanting .
But that 's the kind of class - consciousness you 'd expect from a group that in 2002 , gave its departing chief executive a $ 242,000 severance check , a $ 130,500 performance bonus , and $ 794,000 in deferred compensation .
Which brings us to :
In both 2003 and 2004 , according the group 's tax return , they had several employees making more than $ 300,000 .
I can understand that in the medical field you need to pay well to get talent .
But are n't there a lot of people in the field who would take a bit of a pay cut in return for the good feeling of working for the Red Cross ?
That 's what you 'd think , but you would n't know it to look at the tables of top - paid employees .
So in fiscal 2004 , the group paid out a total of $ 4.4 million in executive pay to its top 13 suits .
It 's not a dreadful number for a $ 2.3 billion biomedical company , but it 's something to keep in mind as they hold up photos of bedraggled New Orleaneans in their appeals for cash .
There 's the little matter of homophobia Suggestions of alternative charities are welcome .
Edward Teller Advances Global Warming Cure
Nuclear physicist Edward Teller says that the jury is still out on whether or not greenhouse gases are leading to global warming , but that contemporary technology offers considerably cheaper options for addressing any global warming effects than politicians and environmentalists are considering .
* One approach , first proposed by theorist Freeman Dyson in 1979 , would counteract any warming effect of greenhouse gases by diminishing by about 1 percent the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth 's surface .
* This could be done by deliberately introducing fine particles -- such as those thrown up naturally from volcanoes -- into the upper atmosphere to scatter sunlight and heat back into space .
* Such a solution might cost as much as $ 1 billion a year -- or just $ 100 million if technologically advanced options were employed .
* That would be between 0.1 percent and 1 percent of the $ 100 billion a year it is estimated would be required to price - ration fossil fuel usage down to 1990 levels in the United States alone .
Teller says that cooling caused by volcanic eruptions shows this technique would work .
For exmaple , the erruption of Mexico's El Chichon in the 1980s cooled the Northern Hemisphere by about one - quarter as much as the average prediction for global warming expected by 2100 .
According to Teller , the director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program 's Coordination Office has been promoting such geoengineering for three decades , and one National Academy of Sciences report a few years ago commented on " the relatively low costs at which some of the geoengineering options might be implemented . "
Teller and his colleagues presented their proposal for geoengineering at the 22nd International Seminar on Planetary Emergencies in August 1997 .

“ WE'RE going to make some history here today , ” said Steve Jobs this week at the beginning of his annual speech at Macworld , his company 's cult - like trade show in San Francisco .
He was as good as his word .
First , he launched a product that promises at last to bring digital entertainment from people 's computers to their television screens without fuss .
Then he unveiled an even more impressive device that transcends the description “ mobile phone ” .
Mr Jobs , who was so excited that he had lain awake all night , made it clear that he considered this day a watershed in the three - decade history of Apple Computer , a point that he emphasised by announcing that his firm would henceforth drop “ Computer ” from its name .
Indeed , Apple 's laptop and desktop computers , which are selling briskly , were hardly mentioned .
Nor were Apple 's iPods , which dominate the market for portable music players .
Both of the new products are really computers , but people wo n't think of them as such , since they will be in their pockets and living rooms .
The mobile phone — provided Apple can settle a legal dispute over the name with Cisco , a network - equipment company — is called the iPhone .
It will go on sale in America in June starting at $ 499 , in Europe in the autumn and in Asia next year .
The television - set add - on is called Apple TV and will hit stores next month at $ 299 .
With these two products , Mr Jobs intends to enter and transform new industries , and ultimately people 's lives — just as he did in 1984 when Apple transformed computing with the launch of the Macintosh , and again in 2001 when it introduced the iPod , which shook up the music industry .
That Mr Jobs ' announcements had such an impact during this particular week says a lot , because the rest of the consumer - electronics , computer and telecoms industries were simultaneously congregating at the Consumer Electronics
Show , the world 's biggest technology fair , in Las Vegas .
There , many of Mr Jobs ' old and new rivals were talking about much the same things as he was .
Microsoft 's Bill Gates introduced the “ Windows Home Server ” , his answer for uniting computers and television sets .
Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo , the boss of Nokia , a mobile - phone giant , unveiled new handsets that can hold music and videos .
His rival , Ed Zander of Motorola , did the same and rode a yellow bicycle around the stage to illustrate the point that “ content moves with you . ”
And so forth .
But all the gadgets being peddled in Las Vegas were “ evolutionary ” , whereas Apple 's were “ revolutionary ” and thus noteworthy , says Tim Bajarin , the boss of Creative Strategies , a technology consultancy in Silicon Valley .
This is particularly true of the iPhone .
Officially , it falls into the category of “ smartphones ” like the Treos or BlackBerrys that seem almost surgically attached to business people these days .
But Mr Jobs used that term in mockery , since many of these phones are , to him , so patently dim - witted .
Yes , they can send and receive e-mail , but why have a tiny keyboard when you do not need it for most of the phone 's other functions ?
Indeed , as Mr Jobs was talking , shares in Apple soared and they plunged at Research in Motion and Palm , the makers of the BlackBerry and Treo respectively .
Unlike rival products — but in keeping with Apple 's approach — the iPhone 's front panel has only one mechanical button .
The thin , small slab has a touch - screen which displays whatever buttons , keys or icons are relevant to the task in hand .
When playing music , the iPhone shows album covers ; when writing e-mail , a small keyboard ; when a call comes in , the caller 's identity from the address book ; and so on .
And whereas any other company would have foisted a stylus on its victims , Mr Jobs gloated , Apple lets them use fingers to scroll , drag , type and resize .
Just as the Macintosh was a breakthrough in 1984 for its mouse , and the iPod in 2001 for its click wheel , the iPhone 's stroke of genius is this new “ multi- touch ” technology .
“ And boy have we patented it , ” said Mr Jobs .
Along with more than 200 other patents , this technology should put the iPhone “ five years ahead ” of its rivals , reckons Mr Jobs .
This claim is hard to judge .
The iPhone is not the only phone that can switch automatically between a short - range Wi-Fi connection and a mobile - phone network , depending on which one it sniffs .
But it is the only phone with a web browser ( Apple 's Safari ) that displays web pages in their full splendour .
It is also the only phone that has “ visual voicemail ” to save users from the hassle of listening to all their messages before getting to the important ones — a joint innovation with Apple 's partner , Cingular , America 's largest mobile operator .
And it is by far the best handset for photographs , music and videos .
In his commercial goals , Mr Jobs was more conservative .
Around one billion handsets are sold each year and Apple hopes to sell 10 m iPhones , capturing 1 % of the market , in 2008 .
Yet just as the original iPod led to smaller and cheaper models , thus exceeding Mr Jobs ' initial projections , so the iPhone too could become a big family of products .
This must be worrisome to Motorola , Nokia , Samsung and , above all , to Sony Ericsson , which concentrates on selling high - end music handsets under its Walkman brand .
Amid all the excitement , Mr Jobs ' biggest concern has nothing to do with Apple 's products .
The risk , rather , is that Apple will become more deeply mired in a financial scandal over the backdating of share options , a practice that it and more than 200 other firms have now admitted to .
Apple disclosed last June that it had awarded options with dates manipulated to make them more likely to pay out .
It has since filed four statements with securities regulators , and each time Mr Jobs ' role has grown .
Last month two board members , including Al Gore , America 's former vice - president , issued a report ostensibly clearing Apple 's boss of responsibility , but confusingly and contradictorily detailing bad options grants ( and even a fictitious board meeting ) that involved Mr Jobs .
Mr Jobs will not be in the clear until regulators give their own verdict .
Many other affected firms have atoned by letting errant bosses go .
For Apple , whose identity is inextricably wound up with its co-founder and boss , this might spell disaster .
Mr Jobs does have able lieutenants , such as Timothy Cook , his number two , who took over for six weeks while Mr Jobs had cancer surgery in 2004 .
But Apple without Steve Jobs would lose its shine .
Tim ( excuse me , Grima Wormtongue ) discussed this last night in depth , and Glenn Greenwald has more today , but this story certainly will be the topic of much discussion :
A team of American and Iraqi epidemiologists estimates that 655,000 more people have died in Iraq since coalition forces arrived in March 2003 than would have died if the invasion had not occurred .
The estimate , produced by interviewing residents during a random sampling of households throughout the country , is far higher than ones produced by other groups , including Iraq ’s government .
It is more than 20 times the estimate of 30,000 civilian deaths that President Bush gave in a speech in December .
It is more than 10 times the estimate of roughly 50,000 civilian deaths made by the British - based Iraq Body Count research group .
Rather than debate the idea that we have lost Iraq , that we have no real plan other than ‘ staying the course , ’ and various other issues of importance ( despite the ‘ seriousness ’ of the GOP ) , you can bet that all that will be done is an attack on the procedures of this study .
As we all know the instinctive Republican response when confronted with things they do n’t like is to blame the media , Democrats , or both , it is just a matter of time before the assault on this data begins ( and to be fair , I know I did my best to ‘ debunk ’ the first study ) .
Who knows - maybe by the time Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly are done dissecting the stats in this study , we will find out that it actually proves global warming is n’t happening .
At any rate , rather than sit back and wait for the inevitable bullshit to fly , let ’s help them out .
With that in mind , here are the top ten GOP excuses for an estimate of a half million + dead Iraqi’s :
10 .
At least when we kill civilians , it is an accident .
Saddam intentionally killed civilians .
9 . No one could have predicted there would be civilian casualties .
8 . We tried to come up with a plan to win this war without killing civilians , but obstructionist Democrats made it too hard .
7 . How many innocent civilians did FDR and Truman kill ?
( Excuse used partially used with a reference to Nagasaki and Hiroshima . )
6 . Why all the fuss ?
The Iraqi people can ‘ tolerate ’ a few dead .
( Excuse actually used by Bush in his presser . )
5. Freedom is n’t Free.
Freedom is messy .
4 . Better to have collateral damage over there than to have it over here .
3 . The terrorists do n’t care if they kill innocent civilians .
2. Brian Ross and the media have known people are dying in Iraq for a long while .
Why did they wait until right before an election to tell us ?
( Excuse actually used here at Red State )
1. Epidemiologists ?!?
What the hell do skin doctors know about waging war ?
( Excuse partially used here : “ So somewhere between 8 and 194 thousand , good lord I hope I never get treated by one of these quacks . ” )
Feel free to add your own in the comments ( and if you have links to these made - up excuses being actually used , please forward them ) .
*** Update ***
Majikthese compiles the list of reactions so I do n’t have to .
The effectiveness of the PayPal network stems , in part , from the fact that it includes all the elements needed to put together a start - up : Talented engineers and entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and a love of the start - up life ; experienced managers who can turn ideas into businesses ; and financiers , most notably Mr. Thiel and Mr. Botha , but also Mr. Hoffman , Mr. Levchin and others , who have used their PayPal money to become angel investors .
The fact that most key PayPal employees were in their 20’s and 30’s , and not ready for retirement , helped too .
The long hours , sleepless nights and intense pressure of life inside a start - up often create strong bonds among its employees .
In its early years , PayPal was all about pressure and the struggle for survival .
The company was losing millions each month .
It was besieged by hackers who used technological trickery to siphon off huge sums from the company ’s coffers .
And it faced blistering competition from , among others , eBay , which eventually admitted defeat when it shut down its own online payment service and bought PayPal .
Mr. Levchin said the pace at PayPal was so intense that employees had little time for much else .
“ We all became each other ’s social life , ” he said .
“ Because of that , we formed really deep connections . ”
Many of those bonds were already in place , and life at PayPal merely strengthened them .
From the beginning , PayPal hired people whom its founders or other early employees already knew .
Mr. Thiel tapped his network of friends from Stanford , many of whom had worked at the Stanford Review , a libertarian magazine that Mr. Thiel co-founded in 1987 .
They populated PayPal ’s business ranks .
Mr. Levchin , for his part , hired engineers in large part from his alma mater , the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , which had earlier been home to the team that developed the software that would be the basis for Netscape ’s Web browser .
One of the first engineers Mr. Levchin hired at PayPal , for example , was Russel Simmons , who went on to become a co-founder of Yelp .
Mr. Simmons , in turn , helped convince another engineer , Yu Pan , to join PayPal .
Mr. Pan went on to become one of the first people hired at YouTube .
Other University of Illinois recruits included Mr. Chen and Mr. Karim , two - thirds of YouTube ’s founding troika .
“ YouTube is like a PayPal reunion , ” Mr. Levchin said .
A YouTube spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Hurley and Mr. Chen available for this story .
The long - standing bonds created an atmosphere of openness and trust , which not only helped PayPal succeed , but also made it easier for members of the network to embrace each other ’s post - PayPal projects .
updates with French ministry statement Deutsche Presse Agentur
Published : Saturday September 23 , 2006 Paris -
The French defence ministry on Saturday indirectly confirmed the existence of a document drawn up by France 's DGSE intelligence service on the supposed death of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden .
In a press statement released in Paris , the ministry declared that it could not confirm a report in the regional daily L'Est Republicain that Saudi intelligence services had determined that bin Laden died of typhoid in August .
However , it also said that it was launching an investigation into the leak of the document on which the story was based , thereby authenticating the information in the report .
L'Est Republicain said it based its information on a DGSE document classified " defence secret , " and reproduced what it claimed were verbatim extracts from it .
As cited in the story , the DGSE document reads in part , " According to a usually reliable source , the Saudi intelligence services are said to have acquired the information that Osama bin Laden is dead .
The information gleaned by the Saudis indicates that the head of al - Qaeda was victim of a very strong attack of typhoid ... in Pakistan on August 23 , 2006 . "
The document goes on to say that bin Laden 's geographical isolation rendered all medical assistance impossible , and that the illness had caused a partial paralysis of his legs .
It also states that Saudi officials were waiting for more information , notably about where bin Laden was buried , to make an official announcement about his death .
According to the newspaper , the DGSE found the Saudi report sufficiently credible to have relayed it last Thursday to France 's highest officials , including President Jacques Chirac , Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy .

This post is some kind of the second part of Russian Police faces shot across Russian cities .
If you have n’t seen the previous post on the subject you can view it here under “ Russian Police ” .
All the photos are real , shot by people on the streets , submitted by different visitors .
Some photos are by Rullon Oboev .
Most of the photos are from Moscow city .
People complain in Moscow that the police in the city consist mostly of the people who came from other more poor parts of Russia , thus these are not faces of Moscow but faces of Russia .
Yes , people in Moscow always think that Moscow is some sort of other country .
Country in the country .
And that ’s true – it has been said that 90 % of Russian money are circulating inside Moscow city , and 90 % of these 90 % are in the Moscow downtown .
So if you go travel to Russia this is a short map of the policemen you might meet .
Everybody is admired by the beauty of Russian girls .
Even Russian cops .
Even Russian dog !
May I take a little nap please ?
As it was said the shots are from Moscow , a lot of nice cars are there .
Some sort of drunk incindent ?
Here it is continued .
Here a policeman demands something from the people who sell stuff on the streets .
Some bad news ?
Russian Road Police .
Waiting for another victim .
As it has been said roughly 90 % of the penalties that Road police gets on the roads of Russia do n’t go thru banks but directly to the policeman pocket .
Something funny ..
This is a winter outfit of some higher Police officer .
The left one .
The sign on the shop : “ Hot Bread ”
Sharing some profit with each other ?
This is the example of a Southerner so hated by some Moscow dwellers .
“ Khorosho ” means “ GOOD ” .
Holding such kind of flags banners is something like a commercial from Russian police ?

Iran : Tourists pass up on nuclear reactor
Tourists passing on chance to visit Iranian nuclear reactor , seem to be sticking to more ' conventional ' vacation hot - spots
Dudi Cohen
As part of the national effort undertaken by Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear programs are peaceful in nature , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered that the country 's nuclear facilities be opened to tourists from all over the world .
So far however , the tourists seem to be opting for Magic Mountain rather than embarking on a road trip to the Zagros Mountains .
" There is no issue of secrecy in the facility , " says a spokesman for the Isfahan uranium conversion facility to the Iranian news agency .
" The system works like any refinery and visits can be held without any restrictions . "
The spokesman noted however that " a visit to a nuclear plant is obviously not exactly like visit to an oil factory , there are certain issues that need to be examined prior to visits . "

Uranium conversion turns raw uranium ( aka yellowcake ) into pure uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) which is then used to produce the enriched uranium needed to fuel nuclear reactors or , as many in the West are concerned , produce nuclear warheads .

The Algorithm : Idiom of Modern Science
by Bernard Chazelle
hen the great Dane of 20th century physics , Niels Bohr , was not busy chewing on a juicy morsel of quantum mechanics , he was known to yap away witticisms worthy of Yogi Berra .
The classic Bohrism “ Prediction is difficult , especially about the future ” alas came too late to save Lord Kelvin .
Just as physics was set to debut in Einstein's own production of Extreme Makeover , Kelvin judged the time ripe to pen the field 's obituary : “ There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now . ”
Not his lordship 's finest hour .
Nor his worst .
Aware that fallibility is the concession the genius makes to common mortals to keep them from despairing , Kelvin set early on to give the mortals much to be hopeful about .
To wit , the thermodynamics pioneer devoted the first half of his life to studying hot air and the latter half to blowing it .
Ever the perfectionist , he elevated to an art form the production of pure , unadulterated bunk : “ X - rays will prove to be a hoax ” ; “ Radio has no future ” ; “ Heavier - than - air flying machines are impossible ” ; and my personal favorite , “ In science there is only physics ; all the rest is stamp collecting . ”
Kelvin 's crystal ball was the gift that kept on giving .
“ Soon , my friends , you will look at a child's
homework — and see nothing to eat . ”
Gloat not at a genius ' misfortunes .
Futurologitis is an equal - opportunity affliction , one hardly confined to the physicist 's ward .
“ I think there is a world market for maybe five computers , ” averred IBM Chairman , Thomas Watson , a gem of prescience matched only by a 1939 New York Times editorial : “ The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes glued to the screen ; the average American family has n't time for it . ”
The great demographer Thomas Malthus owes much of his fame to his loopy prediction that exponentially increasing populations would soon outrun the food supply .
As the apprentice soothsayer learns in “ Crystal Gazing 101 , ” never predict a geometric growth !
Apparently , Gordon Moore skipped that class .
In 1965 , the co-founder of semiconductor giant Intel announced his celebrated law : Computing power doubles every two years .
Moore 's Law has , if anything , erred on the conservative side .
Every eighteen months , an enigmatic pagan ritual will see white - robed sorcerers silently shuffle into a temple dedicated to the god of cleanliness , and soon reemerge with , on their faces , a triumphant smile and , in their hands , a silicon wafer twice as densely packed as the day before .
No commensurate growth in human mental powers has been observed : this has left us scratching our nonexpanding heads , wondering what it is we 've done to deserve such luck .
To get a feel for the magic , consider that the latest Sony PlayStation would easily outpace the fastest supercomputer from the early nineties .
If not for Moore 's Law , the Information Superhighway would be a back alley to Snoozeville ; the coolest thing about the computer would still be the blinking lights .
And so , next time you ask who engineered the digital revolution , expect many hands to rise .
But watch the long arm of Moore 's Law tower above all others .
Whatever your brand of high - tech addiction , be it IM , iPod , YouTube , or Xbox , be aware that you owe it first and foremost to the engineering wizardry that has sustained Moore 's predictive prowess over the past forty years .
Enjoy it while it lasts , because it wo n't .
Within a few decades , say the optimists , a repeal is all but certain .
Taking their cue from Bill Gates , the naysayers conjure up the curse of power dissipation , among other woes , to declare Moore 's Law in the early stage of rigor mortis .
Facing the bleak , sorrowful tomorrows of The Incredible Shrinking Chip That Wo n't Shrink No More , what 's a computer scientist to do ?
The rule of law
Break out the Dom and pop the corks , of course !
Moore 's Law has added fizz and sparkle to the computing cocktail , but for too long its exhilarating potency has distracted the party - goers from their Holy Grail quest :
How to unleash the full computing and modeling power of the Algorithm .
Not to stretch the metaphor past its snapping point , the temptation is there for the Algorithmistas ( my tribe ) to fancy themselves as the Knights of the Round Table and look down on Moore 's Law as the Killer Rabbit , viciously elbowing King Arthur 's intrepid algorithmic warriors .
Just as an abundance of cheap oil has delayed the emergence of smart energy alternatives , Moore 's Law has kept algorithms off center stage .
Paradoxically , it has also been their enabler : the killer bunny turned sacrificial rabbit who sets the track champion on a world record pace , only to fade into oblivion once the trophy has been handed out .
With the fading imminent , it is not too soon to ask why the Algorithm is destined to achieve celebrity status within the larger world of science .
While you ask , let me boldly plant the flag and bellow the battle cry :
“ The Algorithm 's coming - of - age as the new language of science promises to be the most disruptive scientific development since quantum mechanics . ”
If you think such a blinding flare of hyperbole surely blazed right out of Lord Kelvin 's crystal ball , read on and think again .
A computer is a storyteller and algorithms are its tales .
We 'll get to the tales in a minute but , first , a few words about the storytelling .
Computing is the meeting point of three powerful concepts : universality , duality , and self - reference .
In the modern era , this triumvirate has bowed to the class - conscious influence of the tractability creed .
The creed 's incessant call to complexity class warfare has , in turn , led to the emergence of that ultimate class leveler : the Algorithm .
Today , not only is this new “ order ” empowering the e-technology that stealthily rules our lives ; it is also challenging what we mean by knowing , believing , trusting , persuading , and learning .
No less .
Some say the Algorithm is poised to become the new New Math , the idiom of modern science .
I say The Sciences They Are A - Changin ' and the Algorithm is Here to Stay .
Reread the previous paragraph .
If it still looks like a glorious goulash of blathering nonsense , good !
I shall now explain , so buckle up !
The universal computer
Had Thomas Jefferson been a computer scientist , school children across the land would rise in the morning and chant these hallowed words :
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all computers are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Universality and the separation of Data , Control , and Command . ”
The field of computing later
opened up to men
Computers come in different shapes , sizes , and colors , but all are created equal — indeed , much like 18th century white male American colonists .
Whatever the world 's fastest supercomputer can do ( in 2006 , that would be the IBM Blue Gene / L ) , your lowly iPod can do it , too , albeit a little more slowly .
Where it counts , size does n't matter : all computers are qualitatively the same .
Even exotic beasts such as quantum computers , vector machines , DNA computers , and cellular automata can all be viewed as fancy iPods .
That 's
Here 's how it works .
Your iPod is a tripod ( where did you think they got that name ? ) , with three legs called control , program , and data .
Together , the program and the data form the two sections of a document [ program | data ] that , to the untrained eye , resembles a giant , amorphous string of 0s and 1s .
Something like this :
[ 1110001010110010010 | 1010111010101001110 ]
Each section has its own , distinct purpose : the program specifies instructions for the control to follow ( eg , how to convert text into pdf ) ; the data encodes plain information , like this essay ( no , not plain in that sense ) .
The data string is to be read , not to be read into .
About it , Freud would have quipped : “ Sometimes a string is just a string . ”
But he would have heard , seeping from the chambers of a program , the distant echoes of a dream : jumbled signs crying out for interpretation .
To paraphrase the Talmudic saying , an uninterpreted program is like an unread letter .
The beauty of the scheme is that the control need not know a thing about music .
In fact , simply by downloading the appropriate program - data document , you can turn your iPod into : an earthquake simulator ; a word processor ; a web browser ; or , if downloading is too much , a paperweight .
Your dainty little MP3 player is a universal computer .
The control is the computer 's brain and the sole link between program and data .
Its only function in life is to read the data , interpret the program 's orders , and act on them — a task so pedestrian that modern theory of reincarnation ranks the control as the lowest life form on the planet , right behind the inventor of the CD plastic wrap .
If you smash your iPod open with a mallet and peek into its control , you 'll discover what a marvel of electronics it is — okay , was .
Even more marvelous is the fact that it need not be so .
It takes little brainpower to follow orders blindly ( in fact , too much tends to get in the way ) .
Stretching this principle to the limit , one can design a universal computer with a control mechanism so simple that any old cuckoo clock will outsmart it .
This begs the obvious question : did Orson Welles know that when he dissed the Swiss and their cuckoo clocks in “ The Third Man ” ?
It also raises a suspicion : does n't the control need to add , multiply , divide , and do the sort of fancy footwork that would sorely test the nimblest of cuckoo clocks ?
Alas , it still strikes the hours
No .
The control on your laptop might indeed do all of those things , but the point is that it need not do so .
( Just as a bank might give you a toaster when you open a new account , but it need not be a toaster ; it could be a pet hamster . )
Want to add ?
Write a program to add .
Want to divide ?
Write a program to divide .
Want to print ?
Write a program to print .
A control that delegates all it can to the program 's authority will get away with a mere two dozen different “ states ” — simplicity a cuckoo clock could only envy .
If you want your computer to do something for you , do n't just scream at the control : write down instructions in the program section .
Want to catch trouts ?
Fine , append a fishing manual to the program string .
The great nutritionist Confucius said it better : “ Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime . ”
The binary view of fishing = river + fisherman makes way for a universal one : fishing = river + fishing manual + you .
Similarly ,
computing = data + program + control .
This tripodal equation launched a scientific revolution , and it is to British mathematician Alan Turing that fell the honor of designing the launching pad .
His genius was to let robots break out of the traditional binary brain - brawn mold , which conflates control and program , and embrace the liberating “ tripod - iPod ” view of computing .
Adding a third leg to the robotic biped ushered in the era of universality : any computer could now simulate any other one .
Underpinning all of that , of course , was the digital representation of information : DVD vs VCR tape ; piano vs violin ; Anna Karenina vs Mona Lisa .
The analog world of celluloid film and vinyl music is unfit for reproduction : does n't die ; just fades away .
Quite the opposite , encoding information over an alphabet opens the door to unlimited , decay - free replication .
In a universe of 0s and 1s , we catch a glimpse of immortality ; we behold the gilded gates of eternity flung wide open by the bewitching magic of a lonely pair of incandescent symbols .
In short , analog sucks , digital rocks .
Two sides of the same coin
Load your iPod with the program - data document [ Print this | Print this ] .
Ready ?
Press the start button and watch the words “ Print this ” flash across the screen .
Exciting , no ?
While you compose yourself with bated breath amid the gasps and the shrieks , take stock of what happened .
To the unschooled novice , data and program may be identical strings , but to the cuckoo - like control they could n't be more different : the data is no more than what it is ; the program is no less than what it means .
The control may choose to look at the string “ Print this ” either as a meaningless sequence of letters or as an order to commit ink to paper .
To scan symbols mulishly or to deforest the land : that is the option at hand here — we call it duality .
So 1907 , I almost hear you sigh .
In that fateful year , Ferdinand de Saussure , the father of linguistics , announced to a throng of admirers that there are two sides to a linguistic sign : its signifier ( representation ) and its signified ( interpretation ) .
A string is a sign that , under the watchful eye of the control , acts as signifier when data and as signified when a program .
Saussure 's intellectual progeny is a breed of scholars known as semioticians .
Funny that linguists , of all people , would choose for themselves a name that rhymes with mortician .
Funny or not , semiotics mavens will point out the imperfect symmetry between program and data .
The latter is inviolate .
Signifiers must be treated with the utmost reverence : they could be passwords , hip - hop rhymes , or newfound biblical commandments .
Mess with them at your own peril .
Programs are different .
The encoding of the signified is wholly conventional .
Take the program “ Print this ” , for example .
A francophonic control would have no problem with “ Imprimer ceci ” or , for that matter , with the obsequious “ O , control highly esteemed , may you , noblest of cuckoos , indulge my impudent wish to see this humble string printed out , before my cup runneth over and your battery runneth out . ”
The plethora of programming languages reveals how so many ways there are of signifying the same thing .
( Just as the plethora of political speeches reveals how so many ways there are of signifying nothing . )
Sensing the comic , artistic , and scholarly potential of the duality between program and data , great minds went to work .
Abbott and Costello's “ Who 's on First ? ” routine is built around the confusion between a baseball player 's nickname ( the signifier ) and the pronoun “ who ” ( the signified ) .
Magritte 's celebrated painting “ Ceci n'est pas une pipe ” ( this is not a pipe ) plays on the distinction between the picture of a pipe ( the signifier ) and a pipe one smokes ( the signified ) .
The great painter might as well have scribbled on a blank canvas :
“ Le signifiant n'est pas le signifié ” ( the signifier is not the signified ) .
But he did n't , and for that we 're all grateful .
English scholars are not spared the slings and arrows of duality either .
How more dual can it get than the question that keeps Elizabethan lit gurus awake at night : “ Did Shakespeare write Shakespeare ? ”
And pity the dually tormented soul that would dream up such wacky folderol : “ Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe ;
All mimsy were the borogoves , And the mome raths outgrabe . ”
Say it ai n't true
I am lying .
Really ?
Then I am lying when I say I am lying ; therefore , I am not lying .
Yikes .
But if I am not lying then I am not lying when I say I am lying ; therefore , I am lying .
Double yikes .
Not enough yet ?
Okay , consider the immortal quip of the great American philosopher Homer Simpson : “ Oh Marge , cartoons do n't have any deep meaning ; they 're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh . ”
If cartoons do n't have meaning , then Homer 's statement is meaningless ( not merely a philosopher , the man is a cartoon character ) ; therefore , for all we know , cartoons have meaning .
But then Homer 's point is ...
Doh !
Just say it ai n't true .
Ain't true ?
No , please , do n't say it ai n't true !
Because if it ai n't true then ain't true ain't true , and so ...
AAARRRGGGHHH !!!!!!
Beware of self - referencing , that is to say , of sentences that make statements about themselves .
Two of the finest mathematical minds in history , Cantor and Gödel , failed to heed that advice and both went stark raving bonkers .
As the Viennese gentleman with the shawl - draped couch already knew , self - reference is the quickest route to irreversible dementia .
Escher 's reproductive parts
It is also the salt of the computing earth .
Load up your iPod , this time with the program - data document [ Print this twice | Print this twice ] .
Push the start button and see the screen light up with the words : “ Print this twice Print this twice ” .
Lo and behold , the thing prints itself !
Well , not quite : the vertical bar is missing .
To get everything right and put on fast track your career as a budding computer virus artist , try this instead : [ Print this twice , starting with a vertical bar the second time | Print this twice , starting with a vertical bar the second time ] .
See how much better it works now !
The key word in the self - printing business is “ twice ” : “ never ” would never work ; “ once ” would be once too few ; “ thrice ” ??
Please watch your language .
Self - reproduction requires a tightly choreographed dance between : ( i ) a program explaining how to copy the data ; ( ii ) a data string describing that very same program .
By duality , the same sequence of words ( or bits ) is interpreted in two different ways ; by self - reference , the duality coin looks the same on both sides .
Self - reference — called recursion in computer parlance — requires duality ; not the other way around .
Which is why the universal computer owes its existence to duality and its power to recursion .
If Moore 's Law is the fuel of Google , recursion is its engine .
The tripodal view of computing was the major insight of Alan Turing — well , besides this little codebreaking thing he did in Bletchley Park that helped win World War II .
Not to discount the lush choral voices of Princeton virtuosos Alonzo Church , Kurt Gödel , and John von Neumann , it is Maestro Turing who turned into a perfect opus the hitherto disjointed scores of the computing genre .
Mother Nature , of course , scooped them all by a few billion years .
Your genome consists of two parallel strands of DNA that encode all of your genetic inheritance .
Your morning addiction to Cocoa Puffs , your night cravings for Twinkies ?
Yep , it 's all in there .
Now if you take the two strands apart and line them up , you 'll get two strings about three billion letters long .
Check it out :
[ ACGGTATCCGAATGC ... | TGCCATAGGCTTACG ... ]
There they are : two twin siblings locking horns in a futile attempt to look different .
Futile because if you flip the As into Ts and the Cs into Gs ( and vice versa ) you 'll see each strand morph into the other one .
The two strings are the same in disguise .
So flip one of them to get a more symmetric layout .
Like this :
[ ACGGTATCCGAATGC ... | ACGGTATCCGAATGC ... ]
Was I the only one to spot a suspicious similarity with [ Print this twice | Print this twice ] or did you , too ?
Both are program - data documents that provide perfectly yummy recipes for self - reproduction .
Life 's but a walking shadow , said Macbeth .
Wrong .
Life 's but a self - printing iPod !
Ministry - of - Virtue officials will bang on preachily about there being more to human life than the blind pursuit of self - replication , a silly notion that Hollywood 's typical fare swats away daily at a theater near you .
Existential angst aside , the string “ ACGGTATCCGAATGC ... ” is either plain data ( the genes constituting your DNA ) or a program whose execution produces , among other things , all the proteins needed for DNA replication , plus all of the others needed for the far more demanding task of sustaining your Cocoa Puffs addiction .
Duality is the choice you have to think of your genome either as a long polymer of nucleotides ( the data to be read ) or as the sequence of amino acids forming its associated proteins ( the “ programs of life ” ) .
Hence the fundamental equation of biology :
Life = Duality + Self - reference
“ Elementary , my dear Watson ! ”
On April 25 , 1953 , the British journal Nature published a short article whose understated punchline was the shot heard ' round the world : “ It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material . ”
In unveiling to the world the molecular structure of DNA , James Watson and Francis Crick broke the Code of Life .
In so doing , they laid bare the primordial link between life and computing .
One can easily imagine the reaction of that other codebreaker from Bletchley Park : “ Duality and self - reference embedded in molecules ?
Jolly good to know God thinks like me . ”
Turing 's swagger would have been forgivable .
After all , here was the man who had invented the computer .
Here was the man who had put the mind - matter question on a scientific footing .
Here was the man who had saved Britain from defeat in 1941 by breaking the Nazi code .
Alas , good deeds rarely go unpunished .
In lieu of a knighthood , a grateful nation awarded Alan Turing a one - way ticket to Palookaville , England : a court conviction for homosexuality with a sentence of forced estrogen injections .
On June 7 , 1954 , barely one year to the day of Watson and Crick 's triumph , Alan Turing went home , ate an apple laced with cyanide , and died .
His mother believed , as a mother would , that it was an accident .
The modern era
The post - Turing years saw the emergence of a new computing paradigm : tractability .
Its origin lay in the intuitive notion that checking a proof of Archimedes 's theorem can't be nearly as hard as finding it in the first place ; enjoying a coke must be simpler than discovering its secret recipe ( or so the Coca Cola Company hopes ) , falling under the spell of ' Round Midnight ought to be easier than matching Monk 's composing prowess .
But is it really ?
Amazingly , no one knows .
Welcome to the foremost open question in all of computer science !
Ever wondered whether the 1,000 - song library stored in your iPod could be reordered and split up to form two equal - time playlists ?
Probably not .
But suppose you wanted to transfer your songs to the two sides of an extra - length cassette while indulging your lifelong passion for saving money on magnetic tape .
Which songs would you put on which side so as to use as little tape as possible ?
Now you'd be wondering , would n't you ?
( Humor me : say yes . )
“ First you prove it ,
then you let it sink in . ”
You would n't wonder long , anyway .
After a minute 's reflection , you 'd realize you did n't have the faintest idea how to do that .
( Warning : splitting a tune in the middle is a no - no . )
Of course , you could try all possibilities but that 's a big number — roughly 1 followed by 300 zeroes .
Ah , but your amazing friend Alice , she knows !
Or so she says .
Then why not just get the two playlists from her ?
By adding up a few numbers , you 'll easily verify that she 's not lying and that , indeed , both lists have the same playing time .
What Alice will hand you over is , in essence , a proof that your song library can be split evenly .
Your job will be reduced to that of proof - checking , a task at which a compulsive tape - saving Scrooge might even shine .
Heads - up : did you notice my nonchalant use of the word “ lying ” ?
When a movie 's opening scene casually trains the camera on a gun , no one might get hurt for a while , but you know that wo n't last .
Alas , wondrous
Alice fell down the rabbit hole eons ago and , these days , a good library splitting friend is hard to find .
And so , sadly , you 'll have little choice but to compile the two lists yourself and engage in that dreaded thing called proof - finding .
That 's a tougher nut to crack .
So much so that even if you were to harness the full power of an IBM Blue Gene / L running the best software available anywhere on earth and beyond , the entire lifetime of the universe would n't be enough !
You might get lucky with the parameters and get it done sooner , but getting lucky ?
Yeah , right ...
To add insult to injury , computer scientists have catalogued thousands of such Jurassic problems — so named for the dinosaur - like quality of their solutions : hard to discover but impossible to miss when they pop up in front of you ; in other words , proofs hopelessly difficult to find but a breeze to verify .
Courtesy of Murphy 's Law , of course , the great Jurassics of the world include all of the hydra - headed monsters we 're so desperate to slay : drug design ; protein folding ; resource allocation ; portfolio optimization ; suitcase packing ; etc .
Furthermore , even shooting for good approximate solutions — when the notion makes sense — can sometimes be just as daunting .
Now a funny thing happened on the way back from the word factory .
Despite its dazzling lyricism , metaphorical felicity , hip - hoppish élan , not to mention a Niagara of adulatory gushing I 'll kindly spare you , my staggeringly brilliant coinage “ Jurassic ” has n't caught on .
Yet .
Skittish computer scientists tend to favor the achingly dull “ NP - complete . ”
Worse , their idea of bustin ' a dope , def funky rhyme is to — get this — write down the thing in full , as in “ complete for nondeterministic polynomial time . ”
To each their own .
Back to the Jurassics .
Always basking in the spotlight , they are famously difficult , impossibly hard to satisfy , and — if their resilience is any guide — quite pleased with the attention .
These traits often run in the family ; sure enough , the Jurassics are blood kin .
The first to put them on the analyst 's couch and pin their intractable behavior on consanguinity were Stephen Cook , Jack Edmonds , Richard Karp , and Leonid Levin .
In the process they redefined computing around the notion of tractability and produced the most influential milestone in post - Turing computer science .
But what is a tractable problem , you ask ?
Answer : one that can be solved in polynomial time .
Oh , swell ; nothing like calling upon the opaque to come to the rescue of the obscure !
Relax : it 's quite simple , really .
If you double the size of the problem — say , your iPod library will now hold 2,000 tunes instead of a mere 1,000 — then the time to find an even split should at most double , or quadruple , or increase by some fixed rate ( ie , independent of the problem size ) .
That 's what it means to be tractable .
Convoluted as this definition may seem , it has two things going for it : one is to match our intuition of what can be solved in practice ( assuming the fixed rate is n't “ fixed ” too high ) ; the other is to leave the particular computer we 're working on out of the picture .
See how there is no mention of computing speeds ; only of growth rates .
It is a statement about software , not hardware .
Tractability is a universal attribute of a problem — or lack thereof .
Note : some scholars prefer the word feasibility .
Obviously , to resist the lure of the opening riff of Wittgenstein 's “ Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus ” takes willpower ; predictably , the feasibility crowd is thin .
“ What do you mean , ‘ intractable ’ ? ”
Library splitting does not appear to be tractable .
( Hold the tears : you 'll need them in a minute . )
Any algorithm humans have ever tried — and many have — requires exponential time .
Read : all of them share the dubious distinction that their running times get squared ( not merely scaled up by a constant factor ) whenever one doubles the size of the problem .
If you do the math , you 'll see it 's the sort of growth that quickly gets out of hand .
Well , do the math .
Say you want to solve a problem that involves 100 numbers and the best method in existence takes one second on your laptop .
How long would it take to solve the same problem with 200 numbers , instead ?
Answer : just a few seconds if it 's tractable ; and C× 2200 = ( C× 2100 ) 2100 = 2100 seconds if it 's not .
That 's more than a billion trillion years !
To paraphrase Senator Dirksen from the great State of Illinois , a trillion years here , a trillion years there , and pretty soon you 're talking real time .
Exponentialitis is not a pretty condition .
Sadly , it afflicts the entire Jurassic menagerie .
The true nature of the ailment eludes us but this much we know : it 's genetic .
If any one of the Jurassics is tractable , wonder of wonders , all of them are .
Better still : a cure for any one of them could easily be used to heal any of the others .
Viewed through the tractability lens , the Jurassics are the same T. rex in different brontosaurus ' clothings .
Heady stuff !
The day Alice can split your song library within a few hours will be the day biologists can fold proteins over breakfast , design new drugs by lunch , and eradicate deadly diseases just in time for dinner .
The attendant medical revolution will likely make you live the long , jolly life of a giant Galápagos tortoise ( life span : 150 years ) .
Alice 's discovery would imply the tractability of all the Jurassics ( P=NP in computer lingo ) .
Should the computing gods smile upon us , the practical consequences could be huge .
Granted , there would be a few losers : mostly online shoppers and mathematicians .
All commercial transactions on the Internet would cease to be secure and e-business would grind to a halt .
( More on this gripping drama in the next section . )
The math world would take a hit , too : P=NP would prove Andrew Wiles , the conqueror of Fermat 's Last Theorem , no more deserving of credit than his referee .
Well , not quite .
Mathematicians like to assign two purposes to a proof : one is to convince them that something is true ; the other is to help them understand why something is true .
Tractability bears no relevance to the latter .
Still , no one wants to see friendly mathematicians swell the ranks of the unemployed as they get replaced by nano iPods , so the consensus has emerged that P is not NP .
There are other reasons , too , but that one is the best because it puts computer scientists in a good light .
The truth is , no one has a clue .
To be P or not to be P , that is NP 's question .
A million - dollar question , in fact .
That 's how much prize money the Clay Mathematics Institute will award Alice if she resolves the tractability of library splitting .
( She will also be shipped to Guantánamo by the CIA , but that 's a different essay . )
Which side of the NP question should we root for ?
We know the stakes : a short existence blessed with online shopping ( P ≠ NP ) ; or the interminable , eBay - less life of a giant tortoise ( P=NP ) .
Tough call .
P=NP ( Or why you wo n't find the proof on eBay )
An algorithm proving P=NP might conceivably do for technology what the discovery of the wheel did for land transportation .
Granted , to discover the wheel is always nice , but to roll logs in the mud has its charms , too .
Likewise , the intractability of proof - finding would have its benefits .
That 1951 vintage Wham - O hula hoop you bought on eBay the other day , er , you did n't think the auction was secure just because online thieves were too hip for hula hoops , did you ?
What kept them at bay was the ( much hoped - for ) intractability of integer factorization .
Say what ?
Prime numbers deterring crooks ?
Indeed .
Take two primes , S and T , each one , say , a thousand - digit long .
The product R= S × T is about 2,000 digits long .
Given S and T , your laptop will churn out R in a flash .
On the other hand , if you knew only R , how hard would it be for you to retrieve S and T ?
Hard .
Very hard .
Very very hard .
Repeat this until you believe it because the same algorithm that would find S and T could be used to steal your credit card off the Internet !
Cryptology will help you
win wars and shop online
Am I implying that computer security is premised on our inability to do some silly arithmetic fast enough ?
I surely am .
If the Jurassics were shown to be tractable , not a single computer security system would be safe .
Which is why for eBay to auction off a proof of P=NP would be suicidal .
Worse : factoring is not even known — or , for that matter , thought — to be one of the Jurassics .
It could well be a cuddly pet dinosaur eager to please its master ( if only its master had the brains to see that ) .
One cannot rule out the existence of a fast factoring algorithm that would have no incidence on the P=NP question .
In fact , such an algorithm exists .
All of the recent hoopla about quantum computing owes to the collective panic caused by Peter Shor 's discovery that factoring is tractable on a quantum iPod .
That building the thing itself is proving quite hopeless has helped to calm the frayed nerves of computer security experts .
And yet there remains the spine - chilling possibility that maybe , just maybe , factoring is doable in practice on a humble laptop .
Paranoid security pros might want to hold on to their prozac a while longer .
Cryptology is a two - faced Janus .
One side studies how to decrypt the secret messages that bad people exchange among one another .
That 's cryptanalysis : think Nazi code , Bletchley Park , victory parade , streamers , confetti , sex , booze , and rock ' n ' roll .
The other branch of the field , cryptography , seeks clever ways of encoding secret messages for good people to send to other good people , so that bad people get denied the streamers , the confetti , and all the rest .
Much of computer security relies on public - key cryptography .
The idea is for , say , eBay to post an encryption algorithm on the web that everybody can use .
When you are ready to purchase that hula hoop , you 'll type in your credit card information into your computer , encrypt it right there , and then send the resulting gobbledygook over the Internet .
Naturally , the folks at eBay will need their own secret decryption algorithm to make sense of the junk they 'll receive from you .
( Whereas poor taste is all you 'll need to make sense of the junk you 'll receive from them . )
The punchline is that no one should be able to decrypt anything unless they have that secret algorithm in their possession .
“ Remember , guys , not a word about
our factoring algorithm , okay ? ”
Easier said than done .
Consider the fiendishly clever algorithm that encodes the first two words of this sentence as dpotjefs uif .
So easy to encrypt : just replace each letter in the text by the next one in the alphabet .
Now assume you knew this encryption scheme .
How in the world would you go about decrypting a message ?
Ah , this is where algorithmic genius kicks in .
( Algorithmistas get paid the big bucks for a reason . )
It 's a bit technical so I 'll write slowly : replace each letter in the ciphertext by the previous one in the alphabet .
Ingenious , no ?
And fast , too !
The only problem with the system is that superior minds can crack it .
So is there a cryptographic scheme that is unbreakable , irrespective of how many geniuses roam the earth ?
It should be child 's play to go one way ( encrypt ) but a gargantuan undertaking to go back ( decrypt ) — unless , that is , one knows the decryption algorithm , in which case it should be a cinch .
RSA , named after Ron Rivest , Adi Shamir , and Len Adleman , is just such a scheme .
It 's an exceedingly clever , elegant public - key cryptosystem that , amazingly , requires only multiplication and long division .
It rules e-commerce and pops up in countless security applications .
Its universal acclaim got its inventors the Turing award ( the “ Nobel prize ” of computer science ) .
More important , it got Rivest a chance to throw the ceremonial first pitch for the first Red Sox - Yankees game of the 2004 season .
Yes , RSA is that big !
There is one catch , though ( pun intended ) : if factoring proves to be tractable then it's bye - bye RSA , hello shopping mall .
The computational art of persuasion
Is n't intractability just a variant of undecidability , the mother 's milk of logicians ?
One notion evokes billions of years , the other eternity — what 's the difference ?
Whether the execution of [ program | data ] ever terminates is undecidable .
In other words , one cannot hope to find out by writing another program and reading the output of [ another program | [ program | data ] ] .
Of side interest , note how the whole document [ program | data ] is now treated as mere data : an artful cadenza from Maestro Turing .
Very nice , but how 's undecidability helping us go through life with a smile on our face ?
It does n't .
In fact , no one ever tried to benefit from an undecidable problem who did n't wind up slouched face down on the Viennese gentleman 's couch .
Not so with intractable problems .
Just as quantum mechanics shattered the platonic view of a reality amenable to noninvasive observation , tractability has clobbered classical notions of identity , randomness , and knowledge .
And that 's a good thing .
Why ?
Let me hereby declare two objects to be “ identical ” if to tell them apart is intractable , regardless of how different they might actually be .
A deck of cards will be “ perfectly ” shuffled if it 's impossible to prove it otherwise in polynomial time .
It is one of the sweet ironies of computing that the existence of an intractable world out there makes our life down here so much easier .
Think of it as the Olympics in reverse : if you can't run the 100 - meter dash under 10 seconds , you win the gold !
Scientists of all stripes are insatiable consumers of random numbers : try taking a poll , conducting clinical trials , or running a lottery without them !
To produce randomness can be quite arduous .
To this day , only two methods have been scientifically validated .
One of them is the infamous “ Kitty Flop . ”
Strap buttered toast to the back of a cat and drop the animal from a PETA - approved height : if the butter hits the ground , record a 1 ; else a 0 .
For more bits , repeat .
Randomness results from the tension between Murphy 's law and the feline penchant for landing on one 's feet .
The other method is the classical “ Coriolis Flush . ”
This time , go to the equator and flush the toilet : if the water whirls clockwise , your random bit is a 1 ; else it 's a 0 .
Now think how much easier it'd be if cheating were allowed .
Not even bad plumbing could stop you ( though many hope it would ) .
Okay , your numbers are not truly random and your cards are not properly shuffled , but if to show they are not is intractable then why should you care ?
Hardness creates easiness .
Of course , computer scientists have simply rediscovered what professional cyclists have known for years : the irresistible lure of intractability ( of drug detection ) .
You 're not thinking , I hope , that this is all perched on the same moral high ground as Don Corleone 's philosophy that crime is not breaking the law but getting caught .
If you are , will you please learn to think positive ?
Our take on intractability is really no different from the 1894 Supreme Court decision in Coffin vs US that introduced to American jurisprudence the maxim “ Innocent until proven guilty . ”
Reality is not what is but what can be proven to be ( with bounded patience ) .
If you think this sort of tractability - induced relativism takes us down the garden path , think again .
It actually cleanses classical notions of serious defects .
Take knowledge , for example : here 's something far more faith - based than we 'd like to admit .
We “ know ” that the speed of light is constant , but who among us has actually bothered to measure it ?
We know because we trust .
Not all of us have that luxury .
Say you 're a fugitive from the law .
( Yes , I know , your favorite metaphor . )
The authorities do n't trust you much and — one can safely assume — the feeling is mutual .
How then can you convince the police of your innocence ?
Reveal too little and they wo n't believe you .
Reveal too much and they 'll catch you .
Intractability holds the key to the answer .
And the Feds hold the key to my prison cell if I say more .
Sorry , nothing to see here , move along .
Fresh , juicy primes !
Years have passed and you 've traded your fugitive 's garb for the funky duds of a math genius who 's discovered how to factor integers in a flash .
Sniffing a business opportunity , you offer to factor anybody 's favorite number for a small fee .
There might be a huge market for that , but it 's less clear there 's nearly enough gullibility around for anyone to take you up on your offer — especially with your mugshot still hanging in the post office .
No one is likely to cough up any cash unless they can see the prime factors .
But then why would you reward such distrust by revealing the factors in the first place ?
Obviously , some confidence - building is in order .
What will do the trick is a dialogue between you and the buyer that persuades her that you know the factors , all the while leaking no information about them whatsoever .
Amazingly , such an unlikely dialogue exists : for this and , in fact , for any of our Jurassics .
Alice can convince you that she can split up your iPod library evenly without dropping the slightest hint about how to do it .
( A technical aside : this requires a slightly stronger intractability assumption than P ≠ NP . )
Say hello to the great zero - knowledge ( ZK ) paradox : a congenital liar can convince a hardened skeptic that she knows something without revealing a thing about it .
ZK dialogues leave no option but for liars to tell the truth and for doubting Thomases to believe .
They render dishonesty irrelevant , for trusting comes naturally to a society where all liars get caught .
What 's intractability got to do with it ?
Everything .
If factoring were known to be tractable , the buyer would need no evidence that you could factor : she could just do it herself and ignore your services — bakers do n't buy bread .
At this point , the reader might have a nagging suspicion of defective logic : if factoring is so hard , then who 's going to be the seller ?
Superman ?
In e-commerce applications , numbers to be factored are formed by multiplying huge primes together .
In this way , the factors are known ahead of time to those privy to this process and live in intractability limboland for all others .
The book of zero - knowledge
It gets better .
Not only can two parties convince each other of their respective knowledge without leaking any of it ; they can also reason about it .
Two businessmen get stuck in an elevator .
Naturally , a single thought runs through their minds : finding out who 's the wealthier .
Thanks to ZK theory , they 'll be able to do so without revealing anything about their own worth ( material worth , that is — the other kind is already in full view ) .
Feel the pain of two nuclear powers , Learsiland and Aidniland .
Not being signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , only they know the exact size of their nuclear arsenals ( at least one hopes they do ) .
Computing theory would allow Learsiland to prove to Aidniland that it outnukes it without leaking any information about its deterrent 's strength .
The case of Nariland is more complex : it only wishes to demonstrate compliance with the NPT ( which it 's signed ) without revealing any information about its nuclear facilities .
While these questions are still open , they are right up ZK 's alley .
Game theorists made quite a name for themselves in the Cold War by explaining why the aptly named MAD strategy of nuclear deterrence was not quite as mad as it sounded .
Expect zero -knowledgists to take up equally daunting “ doomsday ” challenges in the years ahead .
And , when they do , get yourself a large supply of milk and cookies , a copy of Kierkegaard 's “ Fear and Trembling , ” and unrestricted access to a deep cave .
More amazing than ZK still is this thing called PCP ( for “ probabilistically checkable proofs ; not for what you think ) .
For a taste of it , consider the sociological oddity that great unsolved math problems seem to attract crackpots like flypaper .
Say I am one of them .
One day I call the folks over at the Clay Math Institute to inform them that I 've just cracked the Riemann hypothesis ( the biggest baddest beast in the math jungle ) .
And could they please deposit my million - dollar check into my Nigerian account presto ?
Being the gracious sort , Landon and Lavinia Clay indulge me with a comforting “ Sure , ” while adding the perfunctory plea : “ As you know , we 're a little fussy about the format of our math proofs .
So please make sure yours conforms to our standards — instructions available on our web site , blah , blah . ”
To my relief , that proves quite easy — even with that damn caps lock key stuck in the down position — and the new proof is barely longer than the old one .
Over at Clay headquarters , meanwhile , no one has any illusions about me ( fools ! ) but , bless the lawyers , they 're obligated to verify the validity of my proof .
“ Gotta run .
Let 's try PCP ! ”
To do that , they 've figured out an amazing way , the PCP way .
It goes like this : Mr and Mrs Clay will pick four characters from my proof at random and throw the rest in the garbage without even looking at it .
They will then assemble the characters into a four - letter word and read it out loud very slowly — it 's not broadcast on American TV , so it 's okay .
Finally , based on that word alone , they will declare my proof valid or bogus .
The kicker : their conclusion will be correct !
Granted , there 's a tiny chance of error due to the use of random numbers , but by repeating this little game a few times they can make a screwup less likely than having their favorite baboon type all of Hamlet in perfect Mandarin .
At this point , no doubt you 're wondering whether to believe this mumbo - jumbo might require not only applying PCP but also smoking it .
If my proof is correct , I can see how running it through the Clays ' gauntlet of checks and tests would leave it unscathed .
But , based on a lonely four - letter word , how will they know I 've cracked Riemann 's hypothesis and not a baby cousin , like the Riemann hypothesis for function fields , or a baby cousin 's baby cousin like 1+1=2 ?
If my proof is bogus ( perish the thought ) then their task seems equally hopeless .
Presumably , the formatting instructions are meant to smear any bug across the proof so as to corrupt any four letters picked at random .
But how can they be sure that , in order to evade their dragnet , I have n't played fast and loose with their silly formatting rules ?
Crackpots armed with all - caps keyboards will do the darndest thing .
Poor Mr and Mrs Clay !
They must check not only my math but also my abidance by the rules .
So many ways to cheat , so few things to check .
When Abu's light was
shining on Baghdad
PCP is the ultimate lie- busting device .
Why ultimate ?
Because it is instantaneous and foolproof .
The time - honored approach to truth finding is the court trial , where endless questioning between two parties , each one with good reasons to lie , leads to the truth or to a mistrial , but never to an erroneous judgment ( yes , I know ) .
PCP introduces the instant - trial system .
Once the case has been brought before the judge , it is decided on the spot after only a few seconds of cross-examination .
Justice is fully served ; and yet the judge will go back to her chamber utterly clueless as to what the case was about .
PCP is one of the most amazing algorithms of our time .
It steals philosophy 's thunder by turning on its head basic notions of evidence , persuasion , and trust .
Somewhere , somehow , Ludwig the Tractatus Man is smiling .
To say that we 're nowhere near resolving P vs NP is a safe prophecy .
But why ?
There are few mysteries in life that human stupidity cannot account for , but to blame the P=NP conundrum on the unbearable lightness of our addled brains would be a cop-out .
Better to point the finger at the untamed power of the Algorithm — which , despite rumors to the contrary , was not named after Al Gore but after Abū ‘ Abd Allāh Muhammad ibn Mūsā al - Khwārizmī .
As ZK and PCP demonstrate , tractability reaches far beyond the racetrack where computing competes for speed .
It literally forces us to think differently .
The agent of change is the ubiquitous Algorithm .
Let 's look over the horizon where its disruptive force beckons , shall we ?
Thinking algorithmically
Algorithms are often compared to recipes .
As clichés go , a little shopworn perhaps , but remember : no metaphor that appeals to one 's stomach can be truly bad .
Furthermore , the literary analogy is spot-on .
Algorithms are — and should be understood as — works of literature .
The simplest ones are short vignettes that loop through a trivial algebraic calculation to paint fractals , those complex , pointillistic pictures much in vogue in the sci - fi movie industry .
Just a few lines long , these computing zingers will print the transcendental digits of π , sort huge sets of numbers , model dynamical systems , or tell you on which day of the week your 150th birthday will fall ( something whose relevance we 've already covered ) .
Zingers can do everything .
For the rest , we have , one notch up on the sophistication scale , the sonnets , ballads , and novellas of the algorithmic world .
Hiding behind their drab acronyms , of which RSA , FFT , SVD , LLL , AKS , KMP , and SVM form but a small sample , these marvels of ingenuity are the engines driving the algorithmic revolution currently underway .
( And , yes , you may be forgiven for thinking that a computer geek 's idea of culinary heaven is a nice big bowl of alphabet soup . )
At the rarefied end of the literary range , we find the lush , complex , multilayered novels .
The Algorithmistas ' pride and joy , they are the big , glorious tomes on the coffee table that everyone talks about but only the fearless read .
“ ‘ fetch branch push load store jump fetch ... ’
Who writes this crap ? ”
Give it to them , algorithmic zingers know how to make a scientist swoon .
No one who 's ever tried to calculate the digits of π by hand can remain unmoved at the sight of its decimal expansion flooding a computer screen like lava flowing down a volcano .
Less impressive perhaps but just as useful is this deceptively simple data retrieval technique called binary search , or BS for short .
Whenever you look up a friend 's name in the phone book , chances are you 're using a variant of BS — unless you 're the patient type who prefers exhaustive search ( ES ) and finds joy in combing through the directory alphabetically till luck strikes .
Binary search is exponentially ( ie , incomparably ) faster than ES .
If someone told you to open the phone book in the middle and check whether the name is in the first or second half ; then ordered you to repeat the same operation in the relevant half and go on like that until you spotted your friend 's name , you would shoot back : “ That 's BS ! ”
Well , yes and no .
Say your phone book had a million entries and each step took one second : BS would take only twenty seconds but ES would typically run for five days !
Five days ?!
Imagine that .
What if it were an emergency and you had to look up the number for 911 ?
( Yep , there 's no low to which this writer wo n't stoop . )
The key to binary search is to have an ordered list .
To appreciate the relevance of sorting , suppose that you forgot the name of your friend ( okay , acquaintance ) but you had her number .
Since the phone numbers typically appear in quasi - random order , the name could just be anywhere and you'd be stuck with ES .
There would be two ways for you to get around this : to be the famous Thomas Magnum and bribe the Honolulu police chief to get your hands on the reverse directory ; or to use something called a hash table : a key idea of computer science .
Hash table ?
Hmm , I know what you 're thinking : Algorithmistas dig hash tables ; they 're down for PCP ; they crack codes ; they get bent out of shape by morphin ' ; they swear by quicksnort ( or whatever it 's called ) .
Coincidence ?
Computer scientists will say yes , but what else are they supposed to say ?
Algorithms for searching the phone book or spewing out the digits of π are race horses : their sole function is to run fast and obey their masters .
Breeding Triple Crown winners has been high on computer science 's agenda — too high , some will say .
Blame this on the sheer exhilaration of the sport .
Algorithmic racing champs are creatures of dazzling beauty , and a chance to breed them is a rare privilege .
That said , whizzing around the track at lightning speed is not the be-all and end - all of algorithmic life .
Creating magic tricks is just as highly prized : remember RSA , PCP , ZK .
The phenomenal rise of Google 's fortunes owes to a single algorithmic gem , PageRank , leavened by the investing exuberance of legions of believers .
To make sense of the World Wide Web is algorithmic in a qualitative sense .
Speed is a secondary issue .
And so PageRank , itself no slouch on the track , is treasured for its brains , not its legs .
Hold on !
To make sense of the world , we have math .
Who needs algorithms ?
It is beyond dispute that the dizzying success of 20th century science is , to a large degree , the triumph of mathematics .
A page 's worth of math formulas is enough to explain most of the physical phenomena around us : why things fly , fall , float , gravitate , radiate , blow up , etc .
As Albert Einstein said , “ The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible . ”
Granted , Einstein 's assurance that something is comprehensible might not necessarily reassure everyone , but all would agree that the universe speaks in one tongue and one tongue only : mathematics .
“ Do n't google us , we 'll google you . ”
But does it , really ?
This consensus is being challenged today .
As young minds turn to the sciences of the new century with stars in their eyes , they 're finding old math wanting .
Biologists have by now a pretty good idea of what a cell looks like , but they 've had trouble figuring out the magical equations that will explain what it does .
How the brain works is a mystery ( or sometimes , as in the case of our 43rd president , an overstatement ) whose long , dark veil mathematics has failed to lift .
Economists are a refreshingly humble lot — quite a surprise really , considering how little they have to be humble about .
Their unfailing predictions are rooted in the holy verities of higher math .
True to form , they 'll sheepishly admit that this sacred bond comes with the requisite assumption that economic agents , also known as humans , are benighted , robotic dodos — something which unfortunately is not always true , even among economists .
A consensus is emerging that , this time around , throwing more differential equations at the problems wo n't cut it .
Mathematics shines in domains replete with symmetry , regularity , periodicity — things often missing in the life and social sciences .
Contrast a crystal structure ( grist for algebra's mill ) with the World Wide Web ( cannon fodder for algorithms ) .
No math formula will ever model whole biological organisms , economies , ecologies , or large , live networks .
Will the Algorithm come to the rescue ?
This is the next great hope .
The algorithmic lens on science is full of promise — and pitfalls .
First , the promise .
If you squint hard enough , a network of autonomous agents interacting together will begin to look like a giant distributed algorithm in action .
Proteins respond to local stimuli to keep your heart pumping , your lungs breathing , and your eyes glued to this essay — how more algorithmic can anything get ?
The concomitance of local actions and reactions yielding large - scale effects is a characteristic trait of an algorithm .
It would be naive to expect mere formulas like those governing the cycles of the moon to explain the cycles of the cell or of the stock market .
Contrarians will voice the objection that an algorithm is just a math formula in disguise , so what 's the big hoopla about ?
The answer is : yes , so what ?
The issue here is not logical equivalence but expressibility .
Technically , number theory is just a branch of set theory , but no one thinks like that because it 's not helpful .
Similarly , the algorithmic paradigm is not about what but how to think .
The issue of expressiveness is subtle but crucial : it leads to the key notion of abstraction and is worth a few words here ( and a few books elsewhere ) .
Remember the evil Brazilian butterfly ?
Yes , the one that idles the time away by casting typhoons upon China with the flap of a wing .
This is the stuff of legend and tall tales ( also known as chaos theory ) .
Simple , zinger - like algorithms model this sort of phenomenon while neatly capturing one of the tenets of computing : the capacity of a local action to unleash colossal forces on a global scale ; complexity emerging out of triviality .
Al - Khwarizmi takes wing
Create a virtual aviary of simulated geese and endow each bird with a handful of simple rules : ( 1 ) Spot a flock of geese ?
Follow its perceived center ; ( 2 ) Get too close to a goose ?
Step aside ; ( 3 ) Get your view blocked by another goose ?
Move laterally away from it ; etc .
Release a hundred of these critters into the ( virtual ) wild and watch a distributed algorithm come to life , as a flock of graceful geese migrate in perfect formation .
Even trivial rules can produce self - organizing systems with patterns of behavior that look almost “ intelligent . ”
Astonishingly , the simplest of algorithms mediate that sort of magic .
The local rules of trivial zingers carry enough punch to produce complex systems ; in fact , by Church - Turing universality , to produce any complex system .
Obviously , not even algorithmic sonnets , novellas , or Homeric epics can beat that .
So why bother with the distinction ?
Perhaps for the same reason the snobs among us are loath to blur the difference between Jay Leno and Leo Tolstoy .
But is n't “ War and Peace ” just an endless collection of one - liners ?
Not quite .
The subtlety here is called abstraction .
Train your binoculars on a single ( virtual ) goose in flight and you 'll see a bird - brained , rule - driven robot flying over Dullsville airspace .
Zoom out and you 'll be treated to a majestic flock of birds flying in formation .
Abstraction is the ability to choose the zoom factor .
Algorithmic novels allow a plethora of abstraction levels that are entirely alien to zingers .
Take war , for example .
At its most basic , war is a soldier valiantly following combat rules on the battlefield .
At a higher level of abstraction , it is a clash of warfare strategies .
Mindful of Wellington 's dictum that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton ( where they take their pillow fighting seriously ) , one might concentrate instead on the schooling of the officer corps .
Clausewitz devotees who see war as politics by other means will adjust the zoom lens to focus on the political landscape .
Abstraction can be vertical : a young English infantryman within a platoon within a company within a battalion within a regiment within a mass grave on the banks of the Somme .
Or it can be horizontal : heterogeneous units interacting together within an algorithmic “ ecology . ”
Unlike zingers , algorithmic novels are complex systems in and of themselves .
Whereas most of what a zinger does contributes directly to its output , the epics of the algorithmic world devote most of their energies to servicing their constituent parts via swarms of intricate data structures .
Most of these typically serve functions that bear no direct relevance to the algorithm 's overall purpose — just as the mRNA of a computer programmer rarely concerns itself with the faster production of Java code .
The parallel with biological organisms is compelling but far from understood .
To this day , for example , genetics remains the art of writing the captions for a giant cartoon strip .
Molecular snapshots segue from one scene to the next through plots narrated by circuit - like chemical constructs — zingers , really — that embody only the most rudimentary notions of abstraction .
Self - reference is associated mostly with self - replication .
In the algorithmic world , by contrast , it is the engine powering the complex recursive designs that give abstraction its amazing richness : it is , in fact , the very essence of computing .
Should even a fraction of that power be harnessed for modeling purposes in systems biology , neuroscience , economics , or behavioral ecology , there 's no telling what might happen ( admittedly , always a safe thing to say ) .
To borrow the Kuhn cliché , algorithmic thinking could well cause a paradigm shift .
Whether the paradigm shifts , shuffles , sashays , or boogies its way into the sciences , it seems destined to make a lasting imprint .
Had Newton been hit by a flying
goose and not a falling apple ...
Now the pitfalls .
What could disrupt the rosy scenario we so joyfully scripted ?
The future of the Algorithm as a modeling device is not in doubt .
For its revolutionary impact to be felt in full , however , something else needs to happen .
Let 's try a thought experiment , shall we ?
You 're the unreconstructed Algorithm skeptic .
Fresh from splitting your playlist , Alice , naturally , is the advocate .
One day , she comes to you with a twinkle in her eye and a question on her mind : “ What are the benefits of the central law of mechanics ? ”
After a quick trip to Wikipedia to reactivate your high school physics neurons and dust off the cobwebs around them , you reply that F=ma does a decent job of modeling the motion of an apple as it is about to crash on Newton 's head : “ What 's not to like about that ? ”
“ Oh , nothing , ” retorts Alice , “ except that algorithms can be faithful modelers , too ; they 're great for conducting simulations and making predictions . ”
Pouncing for the kill , she adds : “ By the way , to be of any use , your vaunted formulas will first need to be converted into algorithms . ”
Touché .
Ahead on points , Alice 's position will dramatically unravel the minute you remind her that F=ma lives in the world of calculus , which means that the full power of analysis and algebra can be brought to bear .
From F=ma , for example , one finds that : ( i ) the force doubles when the mass does ; ( ii ) courtesy of the law of gravity , the apple 's position is a quadratic function of time ; ( iii ) the invariance of Maxwell 's equations under constant motion kills F=ma and begets the theory of special relativity .
And all of this is done with math alone !
Wish Alice good luck trying to get her beloved algorithms to pull that kind of stunt .
Math gives us the tools for doing physics ; more important , it gives us the tools for doing math .
We get not only the equations but also the tools for modifying , combining , harmonizing , generalizing them ; in short , for reasoning about them .
We get the characters of the drama as well as the whole script !
Is there any hope for a “ calculus ” of algorithms that would enable us to knead them like Play - Doh to form new algorithmic shapes from old ones ?
Algebraic geometry tells us what happens when we throw in a bunch of polynomial equations together .
What theory will tell us what happens when we throw in a bunch of algorithms together ?
As long as they remain isolated , free - floating creatures , hatched on individual whims for the sole purpose of dispatching the next quacking duck flailing in the open - problems covey , algorithms will be parts without a whole ; and the promise of the Algorithm will remain a promise deferred .
While the magic of algorithms has long held computing theorists in its thrall , their potential power has been chronically underestimated ; it 's been the life story of the field , in fact , that they are found to do one day what no one thought them capable of doing the day before .
If proving limitations on algorithms has been so hard , maybe it 's because they can do so much .
Algorithmistas will likely need their own “ Google Earth ” to navigate the treacherous canyons of Turingstan and find their way to the lush oases amid the wilderness .
But mark my words : the algorithmic land will prove as fertile as the one the Pilgrims found in New England and its settlement as revolutionary .
Truth be told , the 1776 of computing is not quite upon us .
If the Algorithm is the New World , we are still building the landing dock at Plymouth Rock .
Until we chart out the vast expanses of the algorithmic frontier , the P vs NP mystery is likely to remain just that .
Only when the Algorithm becomes not just a body but a way of thinking , the young sciences of the new century will cease to be the hapless nails that the hammer of old math keeps hitting with maniacal glee .
One thing is certain .
Moore 's Law has put computing on the map : the Algorithm will now unleash its true potential .
That 's one prediction Lord Kelvin never made , so you may safely trust the future to be kind to it .
hwa-byung（wool-hwa-byungとしても知られている）：韓国の民俗的症候群で、英語には“ anger syndrome ” （憤怒症候群）」と文字どおりに訳されており、怒りの抑制によるとされている。症候としては、不眠、疲労、パニック、切迫した死への恐怖、不快感情、消化不良、食欲不振、呼吸困難、動悸、全身の疼痛、心窩部に塊がある感覚などを呈する。
Ms.Aは42歳の韓国人女性で離婚歴あり。5年前にアメリカに移住。症状が始まったのは1年前で、彼女自身それをファビョンだととらえている。症状は、極度の疲労感、寒さへの過敏、そして腹部に塊があって胸を圧迫し、動悸や呼吸困難、「火が喉元に上がってくる」感じを起こしているという感覚である。これらの症状により、彼女は窒息死するのではないかという恐怖を感じていた。「寒さへの過敏」のせいで、彼女は寒い季節にはできるかぎり厚い服を着込んで家に閉じこもり、暖房の設定を最大温度にしていた。その他の身体症状としては、全身の筋肉と関節の痛み、消化不良、そしてにぶい上腹部痛があった。それに加え、不眠と無力感、怒りの感覚、韓国に子どもを残してきたことへの罪悪感があると彼女は語った。
Mrs.Bは33歳の韓国人女性で、夫とともにアメリカに移住。子どもは2人。移住3ヶ月後に初めて胸部下方に塊があるように感じ、ファビョンではないかと疑った。痰を吐くと異物感は一時的に楽になるため、塊は痰が固まったものではないかと彼女は考え、治療しないでいると、塊は命に関わるのではないかと怖れた。面談により、彼女はアメリカに移住してから非常に強い不安を感じていたことがわかった。さらに、緊張感、めまい、不定愁訴、食欲不振、体重減少、入眠困難、自分自身と家族の将来に対する不安を感じている、と彼女は語った。精密検査では異常なし。
「 ファビョン」について、改めて書いてみたい。「改めて」と書いたのは、1年くらい前にファビョンについては一度書きかけたことがあるからで、そのときはどうにもうまく続けることができず、中途で止めてしまったのである。そもそもそのときは書き方がまずかった。日本のネット界では、「ファビョン」ということばは、韓国人が「議論で反論に窮した場合などに冷静さを失って感情的になる」ようなときに使われる。しかし、それは悪意ある歪曲であり、実際の精神疾患としてのファビョンはそうじゃないのだ、精神科医として本当のファビョンの意味を教えて上げよう、という啓蒙的なスタンスで何気なく書きはじめたのだが、よくよく調べてみれば、ことはそう簡単ではなかった。「ファビョン」は韓国特有の「ハン」（恨）の感情に関わる疾病概念であり、韓国文化と密接につながっていたのである。つまりファビョンを語るにはまず韓国文化を知る必要があるともいえるのである。ファビョンの概念はなかなか奥が深いのだ。というわけでなかなか面倒そうなので1年前には書きかけのままやめてしまったのだが、最近改めて医学文献データベース
PubMed や、その韓国版である KoreaMed などでファビョン関係の論文を集めてみた（摘要だけなら誰でも無料で読める）ので、それを参考に、「ファビョン」とは何かについて書いてみたい。まず、「ファビョン」は漢字で「火病」( hwa-byung ) と書く。また、" wool - hwa - byung " ともいわれるが、これは漢字で書くと「鬱火病」。この場合の「鬱」とは、「憂鬱」などの意味ではなく、「鬱血」とか「鬱積」と同じで、「出口がふさがれてたまる」といった意味である。「火」とは五行説の「木火土金水」の五元素のうちの「火」のことであり、「火」が体内にたまって気のバランスが崩れた状態が「鬱火病」というわけである。韓国では「火」は怒りに結びつくので、怒りを抑え、体の中に溜め込んだ結果さまざまな症状が起きるのが「火病」ということになる。「火病」は、アメリカの精神疾患診断マニュアルであるDSM-IVの巻末付録「文化的定式化の概説と文化に結び付いた症候群の用語集」にも載っていて、こんなふうに書かれている（なお、この用語集には日本の「対人恐怖症」も記載されている）。韓国で書かれた文献によると、患者は社会階層の低い中年女性に多いという。韓国で41歳から65歳までの女性2807人を調査したところ、ファビョンの有病率は4.95%であり、特に社会経済的に低い階層の人、地方在住者、離婚もしくは別居している人、喫煙者、飲酒者で高率だったという。また、韓国系アメリカ人109人の調査では、12%が自分はファビョンにかかったことがあると回答したという。症状としては、胸の中に塊があるように感じると訴える患者が多いが、これは韓国人は文化的に家族の調和と安定を重んじ、社会的なつながりを危険にさらすような怒りは抑え、胸の中に溜め込むべきだとされているため、怒りが塊となって胸や喉を圧迫しているのだ、と信じられている。ファビョンの原因は、夫の浮気、嫁姑問題、子供の非行など家庭内の問題が多く、男尊女卑の強い韓国社会の影響が強いと考えられている。もともと伝統的な韓国の家では、女の子は生まれても家族の一員とは数えられないほどだった。男の子を産まない母親は、母親扱いしてもらえず、家を追い出されることすらあったという。こうした社会において、女性は怒りを言葉や行動で表現することを禁じられ、忍従の日々を送らざるを得ず、その内にこもった怒りが「火病」の身体症状として表現される、というわけである。地方の貧困層に多いのも、そうした階層で封建的な価値観を持つ家庭が多いからだろう。このように、「火」＝怒りと説明してある文献が多いのだが、Khim SYによる「看護における火病の概念」という論文では、「火」に少し違う意味づけをしている。この論文によれば、ファビョンの特徴は、「火」（ファ）、身体化、自己診断（主観性）の3つだという。まず「火」とは不公平の感情を意味し、ファビョンとは、「火」の鬱滞、つまり、屈辱を受けたり不当な扱いを受けたという感覚が蓄積したものがファビョンなのだという。長年のあいだ不当な扱い堪えつづけてきたという状況は、それだけの期間怒りを抑圧し無力感を感じ続けてきたということを意味する。抑圧された怒りは敵意や憎しみ、復讐心につながり、無力感は欲求不満、諦め、宿命論へと結びつく。続いて「身体化」とは、身体的な症状を通して「火」を表現するということ。身体化は、非言語的なやりかたで彼ら自身の中の抑圧された感情を表現する役割を果たしている。つぎに「自己診断」だが、これは読んで字のごとく。ファビョンの患者は、自分の症状の原因を知っていると考え、自分の問題はファビョンからきている、と自己診断するのである。ファビョンは、医者が診断するものではなく、自分でわかるものなのである。ファビョンの患者は自分の病気の原因（それは「不当に扱われた」という主観的な思いである）を充分自覚しており、それを周囲の人々に知ってもらおうとしているのだ。ここで書かれている「火」は、韓国特有とされる「ハン」（恨）の感情そのものだ。韓国の文献では、ファビョンと「ハン」（恨）の感情との関係を指摘している論文が多かった。ある韓国人精神科医が書いた日本語の文献では 「
“ ハ ン ” 現象を意味する『ファビョ ン （ Whabyung ;火病）』」と書かれていたほどである。つまり「ハン」（恨）＝ファビョンという認識である。「恨」（ハン）とは、非常にわかりにくいので私も充分理解できていないのだが、韓国人のメンタリティを示す概念であり、単純な「恨み」とはまったく違うものである。「苦しみ、悲哀、悲劇、剥奪、悲しみ、虚しさ、孤独、後悔、憎悪および復讐等と連関した、個人の感情的、ならびに認知的条件の非常に複雑な現象の総和」であり、「悲しみと喜び、悲嘆と希望、悲しみと幸福といった相反する二つの感情の混合状態のようなもの」だという。「永続的な悲哀 」（" everlasting woe " ）と表現していた文献もあった。度重なる戦争や侵略、政変などにさらされた経験から生れた韓国人特有のメンタリティといわれているもので、多くの韓国の専門家は、「ハン」は単なる個人的な感情ではなく、韓国人に共有された集団的な感情状態であると信じている。こうした見方はファビョンを韓国特有の民族的な病とみなす見方だが、一方で、ファビョンを普遍的な病の分類の中に位置づける見方もある。初めて英語圏にファビョンを紹介したLin KMらの「 Hwa - Byung:韓国の文化結合症候群？」という文献から、韓国系アメリカ人の症例を紹介してみよう。さてこういった症例を読んでみて浮かぶ感想は、「こういう人いるよね」というものだ。実際、日本人でもこういう症状を訴える中年女性は珍しくない。これは要するに現在の国際的分類では「身体表現性障害」、欧米の伝統的な概念でいえば「ヒステリー」にあてはまる病態なのではないだろうか。誤解を受けないように書いておくが、精神医学での「ヒステリー」は、日常語で使われている「ヒステリー」とは意味が違う。精神医学で使われる「ヒステリー」とは、特に身体的な原因がないのに失神、めまい、体の痛み、目が見えない、耳が聞こえないなどのさまざまな身体症状を訴える病気のことだ。症例報告でファビョンの患者が訴えている、のどの閉塞感はヒステリーに特徴的とされる「ヒステリー球」そのものである。このヒステリー、19世紀のヨーロッパでは盛んに議論されていたホットな病気で、フロイトもこの病気の研究を基礎にして精神分析の理論をつくりあげたほどだが、20世紀に入るといつしか精神医学者の関心は失われ、現在の疾病分類では「ヒステリー」という用語すら使われなくなり、「身体表現性障害」や「転換性障害」などのカテゴリーに分かれている。19世紀のヨーロッパで「ヒステリー」が女性に多かったのは（そもそも「ヒステリー」の語源は「子宮」である）、女性に対する抑圧の強い当時の文化の影響と考えられているのだが、ファビョンも同じく封建的で男尊女卑の傾向の強い韓国文化の影響が強いのだろう。もちろん、日本でもいまだに封建的な文化は残っており、怒りや抑うつをそのままのかたちでは表現できずに身体症状として表現する女性患者は少なくない（数は少ないが男性にもいる）。実際にファビョンと自己診断した患者をDSM-IVの分類で診断してみたところ、136人中31人が全般性不安障害、26人が大うつ病、21人が身体化障害、18人が気分変調性障害、15人が恐怖症、14人が強迫性障害、11人がパニック障害と診断されたそうだ。自己診断だから必ずしもひとつの病態には当てはまらず、憂うつと身体症状を特徴とする幅広い概念ということなのだろう。ファビョンは韓国文化と深く結びついた韓国特有の病であるという見方と、そうではなく普遍的な診断基準の中に位置づけられるという見方。どちらが間違っているというわけではなく、どちらもファビョンという病のひとつの側面をとらえていると考えるべきだろう。しかし、私としてはどちらかといえば後者の方が妥当なように思える。日本の精神医学者もかつて、「対人恐怖症」を、集団の調和を重んじる日本文化特有の病として欧米に発信したことがあったものだが（そのためDSM-IVのリストに載ったのである）、今では欧米にも似たような症状の患者がいることがわかり、「社会恐怖」とか「社会不安障害」といった診断名が日本にも逆輸入されるようになっている（製薬会社主導で。
社会不安障害の情報サイト は抗うつ 薬SSRI を販売している製薬会社が作っている）。別に日本特有の病じゃなかったのだ。ファビョンの症状も、それと同じように、別に韓民族特有の「ハン」などを持ち出さなくても、普遍的な概念だけで説明できるように思えるのである。さて、ファビョンは、前述のLin KMらの論文が1983 年 に" American Journal of Psychiatry " という権威ある雑誌に掲載されたことで英語圏でも知られることになり、1996年にはDSM-IV（精神疾患の診断・統計マニュアル）の巻末付録「文化と結びついた症候群」分類に記載されている。いろいろと調べてみたが、日本ではファビョンについて書かれた精神医学論文は（私の探した範囲では）ひとつも見つからなかった。在日韓国人の多い日本では患者も少なくないはずなのに、論文が書かれていないのは不思議に思えるが、おそらくこうした症状の患者は日本人でもありふれていて、韓国特有の病気とは考えられてこなかったからではないだろうか。最後に、日本のネット界で、ファビョンが本来の意味とは関係なく、興奮して癇癪を起こすことを意味するようになってしまっていることだが、ある意味これは起こるべくして起こった誤解であるようにも思える。なにせ、先に書いたようにファビョンの原型ともいえる「ヒステリー」からして、日常語では医学用語としての意味から離れ、興奮して感情的になるという意味になっているのだから。「ファビョン」は、「ヒステリー」という言葉の運命とまったく同じ過程をたどっているのである。将来的には、日本の「ファビョン」が逆輸入されるなどして韓国でも意味合いが混乱しはじめ、ヒステリー概念が精神医学から消えたように、いずれはファビョンの概念も解体されていくのかもしれない。それよりも先に製薬会社がファビョンをもっと薬を売りやすい病名へと解体してしまうかもしれないが。（『DSM-IV-TR 精神疾患の診断・統計マニュアル』（医学書院 2002）付録）・Lin KM , .

ファビョンを扱った健康番組の動画 が見られる。韓国語はわからないので推測だが、ここではストレスによって起きる女性の身体不定愁訴全般を「ファビョン」と呼んでいるようである。なお、この動画では「火病」の発音は「ファッピョン」と聞こえる。

Be worried .
If you have given even a moment 's thought to climate warming and its potential impact on our planet , be very worried .
China , a nation of 1.3 billion people , has abandoned the bicycle as a principal mode of transportation and is now moving at a frightening pace to a car - based economy .
Perhaps it 's the years of Western chest - beating about the grandeur of capitalism and consumerism .
Or perhaps it 's the simple human desire to have and consume more , to be more comfortable .
Whatever it is , the Chinese are going the American way .
Recently I was in Korla , a fast - growing city in Xinjiang province in western China where I was at the tail end of my mission , to scout the Chinese portion of the famed Silk Route for a bicycle tour that my company is planning for the summer of 2007 .
The route will take about 45 cyclists from Istanbul to Beijing in 108 days , covering 10,000 km .
Part of our mandate is to promote bicycles as sustainable transportation in a world that seems to be hurtling toward major ecological disaster .
Korla is one of 661 cities in China .
What distinguishes it from all others is that it is the home base for several oil companies , including the U.S. conglomerate Exxon .
The companies are tapping into the oil reserves of the vast Taklaman desert .
Korla is an impressive city .
Striking new highrises line wide boulevards filled with Western style boutiques .
The city is clean and , unlike most of the other cities I have seen on this trip , one can still breathe here without tasting the pollution .
Here the sun still reaches the street .
Of course , Korla is still relatively small ( population : 350,000 ) and new , and is the beneficiary of cleansing desert winds .
Other Chinese cities were once like this , too .
Now , the smog is so thick in most of them that the sun is only a rumour .
But while I can breathe here comfortably , I have reached the dispiriting conclusion that promoting sustainable transportation in China , as in the West , is a quixotic activity .
A friend who works for the World Health Organization recently pointed out that , when Chinese officials are drawn into discussions about bicycles as a means of transportation , they respond by asking how many people use bicycles in Los Angeles , New York or Toronto .
Automobiles are rapidly replacing the bikes that are disappearing from the streets of Chinese cities at a phenomenal rates ..
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers , car sales in China in the first half of 2006 climbed almost 50 per cent , year - on - year , to 1.8 million .
The gains come on the heels of 21.4 per cent growth in car sales for 2005 , with sales of luxury cars doing particularly well .
Before the 1980s China did not allow private citizens to purchase vehicles for private use and there were few automobiles on the roads .
By 2005 , there were 20 million cars in use .
By 2020 , it is estimated , there will be 140 million .
It is not only new roads that these automobiles require .
With China 's new wealth come bigger houses , each requiring more energy , not only to build , but to heat in the winter and cool in the summer , producing additional climate warming gases .
Last Nov. 22 , the China Daily reported that in the first half of 2006 , emissions of sulphur dioxide increased by 4.2 per cent , chemical oxygen demand , a major index of water pollution , grew by 3.7 per cent , compared to the same period in 2005 .
So although a 10,000 - km bicycle trip may be a worthwhile activity for promoting health , fitness or adventure , it is hardly going to make a dent in changing people 's minds about using bicycles instead of cars .
Perhaps the only hope would be for Western trendsetters – young actors , business leaders , politicians – to adopt a non-car lifestyle , since Western trends seem to influence the behaviour of much of the world .
Of course , that is not going to happen .
Even if by some miracle it does , there is no guarantee that a world that has watched the West stuff its collective face with energy - consuming habits will join in its new - found environmental sensitivity .
So be worried .
It 's really the only option .
And if 1.3 billion car users do not scare you , remember that Indians , who number a mere 1.2 billion , are close behind .
Our Western ethos and lifestyle has triumphed , all right .
Oh , here is one more piece of good news :
At the recent annual Detroit auto salon , China 's Changfeng auto group announced that within two years it will be selling sports utility vehicles and pick - up trucks at least 20 per cent below any competitor .
Is n't that wonderful ?

The Codex is written in ancient Greek A manuscript containing the oldest known Biblical New Testament in the world is set to enter the digital age and become accessible online .
A team of experts from the UK , Europe , Egypt and Russia is currently digitising the parchment known as the Codex Sinaiticus , believed originally to have been one of 50 copies of the scriptures commissioned by Roman Emperor Constantine after he converted to Christianity .
The Bible , which is currently in the British Library in London , dates from the 4th Century .
" It is a very distinctive manuscript .
No other manuscript looks like this , " Scot McKendrick , the head of the Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts Department in the British Library , told BBC World Service 's Reporting Religion programme .
" On each very large page , about 14 - 16 inches ( 34 - 37 cm ) it has a Greek text written in four columns .
" That 's the really distinct feature of it - layers of text - it's one of the fascinating aspects of it and it shows us how the Biblical text developed over a certain period , how it was interpreted in those crucial early years of Christianity . "
The digitising project is particularly significant because of the rarity and importance of the manuscript .
The original document is so precious that it has only been seen by four scholars in the last 20 years .
Constantin von Tischendorf was shown the Codex by a monk The Codex Sinaiticus contains the whole of the Christian Bible ; specifically , it has the oldest complete copy of the New Testament , as well as the Greek Old Testament , known as the Septuagint , which includes books now regarded as apocrypha .
It is named after the place it was written , the monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai , Egypt , set beneath the mountain where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments .
It remained there until the middle of the 19th Century when a visiting German scholar , Constantin von Tischendorf , took parts of it away to Germany and Russia .
To this day , the monastery officially regards it as .
In total the codex is now in four portions , the largest of which - 347 of the 400 pages - is that at the British Library .
The rest are split between Leipzig University Library , the National Library of Russia in St Petersburg , and the monastery .
Free website
All four institutions are co-operating to digitise the entire text , as well as using hyperspectral imaging to photograph it , in order to find any hidden or erased text .
" To do it also in infra-red or ultra-violet photography , as in forensics , you 'll find out any hidden aspects of it as well , " explained the British Library 's digitisation expert Lawrence Pordez .
The British Library bought the codex from Russia for £ 100,000 in 1933
He added that a further advantage of using photographs of the manuscript to make a facsimile of it was that there were " no chemicals involved " .
" It 's also faster to produce , " he added .
For his part , Dr McKendrick said he estimated it would be about four years before the codex is fully available online .
This is to give time " to essentially photograph the manuscript , to conserve it , to transcribe anew the whole of the text , and to present that in a new form electronically " .
The British Library will also develop a free website to present the manuscript .
The website will both " present the manuscript - just the facts as it were , the images and the transcription - but also interpret it for different audiences , from scholars right through to people who are just interested in this manuscript or in Christianity " .

Intel January 2007 Sneak Peeks
Yesterday , we had the opportunity to wine and dine with the folks at Intel .
Of course , these sessions are always great for juicy tidbits , so let 's check out the latest updates at Intel .
Core 2 Quad Q6600
On January 21st , Intel will launch their first mainstream quad - core processor - the Core 2 Quad Q6600 .
Like the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 , it is made up of two Conroe dies sitting on a single package .
As such , its 8 MB Level 2 cache is not completely shareable between all four cores .
Rather , it 's split into two separate 4MB caches , each of which is shareable between their respective core pairs .
According to Intel , we will not see a true quad - core ( four cores on a die ) processor until the second half of this year .
Codenamed Yorkfield , it will debut in the new 45 nm process and come with a fully - shared 8 MB L2 cache .
The new Q6600 processor will run at 2.4 GHz with a 1066 MHz FSB .
Other than the slower clock speed and locking of the multipliers , the new Core 2 Quad Q6600 is virtually similar to the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 .
Its official price will only be announced on January 21st but we expect it to be significantly lower than $ 999 , which was what the QX6700 debuted at .
Incidentally , Intel will release even cheaper versions of these quad - core processors in the second half of 2007 .
These are likely to be lower - speed versions of the Core 2 Quad Q6600 , although the use of 2MB Conroe dies to create Core 2 Quad processors with just 4MB of L2 cache cannot be ruled out just yet .
Santa Rosa
Although we expected Intel to launch Santa Rosa by Q2 of this year , it appears that the new Centrino Pro platform will only be launched in the second half of this year .
The launch date has been tentatively said to be around the middle of the second half , putting it around September or October 2007 .
As of this moment , Intel has yet to decide the components that are necessary to qualify for the Centrino brand , but here are some juicy facts about the upcoming platform upgrade .
The Santa Rosa platform will support NAND flash for faster boot - ups and recovery from hibernations .
This is similar to the NAND flash technology used in new hybrid hard drives like the Seagate Momentus 5400 PSD .
Not only does the flash memory allow faster boot - ups and recovery from hibernations , it also allows the hard drive to spin down more often , saving power and reducing wear and tear .
The NAND flash memory will be made available in the form of PCI Express x1 cards with capacities of 512MB or 1GB .
The size of flash memory included in each notebook will be up to the ODM although it should be possible to upgrade it yourself .
As you probably know by now , the Centrino Pro will feature an Intel PRO / Wireless 802.11n
WiFi adaptor allowing for very high data rates ( up to 540 Mbits / s ) but is backward - compatible with 802.
11a/b/g.
Intel says that they are also considering adding 3G support but whether it truly becomes part of the platform remains to be seen .
The other features of the Santa Rosa are well - known by now .
It will have an 800MHz FSB with a mobile i965 Express chipset .
It will also feature improved graphics performance thanks to the integrated GMA X3000 graphics circuitry .
Questions & Comments
Please feel free to post your questions or comments here !
A new study from marketing research company Ipsos Insight indicates that while file sharing may be down , it still constitutes a significant percentage of the music found on today 's portable digital music players .
Yet music downloads from legal services have eclipsed those stemming from P2P and other unauthorized sources .
In fact , the study indicated that more than 70 percent of such music stems from legal sources , and that music download services are on the rise .
The numbers show how far the industry has come from the days when CEOs would argue that " the most common format of music on an iPod is ' stolen ' . "
If that view was dubious before , it 's now outright ridiculous .
According to the study of more than 1,100 people , existing CD collections still provide the lion 's share of music on portable players , accounting for 44 percent of such content .
Download - to - own sales accounted for 25 percent of music on portable devices , while unauthorized file sharing accounted for 19 percent .
While the music industry may be pleased , the study also indicated that 6 percent of music stemmed from users " ripping " CDs owned by others something the industry considers akin to raw piracy .
With an average of 700 songs per player according to the study , approximately 175 songs per player have not been properly licensed or purchased in the eyes of the recording industry .
( Of course , that number would be significantly higher if the RIAA 's views on ripping legally acquired CDs were ever enforced . )
Portable music players are quite popular , too .
The study indicates that one in five people over the age of 12 have a portable music player , and one in twenty actually have more than one .
The study suggests that the percentage of portable player ownership is increasing at a rate of roughly five percent a year , as 2003 and 2004 saw 11 and 15 percent penetration , respectively .
The strong sales are good news for the music industry , which has seen aggressive growth in digital sales in recent years .
Sales tripled in 2005 according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , climbing up to represent 6 percent of global music receipts that year .
And while younger people generally dominate the uptake of new electronics , persons aged 35 to 54 are getting in on the action as well , with one in ten sporting a portable music player last year .
Radio star need not fear video ?
There are signs that the music video revolution wo n't be portable , however .
Approximately one in three people aged 12 to 24 said that they are interested in portable video , including music videos , TV shows , and movies .
By way of comparison , almost 1 in 2 were interested in FM radio capabilities being integrated into players , while nearly 2 in 5 expressed interested in satellite music support .
For persons ages 24 to 54 , interest in video content was only 1 in 6 .
Nevertheless , Matt Kleinschmit , a Vice President with Ipsos Insight and author of the study , interpreted the findings as being bullish for video sales .
" These recent findings showing the desire for broader multimedia content on a portable device could suggest we are reaching a turning point in which consumers are truly recognizing the value of anytime , anywhere multimedia content on - the - go , " Kleinschmit said in a statement .
" While this phenomenon may have initially centered on music , younger MP3 player owners are clearly interested in a wide variety of broader content options for their devices . "
The study ( PR ) was based off of responses from 1,112 Americans aged 12 and over .
It carries a 95 percent certainty that the results are accurate to within +/- 2.94 percent .

A painted live elephant forms part of Banksy 's exhibition
In typical Banksy fashion , it was not until two hours before the media preview , that I was given the address of the venue for his exhibition .
It turned out to be a dingy , swelteringly hot warehouse in an industrial part of downtown Los Angeles .
The three - day free show titled Barely Legal - and billed as a " vandalised warehouse extravaganza " - has an overall theme of global poverty and injustice .
After much hype and secretive planning , the event opens to the public on Friday following an invitation - only , celebrity launch party .
The organisers have said Cameron Diaz , Colin Farrell and Orlando Bloom are all expected to attend .
They will be treated to a familiar , but in some respects , head - scratching display of graffiti- inspired artwork .
I 'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles is
Jason Bentley
US radio commentator
In pictures : Banksy in LA
A 37 - year old Indian elephant has been painted , from head to tail , in a floral pattern reminiscent of an old fashioned living room or a British pub .
The animal is made to stand in a makeshift living room , complete with sofa , chandelier and decorated with wallpaper in the same pattern .
Banksy , as ever , was not on hand to discuss his creation , but it is understood that the elephant , blending into the background , is meant to represent the big issues in life , such as poverty , that some people choose to ignore .
" I do n't feel particularly incensed at the fact that he painted a live animal , " said journalist Sorina Diaconescu .
" But I think he 's treading a pretty thin line and it 's part of his charm . "
The meaning of the stunt appeared to be lost on some observers .
" I 've still got to get my head around that one , " said Jason Bentley , a commentator on US public radio .
Banksy targeted Disneyland earlier this week
" I 'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles is . "
" I 'm not sure that Banksy 's work carries a particular message , " added Ms Diaconescu .
" The medium is the message and in this case just the very fact that there is an elephant in the room , the proverbial elephant in the room , is what he 's trying to say , period . "
There is nothing cryptic about the exhibit that features giant cockroaches clambering over photos of a scantily clad Paris Hilton along with copies of her CD .
The display features a graffiti style message , " Thou Shalt Not Worship False Icons . "
Earlier this month Banksy smuggled 500 " alternative " versions of the heiress 's album into record shops in the UK .
Further stunts
" I just love his approach and his style and his wit , " said Mr Bentley .
" It 's really very simple and profound at the same time , that 's what is clever about it .
In a very public arena you can take away something really significant . "
The exhibition also features film footage of Banksy 's latest stunt , when he placed a life - size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee in a theme park ride at Disneyland .
The operation was caught on camera , covertly , and has been edited into a short film .
As for more stunts in Los Angeles , during the exhibition weekend , Banksy 's people are coy .
" Keep your eyes peeled . "

Introduction
This document does not advocate or condone the extinction or betrayal of ewoks , it merely reports upon a physical situation and the acts involved .
The circumstances at the end of Return of the Jedi lead inevitably to an environmental disaster on the Endor moon .
The explosion of a small artificial moon in low orbit sends a meteoric rain onto the ewok sanctuary , on a scale unmatched since Endor formed .
Through either direct atmospheric injection of small particles , or showers of ejecta from large impacts , the atmosphere will be filled with smoke and fallout causing a gargantuan nuclear - winter effect .
Unless the rebel commandoes on Endor were executing a suicide mission , the rebel fleet was evidently able to intervene to protect their immediate vicinity : probably an area comparable to Luxembourg .
Debris fragments amounting to the mass of the rebel fleet might conceivably have been diverted from that particular locality ( by the exertion of the fleet 's tractor beams ) and onto adjacent areas of the Endorian globe .
However this is only a tiny fraction of the total mass incident on the moon during an event lasting mere minutes .
The mass of the entire debris cloud and fireball is incomparably ( inexorably ) greater than the combined mass of both fleets over Endor .
A general climatological catastrophe was unavoidable .
Averting the disaster would have required physical action on a scale greater than the construction of a Death Star , within minutes of the battle station 's explosion .
Immediately following ROTJ the Endor moon has become unliveable , meaning that the ewoks are extinct except for those :
who were already offworld , having taken passage with traders or Imperial sapientologists ;
who were subjects in off - world medical or biological research [ X - Wing novels ] ;
novels ] ; who were evacuated by the rebels and resettled elsewhere ;
who hibernated for a decade or so ( assuming that they can survive anoxia and poisoning by nitrogen oxides ) .
This page is not concerned with environmental amelioration .
The New Republic , former - Imperial warlords , the Svivreni or galactic conservationists could make attempts to terraform and repair the moon , but these are long - term measures and cannot stop the immediate damage that occurs within minutes and hours of the explosion .
The scope of galactic technology is not great enough to magically restore ecosystems buried beneath dozens of metres of metallic dust or debris , nor resurrect life forms smothered by a chemically - altered atmosphere .
Artificial structures , like the urban terrain of Coruscant after Dark Empire , can be replaced or restored globally in a year - long rebuilding project that is comparable to the construction of a Death Star .
However trees and living systems are no so quick to restore .
At the very least , if all the Endorian species were preserved off - world , the replanted forests would take decades to grow .
In any case , amelioration and restoration projects , and the motives of whoever implements them , are in the realm of speculation .
The biotic catastrophe itself is a well founded and direct consequence of the observable events of the STAR WARS canon .
That is the basis of the discussion below .

Artificial Disaster
The Death Star II was designed as bait for the Rebel Alliance , but it was never supposed to be destroyed .
The station was meant to be protected by an impenetrable deflector shield .
Primitive bipeds on that paradise world were recruited and exploited by daring rebel commandos .
They managed to overwhelm the security forces defending the shield 's power generator .
Ironically , the ewoks were actually the beneficiaries of the deflector shield , and their aggression indirectly and unwittingly brought about their world 's doom .
Destruction of both the deflector shield and the battle station caused some serious collateral damage .
1
Radiation
The technical principles underlying power systems in STAR WARS technology are not fully clear to us .
" hypermatter " annihilation is the main and ultimate power source for large warships and battle stations [ SW : ICS p.10 , AOTC : ICS p.5 ] , however nuclear fusion and antimatter annihilation play a subsidiary or secondary role .
For all we know , they may also employ more exotic and potent technologies : perhaps tapping into deeper subatomic realms , portable miniature black holes or other phenomena unfamiliar to Earthly engineers .
We know that hypermatter involves supralight particles [ AOTC : ICS p.5 ] , and we can infer that its annihilation produces radiant decay products like antimatter annihilation or nuclear reactions do .
The mass / energy conversion of hypermatter must be as complete and as practically effective as antimatter annihilation , otherwise the latter would have been used instead .
The destructive magnitude of the superlaser implies power systems of vast power and admirable efficiency .
The main reactor core of the Death Star II was a machine of immense scale operating on what probably were post - nuclear technological schemes .
As a general tendency of human works , the deeper the technology , the worse may be the by - products of its uncontrolled failure : disasters of pre-nuclear technology produce poisons or fires ; nuclear explosions leave abundant radioactivity ; the detonation of a Death Star could be at least as dirty .
But we do n't know for certain .
Even if exploding hypermatter power sources are completely clean , the subsidiary antimatter and fusion devices in the Death Star II must have created an enormous burst of gamma-rays and high - energy particles .
[ Meltdowns are mentioned in ROTJ novel , chapter 9 . ]
The magnitude of this flash is difficult to assess without intimate knowledge of the superphysical mechanisms of the runaway reaction and the evolving gamma-ray opacity of the debris cloud , but at least the outermost layers of the explosion must have emitted high - energy by - products .
The visible parts of the surface of the nearby moon , which was as near as two thousand kilometres at the closest point , amount to 5/36 of the total area and must have been bathed in radiation .
Living organisms on the irradiated side of the moon would be disposed to radiation sicknesses , if not sterilised or killed outright .
Lingering radioactivity from affected areas of the moon 's surface and radioactive debris fallen from the battle station would be a perpetual hazzard .
Although the specifics are hard to estimate , the initial radiation flash and the long - term contamination may actually be more deadly than the climatological damage described below .
Orbital considerations
The Death Star II was in a very low orbit .
According to geometric studies , the construction site was at an altitude which put its orbit within a double - radius of the moon 's centre .
A likely estimate for the moon 's radius is 5200 km , based on the surface gravity and realistic ranges of planetary composition .
Assuming this scale , the orbital geometry is such that the battle station is only another 2000 km above the surface .
The Death Star II remained stationary above the surface facility which generated its protective shield .
In order to remain synchronous with the surface , the station 's orbital period needed to exactly match the duration of the Endorian day2 .
However for all plausible ranges of the moon 's composition , the orbital period will be very short for any object in a free orbit at this level .
It should circle the globe in only a few hours .
There is good reason to believe that the moon does not have such a short rotation period .
If the day was so short then the shadows would be move visibly during scenes , and the globe would be rotationally distorted .
In other words the moon would have a noticeably oblate aspect , with the diameter through the poles being visibly narrower than the diameter through the equator .
The observed profile of the moon is a nearly perfect sphere .
Therefore an object moving at the altitude of the Death Star II and which also has a period slow enough to be synchronised with the moon 's rotation cannot be in a free natural orbit .
In other words , the battle station was moving around the moon too slowly and with insufficient energy to stay up by itself .
It needs supplementary support against gravity or else it will literally fall from the sky .
The Death Star II therefore possessed an artificial support mechanism .
This mechanism could not have been the simple kinetic action of the station 's sublight thrusters , since they would lead to either an increased orbital distance or increased rate of orbital revolution .
Even in the last few minutes of the station 's existence , it would have visibly moved away from its position above the location of the rebel strike team .
As seen by the rebels , it would have moved close to or over the horizon .
( Moving to the horizon would involve only about a tenth of a free orbit .
A free orbit at that altitude is only a couple of hours long ; hence only about a dozen minutes are needed to reach the horizon . )
The support was most likely provided by a large - scale repulsor field projected along with the security shield , generated at the surface facility .
Alternatively , repulsors may have been mounted within the shell of the station itself .
This seems most likely , since the station did not immediately fall out of the sky after the ground facility was obliterated .
In any case , the repulsors were destroyed either when the shield facility was demolished or when the station itself exploded .
The artificial orbital equilibrium was broken and the remains of the Death Star II would drop into moon 's atmosphere within only a few minutes , even if it were not already exploding in all directions ( including the direction towards the moon ) .
Death Star II hangs serenely in low orbit above the sanctuary moon .
The surface facility generating the security deflector shield might also have been responsible for a repulsor field which supported the station vertically .
Debris influx
What happens next depends on the explosion 's energy and the distribution of the sizes of the debris particles .
There are two extreme cases according to the explosive energy of the battle station 's destruction ; these tell us that the total amount of material reaching the moon is somewhere between a sixth the station 's mass and all of the station 's mass .
Soft explosion :
If the energy of the explosion is relatively low , the debris velocities will be negligible compared to the speeds needed for free orbit ( a few km / s ) .
Most of the debris falls towards the moon , like the unsupported battle station would .
Even the matter ejected away from the moon will ultimately arc back and fall to ground .
The free - fall time for fragments to reach the surface would be a matter of minutes .

Even the matter ejected away from the moon will ultimately arc back and fall to ground .
The free - fall time for fragments to reach the surface would be a matter of minutes .
Hard explosion :
The remains of the Death Star II are blasted in all directions with enough force that the orbital equilibrium and tug of Endorian gravity do n't matter .
Fragments follow approximately straight ballistic trajectories .
The fraction directed into the Endorian surface is no less than 15.4 % ( the fraction of the sky subtended by the moon as seen from DS2 ) .
The rest will fly out into deep space .
The battle station is visible from 13.9 % of the moon 's surface ; this is the area exposed to direct , high - velocity impacts .
Careful timing measurements indicate that the outer surface of the fireball expands at about 80 km / s .
Matter hidden below the surface expands at the same or slightly lower velocity .
The mysterious flaming ring emerging from the equator was much faster , but until more is known about its composition we cannot assess its environmental impact .
It could be intangible .
At least thirty multi-kilometre solid chunks emerged from and overtook the roiling debris cloud .
Their velocities are greater than the 80 km / s of the cloud 's general expansion .
( In fact there were enough large pieces of debris that Shug Ninx was able to purchase a mile - long piece of salvaged air - shaft , as shown in Dark Empire and Dark Empire Sourcebook . )
Escape velocity at the Death Star 's altitude is on the order of 7 km / s ( assuming a realistic estimate for the moon 's mass and composition ) .
Since all major visible components of the explosion were moving dozens of times faster , the explosion was of the hard type .
It has been asked whether the total mass of the battle station 's remains was great enough so that the fireball could fall back inwards upon itself due to self - gravity , perhaps to be swallowed by whatever exotic residue the reactor core may have left .
Unfortunately , if this were the case , the outward motion of the margins of the fireball would have slowed visibly during the time shown in the movie .
Empirically , it did not .
Furthermore , Princess Leia did not encounter any self - collapsed remnant when she visited the place where the station would have been five years later , in Dark Force Rising .
In any case , the mass needed for self - collapse would have been much greater than that of the Endor moon itself , and the station 's everyday tidal effect would have warped the moon 's shape noticeably .
Having established that millions of cubic miles of porous metal3 will inevitably strike the atmosphere , it is important to consider the state of the debris :

Molten or evaporated material will recondense as fallout dust and settle in the upper atmosphere .
Pieces of space junk less than a few metres wide will burn up in the atmosphere like meteors ; ash of these meteors also becomes suspended as airborne dust .
Molten or evaporated material will recondense as fallout dust and settle in the upper atmosphere .
Pieces of space junk less than a few metres wide will burn up in the atmosphere like meteors ; ash of these meteors also becomes suspended as airborne dust .
Coarse :
Objects larger than a few meters will impact upon the surface .
Pieces which are the size of starships will land with explosions comparable to thermonuclear detonations .
Pieces which are several kilometres wide will flatten vast tracts of forest , cause tremendous groundquakes , create craters up to hundreds of kilometres wide etc .
Big impacts will inject vast amounts of dust and soot into the atmosphere .
When there are significant impact events , the total amount of atmospheric dust will be greater than merely the mass of all the impactors .
Large impacts yield more dust as ejecta ( pulverised rock from the crater ) than from the body of the projectile itself .
Impacts will also kindle forest fires of global scale , sending further soot into the air .
( Endor 's isolated , unconnected seas cannot interrupt such fires ; the burning will be much more extensive than during similar calamities on Earth . )
Observations of the morphology and kinematics of the explosion suggest that a combination of fine and coarse effects were experienced .
The larger pieces are representated by at least fourteen fragments each a few tens of kilometres wide , seen hurtling down towards the moon 's atmosphere .
An explosive ring of plasma , erupting from the battle station 's equator , will strike the moon within seconds , though it is unknown how much actual substance this phenomenon contains .
The rest of the debris lacks discernable structure and seems to be fine .
The apparent tranquility of the site around the demolished shield generator , where the rebel commandoes celebrated their victory , has implications for the size distribution of the debris particles .
The debris chunks which would have directly collided with the ground team must have been deflected to other areas of the moon 's surface by the screening rebel fleet .
However an impact over a certain size will cause a rain of ejecta and seismic concussion which would have harmed the commandoes even if they were dozens , hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away .
This suggests that apart from the fourteen or so visibly large fragments , most of the impacting debris comprised bodies no larger than a dozens or a few hundred metres across , whose impacts would have no more effect on the rest of the globe than thermonuclear detonations .
Much of the mass of the battle station probably fell as centimetre - sized or smaller grains , burning in the air and directly entering the atmosphere as dust without striking ground .
The nett result in all scenarios is that a huge volume of dust is left high in the upper atmosphere .
The total amount is equivalent to the mass of a porous lump of metal several hundred miles wide , plus whatever enhancement is derived from impact ejecta .
If the remains of the Death Star II were evenly laid upon the moon with the same density as in the original substance of the station itself ( with no extra compaction ) then the entire globe would be buried in a wreckage layer over half a kilometre deep .
Of course , significant compaction is likely ; the final depth of solid material is likely to be only a few dozen metres on average .
The sanctuary moon of Endor is likely to resemble a heaven for junk scavengers .
Even if it were not for dust - induced climate shifts , the chemistry of the air and surface of the moon must be severely changed by the arrival of this immense mass of foreign material .
The debris is likely to include noxious chemicals similar to those which sterilised most of Honoghr .
The far side of the moon would not receive many direct hits .
A minor fraction of the debris might be moving slowly enough to follow trajectory / orbits leading to collisions with the moon 's opposite face .
Some big impacts on the forward face of the moon may produce secondary debris that would fly into low orbits and then land on the far side , but on the whole the far side should fare better than the side that is directly under the explosion .
However the most serious effects such as global firestorms , chemical contamination and the " nuclear winter effect " will be carried around the world by regular atmospheric circulation .
A scaled illustration of the spatial and size relationship between the sanctuary moon and the battle station .
At this range it was inevitable that much of the moon would be struck directly by the station 's remains .
Biocidal consequences
The most important consequence following the debris shower is what has been called " nuclear winter effect " .
This kind of cataclysm is believed to have befallen Earth on several occasions , each time due to the natural impact of an asteroid or comet .
One such episode was the mass - extinction 65 million years ago ( which eliminated a majority of extant species , including dinosaurs ) .
Atmospheric dust blocks sunlight from reaching the surface , casting a pall of twilight and causing temperatures to plummet .
Vegetation dies due to lack of light ; and this causes starvation of herbivores .
Carnivores persist for a while by feeding on carcasses , but they too must perish .
Only tiny , hardy , primitive animals of rodent size or less may survive through the cold dark years .
After several years , the fallout gradually settles , leaving behind a devastated biosphere in which a majority of the former species have perished .
The severity of the effect on Endor must be much greater than the versions projected for Earthly nuclear wars and single asteroid impacts , since the amount of dust involved is comparable to a small moon rather than insignificant portions of the planetary crust .
Such is the magnitude of the Endor event that it is yet unclear whether the atmosphere would even remain breathable .
The chemistry of the air , land and water may be grossly altered ( because of the burning meteoritic material ) .
The explosion probably is accompanied by a huge burst of deadly radiation .
Additionally , the remains of the Death Star II might have been highly radioactive , depending on the characteristics of the station 's power technology .
The scope of mass - extinction will be nearly total .
Only very simple lifeforms will survive on Endor , and the ewoks are not quite simple enough .
Continuity
The mass - extinction event at Endor is an inevitable physical consequence of the circumstances at the end of Return of the Jedi .
As such , it indirectly enjoys canonical status , even though it was not clearly portrayed in the film .
A small number of official but unfilmed pieces of STAR WARS fiction have offered brief glimpses of post - Imperial Endor , and at first glance some of these references seem difficult to reconcile with the necessary reality of the cataclysm .
There are two possible responses to this problem , and a spectrum of compromises between them :
Reject the offending scenes in the novels and comics , or perhaps those works in their entirety .
These pieces of fiction are official but non-canonical and therefore wherever there is a conflict they must yield to the facts and direct consequences of Return of the Jedi .
Reinterpret the Endor scenes in the secondary works in an attempt to salvage them .
Attribute new meaning to the circumstances so that they do not conflict with Return of the Jedi .
Regard the aberrations as merely " a certain point of view " disguising parts of the objective reality .
Harmonisation of the continuity is preferable to rejection , since it leaves us with a broader and more detailed view of the STAR WARS universe .
Of course , some compromises are unreasonable or impossible to make , and there will be many fans who personally prefer excision of the aberrant fiction for the sake of consistency or out of personal taste .
The particular works which are affected by the Endor holocaust are examined below .
Return of the Jedi
For the first time , the Death star rocked .
The collision [ with Executor ] was only the beginning , leading to various systems breakdowns , which led to reactor meltdowns , which led to personnel panic , abandonment of posts , further malfunctions , and general chaos .
— Return of the Jedi novel , chapter 9 , p.201 [ illustrated edition ] .
One of the important implications of this passage is that the station 's habitable surface layers locally include reactors which undergo dirty meltdown like nuclear reactors on Earth .
They pose a danger to the crew .
How much harmful radioactivity will the battle station 's solid fragments and fireball deposit into the Endorian environment ?
As soon as the battle station was destabilised , the rebel starfleet clustered together and moved between the moon 's surface and the imminent explosion .
This may have been a premeditated attempt to shelter the region surrounding the commando team , perhaps extending to an area as wide as a couple of miles .
Although the rebel cruisers would be inadequate for affecting the majority of the moon - sized bulk of debris , judicious use of combined deflector shields , tractor beams and firepower might deflect dangerous fragments towards neighbouring regions of the moon 's surface ( rather than falling directly on the commandoes ' heads ) .
The " fireworks " and dark circumstances of the rebel celebration are suggestive of the meteoric rain of debris and the spread of fallout across the sky .
The Radio Play [ p.182 ] explicitly states that pieces of the Death Star II were burning up in the atmosphere during the lighting of Lord Vader 's pyre .
LUKE : What could be more fitting ?
It 's a night of lights .
Ewok victory fires .
Rebel fireworks .
Even the last pieces of the Death Star burning up in the atmosphere .
The rebel starfighters seen flying through the air are probably providing air cover protecting the commando team against straggler impacts .
At the very least this would have been necessary during the first few minutes after the station 's explosion .
Pilots would blast apart any dangerously large fragments endangering the site .
However , the smaller broken particles left by such intervention will still ultimately burn up and contribute to the atmospheric fallout layer .
Furthermore , it is impossible for the rebels to break apart or repel more than an insignificant local portion of the total shower 's mass , which is moon - like in magnitude .
Other regions of the globe will still suffer their giant impacts , and the finer debris will still reach the high airborne soot layer .
If the rebels ever had the ability to avert the biocidal calamity then they would also have had the ability to propel the whole battle station around the system before the destruction , which is a ludicrous proposition .
The rebels brought a large number of medium transports to Endor .
their role is not immediately obvious , but the novel indicates that at least some of them were loaded with explosives and sent into deliberate collisions with Imperial ships .
Surviving transports might have been useful for evacuating allied Ewoks , after being emptied of the deadly cargo .
However there is not way in which the transports could carry and deposit useful heavy machinery like a portable planetary shield in the few minutes between the battle station 's explosion and the time when the debris reached the moon 's atmosphere .
The Truce at Bakura
Immediately following the Battle of Endor , the heroes of the Rebel Alliance departed to attend to a bizarre and urgent crisis in the Bakura system .
They spent only one night at Endor , with Han Solo then morbidly inspecting the site of Anakin Skywalker 's pyre .
Nothing in this tale is affected by the Endor holocaust .
Luke Skywalker and his companions can be excused for not knowing or understanding the extent of the calamity since :
they were preoccupied with grief , healing and celebration ; they were not in the mood for pondering astrophysical and climatological circumstances ;
they spent too little time in the system to witness the climatic aftermath ;
rebel leaders would be embarrassed by the hardship which they had unwittingly inflicted on the ewoks , so there would be an official cover - up ;
X - Wing : Wedge 's Gamble
Sometime between two and three years after the Battle of Endor , Wedge Antilles and members of his famous starfighter squadron were on a scouting mission on the galactic capital world , Coruscant .
They toured the Galactic Museum as part of their task of monitoring the planet 's social conditions ( in preparation for New Republic invasion ) .
Antilles found several stuffed ewok specimens on display with a note that the innocent creatures had been made extinct on their native world through the actions of rebels .
Though unwelcome news to members of the squadron which detonated the battle station , this report appears to be objectively true .
The museum display provides satisfying corroboration for the realistic fate of the ewoks , but of course it is not relied upon as primary evidence .
( The primary facts are those events of Return of the Jedi which point to the disaster . )
Some readers have assumed that the ewok extinction reported by the prestigious Galactic Museum is nothing more than a lie serving Imperial propaganda .
However it is important to realise that the most effective forms of propaganda do not falsify verifiable truths and circumstances ; instead they weave a preconceived pattern of significance through cleverly judicious use of available objective facts .
It is true that a few mistruths were told in Museum displays dealing with Emperor Palpatine 's motivations at Endor , but those situations were no longer open to testing and disproof .
Demonstrably false factual claims about ewok extinction would not serve the propaganda machine very well .
From the Imperial point of view , the holocaust at Endor was an act of reckless ecological vandalism by wild political fanatics .
For the Rebel Alliance , the devastation was an unfortunate side - effect of the necessary destruction of a war - machine which was poised to deliver worse destruction throughout the civilised galaxy .
The pilots of Rogue Squadron , particularly those who were involved with the Battle of Endor , would probably not know about the subsequent fate of Endor 's natives .
The rebel leadership must be sufficiently ashamed of the biocide to hold a general cover - up , and they 're probably tactful enough to deliberately avoid bringing the debacle to the Rogues ' attention .
X - Wing : The Bacta War , Wraith Squaron & Iron Fist
In these novels Endor is mentioned , but its condition is not .
Ewoks are mentioned , but their circumstances are not .
The closest these books come to showing a native of Endor is the use of a hypothetical Ewok recruit , who is an emigrant anyhow .
There are hints that some mid-level and junior New Republic pilot officers are unaware of the fate of Endor and any ewoks who remained there .
Evidently , the New Republic 's official coverup persists , but otherwise these novels tell us nothing about the environmental catastrophe .
X - Wing : Solo Command
In this novel a number of Ewoks escaped from Warlod Zsinj 's Binring Biotics Facility , with the aid of a New Republic sympathiser .
This demosntrates that unknown numbers of Ewoks survived for some time in Imperial captivity far away from their homeworld , some may have been kept as luxury exotic pets , and some eventually entered civilian life in the greater galaxy .
This suggests that the species itself may not be in depserate danger , regardless of the thoroughness of whatever evacuation may have taken place immediately after the destruction of the second Death Star .
Dark Force Rising
Princess Leia Organa - Solo chose Endor as the location for her rendezvous with noghri super - commando Khabarakh , approximately five years after the disaster .
The orbit chosen for the Millennium Falcon passed through the position of a " stain " in the Force marking the event of the Emperor 's betrayal and death .
[ This encounter tells us something about the kinematics of the dark Force nexus , since there is no such thing as a universal frame of reference ; the nexus must be either in some kind of " orbit " alongside the moon , or else it is linked to the moon itself .
But this should be the subject of another commentary . ]
The full disk of the moon was visible in the sky .
No landing was made .
As seen by the Princess , the moon seemed " lush " and " green " .
At first glance , this appears to be incompatible with the wasteland which Return of the Jedi leads us to expect .
However the lushness may be a misleading impression given by the green colour .
There are more ways for a world to be green than simply through the presence of foliage .
The greenery of Endor at this point in its post - apocalyptic history must be due to either copper salts or algae suspended in the air or scattered on the desolate ground .
( Atmospheric dust should have mostly settled and thinned within the first few years after the disaster , so the surface might now be visible from space . )
Simple forms of microscopic algae or photosynthetic bacteria might be the forms of life best equipped for surviving several years of lightless dormancy .
In a best - case scenario , the greenery might be lichens or simple hardy grasses .
Dark Empire
Two ewoks were sighted among the rebel forces grounded at the wreck of the star destroyer Liberator near the damaged Imperial Palace on Coruscant .
The Endor holocaust has no implications for this scene , since the moon never appeared in the comic and the ewoks could simply belong to whatever small handful of survivors the rebels were able to evacuate in the days following the Battle of Endor .
Otherwise these offworld ewoks are representative of the scarce individuals who left their moon with traders before the commencement of the Empire 's military activity there .
This group could easily be the entire ewok population of the universe .
Dark Apprentice
Seven years after the Battle of Endor , a young Sith initiate named Kyp Durron paid a visit to the site of Lord Vader 's funeral pyre .
He did not seem to notice anything amiss .
An ecological disaster at Endor is grounded in the canonical facts of Return of the Jedi .
Now what does this tell us about the continuity status of Durron 's excursion ?
The passage we 're interested in is pp.293-298 of Dark Apprentice .
It mentions the existence of " trees " , a " forest " , " twigs and dead leaves " , " underbrush " , one live Gorax , a handful of live Ewoks perceived to be huddled in their homes , and a few noises .
Note :
Nowhere does it say that the trees and plants are alive .
Nuclear winter would not necessarily fell the trunks but the trees would almost certainly be starved of sunlight during the few years through which the climatic effect persists .
Nowhere does it explicitly say that the forest sounds were made by living things .
They might be other phenomena , like the wind whistling .
The Gorax is a rather tough and dull thing .
It plausibly might survive in its castle , though it would go hungry .
Maybe a Gorax is big enough to last for a year or two without food .
In any case , there is reason to believe that the semi- sentient beast is in fact an artificial abomination , and as such it is not really a reliable indicator of the health of the Endorian biosphere .
Maybe the Gorax exists only in the imagination and fears of the Ewoks whose minds Durron has made contact with .
Nowhere does it say that the handful of Ewoks sensed by Durron were on the moon during the aftermath of Return of the Jedi .
If there really are Ewoks on the Endor Moon at this time they can only be individuals resettled as part of an endangered species conservation program .
They must be living on high - technology survival gear and supplies provided by the New Republic .
It has been established in the Roleplaying Game that some Ewoks left Endor with smugglers before Return of the Jedi .
The ones sensed by Durron are probably some of those who 've subsequently returned home .
.

It has been established in the that some Ewoks left Endor with smugglers before .
The ones sensed by Durron are probably some of those who 've subsequently returned home .
Durron is delusional .
He has come under Sith influences , and he 's being manipulated by the shade of a potent Dark Lord .
He 's obsessive , and he 's not in his right mind .
Much or all of his experience at Endor may be a delirium .
In a similar vein , his experience might be part of an illusory test conducted by the Light Force nexus surrounding the resting place of the benign Lord Vader .
This would be like the experiences of Luke Skywalker within the Dark nexus of a certain tree - cave on Dagobah .
The Gorax is a miserable carnivorous giant residing in a peculiar castle on Endor .
Its gross similarity to the stranded humanoid marauders of King Terak suggests that it could be an abomination deliberately created by the Dathomirian witch Charal , as part of her malevolent experiments with the Dark Side of the Force .
( Ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun performed similar procedures on willing Massassi warriors .
Emperor Palpatine 's adepts on Byss used human stock to create giant symbiotic soldiers known as Imperial Sentinels . )
Aside from neglecting the climatic disaster , the credibility of a literalist interpretation of the Dark Apprentice is undermined by the existence of a few comparable continuity problems in material written or edited by the same author .
For instance :
In Tales from Jabba 's Palace Ephant Mon is said to be in Mos Eisley at times when he is clearly seen in the crowd of Jabba 's palace .
Similarly , Bib Fortuna is clearly seen to be aboard the sail barge on Jabba 's final journey to the Pit of Carkoon .

In Tales of the Bounty Hunters Dengar misses Skywalker 's fight with the Rancor , whilst in Return of the Jedi he can be seen among the hecklers watching Skywalker before , during and after the Rancor fight .
In fact he is seen on alert , standing upright when Skywalker entered the throne room , visible through an archway and across the chamber .

In Return of the Jedi the gas - giant Endor is absent .
The Return of the Jedi novel states that it was lost long ago .
[ For an outline of some theories on how this might be accomplished , refer to Astrophysical Concerns . ]
Yet in the Endor scene in Dark Appentice ( p.295 ) the planet is mysteriously restored .
This extraordinary continuity oversight occurs in the same problematic passage of the book .
Comparable Disasters
Honoghr
At some point in his career , Lord Vader 's forces were engaged in a large space battle over the planet Honoghr , homeworld to the fierce noghri species .
A capital ship belonging to one of Vader 's enemies crashed to the surface , effecting a climatic disaster .
Though the immediate climatic effects of such an event would be much slighter than the more massive calamity at Endor , ( since the size and severity of the impact is less ) , the damage is much more lasting .
The principal cause of the continuing devastation on Honoghr is contamination by noxious chemicals used in the crashed vessel .
Only a small area of clean land remains habitable .
Lord Vader brought aid to the noghri , who pledged allegiance to him , but agents of the Emperor modified many of the land rehabilitation droids to sow a genetically - engineered kholm - grass which actually enhanced and perpetuated the poison .
So , even two decades after its cataclysm , Honoghr is not even graced by the greenish slimes and lichens which appear to have recovered a hold on Endor .
Qella
During the Palpatine Era , the planet known as Maltha Obex was a desolate waste in the grip of a fierce ice - age .
New Republic scientists and an intelligence team led by Lando Calrissian discovered that it had once been a more balmy world inhabited by an intelligent species known as the Qella .
Several thousand year ago , unnoticed by the Old Republic , the Qella faced a disaster which promised their extinction .
One of their world 's two moons was a small captured asteroidal body .
Perturbed by a larger natural moon , its orbit was decaying towards an inevitable impact against the planet .
With only a century to prepare , the Qella were unable to develop sufficient starfaring technology to evacuate their entire population , nor sufficiently powerful repulsors to deflect the moon .
Their bioengineers did manage to develop another slight hope for the species ' salvation , but the planet itself met its due devastation .
The moon impacted , and the resulting nuclear winter effect kicked the planetary climate into a deep ice - age state .
Earth
The details of extraterrestrially - induced mass - extinctions on Earth are still contended by geologists .
However it seems as if most scientists believe that an asteroid or comet about 10 km in diameter impacted sixty - five millions years ago .
An impact crater at least several hundred kilometres wide and dating to the correct age lies beneath the surface of the northwest part of Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
Distinctive chemical elements which are rare in the Earth 's crust but relatively common in asteroids ( and comets ) is found enriched in a 65 M yr - old clay layer worldwide .
Most individual organisms died and at least forty percent of all animal species ( including most large animals ) vanish from the fossil record at this point .
It is believed that the impact caused the mass - extinction via the kind of nuclear winter effect described in previous sections ( climatic alteration due to dust and soot in upper atmosphere ) .
The necessary differences between the Earthly and Endorian situations are that much more matter was injected into the Endorian atmosphere , the matter may have been radioactive , and the moon probably did not suffer global tidal waves ( because instead of oceans it has only a smattering of small local disconnected lakes ) .
The composition of Earth 's atmosphere probably would not have been as severely altered .
Yavin
It has been speculated that the moon Yavin IV might have been adversely affected by the explosion of the original Death Star .
Whether or not the first Death Star was close enough for Yavin IV 's surface to be affected , the rebel base surely had a sufficiently good deflector shield to locally repel any falling debris onto neighbouring areas of the moon 's surface ( so the base need not fear obliteration by a direct impact ) .
The rebels probably left the moon within days of the battle anyhow , since they would rightly fear Imperial reprisals .
The Death Star was not close to the moon when it exploded .
It had just rounded the limb of the planet Yavin , ready to fire the superlaser .
According to indications on rebel tactical displays and the known diameter of Yavin , the battle station was about 250,000 km away from YavinIV .
The Death Star II was only about 2000 km away from the Endor moon .
Because of the great distance between the Death Star and the moon , only a tiny fraction of the exploding mass would intercept Yavin IV .
Much ( perhaps most ) of the debris would have fallen into the gas giant , which dominated the battle station 's sky .
The portion striking the moon would be no more than a quarter of a percent of the station 's total mass - equivalent to a cube of the station with a side length of 8 km .
A single solid impact of this size would cause a big mass - extinction event , but the Death Star is partly hollow .
Realistically we would expect a large number of small - to medium - sized impacts distributed over the globe .
Individually , the imapcts would be nasty to anyone within a few dozen km .
There may be some climatic problems , but nothing on the scale of the Endor disaster , where much of the moon 's surface would be literally smothered with wreckage .
Attacked Worlds
Biocide is well within the standard technological capabilities of the galactic civilisation .
Interstellar warfare results in the deliberate or accidental erasure of life from planets from time to time .
The operation of cleansing a hostile world by bombarding it to the point where the crust is melted is code - named " Base Delta Zero " in the lexicon of the Imperial Navy , but it is not an exclusively Imperial procedure .
Victims of such operations have included Caamas and Emberlene [ Spectre of the Past ] , and the Rebel Alliance administrative outpost at Dankayo [ Scavenger Hunt ] .
In the former example , the planetary surface remained aflame for years after the attack .
The planet Meridias [ Planet of Twilight ] was left a charred radioactive wasteland centuries before the rise of Palpatine .
According to X - Wing : Wraith Sqaudron , the planet Toprawa was sterilised after the Battle of Yavin .
This was Imperial punishment for the theft of the Death Star plans from a facility on that world .
The locals were innocent , but they were reduced to a pre-industrial existence , and forced to partake in rituals of public grovelling in order to receive supplies .
In Vector Prime a deliberate moonstrike was inflicted on a populated Outer Rim world by the Yuuzhan Vong .
It was a small moon , really only as great as a modest or large asteroid .
However its impact obliterated civilisaztion and presumably sterilised the globe .
Fate of the Ewoks
No animal larger than a few kilograms and incapable of long sheltered hibernation could survive the Endorian calamity .
The air might even have been poisoned and deoxygenated for a few years until simple plant life could return to growth .
If so then it is possible that all animal life perished .
In any case any ewok on the surface who was not equipped with impressive high - technology survival gear and a nuclear shelter must have died .
For those unfortunate beings not painlessly obliterated by the impact concussions , the initial night of celebration would linger on and on with days of darkness .
A chill would fall , the waters would turn to ice and the vegetation would wilt into death or dormancy , depending on species .
Provided that radioactivity was insignificant and the air remained modestly breathable ( a very generous assumption ) the doomed ewoks might survive for days or weeks huddling around bonfires , until they starved .
The species was not perfectly confined to its native moon , and some off - world individuals seem to have survived .
Exact statistics for ewok emigration are unknown but probably small .
Although the Galactic Empire had declared the moon a natural sanctuary , at least several smugglers had taken ewoks offworld as stowaways , hitchhikers and perhaps slaves .
These encounters are known to have happened long before the start of the Death Star II construction project .
It seems likely that the forces of the Rebel Alliance evacuated some ewoks in the aftermath of the Battle of Endor , though they did not have sufficient transport capability or enough time to gather more than a small fraction of the scattered global population .
Members of the tribe which had adopted the Rebel Alliance were probably given preferential treatment .
The presence of two living ewoks among the forces of the New Republic Navy was confirmed in Dark Empire , six years after the disaster .
During the Thrawn campaign , the neutral planet Svivren boasted an ewok population .
The Svivreni detest the Galactic Civil War , and they successfully resisted both the Imperial remnants and the New Republic after Palpatine 's fall .
Thus Svivren is an ideal sanctuary for Endorian evacuees .
Statistics in The Last Command Sourcebook hint that the ewoks comprise the largest minority group on the planet .
If there truly were ewoks on the moon during the later visit of Kyp Durron then they must be a recently - resettled group , with modern survival equipment if the climate remains hostile .
They may be part of a deliberate rehabilitation and terraforming project executed by a benign agency with galactic - standard technology .
Though resettlement of offworld ewoks ends the species ' technical state of extinction on their homeworld , the fate of the ewoks is not yet secure .
It is not clear whether the remnant ewok population is large enough for the species to remain viable without extensive genetic therapy to counteract the ills of inbreeding .
If the Death Star II fallout was radioactive then the ewok returnees would also need to contend with radiation sickness , enhanced rates of cancer and mutational birth abnormalities .
Political Implications
The ewoks were marginally known to the outside galaxy before the cataclysm at Endor .
Some ewok languages must have been cursorily studied by galactic anthropologists , since they were incorporated into the linguistic repertoire of at least one protocol droid which was over a hundred years old4 .
The ewoks were known to the Imperial scouts who contributed to the selection of the moon as the Death Star II construction site [ The Illustrated STAR WARS Universe ] .
They must have been known to the security troops on the ground .
They probably were known to at least some civilian departments of the Imperial government , since the moon was designated as a nature sanctuary .
Endor was probably reserved for the purpose of protecting the natives from exploitation , and allowing them to progress at their own technological pace .
Whether the " sanctuary moon " status was granted by the Empire or Old Republic is unknown .
The Imperials were not consistently pure in their motives towards the ewoks .
Emperor Palpatine did not seem interested in his government 's standards of environmental protection and non-intervention with primitive species .
In fact he left contingency orders for the moon 's destruction in the event that the rebel commando team succeeded in lowering the security shield .
This may have been no more than a taunt for Luke Skywalker , since the moon 's nearby explosion would seem to threaten the station itself , unless the Death Star 's modest internally - generated shielding ensured safety ,
As the battle station rocked from the impact of Executor and internal damage inflicted by rebel starfighters , Moff Jerjerrod was already attempting to carry out the command .
The station was already turning upon the moon when Palpatine began attacking Skywalker , as demonstrated by the motion of stars visible through the throne room windows .
By the time of its destruction , Death Star II had turned away from the rebel fleet and the superlaser almost reached firing orientation .
The record of the Rebel Alliance 's involvement with the ewoks is also far from flattering .
The commando team clearly exploited the naive natives in their attack upon the Imperial ground facilities .
Though the rebel starpilots deserve credit for thwarting Jerjerrod 's attempt to eliminate all Endorian life , the rebel actions indirectly caused gross environmental damage .
To establish the degree of culpability we must consider whether the rebel leaders and tacticians were aware that Endor was inhabited .
At the Rebel Alliance general briefing there was no mention of native intelligent life .
However the presence of Ewokese in the linguistic repertoire of C - 3PO suggests that although obscure , the ewoks should have been known to mission planners .
Perhaps the ewoks were omitted from the information leaked to the Bothans by Palpatine ; it would be quite in character for the Emperor to entice the Alliance into ugly moral ambiguities , forcing them into an accidental genocide .
Alternatively , the ewok information may have been received by rebel leaders but deliberately omitted from subsequent briefing reports so that the lower officers and enlisted men could fulfil their orders without guilty qualms of environmentalism .
In the Return of the Jedi Radio Drama , Princess Leia explicitly complained that her reports made no mention of intelligent lifeforms .
At least the rebel commandoes were ignorant of the ewoks ' existence , and were dealing with the primitives in good faith .
That 's not to say that there could n't have been concealment higher up the rebels ' executive chain .
Their strategic calculus might demand that the battle station be destroyed , for the greater good of the majority of sapient species in the galaxy .
Considering the importance of the Emperor and his superweapon , a biosphere lacking sapient natives would be a justifiable sacrifice , which could save other worlds from obliteration .
War is cruel and desperate , and the rebels might not have reconsidered their attack under any circumstances .
However some may believe that a knowing willingness to endanger an intelligent species would expose severe hypocrisy in the propaganda of the Alliance / New Republic .
Whether or not the rebels had foreknowledge , the fate of Endor would probably remain a secret of the New Republic government .
Although the uninformed personnel of the fleet and ground operations are blameless , the decisions of the highest rebel leaders deserve scrutiny .
It may have been clumisiness and poor research , or it may have been ruthless utilitarianism .
The truth , which remains unexplained to this day , is likely to involve more clumsiness than malice .
Rebel intelligence was not excellent in the Battle of Endor .
Their spies clearly were manipulated by the Emperor to the extent of providing wholly false information about the condition of the Death Star II and the distribution of security forces .
In any case , the disaster situation must have been an embarrassment after the battle .
The inclination of Endor references in post - Return of the Jedi stories hints at a high - level cover -up .
Most citizens and military personnel of the New Republic would be kept unaware of the deep shame which accompanied the birth of the new regime .
It is unknown whether the rebel forces and the successive New Republic government made any systematic efforts to evacuate and eventually resettle ewoks in secret .
It seems likely that they would have at least indulged in the rescue and protection of a token number of the ewoks from the tribes who had allied themselves against the Empire .
The neutral Svivreni hosted a large population of ewok immigrants on their homeworld ; they probably were evacuees [ The Last Command Sourcebook ] .
A long - term terraforming project is possible .
Summary
The ewok population is effectively extinguished .
Most were killed in a mass - extinction event affecting life on their homeworld , due to unavoidable fallout and debris from the destruction of the Death Star II .
The Rebel Alliance is culpable but perhaps innocent .
All ewoks would have been better off if the tribe which made contact with the rebels continued with their original plan of killing and eating the commando team 's leaders .
However once the shield fell and Jerjerrod began his attack , the ewok 's best interests were served by the Alliance naval forces bringing about a swift destruction of the battle station ; the chance of ecological devastation ameliorated by partial evacuation and rehabilitation is better than near - instantaneous obliteration of the whole moon .
Knowledge of the Endor Holocaust is based primarily on the facts of the Return of the Jedi film , and the supportive passage in the Wedge 's Gamble is only secondary corroborative evidence .
None of the Endor references in other tales of the New Republic era are in unresolvable contradiction with the catastrophe , though a very precise interpretation of Dark Apprentice may be necessary .
Studying the mechanics of the orbit and explosion of the Death Star II reveals , in brief :
The Death Star II was not in a natural stable orbit .
For a geosynchronous orbit ( ie. the station staying directly above the ground facility ) it would have to be several times further from the moon .
Therefore it is being held in place by a repulsor field , which is probably associated with the deflector shield .
When that blows up , the battle station 's substance falls from the sky , regardless of whether it has been disintegrated or falls in one piece .
In Return of the Jedi we see debris shooting out in all directions , including down towards the surface of the moon .
Some of the pieces are very large , dozens of miles across ; which is wider than the effective depth of the atmosphere and probably more massive than the kind of asteroid needed for a mass - extinction impact .
There are at least dozens of bodies in this mass range .

There are at least dozens of bodies in this mass range .
Maybe the rebels , being environmentally conscious , attempt to blow up these fragments before they can hit the moon ?
Fine .
You 're still left with the same amount of material falling from the sky .
You can have it either in big chunks ( which make huge impacts ) or as a rain of fallout dust .
Either way the upper atmosphere will eventually be clogged with either fallout dust or impact dust , resulting in one huge nuclear winter effect .
Maybe the rebels think that they can move all of the Death Star material somewhere else ?
That does n't work because there 's too much to shift .
The rebels do n't have the capacity to transport a moon - sized mass of material within a few minutes any more than the Imperial engineers could import it all into the construction site in the same length of time .
They could n't budge the Death Star II when it was in one piece and they certainly could n't move it after it was disintegrated and spread all over the place .
Avoiding the Endor Holocaust is completely impossible .
It is an inevitable consequence of observable facts of the Return of the Jedi film .
Endor is a depopulated wasteland .
Notes
This makes some people understandably uncomfortable .
I only discovered the Endor Holocaust by accident .
I studied the Death Star II orbit in order to gain a measurement of the station 's size which is independent of the ( incorrect ) value given by West End Games .
I always imagined that the site of Vader 's pyre would become a place of gentle things ; a Light Force Nexus analogous to the Dark Nexus on Dagobah .
But I 've done calculations and I now accept the inevitability of the bleaker reality .
To be precise , the Death Star II 's orbital period must match the sidereal period of the moon : its period of rotation with respect to the non-inertial background of the universe , not in relation to Endor 's sun or any other local body .
The composition of the station must have involved substances of immense strength .
This may have included metals , reinforced through by the action of inertial dampers or " structural integrity " fields .
It may consist of exotic carbon compounds or superlattices designed for strength greater than substances known on Earth .
For the convenience I 'll refer to it all as " metal " , understanding that the true chemical nature might be profoundly different .
According to SWCCG cards and earlier sources , C - 3PO was well over a century old in the classic trilogy .
C - 3PO was reconstructed by Anakin Skywalker in TPM , which was 36 years prior to ROTJ .
Some components predated the rebuild .
The processor that allows the droid to interpret millions of languages is likely to be one of the older components , since a Tatooine slave boy is unlikely to be able to program so much information without significant outside resources .
FAQ
Why do n't we see debris raining from the sky during the ewok celebration ?
We actually do .
We see rebel starfighters flying amidst an abundance of material breaking up in the atmosphere .
The Return of the Jedi radio play describes it as material from the Death Star .
Furthermore the whole sky is darkened , as if overcast with fallout .
Large ground - shaking impacts matching and exceeding the yield of nuclear weapons must have struck parts of the moon beyond the immediate vicinity of the village .
Why could n't the rebel fleet use tractor beams to move the debris somewhere safe ?
It 's a matter of inertia and energy .
The trouble with any attempt by the rebels to do something about the explosion is that the combined mass of the rebel fleet is equal to only a tiny speck of the Death Star 's surface .
If they used tractor beams on the station 's wreckage the result would be for the ships to be dragged by the debris while the debris would be only slightly deflected .
The difficulty and amount of energy involved in containing or shifting the stuff of a moon - sized explosion is the same or greater than for moving the intact battle station around .
If the rebels had been physically able to do something about the Death Star II explosion , they also would have had the capability to knock the station around the Endor system like a billiard ball .
They plainly were n't able to do that .
Besides , the debris cloud was close enough to reach the forest moon within minutes or seconds , so the rebels had little time for large celestial manipulations .
Why could n't captured Imperial ships help to do the same ?
Because the combined power and mass of the Imperial and rebel ships at Endor is insignificant compared to the energy / timeframe of the explosion and the mass of debris .
Could the disaster have been averted if the Death Star was actually moving towards the Alliance fleet [ and away from the moon at its moment of destruction ] ?
In principle you could inadvertently protect the moon , if the station 's initial outwards motion was greater than the maximum velocity of the fireball ( of the eventual explosion ) .
But in that case the fireball would have seemed to be receding away in the sky , rather than having pieces falling down as seen in the movie .
For viewers on the ground , it would have seemed to be shrinking .
As shown in the movie , the fireball expanded much faster than the velocities typical of orbital motion at the Death Star 's altitude .
In any case , the operational status of the station 's sublight propulsion systems is uncertain .
Does it matter whether the bulk of the station was vaporised ?
No .
Material that is turned to vapour does not vanish .
Vapour cools rapidly by radiating its heat to space and also by conducting heat to air once it hits the atmosphere .
The result of this cooling is that the vapour would recondense as solid soot , like water precipitating as snowflakes .
Indeed the margins of the Death Star II explosion appeared sooty before many of the ground troops noticed the fireball .
Therefore some condensation began to occur only seconds after the detonation .
In any case the explosion shows numerous large tumbling solid fragments , each of which alone is sufficient to cause a global mass - extinction event .
In summary , there are two extreme alternatives , and a mixture of intermediate possiblities in between : ( 1 ) big solid chunks of the DS impacting on the surface and throwing up fallout dust ; or ( 2 ) huge volumes of metallic vapour condensing in the atmosphere to give a similar amount of dust .
What if it was n't metal ?
Substances that do n't react chemically in the Endorian atmosphere will end up as condensed atmospheric soot , either directly or via impact ejecta .
This is the standard scenario described above .
If the station were composed of combustible materials involving lighter elements like C and H , the byproducts would be water and carbon - dioxide .
However the mass of solid material visible at the station 's surface is large enough that it would deplete atmospheric oxygen if it burnt upon entry .
( At the maximum possible size of the moon ( 5600 km radius ) the mass of atmosphere should be about 4x1018 kg .
If the station 's mean density is at least equal to air — for a total mass of about 3x1017kg — then the combustion of all this material would consume much or all of Endor 's free oxygen . )
What if much of the material of the station was annihilated in matter / antimatter or similar reactions ?
Then a horrendously lethal burst of gamma rays would have burnt everything on the moon with a line of sight to the explosion .
That did n't happen in the movie , and we saw huge chunks of debris moving towards the moon .
An impact by any one of them is sufficient to create a climatic catastrophe on par with the Cretaceous - Tertiary extinction on Earth .
What if the debris goes into hyperspace ?
Sending the debris into hyperspace ( presumably involving local misfiring of hyperdrive systems within the station ) would solve nothing .
It is a well established fact that objects in hyperspace collide with objects in realspace destructively .
( " You can fly right through a star ... and that will end your trip real quick . " )
The debris that flies off in the direction of the moon will crash into the moon .
The only question is whether the material would revert to realspace or just dump its mass - energy in the moon 's atmosphere .
The former scenario will have consequences similar to those outlined in the main parts of the commentary .
The latter scenario effectively means irradiating the near side of the moon with the equivalent of the annihilation energy of much of the station 's mass — an unfathomable dosage of hard radiation .
Could the rebels have activated the shields from Endor right after the explosion of the Death Star II , thereby containing most of the matter within the confines of the shield radius ?
No .
The trouble is that they blew up the shield already , in order to allow the rebel fighters access to the station .
The Endor moon has lower gravity than Earth .
Wo n't this prevent a calamity ?
True , the gravity must be lower than Earth's .
That circumstance is estimated and taken into account in this commentary .
The gravity cannot be indefinitely low , otherwise there would be no atmosphere , and the humans and ewoks on Endor would bounce high whenever they attempted to walk .
The Endorian gravity msust be at least as great as on Earth 's airless moon , and even there objects falling from space land at violent , crater - inducing velocity .
Furthermore , the observed expansion speed of the debris chunks is much greater than the speed that the same material would attain by falling freely from the sky .
The chunks impact harder than free - fall velocity .
The moon and ewoks seem unharmed in the Ewok movies .
How can this be ?
For five years , Allen Stayman wondered who ordered his removal from a State Department job negotiating agreements with tiny Pacific island nations -- even when his own bosses wanted him to stay .
Now he knows .
Newly disclosed e-mails suggest that the ax fell after intervention by one of the highest officials at the White House : Ken Mehlman , on behalf of one of the most influential lobbyists in town , Jack Abramoff .
The e-mails show that Abramoff , whose client list included the Northern Mariana Islands , had long opposed Stayman ’s work advocating labor changes in that U.S. commonwealth , and considered what his lobbying team called the “ Stayman project ” a high priority .
Advertisement
“ Mehlman said he would get him fired , ” an Abramoff associate wrote after meeting with Mehlman , who was then White House political director .
The exchange illustrates how , more than two years after the corruption scandal surrounding the now - disgraced Abramoff came to light , people are still learning the extent of the lobbyist ’s ability to pull the levers of power in Washington .
The latest revelations provide more detail than the Bush administration has acknowledged about how Abramoff and his team reached into high levels of the White House , not just Capitol Hill , which has been the main focus of the influence - peddling investigation .
The e-mails , disclosed as part of a report by the House Government Reform Committee , show how Abramoff manipulated the system through officials such as Mehlman , now the chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Doing so , Abramoff directed government appointments , influenced policy decisions and won White House endorsements for political candidates -- all in the service of his clients .
The report found more than 400 lobbying contacts between Abramoff ’s team and the White House .
Advertisement
Besides the Stayman matter , the e-mails reveal Mehlman ’s role in helping an Abramoff client , the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians , secure $ 16.3 million for a new jail that government analysts concluded was not necessary .
Mehlman also helped Abramoff obtain a White House endorsement in 2002 of the Republican gubernatorial ticket in the U.S. territory of Guam .
Abramoff pleaded guilty in January to federal charges in a congressional bribery investigation that continues to loom over Capitol Hill and the GOP .
A Senate subcommittee concluded that Abramoff fleeced Indian tribes out of millions of dollars in fees that he split with one of his associates .
The scandal has touched just one West Wing staffer , Susan Ralston , a onetime Abramoff aide who resigned this month as executive assistant to strategist Karl Rove after congressional investigators documented frequent contact with the lobbyist ’s team .
Mehlman said he did not recall the details of his contacts with the Abramoff team , including discussions about Stayman , the former State Department official .
But he said such interactions were part of his job as White House political director .
Advertisement
“ I was a gateway , ” Mehlman said in an interview .
“ It was my job to talk to political supporters , to hear their requests , and hand them on to policymakers . ”
Mehlman said he had known Abramoff since the mid-1990s and would listen to his requests along with those of other influential Republicans .
“ I know Jack , ” Mehlman said .
“ I certainly recall that if he and others wanted to meet I would have met with them , as I would have met with lots of people . ”
Mehlman , a Baltimore native and graduate of Harvard Law School , has remained a GOP power player since stepping down as political director in 2003 .
He built the party ’s grass - roots get - out - the - vote strategy , managing President Bush ’s 2004 reelection campaign before taking over the RNC last year .
Advertisement
Democrats charge that Mehlman may have acted unethically during his time at the White House , lobbying for government actions at Abramoff ’s behest , even when policy experts disagreed with the decision .
The senior Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee , Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles , points to e-mails suggesting that in June 2001 , amid negotiations over whether to fire Stayman , Mehlman requested and might have been given two U2 concert tickets in Abramoff ’s suite at what was then the MCI Center ( now the Verizon Center ) .
Ethics rules prohibit officials from accepting gifts worth more than $ 20 from a person doing business with the government , although there are exceptions .
Ethics officials typically consider such suite tickets to be worth the same as the event ’s most expensive tickets , which in this case was $ 133 apiece , according to Waxman ’s office .
“ Please tell me we can fit two more in for Friday , ” lobbyist and Kevin Ring wrote to Abramoff , his partner .
“ Ken Mehlman of the White House apparently wants to go . ”
On the day before the concert , Ring wrote to Abramoff that a resume for a Stayman replacement had been “ sent to our conduit . ”
Advertisement
Referring in the same e-mail to an unrelated Labor Department appointment , Ring said he “ will talk to Mehlman at the concert tomorrow night . ”
A former Abramoff associate remembers Mehlman attending the concert .
Mehlman said he did not recall it .
“ I ’ve been to several U2 concerts , but I do n’t know whether I went to that one , ” he said .
“ But I can tell you that as political director I was always very careful to make sure everything I did was above board and consistent with the rules . ”
Waxman said the e-mails suggested Mehlman may have “ violated fundamental ethics regulations and the law . ”
“ There are serious questions that Mr. Mehlman needs to address with candor and that Congress should investigate thoroughly , ” Waxman said .
Advertisement
The e-mails disclosed in the House report showed that Mehlman was involved in a variety of matters of interest to Abramoff , one of which bore fruit for the lobbyist after he discussed delivering campaign contributions to GOP causes .
Tony Rudy , a onetime aide to former Rep. Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) , referred to Mehlman on Nov. 9 , 2001 , as a “ rock star ” after Mehlman agreed to “ take care of ” the Choctaws ’ jail , despite a Justice Department finding that the tribe ’s existing jail was adequate .
Several days after that meeting , on Nov. 13 , Rudy recommended a $ 15,000 contribution to the Republican National Committee .
“ Let ’s give the check to Ken Mehlman at the White House , ” wrote Rudy , who later pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the broader investigation .
On Nov. 15 , campaign finance records show , the tribe gave $ 10,000 to the RNC .
Overall , the tribe gave $ 120,000 in the 2002 election cycle to Republican committees and $ 95,000 to Democratic committees , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Advertisement
Two weeks after the RNC received its check , Susan Butler , chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Charles W. “ Chip ” Pickering , a Mississippi Republican whose district includes the Choctaws , e-mailed Rudy to say that she had discussed the issue with Mehlman and others and that “ they were very positive and promised to work with us on it . ”
When Justice Department officials relented and released the money for the jail , giddy Abramoff associates planned to host agency officials in a suite at a Dave Matthews concert .
“ I have the suite filling up with DOJ staffers who just got our client $ 16 million , ” one wrote .
Another replied that the agency officials deserve any reward they want , “ opening day tickets , Skins v. Giants , oriental massages , hookers , whatever . ”
Mehlman , meanwhile , also helped Abramoff with another client , Guam , the e-mails show .
Advertisement
On Oct. 9 , 2002 , Abramoff asked Mehlman to secure a White House endorsement for the island ’s GOP gubernatorial ticket .
Three weeks later , Abramoff received a note from Ralston , then Rove ’s assistant , saying that Mehlman had gotten a quote from the White House for “ your Guam candidates . ”
She also asked Abramoff to send his requests in the future to “ Ken only . ”
For Stayman , learning more about how Abramoff used White House connections helped him understand why , five years ago , he found himself looking at a career change .
His job was up for renewal , but his State Department supervisors wanted to keep him on to finish a project that was expected to take more time .
Advertisement
“ With only about a year left on my appointment , I did n’t think it would trigger any interest from the White House , ” Stayman said .
“ I assumed that Abramoff was behind it , but I did n’t know the details , who called whom and how much effort it took . ”
Unbeknownst to Stayman , though , within weeks of Bush taking office , the “ Stayman project ” was in full swing .
State Department officials resisted the dismissal , and negotiations dragged on for months .
In May 2001 , one of Mehlman ’s deputies assured Abramoff ’s team that , “ Obviously , this guy cannot stay . ”
That July 9 , Ralston e-mailed Abramoff with news of a deal on Stayman : “ He ’ll be out in four months . ”

And he was .

Note : this article was written in February 2005 .
The ideas still apply , but many of the technical details about Gmail and Pine have changed .
Caveat reader !
I ’ve used Pine as my email client for , well , pretty much forever .
I use it because it ’s fast , powerful , stable , and very keyboardable .
( I hate the mouse . )
However , since I work at Google , I ’m constantly bombarded with people who ask me why I do n’t use Gmail .
After hearing the nth person brag about how much it increased their productivity , I finally broke down and tried it .
I did n’t expect much , since I ’ve never liked web - based email clients .
However , I made myself use it as my only email client , for a month , to give it a fair shot .
I ended up using it for five weeks , and while I eventually switched back to Pine , I liked Gmail a lot more than I expected .
It made me question lots of things I took for granted , and showed me that there ’s plenty of innovation left in email clients .
I ’m currently writing patches for Pine to implement the features I miss most from Gmail .
( Many people have gone the other direction and written Greasemonkey scripts for Gmail to add features and customize it to their liking . )
Here ’s the good , the bad , and the ugly of Gmail , compared to Pine .
My opinions are not those of my employer , look both ways before crossing the street , do n’t run with scissors , etc .
The Good
It ’s somewhat faster than your average IMAP server .
( Of course , this is both a success of Gmail and a failing of most IMAP servers . )
Gmail is smart about hiding quoted text and emails i’ve seen .
This rocks .
Somehow it even knows the 1 % of cases where I actually do want to see the quoted text .
I have no idea how .
The UI for threading , or conversations in Gmail lingo , rocks even harder .
The killer feature is that the bodies of all messages in the thread on a single screen .
Combined with hiding quoted text , this is very powerful .
Mail is indexed .
My average search takes under a second in Gmail , but around 10 seconds in Pine .
Tags , aka labels or virtual folders , are all the rage these days .
GMail ’s implementation of them is slick , and eminently usable .
Pine ’s keywords offer most of the same functionality , but compared to Gmail , they ’re a little clunky .
There are keyboard shortcuts !
Wonder of wonders , it ’s a webapp that has keyboard shortcuts .
Even more amazing , I can actually do most of my normal email tasks with the keyboard shortcuts only .
If I could n’t , I never would have given Gmail a second glance .
I love the Y key , a single keystroke for archiving email .
Archiving in pine takes two keystrokes at best , and four if I last saved to a different folder than my “ archive ” folder .
The address book is great , mostly because I never have to use it .
Gmail automatically remembers everyone I ’ve sent email to or received email from , and auto - completes when I start type their name or email address .
I wish Pine did this !
The Bad
Filtering has a great UI , but it ’s horribly weak .
It has maybe a third of the headers and options that I normally filter on .
Even with labels , the set of filter actions is anemic .
There ’s no way to bounce an email .
This should be pretty trivial to add .
If no email is selected , the Y key should archive the email under the cursor .
This should be common sense .
You ca n’t automatically create a filter based on an email .
Why not ?
You can search , but you ca n’t select messages based on headers , subject , or body text .
Worse , if you have more messages than fit on the screen , you ca n’t select any messages that are n’t on the screen .
If you ever get flooded with email , or with spam that escapes the spam filters , god help you .
The Ugly
There are " must have " application areas and data files that will drive adoption of products .
Many of them are far down the long tail of popularity .
Serving a narrow , most popular set is a losing proposition .
One of the hot concepts mentioned frequently when discussing Internet businesses and applications for the last year or two has been that of the " Long Tail " .
It was most recently popularized by Chris Anderson 's October 2004 article in Wired called " The Long Tail " .
I 've written about some of value of the long tail , as have many others : See " Small Players Matter " from June 2002 and Jakob Nielsen 's email there and his essays with data back to 1997 .
From what I 've seen , most of the writings derived from Anderson 's article have to do with the additional value you get by serving the long tail of less - than - very - popular items made more financially viable by the Internet .
In this essay I show why it is even more important to serve the long tail in some areas , and how systems that limit the ability to use inexpensively created custom content will have a hard time in the marketplace .
I also relate the idea of the long tail to general purpose authoring tools .
The essay goes through the background that brought me to these conclusions .
What do we mean today by the long tail ?
The standard discussion of the long tail includes a graph like this :
Along the horizontal axis it has the full inventory of items or services available for purchase .
The vertical axis shows the number of units of each sold .
There is a classic curve with just a few of the products selling in any significant numbers compared to the others .
In a traditional store or company only a subset of the products that could be sold is actually made available for sale -- those to the left of the vertical dotted line .
There are many reasons for this , such as cost of inventory , lack of shelf space , old fashioned telecommunications architecture , need to focus sales and support in a narrow area , etc .
The long tail comes into play when the cost of making a much wider selection available drops .
This may be because of new technology such as the Internet , business models that involve user generated reviews and support , etc .
In any case , in areas such as books and music there is a very long tail of additional products , each of value to its purchasers few that they may be .
If you look at the total sales you find that the large volume of niche products more than makes up for the few copies sold of each , with those products making up a significant portion of revenue and often profit .
You get graphs like this :
Hyperdifferentiation Last year I heard a speech by University of Pennsylvania Professor Eric Clemons at a DiamondCluster event .
( Eric has since become a DiamondCluster Fellow , as am I . )
Prof. Clemons talked about " hyperdifferentiation " .
( See the paper he co-authored titled " Information , Hyperdifferentiation , and Delight : The Value of Being Different " . )
Hyperdifferentiation is described as " the art of reducing the importance of price as the principal determinant of customers ' selection among alternative goods and services ... [ It 's ] not about being better in any absolute sense nor [ needing to be ] more expensive to produce ; rather it is about being better for each customer , and thus more profitable to sell . "
He gives examples of products such as beer with a high content of hops .
Most people do n't like the taste , but for those who do like it that beer is something they will pay much more for than a more common brew .
He also talks about certain hotels that just do things just the way he likes , and therefore make him feel the extra cost is " worth it " .
The issue can be shown graphically this way :
The horizontal axis shows the range of items available , sorted by attributes that matter to the purchaser .
The vertical dotted line is the point where the product 's attributes are " ideal " for a particular purchaser .
The vertical axis is the value to that particular purchaser :
Notice how the value peaks at " exactly what they want " and drops off as it meets the ideal less and less .
Clemons and his co-authors write : " Assumption : With many choices available , a customer 's willingness to pay for products and services falls off quickly when the fit between these offerings and his or her ideal product location decreases . "
Uncertainty
What struck me is the following graph , derived from what I remember of his talk and explained in the paper :
When you have uncertainty involved , not being sure that the product will be of consistent attributes or not being sure of your understanding of the likelihood of meeting your ideal , the value goes down .
A hotel which is sometimes great and sometimes lousy is not one you will pay as much for as one that is always great .
A hotel that you can't check out in advance through pictures or trusted recommendations will make you feel less comfortable about committing in advance to paying a high room rate .
Some products ( big fast food and hotel chains ) often depend upon the value of certainty :
Their attributes may not be the greatest , but they give you a very high certainty that you will get exactly what you expect and rarely get surprised on the downside , so they minimize the uncertainty effect .
Hearing this , I realized something .
If I have a particular need that can be fulfilled by a tool , the tool I will choose is the one that I know will more likely fulfill that need .
If I have to limit my " toolkit " in advance to just a few tools , I try to include those tools that will meet as wide a range of needs as possible from the range of needs that I think I will have in the future .
Tools that can be used for a wide range of purposes therefore become very popular : Hammers , screw drivers , pliers , word processors , personal automobiles , etc .
General purpose tools A digression about general purpose computer - based tools :
I 've learned from my work developing spreadsheet and word processing systems over the last 30 years that one of the reasons they are so popular ( and have repeatedly beat out competing genres of products aiming for a subset of their uses ) is that these tools are so general purpose and well understood .
People 's needs with text and mixed text and data documents are quite diverse .
When you get down to the details , most uses are custom .
While an " income statement " may sound like a standard thing , so many of them are very specific to the company they report upon and the needs of the particular executives and others who use them .
A production planning report is even more varied .
A " letter " or " resume " may sound standard , but people like to craft each to be exactly their way and to fit the content .
The beauty of a computer tool like a spreadsheet or a word processor is that it provides an understandable framework with which the user can figure out by themselves how to create exactly what they want .
( We sometimes call this framework a " metaphor " . )
The spreadsheet provides a framework by having a row and column system .
That system imposes a slight order and restricts things a bit , but it opens up areas like summation on ranges and other operations .
The freeform positioning and arbitrary cell references keep the framework from getting in the way of making things exactly as you want them to be .
The spreadsheet as a tool takes care of the tedious parts of producing a wide variety of output without defining the problem being solved .
It has calculating ( and recalculating ) abilities , both text and numbers and straight lines , and numeric formatting -- all tedious things otherwise .
General purpose tools such as these are appropriate when you have very diverse situations .
They handle unanticipated needs well .
They are " tools " , not automatons or agents .
They allow for customizing ( dealing with the unanticipated ) as opposed to just choosing ( dealing only with anticipated , predetermined needs ) .
An important aspect of the framework of a good general purpose tool is that once you learn it , the range of areas it can be successfully applied to should be something you internalize .
You know which things are easy to get done exactly as you want with a word processor or with a spreadsheet .
You may never have used them for that particular application , but you know the " space " it covers well enough to know if the application is in that space .
Tools whose applicable " problem solving space " is broad become popular , from word processors to duct tape .
A general purpose tool that most people can't use easily or understand how to apply in new situations will be less popular .
General purpose addresses hyperdifferentiation Back to hyperdifferentiation :
If you know that a product can be used for a range of needs , you will have less uncertainty about getting to your ideal .
You may not be sure that public transportation will get you to a new friend 's house , but you know an automobile can .
Here is another graph :
David Reed points out that this is related to option theory .
You would be willing to pay very little for an option to have something that is unlikely to occur compared to the maximum potential value you would get if you exercised the option .
On the other hand , an option to get something that is very likely to happen would be worth much closer to the value of buying it with certainty .
The question with valuing an option is how do you know the likelihood of what will happen .
When you have a tool that you understand its applicable problem space well and that covers your desired area completely you can have greater certainty of success than a tool which you feel has a smaller applicable problem space and that is unlikely to work for many of the problems that you may need solved .
David points out that the key is having a tool whose design is such that you feel confident in knowing what it can be applied to and a problem space which you can understand the range of needs that must be met by such a tool .
So , general purpose tools that people understand are more likely to serve a longer part of the " tail " of potential future needs and also be valued higher because of such likelihood .
Must Haves
While interviewing ex -Palm Computing CEO Donna
Dubinsky last year , I asked her about the applications people came up with for use on the original Palm handheld and their effect on the success of the product ( starting at 2:30 in the recording ) .
What she said surprised me .
In addition to using one or more of the few " popular " built - in applications ( calendar , address / phone book , etc. ) , " ... rather than adding 3 - 5 applications [ to those existing built - in ones ] on a device , customers would find one that was compelling for them , and that to them was a make it or break it thing .
It might have been the stars and what the stars are , it might have been world traveler applications , or it might have been querying a detailed database at work , but there was always some additional compelling application for the Palm owner . "
That statement struck me as very special .
There are " must have " applications .
Good versions of the popular , everybody - needs - them applications were a minimal requirement ( and highly valued ) .
But people bought the Palm instead of some cheaper limited device that could only do those popular applications because they had at least one other niche application that made the increment in cost worth it .
More importantly , the Palm ( joined later by similarly customizable Pocket PC competitors ) became dominant beating out the cheaper , non-customizable devices .
The " must have " applications were often quite limited in their appeal and often labors of love , but they made the Palm a successful product .
So , it is n't just the number of potential items that 's of value , it 's the kind of items .
Some are of great value and their availability completely drives the purchase .
For example , in the late 1990's , many people in their 40's and 50's did n't use personal computers or email .
But when their children went away to college and email became a major form of communication available to stay in touch with those children , they got the computers , signed up for email , and started using it .
That one application got them started .
Once they were email users they would use it to communicate with people other than their children , but it was that one particular application ( communicating with a particular loved one ) that drove the purchase and adoption .
Applying this to the long tail So , now we have another graph :
The horizontal axis is the range of things you 'll want to do sorted by popularity .
The vertical axis is the value to a particular purchaser .
For the sake of argument , I 'll assume that in general the value of each item is reflected in its popularity .
For example , with PDAs , everybody wants a calendar application and an address / phone book .
What I 've added is the occasional item that is a " must have " .
These are of great value to the purchaser .
Think of telephones ( wired or wireless ) .
Lots of people need to call airline reservations at some point .
Fewer , but still many , need to call LL Bean .
Many in a city will need to call for concert ticket reservations .
Only those who live in the neighborhood will call a particular pizza restaurant .
Finally , only a very few will need to call a particular automobile service station and even fewer a particular individual .
However , there are some individuals ( my friends , relatives , etc. ) that I really , really want to talk to .
When my car is making some funny sound and I 'm about to start a long trip or when it breaks down I really want to talk to my car mechanic .
That 's why I pay for the phone service .
I do n't pay for it to just make calls to LL Bean or receive calls from a Verizon representative .
Much of my use is only of interest to me .
See my " What will people pay for ? " essay from July 2000 .
Now , let 's add the " must haves " that I do n't know about yet but can easily anticipate and want to be prepared for .
With the phone it includes friends I have n't met , future customers , and perhaps a doctor for a disease I have n't come down with yet .
Here 's the new graph :
If I 'm buying a system to meet this general area of need , how do different system architectures fit ?
Here are two types :
One is a restricted , special purpose system that meets the popular needs quite well .
It is of high value for those needs , but not for the others .
The other is a general purpose system that I know will meet many , many more of my current and potential needs .
It is of high value for a wider range .
As David Reed says , general purpose gives you more options and in the right cases more higher valued options because they are for the right kinds of high value potential uses .
Here 's the graph :
Another way to look at it :
I believe that for many areas , only products that serve both the left and right side of the graph -- providing popular applications / content as well as specific , niche ones -- will be successful in the long run .
The niches can be personal ( my family photos , for example ) , commercial ( internal - use - only corporate stuff ) , or by other means ( buyers of Pez dispensers ) .
I also believe that even when the general purpose system produces somewhat lesser value for those popular applications , the fact that it covers the " must have tail " more than makes up for that drop in value .
I 'll put up with the lower quality of the sound on a telephone over an FM - radio to listen to my friends rather than just professional radio personalities .
Many more people carry a cell phone with them than an FM radio , and they willingly pay much more for the phone .
Here is an example that has been in my thinking :
You have a cell phone that can receive video and display video .
Should it be tuned for the top 100 video feeds and make it hard or impossible to see the birthday videos of your grandkids or grandparents ?
Or should it let anybody inexpensively share content composed using any of the popular tools available ?
I maintain that given a choice , the latter products will win .
There will be some content you need ( for example , created by a loved one or on the topic of a hobby you are most passionate about ) that would only be available on the general purpose system , and you know it ( or will find out quickly when you find out it 's available ) .
It may be that the niche content is the reason you buy the product in the first place .
The conclusion So , here is my theory which I call " When The Long Tail Wags the Dog " :
In areas where results are often customized to people or situations and that can't be addressed directly in advance , such as when there is a high value to most users of at least some user - generated material , " open " general purpose systems that address all these niches will dominate .
I believe this helps explain the emergence of Internet email , cell phones , automobiles , and many other systems we take for granted today and is useful for evaluating systems and business models for the future .
Companies that develop closed systems that ignore generally created content and applications and that do n't take advantage of widespread " open format " content / application creating tools ( that is , those that produce output that is easily consumed by a wide range of different content - accessing or application running tools ) will be eventually wiped out by those that do .

War is hell .
But its worse when the Marines bring out their new urban combat weapon , the SMAW - NE .
Which may be why theyre not talking about it , much .
This is a version of the standard USMC Shoulder Mounted Assault Weapon but with a new warhead .
Described as NE — “ Novel Explosive ” - it is a thermobaric mixture which ignites the air , producing a shockwave of unparalleled destructive power , especially against buildings .
A post-action report from Iraq describes the effect of the new weapon : “ One unit disintegrated a large one - storey masonry type building with one round from 100 meters .
They were extremely impressed . ”
Elsewhere it is described by one Marine as “ an awesome piece of ordnance . “
It proved highly effective in the battle for Fallujah .
This from the Marine Corps Gazette , July edition : “ SMAW gunners became expert at determining which wall to shoot to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms . “
The NE round is supposed to be capable of going through a brick wall , but in practice gunners had to fire through a window or make a hole with an anti-tank rocket .
Again , from the Marine Corps Gazette :
“ Due to the lack of penetrating power of the NE round , we found that our assaultmen had to first fire a dual - purpose rocket in order to create a hole in the wall or building .
This blast was immediately followed by an NE round that would incinerate the target or literally level the structure . ”
The rational for this approach was straightforward :
“ Marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes , not homes .
The economic cost of house replacement is not comparable to American lives … all battalions adopted blast techniques appropriate to entering a bunker , assuming you did not know if the bunker was manned . ”
The manufacturers , Talley , make bold use of its track record , with a brochure headlined Thermobaric Urban Destruction . “
The SMAW - NE has only been procured by the USMC , though there are reports that some were ‘ borrowed ’ by other units .
However , there are also proposals on the table that thousands of obsolete M - 72 LAWs could be retrofitted with thermobaric warheads , making then into effective urban combat tools .
But in an era of precision bombs , where collateral damage is expected to be kept to a minimum , such massively brutal weapons have become highly controversial .
These days , every civilian casualty means a few more hearts and minds are lost .
Thermobaric weapons almost invariable lead to civilian deaths .
The Soviet Union was heavily criticized for using thermobaric weapons in Afghanistan because they were held to constitute “ disproportionate force , ” and similar criticisms were made when thermobarics were used in the Chechen conflict .
According to Human Rights Watch , thermobaric weapons “ kill and injure in a particularly brutal manner over a wide area .
In urban settings it is very difficult to limit the effect of this weapon to combatants , and the nature of FAE explosions makes it virtually impossible for civilians to take shelter from their destructive effect . “
So its understandable that the Marines have made so little noise about the use of the SMAW - NE in Fallujah .
But keeping quiet about controversial weapons is a lousy strategy , no matter how effective those arms are .
In the short term , it may save some bad press .
In the long term , its a recipe for a scandal .
Military leaders should debate human right advocates and the like first , and then publicly decide “ we do / do not to use X ” .
Otherwise when the media find do find out as they always do — not only do you get a level of hysteria but there is also the charge of covering up .
I ’m undecided about thermobarics myself , but I think they should let the legal people sort out all these issues and clear things up .
Otherwise you get claims of chemical weapons and violating the Geneva Protocol .
Which does n’t really help anyone .
The warfighter is left in doubt , and it hands propaganda to the bad guys .
Just look at what happened it last weeks screaming over white phosphorous rounds .
– David Hambling
THERE ’S MORE : Americans arent the only ones with these weapons .
The Chinese , the Russians — even guerilla groups — now have thermobarics ’ shockingly destructive power in their grasps .

Hudood laws can punish women for extra-marital sex
The bill would for the first time have allowed rapists to be tried under civil law as well as Islamic law .
But following complaints from Islamic and secular parties the government says it will now re-draft its proposals to create more of a consensus .
Rape is currently dealt with under the Hudood Ordinance , an Islamic law strongly criticised by women 's groups .
The government is trying its best to placate the mullahs
Human Rights Commission Pakistan Director IA Rehman
Send us your comments
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says that the government 's attempt to reform rape laws have suffered a setback amid growing controversy .
Our correspondent says those political parties which supported the original bill are furious and the Islamic parties are now demanding even more changes .
The government had already revised its original draft to satisfy strong opposition from Islamic parties , and critics accused it of rolling back the reforms to make it even harder for women to take action in rape cases .
Compromise
The Hudood Ordinance criminalises all sex outside marriage , so if a rape victim fails to present four male witnesses to the crime she herself could face punishment and be prosecuted for adultery .
The government says that makes it almost impossible to prosecute a rape case .
It proposed putting the offence of rape in the secular penal code where normal rules of evidence apply .
But it revised the bill because of strong opposition from Islamic parties .
A compromise draft was presented , which said that rape would fall under both Islamic and secular penal codes .
Human rights activists say this will create confusion , allowing powerful religious lobbies to manipulate what is seen as a weak judicial system .
The ethanol bubble has been bursting a bit lately .
I do n't say that with glee , because I hate to see people lose money , especially when it was due largely to misleading claims .
( I say that even though 95 % of the hate mail I get comes from ethanol investors ) .
I hope the end of the irrational exuberance we have seen in the ethanol market will lead to a more fact - based look at which technologies are needed to replace or supplement fossil fuels , and what technical challenges must be overcome before that happens .
There are certain things we can do to help ethanol along that I completely agree with .
Because of the great potential , I think we need to heavily fund cellulosic ethanol research .
I think we need to encourage the pursuit of closed - loop ethanol processes , like the one E3 Biofuels is building .
I have no problem with making most vehicles flex - fuel .
I do have a problem with requiring E85 pumps at some percentage of gas stations .
We can't even produce enough ethanol to roll out E10 nationwide , so why force gas stations to put in a lot of E85 infrastructure when we can't possibly produce the E85 to justify the expense ?
I also have a problem with forcing oil companies to pay for the pumps .
If ethanol producers insist on E85 pumps , they should be required to pay for their installation , since they are the ones who will primarily benefit from E85 sales .
While I support the production of more flex - fuel vehicles , the CAFE loophole for flex - fuel vehicles is appalling .
The government regulates fuel efficiency in the U.S. with Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency , or CAFE standards .
When the average fuel efficiency falls below a certain level for a car manufacturer , they must pay a penalty .
This provides an incentive for auto makers to produce fuel - efficient vehicles .
However , there are a couple of loopholes that have limited the effectiveness of the standard .
One is that light trucks have an exemption that allows them to get worse fuel efficiency without being penalized .
Because SUVs are classified as light trucks , there is an incentive for the auto maker to produce SUVs .
The good news is that the government recently passed legislation to close the loophole .
The bad news is that it does n't take place until 2011 , meaning we have 5 more years of gas - guzzling SUV sales to contend with .
While this loophole is being closed , another is being opened .
Did you wonder why automakers have embraced E85 ?
Have they suddenly gone " green " , and therefore E85 just seems like the right thing to do ?
No .
By making flex - fuel vehicles , they are able to exploit another loophole in the standards .
This loophole has recently been reported on in the press .
Car and Driver was the first to bring this to my attention in Tech Stuff : Ethanol Promises .
The article explains :
With fewer than 600 stations selling E85 fuel in 37 states , why have GM , Ford , and DaimlerChrysler been cranking out these flex - fuel vehicles by the millions ?
The answer is the mandatory Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards .
Federal law requires that the cars an automaker offers for sale average 27.5 mpg ; light trucks must achieve 22.2 mpg .
Failure to do so can result in substantial fines .
However , relief is available to manufacturers that build E85 vehicles to encourage their production .
The irony here is that although E85 in fact gets poorer fuel economy than gasoline , for CAFE purposes , the government counts only the 15 - percent gasoline content of E85 .
Not counting the ethanol , which is the other 85 percent , produces a seven - fold increase in E85 mpg .
The official CAFE number for an E85 vehicle results from averaging the gas and the inflated E85 fuel - economy stats .
Consumer Reports recently weighed in with The Ethanol Myth .
On the CAFE issue , they reported :
GM 's advertising says , " Energy independence ?
The answer may be growing in our own backyard , " and has coined the slogan " Live green , go yellow , " referring to the corn from which most U.S. ethanol is made .
DaimlerChrysler , Ford , and GM have said that they plan to double production of FFVs and other biofuel vehicles to 2 million by 2010 .
The FFV surge is being motivated by generous fuel - economy credits that auto - makers get for every FFV they build , even if it never runs on E85 .
This allows them to pump out more gas - guzzling large SUVs and pickups , which is resulting in the consumption of many times more gallons of gasoline than E85 now replaces .
With the loophole in place , their motto should be " Live green , go yellow , consume more fossil fuels . "
By all means , build flex - fuel vehicles .
But close this loophole , which may very well result in much higher gasoline consumption in the future .
Scientists discover wearing sunglasses can help beat jet lag
Scientists in Edinburgh have found that people can adjust their body clocks when travelling to different time zones by altering their light patterns .
Jet lag , which causes feelings of sleepiness and muscle inefficiency , is affected by the biological clock .
The study , conducted by Edinburgh Sleep Centre for British Airways , monitored more than 1,000 passengers .
Dr Chris Idzikowski , director of The Edinburgh Sleep Centre , said that without using sunglasses it took a day to recover for every hour of time difference travelled westwards .
It takes five days to recover from a five hour flight to New York from Britain and 50 per cent longer when flying eastwards
Dr Chris Idzikowski
Edinburgh Sleep Centre
He said : " The biological clock is 20,000 nerve cells in the brain , it is a physical thing and not made up like many people think .
" When passengers are travelling west it 's like a long day for the biological clock but when flying east , the clock tries to go into reverse which is obviously harder . "
Dr Idzikowski has drawn up a jet lag checker for passengers , which tailors the amount of time and when passengers are to wear sunglasses .
He added : " The internal body clock steps up at dawn which is when we can manipulate exposure to light , it 's a way of fooling the biological clock .
" I have used this technique on a flight but you have to be aware of immigration officials as they can ask you to take them off , which weakens the outcome . "
OUTREACH EFFORTS HELP MUSLIMS MAKE INROADS OUTREACH EFFORTS HELP MUSLIMS MAKE INROADS
Muslims in the USA might receive more favorable treatment if more Americans knew them .
In a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,007 Americans , 58 % said they had never met a Muslim .
And those who did know Muslims felt a lot better about them .
Ignorance about Islam and isolation from Muslims can only foment trouble , leaders in the Muslim community say .
Since 9/11 , Muslim groups have greatly expanded their outreach , offering educational seminars on their religion and cultural practices to audiences such as the police , private companies , hospital workers , teachers , students and therapists .
The Islamic Networks Group , which has affiliates in 12 states , received 1,500 invitations a year to present such programs before 9/11 ; now it 's about 4,000 a year , says president Maha ElGenaidi .
" People are more open to learning about us , and we want to tell them . "
In the past year , 30,000 Americans requested free Qurans offered by the Council on American - Islamic Relations , says Arsalan Iftikhar of the council .
Reading the Quran will help Americans understand and appreciate Islam , he says .
And many interfaith groups involving Muslims have formed in the past few years in cities as diverse as Boston , Syracuse , N.Y. , and Elyria , Ohio .
In Los Angeles , there are two " cousins clubs , " interfaith groups of Muslim and Jewish women , so named because they share a common ancestor , Abraham .
Participants read each others ' sacred texts , celebrate holidays together and learn about one another 's spiritual lives .
The women have become close , says Shayna Lester , co-founder of one of the groups .
" We find we have more likenesses than differences .
We no longer call each other cousins .
We call each other sisters . "
By Marilyn Elias Mona Amer Yale University USA 's Muslims under a cloud Motaz Elshafi , 28 , a software engineer , casually opened an internal e-mail at work last month .
The message began , " Dear Terrorist . "
The note from a co-worker was sent to Muslims working at Cisco Systems in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , a few days after train bombings in India that killed 207 .
The e-mail warned that such violent acts would n't intimidate people , but only make them stronger .
" I was furious , " says Elshafi , who is New Jersey - born and bred .
" What did I have to do with this violence ? "
PHOTO GALLERY : U.S. Muslims face stress in post -9/11 world Reports of such harassment and discrimination against Muslims are rising , advocacy groups say .
A USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,007 Americans shows strong anti-Muslim feeling .
And the hard feelings are damaging the mental health of U.S. Muslims , suggest new studies to be released at the American Psychological Association meeting starting Thursday in New Orleans .
Thirty - nine percent of respondents to the USA TODAY / Gallup Poll said they felt at least some prejudice against Muslims .
The same percentage favored requiring Muslims , including U.S. citizens , to carry a special ID " as a means of preventing terrorist attacks in the United States . "
About one - third said U.S. Muslims were sympathetic to al - Qaeda , and 22 % said they would n't want Muslims as neighbors .
Verbal harassment and discrimination correlate with worse mental health in studies of Muslims and Arab - Americans since 9/11 , says psychologist Mona Amer of Yale University School of Medicine .
In her new study of 611 adults , thought to be the largest ever done on Arab - Americans , they had much worse mental health than Americans overall .
About half had symptoms of clinical depression , compared with 20 % in an average U.S. group , Amer says .
Muslims , who made up 70 % of the study 's participants , had poorer mental health than Christians .
Those less likely to be depressed or anxious were people who kept their ethnic or religious ties but also had relationships with other people in the community .
And more Christians than Muslims lived this " integrated " lifestyle , Amer says .
Though Muslims said they wanted more contact with Americans of other religions , it may be easier for Arab Christians to integrate , Amer speculates .
" They share the mainstream religion .
Muslims may have different kinds of names or dress differently and , especially since 9/11 , they 're ostracized more . "
Bias leads to depression Virtually no mental health research was done on U.S. Muslims before 9/11 , so her findings can't be compared with earlier studies .
A new publication , the Journal of Muslim Mental Health , began publication in May , signaling concern about the growing problems and lack of research .
Many therapists are counseling more Arab - Americans and Muslims since 9/11 , Amer says .
Also , in surveys of Muslim spiritual leaders to be reported at the psychological association meeting , the imams report a surge in worshipers seeking help for anxiety and stress related to possible discrimination .
Reports of such abuses skyrocketed in the first six months after9 / 11 , fell in 2002 and have climbed again since the Iraq war began in 2003 , according to data kept by the Council on American - Islamic Relations , an education and advocacy group in Washington , D.C.
The number of assault and other discriminatory complaints filed with the group jumped from 1,019 in 2003 to 1,972 in 2005 , says Arsalan Iftikhar , national legal director .
Nobody knows what proportion of U.S. Muslims encounter discrimination ; even Muslims disagree .
" I do n't think there 's a Muslim out there who has n't felt some kind of fallout from 9/11 , " says Jafar Siddiqui , 55 , a real estate agent in Lynnwood , Wash .
" I myself have been invited to ' go home ' at least once a month . "
Siddiqui has been a U.S. citizen for 20 years .
Despite an increase in harassment since 9/11 , " many , many have not felt any discrimination , " says Farid Senzai , research director of the Detroit - based Institute for Social Policy and Understanding , a non-profit started four years ago to do research on Muslims .
Harassment charges claiming unreasonable arrest and detention have garnered the most publicity .
But discriminatory acts in everyday life — in shops , schools and at work — are reported about as frequently to the American - Islamic relations council .
Elshafi , who got the nasty e-mail at work , still wonders at the boldness of a person who would send such a note .
The sender was asked to apologize to several employees who filed complaints with Cisco 's human resources department , says Elshafi , who did n't file a complaint .
" We would n't confirm a specific internal incident on the record , " says Cisco 's Robyn Jenkins Blum , who adds , " It is Cisco 's policy not to tolerate artificial divisions or harassment of any individual . "
Elshafi , a worshiper at the local mosque , says he has received a lot of support from non-Muslim friends at work .
" After 9/11 , people would say , ' Do n't worry , ' Taz , we 've got your back . ' "
He says Muslims are not doing enough to educate people about their religious practices .
" We need to talk about our beliefs , know our neighbors . "
People such as Elshafi are least vulnerable to becoming depressed due to bigotry , says John Dovidio , a University of Connecticut psychologist and expert on prejudice .
" He gets strength from his group identity and support from the outside . "
Many are not nearly as fortunate .
Children of recent immigrants , women who wear the traditional head scarves or long robes and Iraqi - Americans often are n't faring as well , according to reports at the psychological association meeting .
In Seattle , Hate Free Zone Washington , an education and advocacy group , was launched five years ago to oppose backlash against local Muslims , Sikhs ( sometimes mistaken for Muslims ) and Arab - Americans .
" We 've seen an increase in bias - based harassment since 9/11 , " says Amelia Derr , the group 's education director .
Derr says she has seen some Muslim children so traumatized by violent bigotry that she wonders whether they 'll ever recover .
Last October , a Seattle high school junior who had faced verbal harassment was assaulted in gym class .
He suffered a hemorrhage behind his eye and a collapsed lung , Derr says .
" The good thing is that the student who did it was convicted of a hate crime . "
But the beaten boy wo n't go back to school , she says .
" He 's terrified .
You can see how damaged he has been .
He wo n't look you in the eye ; he just shrinks back .
He wo n't talk . "
The family came from Afghanistan four years ago , she says .
Even some who were born and raised in the USA feel their religious freedom has limits .
Jafumba Asad , 32 , of Tulsa stopped wearing the traditional dark robe after 9/11 .
" It 's bad enough just wearing a head scarf .
I get nasty stares every day .
Wearing full cover makes it harder to get a job .
It scares people , " says Asad , a community college teacher and graduate student .
Muslim women who wear head scarves are more likely than those who do n't to say they face discrimination and a hostile environment , according to a study to be presented at the psychological association 's meeting by Alyssa Rippy of the University of Tulsa .
The scarves make Muslim women stand out and could change behavior toward them , she suggests .
A few years ago , in a Wal - Mart parking lot , Asad says two men approached her and aggressively shouted " Y'all ought to be ( expletive ) locked up ! "
Pregnant at the time , she quickly backed away and then realized there were parked cars behind her .
" I felt trapped and very vulnerable .
I 'm pregnant .
I did n't know if they were going to get violent . "
Luckily , she says , they just walked away .
The mother of three girls says she developed ulcers a few months after 9/11 .
" I feel stressed a lot . "
In Rippy 's study , Muslim men were just as likely as women to report discrimination but more likely to become mistrustful and wary because of it .
That can encourage sticking with your own group , " which intensifies feelings of paranoia , " she says .
Iraq war 's fallout Men may back away more than women because they feel discrimination could have more serious consequences for them , for example being pegged as a terrorist or jailed , Rippy says .
The USA TODAY / Gallup Poll suggests Americans have greater fear of Muslim men than women : 31 % said they 'd feel more nervous flying if a Muslim man was on the plane ; 18 % said they'd be more nervous with a Muslim woman .
The poll , conducted July 28 - 30 , has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The Iraq war has made its mark on U.S. Muslims as well , psychologist Ibrahim Kira will say at the meeting .
In his study of Iraqi - Americans , the more time people spent listening to the radio and watching TV news about the war , the more likely they were to have post - traumatic stress disorder .
Many of them had relatives still in Iraq , and stress - disorder rates were high : 14 % compared with 4 % for the U.S. population , Kira says .
Tuning in to war news also correlated with more stress - related health problems , such as high blood pressure , headaches and stomach trouble , Kira says .
Although the war creates special problems for Iraqi - Americans , they also share a key challenge with other Muslims : lack of trust from people living here .
Many Americans clearly do n't trust those of the Muslim faith .
In fact , 54 % said they could n't vote for a Muslim for president in a June Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll .
That compares with 21 % who turned thumbs - down on an evangelical Christian and 15 % who would n't cast their ballot for a Jew .
Amer believes the world has changed for U.S. Muslims since Sept. 11 but says : " I do n't think Americans understand what 's happened .
Muslims have the same anxieties and anguish about terrorism as everyone else in the U.S.
At the same time , they 're being blamed for it .
They 're carrying a double burden . "

" Berlusconi has confirmed himself to be an uncouth and vulgar man , " the opposition bloc said in a statement .
" By using these ignoble and violent words , Berlusconi has thrown off the mask and shown himself for what he is : a person who uses the media like a thug and who lacks any respect for democracy , for institutions and for Italians . "
The latest of many outrageous remarks during the campaign came the day after he promised to wipe out council taxes for first homes during a bitterly contested television duel with his rival , Romano Prodi .
Mr Berlusconi also undertook to slash a levy on current account interest and , in a bid for female voters , promised to put more women in his next government , including as deputy prime minister .
Alessandra Mussolini , who is running for Parliament in Mr Berlusconi 's alliance , this week claimed that she would be given the job .
The most recent polls found the right was trailing by up to 5 percentage points and suggested 24 per cent of Italian voters were still " do n't knows " .
But leading pollster Renato Mannheimer said : " There are actually very few people who are undecided about who to vote for .
The issue is whether they vote or not . "
He said Mr Berlusconi was seeking to mobilise those who , if they could be persuaded to cast their vote , would cast it for him .
" And with this sort of remark , he could perhaps manage it , " Mr Mannheimer said .
Alberto Mancinelli , a lecturer in communications at Trento School of Management , said he believed that Mr Berlusconi 's language — the key word was " coglioni " , which literally translates as " testicles " — might rebound on him .
" It is so strong , he could lose points as a result , " Dr Mancinelli said .
Mr Berlusconi's outrageous comments during the campaign have ensured he remains the centre of attention .
This week a Milan newspaper reported that he had told a party meeting about a straw poll of sex chat lines he had conducted during a sleepless night .
" Seven out of nine of the young ladies who answered acknowledged they preferred me ( to Mr Prodi ) , " he was quoted as telling his followers .

A basic grasp of maths starts early
By the age of seven months infants have an abstract sense of numbers and are able to match the number of voices they hear with the number of faces they see .
The research could be useful in devising methods for teaching basic maths skills to the very young , say researchers in the US .
The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Look and listen
Adults can easily recognise the numerical equivalence between two objects they see and two sounds they hear .
Infants are smarter than we think
Dr Anna Franklin , Surrey Baby Lab
Kerry Jordan and Elizabeth Brannon of Duke University , Durham , North Carolina , played a video of two or three adult women strangers simultaneously saying the word " look " to babies aged seven months .
The videos were displayed on two monitors positioned side by side as the babies sat on a parent 's lap .
Audio tracks , synchronised with both videos , were played through a hidden speaker .
On average , the infants spent a significantly greater proportion of time looking at the display that matched the number of voices they heard to the number of faces they saw .
" Our results demonstrate that by seven months of age , infants can represent the equivalence between the number of voices they hear and the number of faces they see , " the scientists wrote .
" The parallel between infants ' and rhesus monkeys ' performance on the task is particularly striking . "
Numerical abilities
The research suggests that there is a shared system between infants before they learn to talk and non-verbal animals for representing numbers .
Understanding more about this system could be useful in devising methods for teaching basic maths skills to the very young .
" The study asks important questions about numerical abilities in infancy , " Dr Anna Franklin of the Surrey Baby Lab , Department of Psychology , University of Surrey , UK , told the BBC News website .
" The findings support the argument that young infants are capable of a wide range of mental operations and that infants are smarter than we think . "

Hobbes :
You 're going to juggle eggs ?
Calvin :
It 's a metaphor for life , Hobbes .
Each egg represents one of life 's concerns and the goal is to give each the appropriate amount of individual attention while simultaneously watching and guiding all the others .
Life is about balance and staying quick and alert as everything threatens to spin out of control !
Hobbes :
And sometimes we make a big mess of things .
Calvin :
But the important thing is persistance .
Sen .
Wyden 's pledge to " hold " any anti-net neutrality legislation that reaches the Senate floor might be raising some concern in the Senate leadership .
WASHINGTON , June 27 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens said on Tuesday he does not yet have the necessary votes to get legislation to overhaul communications laws through the full Senate .
. . .
Stevens told reporters he had not yet secured the 60 votes needed to end debate on the Senate floor , known as cloture , and set the measure for a final vote by the lawmakers .
" We have to get 60 votes , we do n't have them right now , " the Alaska Republican said after a daylong committee session for amending his proposed legislation .
He has predicted the panel would pass the bill .
Stevens said he would not likely get a commitment from Senate leaders to bring the measure to the floor until there was greater support and that the toughest issue facing senators was Internet service , known as Net neutrality .
" They 're not going to take a month on the floor on this bill , " Stevens said .
" Unless we can define a period of time that we get it done , we 'll not get it up ( on the Senate floor ) and that 's defined by 60 votes . "
However , that could just be Stevens 's way of letting the telcos know that they need to get out the checkbooks one more time .
It would be much better to win this fight in the Commerce Committee tomorrow , which can still happen if we hold all Democratic Senators and pick up one or two Republicans to support the Snowe / Dorgan amendment to the legislation .
Here are the Senators that Save the Internet says have n't stated a position on net neutrality .
If any of these Senators represent you , please take a few minutes tomorrow morning to call to request support for the Snowe / Dorgan amendment .

Niklas B considered himself lucky .
His dormitory at West Thomson - Friedman * University ( also known as WTFU ) was the first selected to participate in the campus - wide Wi-Fi Initiative .
This meant that he'd be able to take his laptop and work in the more - comfortable areas of the building instead of staying cramped up in his room .
Of course , like everything else at WTFU , the Wi-Fi Initiative did n't quite work like one might expect .
Connecting to the wireless network required tilting one 's laptop to a randomly - changing angle , waiting until the solar azimuth and winds were just right , and not only crossing one 's fingers on both hands , but crossing the arms over each other as well .
It was a bit inconvenient to say the least .
Achieving such low wireless performance is not an easy task , especially when using the commercial - grade wireless equipment that WTFU purchased .
Finding a proprietary wireless authentication application that manages to freeze any computer unlucky enough to drop the wireless signal is an even bigger challenge .
Thankfully , the cleverness of WTFU 's IT department knows no bounds .
They found the perfect location for the dormitory 's high - powered wireless router : the basement kitchen .
It may not be clear from the picture , but that particular corner hosts six microwaves , a freezer , a refrigerator , and , of course , the router .
The rest of the room is chock full of electrical appliances from a sandwich maker to a blender .
Granted , the router is able to cope with electrical noise from the appliances , but its signal loses heftily to the 2.4 Ghz - radition spewed from a single microwave .
The fact that there are six of them should give you a good idea of just how popular the microwaves are .
Niklas B mentioned this problem quite a few times and they eventually moved the router to the other side of the wall , a full eighteen inches through an open door from its previous location .
Obviously , that does n't help in the least with the connectivity problem , but it did solve one other .
Before the move , the six microwaves , freezer , refrigerator , and wireless router were all on the same circuit .
Since the breaker trips several times a week ( imagine that ! ) , the router would get taken offline with everything else .
The good news is that , now , they have a good hour or two of wireless connectivity before maintenance comes to open the breaker .

Sounds implausible , I know .
But how else do you explain this FCC ruling ( from September — I missed it until now ) :
The Federal Communications Commission thinks you have the right to use software on your computer only if the FBI approves .
No , really .
In an obscure “ policy ” document released around 9 p.m. ET last Friday , the FCC announced this remarkable decision .
According to the three - page document , to preserve the openness that characterizes today ’s Internet , “ consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice , subject to the needs of law enforcement . ”
Read the last seven words again .
The FCC did n’t offer much in the way of clarification .
But the clearest reading of the pronouncement is that some unelected bureaucrats at the commission have decreeed that Americans do n’t have the right to use software such as Skype or PGPfone if it does n’t support mandatory backdoors for wiretapping .
( That interpretation was confirmed by an FCC spokesman on Monday , who asked not to be identified by name .
Also , the announcement came at the same time as the FCC posted its wiretapping rules for Internet telephony . )
Throwing a party for many people does n’t have to be hard .
It may even be very fun !
Whether you are preparing a casual birthday party , a sophisticated Christmas dinner or even a wedding !
The most important thing is to plan it all beforehand !
We present you several essential tips to throw any kind of party .
First , the party ’s planning
Decide what kind of party works best for you and for your guests ; it cab be a cocktail , a buffet , a formal dinner , an informal dinner , etc .
Plan the menu .
Make your shopping list .
Make an inventory of everything you need to cook and serve : recipients , pans , bowls , plates , cutlery , napkins , glasses , etc .
Tips for the party
For an informal , quick and easy party , keep it all simple .
Buy some snacks , cold meats , pickles , olives , cheese , bread , salty cookies , toasts , lettuce , tomato , rucula , carrot , fruit and sauces and prepare some salads and snacks .
For a cocktail party , the most important things are the drinks , so you must have a very varied bar , not only with alcoholic drinks , but also with non alcoholic drinks .
Depending on the guests , you should have more than one bar , so that people wo n’t have to form lines .
Make sure the Hors D’ouevres do n’t end before time .
The tables and the chairs should be sufficient enough , making sure there are chairs for , at least , half the guests .
It is important that you promote the sociability between guests and for that you will have to make them circulate , placing several drinks and food ’s points .
Do you feel especially ambitious ?
Then add some more elaborate dishes to the menu , that can be prepared a day or two beforehand , that can be heated on that day , or even served cold .
There are several dishes ( like stews , soups and roasted meats ) which are perfect to heat on the spot and that can be served with only a salad .
To the main dish you may also add a previously made dessert , like a pie or a cake , to which you may add a bit of ice - cream or some fruit .
Before going shopping or starting to prepare things , organise your refrigerator in order to save the previously made foods and everything else you might need .
Offer your guests dishes with a lot of vegetables , cereals and fruits … it is important that you always thing about a balanced diet .
If you are thinking about serving a buffet , then you should plan the control of the crowd .
It all goes best if you divide the food in small plates and if you have it all already sliced .
Organise your guests , setting the table .
If you are organising a buffet or an informal dinner with a single table , organise yourselves from left to right , place the plates , the napkins , the cutleries and the bread ; then place the salad , the main dish and the sauces .
At the end , place the glasses and the drinks .
The dessert can be placed on the table for decorative effects or at the end of the main meal .
I you are serving a buffet , make some small card to identify the dishes .
Also in the case of a buffet , you can wrap the cutleries in napkins and place them in a basket so that your guests can easily take them .
Always prepare a selection of items than can be served at room temperature .
If you do so , you do n’t have to worry with the hot first courses that might get cold , or with the cold dessert that is melting down .
Always have a lot of ice at hand !
Prepare the table beforehand , before the guests arrive .
For an easy access to a good presentation , place the spices in small recipients , all placed at the same area .
Have some plastic bags and Tupperwares to place the remains .
Make sure the places for garbage are perfectly evident .
Do not use your glasses , teapots or even silver trays to serve or only to drink , animate your creativity and use them to place flowers and decorate the place with joy .
Using candles for decoration is great to create a good ambience , but it also helps neutralising the food and the smoke ’s odours .
Knowing how to control the portions

In 1945 , the German submarine U - 864 was on its way to deliver mercury for weapons production to war - time ally Japan , when it was torpedoed off Norway 's western coast .
All of the 73 men on board went down with the U - boat , as did the steel containers filled with 65 - tonnes of weapons - grade mercury .
The Norwegian Navy spent years looking for the submarine .
They finally located it in 2003 , lying in 150 meters of water near the island of Fedje , some 70 km from Bergen .
Over the next three years , the coastal authority conducted field studies looking at how best to deal with the ecological time - bomb ticking in the North Sea .
Contaminated ocean
Speaking to DW - WORLD .DE , Ane Eide Kjeras , a spokesperson with the Norwegian Coastal Administration , said the sea bed surrounding the wreck was " heavily contaminated " with mercury .
There was also " a low but increasing level of mercury in fish and sea food , " she said .
Fishing is banned within a one kilometer zone around the wreck
Not only is mercury a danger to marine life , it can also pose a hazard to humans who eat the contaminated sea food .
The Norwegian Coastal Administration has now recommended hermetically sealing off the submarine and surrounding silt in a layer of sand , gravel and concrete -- an underwater version of the Chernobly nuclear reactor .
There are several good reasons not to attempt to salvage the U - boat , Kjeras said .
" When divers tried to dig into the keel of the U - boat , the wreck started to move because the ground there is very unstable , " Kjeras said .
" There was also crack in the keel so we are afraid to salvage the U - boat in case it splits and all of the mercury spills into the ocean . "
WWII weapons on board
And then there is also the danger that the World War II submarine is still armed .
" We have to assume there were at least a couple of torpedoes on board , " said Kjeras , adding that the Norwegian Army were closely involved in the investigation .
" They advised us that the danger of the torpedoes going off is much larger if you try to lift the wreck , " Kjeras told DW - WORLD .DE .
The Norwegian government has n't decided on the exact details of how to seal off the submarine .
They also are n't revealing any details of the estimated project costs .
But if the measure is passed by parliament , it could begin as early as next summer .
The award winning Canadian documentary ' The Corporation ' has been released on BitTorrent for free .
Filmmaker Mark Achbar just released an updated " official " torrent of it .
Everyone is free to download , watch , discuss , and share it .
The Corporation received more than 20 awards , including an audience award at the the prestigious Sundance Film Festival .
The Film gives insight into the inner workings of large and powerful corporations , and how these affect our society .
The new torrent download includes a high - quality rip of the master DVD and a 40 minute interview with Joel Bakan , the author of the book and writer of the film .
Mark Achbar actually dedicated a computer in his garage to do nothing but seed .
Although the torrent download is free , the filmmakers encourage people to donate a small fee if they like what they see .
We asked Mark Achbar how the first round of donations went .
He said , “ since my initial torrent launch of The Corporation at the end of August , there have been $ 635.00 in contributions .
They ranged from $ 2 to three very generous gifts of $ 100 each .
All are very much appreciated . ”
The makers of “ The Corporation just launched a Campaign for Corporate Harm Reduction ( C4CHR ) in collaboration with Hellocoolworld.com .
The purpose of this campaign is to collect stories about the impact of the film , asking people what they did , or something they ’ve heard happened as a result of the film .
“ We want to create a feedback loop on the “ what you can do ” front , and perhaps turn it into a book .
The torrent is a great way to stay in touch with people about our current activities Achbar ” Achbar explained .
He added , “ my only regret is that I did n’t put up my own torrent sooner . ”

Porn makes sperm better swimmers ABC Science Online
Pornography involving a woman alone or multiple women does n't have the same effect .
Evolutionary biologist Professor Leigh Simmons of the
This occurs when semen quality increases according to the perceived risk of another male fertilising a female .
" Males ejaculate more sperm , or sperm of better quality , when the risk of sperm competition [ the probability that a female will mate with more than one male ] is high , " Simmons writes in the journal
Simmons says his research now shows that just looking at an image of another man in action is enough to register as a case of sperm competition , causing a compensatory adjustment in the viewer 's semen .
" Our data show that image content can have an impact on men's semen quality , " he says .
" We show that ... human males viewing images depicting sperm competition had a higher percentage of motile [ efficiently moving ] sperm in their ejaculates . "
Putting it to the test
Simmons says previous Australian research sparked his interest in exploring this twist on sexual selection .
These studies show sperm counts are higher if men are given pornographic material before in - vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) procedures .
Psychological studies also show that when men look at pornography depicting more than one person they prefer to see at least one more man .
" It seems that men like to see other men in these images , " he says .
To test the theory , 52 heterosexual men aged 18 to 35 were shown two images over two separate days .
One showed three women , the other a woman with two men .
Masturbatory samples of their sperm were then tested for the number of sperm per millilitre of ejaculate and sperm motility , or ability to swim , which is associated with the ability to fertilise an egg .
" We tested the evolutionary hypothesis that the men who viewed those sort of mixed sex images should have a higher semen quality if it was stimulating some innate evolved response to competition , " he says .
" We found men viewing images containing both men and women had higher sperm motility in masturbatory ejaculate compared to men who were viewing images of just women alone . "
It was not clear how pornography affected sperm count , he says .
A new fertility aid ?
Simmons says the study needs replicating and it's too early to say whether looking at images of group sex involving men could be a useful tool in aiding fertility .
Other lifestyle factors are involved in fertility , he says , such as avoiding alcohol and drugs .
Dr Kylie de Boer , embryology director at Sydney IVF , says men involved in assisted reproduction are routinely provided with " light pornography " to assist them in producing semen .
But she doubts that viewing pornography , of any kind , would have a major impact on a man 's ability to fertilise an egg .
" It 's to help them with their arousal in what can be a stressful situation , " she says .
" The man 's general health would perhaps be a more important factor in what [ the quality of his sperm ] is like . "
Looking at pornographic images of men and women together can increase the quality of a man 's sperm , a new study suggests .
Pornography involving a woman alone or multiple women does n't have the same effect .

Q : ' Buried ' in debt , can he dig out ?
USA TODAY , in partnership with ABC News , is exploring the issues of being young and in debt in a six - week series that began Monday , Nov. 20 .
We 've paired five twentysomethings with members of the Financial Planning Association who are lending advice .
And we 're offering tips for managing debt , cutting expenses and saving .
Follow the entire series and find online tools and resources at youngdebt.usatoday.com .
Remember when you were sent to the principal 's office in high school and were threatened : " This will go on your permanent record " ?
Remember your relief when you realized that a school day 's discipline report did n't really follow you all through life ?
Well , Todd Townsend has learned that there is , in fact , a permanent record .
It 's called a credit score .
And his is n't very good .
VIDEO : Todd 's life with mom Darsie
Two years after graduating with a degree in theater from St. Lawrence University in Canton , N.Y. , Townsend , 25 , finds himself loaded with student debt and working at a job that does n't pay enough to make the payments .
He earns $ 10.50 an hour as a concierge for a lodge in the Lake Placid , N.Y. , area .
His student debt totals $ 47,000 .
After graduating from St. Lawrence in 2004 , Townsend headed West to attend the Art Institute of Colorado in Denver .
There , he racked up more debt .
Then he decided to follow his dream to be an actor and moved to New York City to find work .
He lasted 4 ½ months .
" I lived like an animal , " he says of his big - city life , spent eating ramen noodles and absorbing job rejections .
Like thousands of young people , he retreated to safety : Mom 's house .
In fact , 19 % of the twentysomethings polled recently by USA TODAY said they had moved back with their parents .
" It was a good financial decision " to move back home , Townsend says .
Still , he 's the first to recognize that " girls do n't think it 's sexy . "
Now , Townsend 's dreams of entering the theater world are being deferred .
" I graduated from a great school with honors , and I 'm not using the degree at all , " he says .
" Schools do n't prepare you for the real world . "
Townsend remembers his first day as a freshman when , " You got a meal card , your class schedule and a credit card application , " he says .
" I was 18 years old .
I did n't know it was wrong . "
Every one of his college friends , Townsend says , got a credit card and ran up debt to the limits .
He did , too .
Townsend also signed promissory notes for college loans without really understanding the terms .
Now , he 's stuck with a variable loan at 14.25 % interest .
" I kept accruing loans and interest on the loans , and I found myself buried , " he says .
At the moment , Townsend 's happy to be earning a steady paycheck , and he 's paying a minimum amount of rent and utilities to his mother .
It 's not free ?
" She loves me , " he says .
" But not that much . "

Royal Navy to allow devil worship
Devil warship : Type 22 frigate , HMS Cumberland QUICKVOTE
Should devil worship be granted the same status in the armed forces as established religions ?

What is this ?
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A devil - worshipping sailor in the Royal Navy has become the first registered Satanist in the British Armed Forces .
Chris Cranmer , 24 , a technician serving on the Type 22 frigate Cumberland , has been officially recognized as a Satanist by the ship 's captain .
That allows him to perform satanic rituals aboard and permits him to have a non-Christian Church of Satan funeral should he be killed in action .
A spokesman for Britain 's Ministry of Defence told CNN Sunday that it had a duty to allow members of the forces to practice their religion .
He added that the MoD was an " equal opportunities employer " which did not stop anyone having their own religious values .
" The Royal Navy allows this kind of approach because it is clearly in line with current regulations .
We are not aware of any other individuals who want to be registered as Satanists . "
Cranmer , 24 , who comes from Edinburgh , Scotland , is now lobbying the Ministry of Defence to make Satanism a registered religion in the Armed Forces , says Britain 's Sunday Telegraph .
He says he wants Satanists to be able to join the military without " fear of marginalisation and the necessity to put up with Christian dogma . "
The defense ministry told CNN that Cranmer went to his commanding officer with a request to practice his beliefs on board his ship and , after consultation with the ship 's chaplain , this was granted .
The decision was at the discretion of the captain , the MoD , said , and was on the basis that it did not impinge on the operational effectiveness , safety or security of the ship , or the well - being of colleagues .
Tour of duty
Cranmer , who has been aboard the Cumberland 's tour of duty in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf since April , said that being registered as a Satanist gave him " the freedom of religion I wanted despite its controversial nature " .
Cranmer , who is single , has been in the Royal Navy for four years and was promoted leading hand -- the naval equivalent of corporal -- in July last year .
He told the newspaper that he realized he was a Satanist nine years ago when he " stumbled across " The Satanic Bible by American ' Black Pope ' Anton Szandor LaVey .
" I then read more and came to realize I 'd always been a Satanist , just simply never knew . "
He added that he had been " warmly congratulated " by his friends and family for becoming the Armed Forces ' first Satanist but did not feel that the war in Iraq was " the Devil 's work . "
" From a military perspective , I believe in vengeance .
I do n't consider Satan to be an intelligently external force in my life ; instead I consider it an empowering internal force .
" If I were asked if I were evil , I would say yes -- by virtue of the common definition .
However , if you asked my family and friends you would hear a resounding ' no ' .
I get a massive amount from my career . "
Satanic rules
The Church of Satan was established in San Francisco in 1966 and LaVey was its high priest until his death in 1997 .
Members of the church , which rejects Christian ideas of God and the Devil , follow 11 " Satanic Rules of the Earth . "
The belief system has been condemned as a cult by some religious groups and at least one opposition politician expressed dismay after Cranmer won permission to practice Satanism aboard a Royal Navy ship .
" I am utterly shocked by this , " Conservative parliamentarian Anne Widdecombe told Reuters .
" Satanism is wrong .
Obviously the private beliefs of individuals anywhere including the armed forces are their own affair but I hope it does n't spread , " she said .
Ver0.159あたりから以前のコードがコンパイルできないほどの仕様変更が頻繁に起こったD言語も昨日ついに1.00となり、今後はコンパイルできないほどの仕様変更は2.xxbに入ることになる。
そう信じたい 。
そうすると、自分のコードを同じ言語に移植するハメになったり、使っているライブラリまでコンパイルできなくなってしまって、しかもいつまでたってもオフィシャル版が更新されないものだから、自分でパッチを作るべきか待つべきかを数日間悩むことになるような事態もすべてなくなるというわけだ。
最近は自宅でC言語ばかりを使っているものだから、ああD言語は本当によかった――なんて過去を振り返ることが多く、そんなときにVer1.00リリースのニュースを聞くとつい飛びついてしまいそうだし、実際飛びつこうとしてどういう準備がいるかを昨夜考えていた。しかし、自らの過ちも含めD言語恐怖症気味なってしまった俺が、そうなった理由というのは単に言語仕様の変更だけではなかったことを思い出したので、各恐怖項目について再考する必要があった。
そんなような悩みリスト。
GCの挙動が想像およびドキュメントに書かれている本当に素晴らしい感動の内容と違う
有志によるライブラリの開発が突然停滞する
連想配列がなんか怪しい（謎、定期的にrehashしていないとassertすることがある、スレッドは関係なかった）
Threadクラスがなんか怪しい（たぶんstate変数でレースコンディションが発生している）
1は、かの有名な大きめのメモリが回収されないという問題。参照してないつもりでも偶然ポインタにキャストするとアドレスが一致するデータがbyte配列内にあると回収されなくなる。byte配列なんて存在ない場合でも、phobosのUnicodeテーブルが参照していることになっていたりする。なので大きめのメモリを確保する場合は、明示的にdeleteすることを初めから意識してdelete用のラッパークラスなどを作っておかないと後で大変なことになる（初めにポエニーはメモリが増え続けてマシンごと止まることになり、その後のテキトウなdelete追加によってアクセス違反のバグが多発した……これは俺のせい）。ここで、「大きめってどれくらい？」という疑問が出てくるが、それは確率の問題になるのでなんともいえないのがまた怖い。ようはアドレスの範囲が広いほど参照が外れた後に偶然参照される（されている）確率が高いという理由から『大きめ』であって、少しでもその確率があるのなら実稼動三年後に偶然ヒットしてしまい永久に回収されないメモリがでてくる可能性はある。さらにMD5ハッシュ値の配列や暗号化されたデータブロックなどポインタにキャストするとランダムな数値になりがちなデータが多いと偶然参照したことになる確率がぐっと高くなる。超怖い。
また、GC#minimizeが実装されていないので、一度確保したメモリはOSに返却されることがない。たとえば、DWTでは16*16のアイコンに透明色を設定するたびに約70MBづつメモリを確保するので、アプリ起動時に二つのPNGアイコンを初期化すると、その後アプリは140MBのメモリを確保したままになる。ユーザーからの「メモリ使用量が多すぎる」という文句が超怖い（HovenではOSのalloc/freeを使うようにDWTにパッチしている）。
これらは常駐しないソフト（コマンドやCGIなど)では、気にかけなくてもいいと個人的には思っている。何日間も動くようなデーモン的なプログラムでは気にかけたほうがいい。たとえば、ウェブサーバーを作ったときは数日間は自動リクエストを投げ続けてメモリが増え続けていないかをチェックしたほうがいいだろう。
2は商用じゃないことがそもそもの原因だと思うが、今回のVer1.00のリリースによって更新停滞することは減るはずだ。そもそもバグ以外での更新が必要なくなる。切実にそう信じたい。
3と4はよくは調べていないのでGC関係や言語仕様の変更で被害妄想気味だった俺の思い違いかもしれないが、もしなにかあったときには最悪自分で作ればいいやレベルなので、あまり気にかけない。それにPhobosまだ開発中だからこれからよくなってくるに決まっている、きっと。個人的には、スレッドなんかは元が貧弱なので、std.c.linux.pthreadとWin32APIで、もっと強力なマルチスレッドライブラリを作ったほうがいいんじゃないかと思っているし、連想配列もスレッドセーフじゃないからマルチスレッド環境で使いやすいテンプレートライブラリを作ったほうがいいんじゃないかなんて思っている。スレッドはaprをメモリプールなしで移植するのが早いかななんて。
これら もVer1.00のおかげで安心して開発できるようになった。
そんなわけで、D言語は賢い言語マニアな人たちの遊び道具であってまじめにソフトを作ろうとする人たちの道具ではないと考え始めていた自称まじめにソフトを作ろうとする俺に残された課題はGC周りだけになった。そのGCもポエニーでえらい苦労したおかげでなんとなくどうすればいいか解ってきている。
パフォーマンスも考えてループ内で確保し続けるメモリはリソースプールをかます（自主管理）
それ以外の大きめのメモリは明示的にdeleteする
特に巨大なメモリはOSのalloc/freeを使い自主管理する
各スレッドで定期的にgc.fullCollectを呼ぶ（これが汚いか……）
以上。
これでDが自分でも使える言語として戻ってきた。Javaと比べてどうかというと、まだJavaのほうが信頼性があるしライブラリも充実しているから正直Javaかなーなんて思ってしまう。しかし、もしもDにJava並みのライブラリが充実してくるなら迷わずＤを選ぶね。
でも、今はまだ悩む……。
君は勘違いしてる！ という話があったら教えてください。
Yesterday Amazon ’s new S3 service served up nothing but service unavailable messages for nearly 7 hours .
I give Amazon full credit for hopping on their user forums last night and letting us know that they were working on it and letting us know when it was fixed .
At the same time I ’m a little frustrated that such an outage occured so early on in the history of the service .
The whole point of S3 is to treat storage like a utility , metered in gigabyte - hours and gigabytes of data transfered , much like you would treat your water or electricity service .
How mad would you be if the power company turned off your power for several hours without warning , or if you woke up in the morning to find that you could n’t take a shower ?
Pretty mad I imagine .
I was just a little bit annoyed last night because my flickr backup was n’t working .
I could n’t have retrieved anything from S3 if I had wanted to , but thankfully I did n’t need ( or want ) to .
What if I were building out a Carson - style startup using S3 for storage ?
That would have been 7 hours of downtime for my app too .
Hopefully the beta testers were n’t too pissed off .
Hopefully I was n’t showing a demo of it to anyone .
Now might be a good time to read the Amazon Web Services Licensing Agreement and specifically the section on Amazon S3 .
You ’ll note that there are n’t any guarantees about availability or uptime .
You ca n’t count the nines in their SLA .
I know that Amazon strives to keep S3 and their other web services up as much as possible , and over time they have done an extellent job at it .
S3 is still very young and I ’m sure that they ’re tweaking and improving the service on the fly all the time .
This incident is by means an indication of long term stability .
Just remember that there are no guarantees .
Update : Amazon continues to keep communication channels open and are taking strides to make sure that this does n’t happen again .
David Barth writes :
A short note to let you know that we are taking the outage this weekend very seriously , and that once things calm down here we will post something to this thread letting you know what steps we will be taking in the future to ensure this does n’t happen again .
Update : David Barth gives us a more detailed update :
We were taking the low - load Saturday as an opportunity to perform some maintenance on the storage system , specifically on some very large ( > 100 million objects ) buckets in order to obtain better load - balancing characteristics .
Normally this procedure is entirely transparent to users and bucket owners .
In this case , the re-balancing caused an internal transit link to become flooded , this cascaded into other network problems , and the system was made unavailable .

At last , the truth can now be told .
In our latest report , The Heterosexual Agenda : Exposing The Myths , we examine the statistics and the case studies that dispel many of the myths about heterosexuality .
No longer satisfied with “ mere acceptance ” by our society , heterosexual political pressure groups have launched a well - planned , well - financed campaign , which , if left unchecked , threatens to destroy the most fundamental structures of American society .
This report considers the implications of the heterosexual agenda ( both overt and hidden ) , the problems it has already caused and its potentially disasterous results for society .
In The Heterosexual Agenda : Exposing The Myths , you will learn how :
heterosexual militants have embarked on a systematic assault on American values ;
heterosexual activists plan on recruiting your children into their lifestyle ;
heterosexuals are undermining traditional marriage ;
heterosexuals are undermining the health and safety of society ;
violence has become a hallmark of the heterosexual lifestyle ;
heterosexuals are intent on eventually recriminalizing all freedoms of expression for gay men and women .
( It ’s already happening in Zimbabwe , Nigeria , and throughout the Middle East where the heterosexual agenda is well advanced . )
Here is where the buck stops — no hype , no exaggeration , no fear - mongering — just the facts .
Whether you are personally impacted by heterosexuality or simply concerned about this controversial issue , you will be informed and challenged by The Heterosexual Agenda : Exposing The Myths .

And while you ’re at it , do n’t miss our companion report , How To Write An Anti-Gay Tract In Fifteen Easy Steps .
First , let me wish Your Excellency a very happy and prosperous new year .
I am Sugato Mitra , a 41 year old man from Durgapur in West Bengal .
As a very ordinary citizen of this great nation , I consider it an immense privillege of mine to be presented with an opportunity to answer a question which happens to cross the mind of someone who is not only the Honourable President of India but also happens to be one of the greatest intellectual minds of this country .
A look at the very elementary picture of terrorism reveals certain things :
1 . A handful of immensely wealthy , influential and powerful people provide the leadership .
In many instances they lead a justifiable movement .
In an equal number of instances they have a personal axe to grind in the garb of mass movement .
Some of them are prepared to come out and discuss their grievances .
Others prefer to remain away from the public eye .
2 . The foot soldiers are almost invariably youth of impressionable minds .
It is also commonly seen that they come from ordinary or poor families .
The governments of different countries faced with the problem of terrorism has to do some serious and honest soul searching .
The discussion below , tries to combine the aforesaid two aspects in an effort to find a solution to terrorism .
The question of origin of the terrorist movement has to be addressed first .
Why did a terrorist movement arise ?
Was it because a certain section of the population justifiably demanded something , but was denied the same ?
In that case , how does the fulfillment of their demands fit into the overall national interest ?
If conceding to their justified demand does not affect national interests adversely , there is no harm in agreeing to them .
But if those are contrary to the overall national interests then there is no question of conceding .
But the issue should be considered objectively and impartially .
This seems to be particularly pertinent in the Kashmir problem .
Here we see not only Kashmiris demanding their own independent homeland , but also a neighbouring country abetting the terrorist movement against India .
Here Pakistan clearly has an axe to grind and in all probabilities ultimately want to annexe Jammu and Kashmir .
Pakistan and all Pakistan sponsored Kashmiri leaders should be firmly ignored in solving the problem .
The Government of India should address the people of Kashmir directly , especially the Kashmiri youth .
The message should ring loud and clear : we want our Kashmiri brothers and sisters to be with us now and forever .
India does n't want to bribe Kashmiris with special concessions to be a part of this country .
India wants every Kashmiri to be equal partners in the country 's progress to prosperity .
Every effort should be made to initiate progress in J&K through setting up of institutes of excellence and modern industries .
The mind of the Kasmiri youth should be weaned away from the narrow confines of terrorism and divisiveness and exposed to modern liberal thinking through these institutes .
When he or she is adequately trained , there should be adequate modern industries where he or she can put his hand on modern machines and applications .
Hopefully , the Kashmiri youth will thereafter forsake the gun and terrorism and separatism as his or her aspirations in life , which are no different from any other normal youth , marches towards the path of fulfilment .
Terrorism and its associated perils will be an unviable option compared to the peace and tranquility of a normal human life .
The same approach needs to be implemented in North East India as well .
Development should be the dominant ingredient in the government 's efforts to tame terrorism .
Development for the masses , especially the youth and harsh repressive measures for the handful of masterminds can adequately tame terrorism .
Your Excellency , as you have rightly pointed out , the human population is growing and scarce natural resources are under pressure .
If a system of equitable distribution could be worked out , it would leave greater number of people satisfied .
But sadly this does n't happen practically with the result that a lot of us feel deprived and aggrieved .
This is particularly relevant to India and its exploding population .
If the pressure of population on resources decreased , attrition would lessen consequently and quality of life of the average Indian improve considerably .
That would also mean a drastic reduction in terrorist activities and chances thereof .
Population control in India should not only be a slogan but a visible and effective national movement .
Adding to our woes , powerful nations want to corner a major share of the scarce natural resources .
Terrorism originating from the Middle East has its roots in Western countries trying to control and corner the oil reserves located there .
Kuwait was attacked by Iraq for its oil .
The US started the Gulf War against Iraq to free Kuwait .
And now Iraq is the latest hotbed of terrorism .
Of course there is the Palestinian problem as a direct consequence of Israel 's occupation .
Israel can not be wished away , but it is Israel 's responsibility to be the initiator of peace in the region with meaningful and acceptable efforts .
The UN of late has unfortunately come out as a pretty ineffective forum to implement peace .
It has to be made effective .
India is aspiring for a permanent seat in the Security Council .
If she succeeds , India should hopefully provide solutions to end attritions accross the world and end terrorism .
But right now responsible nations must unite against terrorism .
The group should not only be composed of nations facing this threat , but also those still out of its tentacles .
Terrorism should be tackled globally and not individually .
When the World Trade Center came crashing down , the whole world condemned .
But sadly , such reactions of universal solidarity are seen when terrorism kills innocents in India .
Sanity and responsibility are still dominant in the world .
The need of the hour is unity of sane and right thinking people cutting across national barrier and ideologies .
When they unite , greedy and aggressive regimes will be forced to take a backseat .
Let there be greater exchanges between the youth of all countries who want peace in their own country and also internationally .
Let ideas flow freely .
Voices should be raised when a powerful nation tries to bully a weak nation into submission and thereby open another front for terrorism .
Such nations , however powerful , should be shunned by one and all .
And let the condemnation be equally loud and clear when terrorism strikes and kills innocents .
A check on the population growth , quality education and living standards , development and employment opportunities for the youth and respect for humanity and universal human values will ultimately wipe out terrorism one day .
This may appear Utopian right now .
But I am optimistic of seeing this day arrive soon .
And with this fervent hope , Your Excellency , I end my humble submssion .
Microsoft has released an extension that allows IronPython to be used with ASP .
NET .
More importantly , they have created a route for other dynamic languages to tie into the ASP .
Net framework .
According to David Ebbo of Microsoft , the primary reason why dynamic languages such as IronPython could n't be used with ASP .
Net is that they do n't support static typing .
ASP .
Net relies heavily on CodeDOM , which assumes " that any language used for ASP .
NET has the ability to produce true classes in the .NET Framework sense — that is , classes that are in on - disk assemblies and that can be loaded using standard APIs like Type.
GetType . "
This means that any dynamic language that wanted to support ASP.
NET would have to be extended .
Microsoft solved this problem by turning off page compiling and using a custom PageParserFilter .
This routes some of the python code through a new base class called ScriptPage and the rest through controls .
A similar mechanism is used for user controls and master pages .
And because the pages do n't need to be compiled , the usual first - time hit will be significantly less .
A variant of the application file is supported , as well as an App_Script directory ( replaces App_Code , and HTTP handlers .
Web services are not supported , as they require language features not available in most dynamic languages .
Currently ASP.NET does n't scale well when too many unique pages are created .
The cost to compile , load , and manage all of the page specific assemblies can seriously stress the server .
Since dynamic pages eliminating the need to create an assembly for each page , there is no theoretical limit on the number of unique pages .
Runtime performance is expected to be nearly the same as C# .
While late - bound code is slower , most of the processing time is spent in the framework code rather than the user code .

What do charities need most ?
Volunteers
Awareness
Why do you give to charity ?
It Feels Good
Tax Deductions
Creates Opportunities
Why Should Charitable Organization Pick Skip Hire Companies
Helps Identify the Best Rates
Provides Helpful Information
Improves Accurate Budgeting
Saves Time and Resources
What are you most passionate about ?
Whatever it is , you would be happy to know there is an organization that supports it .
Worldwide , there is a belief that charities need money more than any other thing .
That is true for many organizations but not all .
Some charities have no financial worries .
They have all the money they need .
Therefore , such organizations need other forms of assistance , which you can provide .
First , they need volunteers .
Though they get money to pay for salaried workers , these are never enough to provide all forms of professional and non-professional services .
Therefore , consider volunteering to help a charity that supports a cause that is close to your heart .
Offer specific skills you possess to the charity of your choosing .
The charities also need your time .
They need you to promote their activities .
They need you to create or increase awareness regarding the causes they support .
They need you sparing some of your time to let the whole world know what they do .
Spend your time with those who need it , especially the groups your charity supports .
Raising awareness is good to make those who can donate money know about the charity ’s existence .
Not everybody knows all the charity organizations that support certain causes .
People in your circle probably are not aware of the organizations you know .
All charities need as much publicity as possible .
Sadly , some never have enough money to spare on ads or making people aware of their activities .
Can you help publicize the activities of your favorite charity ?
The world is full of numerous charitable organizations .
These organizations do not make money .
Instead , they depend on donors to support them financially .
Some of the donors give continuously while others do it only once .
Nevertheless , it is important to give to charities .
Giving to charities is quite appealing for many reasons , as you will see below .
First , few things in life can give you the kind of pleasure that you derive from donating to charities .
Science has proven that anybody who donates money will always feel better .
Such simple acts activate the pleasure centers within the brain .
Charities support people in need all over the world .
Giving to these organizations , therefore , offers a chance to help needy people .
Globally , a huge gap exists between the poor and the rich .
The poor need all the help they can get .
Charitable organizations offer them just that .
Then there is the not - so - little - matter of tax deductions .
Giving to charities opens the door for you to receive or benefit from these deductions .
However , you only qualify for these deductions if you are in the US and donate money to IRS - approved charities .
Does life seem to have lost its meaning ?
If it has , you should start considering donating some of your finances to charities .
Such acts create more opportunities for meeting new people with whom you share a few ideas and causes .
Donating to charities is a good habit to teach your children .
They grow up learning that it is good to give to those who are badly off than them .
It is an excellent way of teaching your kids the benefits and importance of being generous .
Therefore , give to charities to enjoy all these benefits and more .
Waste management is a major problem around the world .
Americans produce 250-400 million tons of trash each year .
Since 1960 , the volume of waste produced each year has increased 300 % .
Faced with all this , it has become important to find ways of managing waste properly and effectively .
One way of doing that is through hiring skips .
Several companies provide skip hire services .
Therefore , it is important to compare skip Hire Prices before settling on any firm .
Charitable organizations need to use money wisely and prudently ; hence , the need for comparing prices .
Price comparison helps them to identify the best and most affordable rates .
Skip hire companies charge different rates .
Some offer huge discounts while others charge high rates .
The fact the organizations emit a lot of waste makes it wise to spare some money for skips .
They are easier to use .
They are also more convenient .
They are capable of holding huge volumes of garbage at any given moment .
Comparing prices is ideal for the information you are likely to glean from it all .
For example , some companies have no problem stating why they charge their rates .
Studying the rates will help you in future when haggling with other companies .
It enables the charities to understand where their money is going .
Other companies , however , are not too forthcoming with such information .
Therefore , it is better to select a company that publishes its rates openly .
Budgeting becomes easier when organizations have all the information they need .
Yes , no charity organization can function without a proper and accurate budget .
Meetings with donors , sponsors , and the board flow smoothly when an accurate budget is in place .
Organizations need to know how much money to set aside for any activity or item .
Comparing prices from different companies enables them to draft accurate budgets .
With a budget in place , the organizations can focus on their strategic goals .
After preparing the budget , they can approach their donors confidently too .
As previously stated , skips are some of the most efficient waste management tools .
They save time and resources .
They reduce the numerous trips a waste collection agency would have made to the organizationís premises .
They reduce the likelihood of suffering accidents and injuries from exposure to harmful items .
With a skip erected at the right place , the organization ( including its members and the group it serves ) can work together to reduce risks and dangers .
Therefore , do not hesitate to compare skip hire prices .
Contact as many skip hire firms , as you know , to obtain this valuable information .
Hiring and erecting a skip has numerous benefits to the organization , as shown above .
Comparing the rates will help you determine whether the skip is worth hiring for use in : a ) Household b) Commercial c ) Industrial d) Communal Charity organizations like many others use , produce and need to dispose of plenty of cardboard , old furniture , bricks , wood , and unused or broken bottles .
Skips are the best types of equipment for disposing of such wastes efficiently .
With strategic skip bin locations , speedy disposal of these unwanted wastes is guaranteed .
Compare the prices to discover whether you should proceed to book or hire a skip from a specific company .

Software Metrics : Measuring Haskell
Chris Ryder and Simon Thompson
Abstract
In Marko van Eekelen and Kevin Hammond , editors , Trends in Functional Programming , pages 182- 196 , September 2005 .
Software metrics have been used in software engineering as a mechanism for assessing code quality and for targeting software development activities , such as testing or refactoring , at areas of a program that will most benefit from them .
Haskell has many tools for software engineering , such as testing , debugging and refactoring tools , but software metrics have mostly been neglected .
The work presented in this paper identifies a collection of software metrics for use with Haskell programs .
These metrics are subjected to statistical analysis to assess the correlation between their values and the number of bug fixing changes occurring during the development lifetime of two case study programs .
In addition to this , the relationships between the metric values is also explored , showing how combinations of metrics can be used to improve the accuracy of the measurements .

A dozen years ago anyone who had foretold the political line - up of today would have been looked on as a lunatic .
And yet the truth is that the present situation — not in detail , of course , but in its main outlines — ought to have been predictable even in the golden age before Hitler .
Something like it was bound to happen as soon as British security was seriously threatened .
In a prosperous country , above all in an imperialist country , left­wing politics are always partly humbug .
There can be no real reconstruction that would not lead to at least a temporary drop in the English standard of life , which is another way of saying that the majority of left - wing politicians and publicists are people who earn their living by demanding something that they do n't genuinely want .
They are red - hot revolutionaries as long as all goes well , but every real emergency reveals instantly that they are shamming .
One threat to the Suez Canal , and ‘ anti-Fascism ’ and ‘ defence of British interests ’ are discovered to be identical .
It would be very shallow as well as unfair to suggest that there is nothing in what is now called ‘ anti- Fascism ’ except a concern for British dividends .
But it is a fact that the political obscenities of the past two years , the sort of monstrous harlequinade in which everyone is constantly bounding across the stage in a false nose —
Quakers shouting for a bigger army , Communists waving Union Jacks , Winston Churchill posing as a democrat — would not have been possible without this guilty consciousness that we are all in the same boat .
Much against their will the British governing class have been forced into the anti-Hitler position .
It is still possible that they will find a way out of it , but they are arming in the obvious expectation of war and they will almost certainly fight when the point is reached at which the alternative would be to give away some of their own property instead of , as hitherto , other people's .
And meanwhile the so - called opposition , instead of trying to stop the drift to war , are rushing ahead , preparing the ground and forestalling any possible criticism .
So far as one can discover the English people are still extremely hostile to the idea of war , but in so far as they are becoming reconciled to it , it is not the militarists but the ‘ anti- militarists ’ of five years ago who are responsible .
The Labour Party keeps up a pettifogging grizzle against conscription at the same time as its own propaganda makes any real struggle against conscription impossible .
The Bren machine - guns pour from the factories , books with titles like Tanks in the Next War , Gas in the Next War , etc pour from the press , and the warriors of the New Statesman gloze over the nature of the process by means of such phrases as ‘ Peace Bloc’ , ‘ Peace Front ’ , ‘ Democratic Front ’ , and , in general , by pretending that the world is an assemblage of sheep and goats , neatly partitioned off by national frontiers .
In this connextion it is well worth having a look at Mr ( Clarence K. )
Streit 's much - discussed book , Union Now .
Mr Streit , like the partisans of the ‘ Peace Bloc’ , wants the democracies to gang up against the dictatorships , but his book is outstanding for two reasons .
To begin with he goes further than most of the others and offers a plan which , even if it is startling , is constructive .
Secondly , in spite of a rather nineteen - twentyish American naivetй , he has an essentially decent cast of mind .
He genuinely loathes the thought of war , and he does not sink to the hypocrisy of pretending that any country which can be bought or bullied into the British orbit instantly becomes a democracy .
His book therefore presents a kind of test case .
In it you are seeing the sheep - and - goats theory at its best .
If you can't accept it in that form you will certainly never accept it in the form handed out by the Left Book Club .
Briefly , what Mr Streit suggests is that the democratic nations , starting with fifteen which he names , should voluntarily form themselves into a union — not a league or an alliance , but a union similar to the United States , with a common government , common money and complete internal free trade .
The initial fifteen states are , of course , the USA , France , Great Britain , the self - governing dominions of the British Empire , and the smaller European democracies , not including Czechoslovakia , which still existed when the book was written .
Later , other states could be admitted to the Union when and if they ‘ proved themselves worthy ’ .
It is implied all along that the state of peace and prosperity existing within the Union would be so enviable that everyone else would soon be pining to join it .
It is worth noticing that this scheme is not so visionary as it sounds .
Of course it is not going to happen , nothing advocated by well - meaning literary men ever happens , and there are certain difficulties which Mr Streit does not discuss ; but it is of the order of things which could happen .
Geographically the USA and the western European democracies are nearer to being a unit than , for instance , the British Empire .
Most of their trade is with one another , they contain within their own territories everything they need , and Mr Streit is probably right in claiming that their combined strength would be so great as to make any attack on them hopeless , even if the USSR joined up with Germany .
Why then does one see at a glance that this scheme has something wrong with it ?
What is there about it that smells — for it does smell , of course ?
What it smells of , as usual , is hypocrisy and self - righteousness .
Mr Streit himself is not a hypocrite , but his vision is limited .
Look again at his list of sheep and goats .
No need to boggle at the goats ( Germany , Italy and Japan ) , they are goats right enough , and billies at that .
But look at the sheep !
Perhaps the USA will pass inspection if one does not look too closely .
But what about France ?
What about England ?
What about even Belgium and Holland ?
Like everyone of his school of thought , Mr Streit has coolly lumped the huge British and French empires — in essence nothing but mechanisms for exploiting cheap coloured labour — under the heading of democracies !
Here and there in the book , though not often , there are references to the ‘ dependencies ’ of the democratic states .
‘ Dependencies ’ means subject races .
It is explained that they are to go on being dependencies , that their resources are to be pooled among the states of the Union , and that their coloured inhabitants will lack the right to vote in Union affairs .
Except where the tables of statistics bring it out , one would never for a moment guess what numbers of human beings are involved .
India , for instance , which contains more inhabitants than the whole of the ‘ fifteen democracies ’ put together , gets just a page and a half in Mr Streit 's book , and that merely to explain that as India is not yet fit for self - government the status quo must continue .
And here one begins to see what would really be happening if Mr Streit 's scheme were put into operation .
The British and French empires , with their six hundred million disenfranchised human beings , would simply be receiving fresh police forces ; the huge strength of the USA would be behind the robbery of India and Africa .
Mr Streit is letting cats out of bags , but all phrases like ‘ Peace Bloc’ , ‘ Peace Front ’ , etc contain some such implication ; all imply a tightening - up of the existing structure .
The unspoken clause is always ‘ not counting niggers ’ .
For how can we make a ‘ firm stand ’ against Hitler if we are simultaneously weakening ourselves at home ?
In other words , how can we ‘ fight Fascism ’ except by bolstering up a far vaster injustice ?
For of course it is vaster .
What we always forget is that the over­whelming bulk of the British proletariat does not live in Britain , but in Asia and Africa .
It is not in Hitler 's power , for instance , to make a penny an hour a normal industrial wage ; it is perfectly normal in India , and we are at great pains to keep it so .
One gets some idea of the real relationship of England and India when one reflects that the per capita annual income in England is something over £ 80 , and in India about £ 7 .
It is quite common for an Indian coolie 's leg to be thinner than the average Englishman 's arm .
And there is nothing racial in this , for well - fed members of the same races are of normal physique ; it is due to simple starvation .
This is the system which we all live on and which we denounce when there seems to be no danger of its being altered .
Of late , however , it has become the first duty of a ‘ good anti-Fascist ’ to lie about it and help to keep it in being .
What real settlement , of the slightest value , can there be along these lines ?
What meaning would there be , even if it were successful , in bringing down Hitler 's system in order to stabilize something that is far bigger and in its different way just as bad ?
But apparently , for lack of any real opposition , this is going to be our objective .
Mr Streit 's ingenious ideas will not be put into operation , but something resembling the ‘ Peace Bloc ’ proposals probably will .
The British and Russian governments are still haggling , stalling and uttering muffled threats to change sides , but circumstances will probably drive them together .
And what then ?
No doubt the alliance will stave off war for a year or two .
Then Hitler 's move will be to feel for a weak spot or an unguarded moment ; then our move will be more armaments , more militarization , more propaganda , more war - mindedness — and so on , at increasing speed .
It is doubtful whether prolonged war - preparation is morally any better than war itself ; there are even reasons for thinking that it may be slightly worse .
Only two or three years of it , and we may sink almost unresisting into some local variant of austro - Fascism .
And perhaps a year or two later , in reaction against this , there will appear something we have never had in England yet — a real Fascist movement .
And because it will have the guts to speak plainly it will gather into its ranks the very people who ought to be opposing it .
Further than that it is difficult to see .
The downward slide is happening because nearly all the Socialist leaders , when it comes to the pinch , are merely His Majesty 's Opposition , and nobody else knows how to mobilize the decency of the English people , which one meets with everywhere when one talks to human beings instead of reading newspapers .
Nothing is likely to save us except the emergence within the next two years of a real mass party whose first pledges are to refuse war and to right imperial injustice .
But if any such party exists at present , it is only as a possibility , in a few tiny germs lying here and there in unwatered soil .

You know how they say pets tend to look like their owners .
Well , after playing around with content aggregators over the last few days , it ’s become strikingly obvious to me that the content aggregators share the same types of personalities as their users .
The explosion of traffic this site has seen over the last three of four days that has seen us maintain our lofty WordPress ranking has been entirely down to referrals from aggregators .
So I ’ve had the opportunity to watch the kinds of traffic that these aggregators send through as well as watching the way certain stories climb or fall .
It ’s been fascinating .
Let ’s start with memeorandum .
How does memeorandum work .
It ’s based on links from authorative sources .
So if you ’re not in the club , you do n’t get a guernsey no matter how intelligent or smart your post is .
There ’s no ability to submit an article .
You need to depend on being noticed and linked to by someone in the club .
Now , let ’s look at the type of bloggers who dominate memorandum .
It ’s the tech elite .
Your Scoble ’s , Arrington ’s , Malik ’s , etc .
So you ’ve got elite bloggers , whose sense of eliteness is being reaffirmed by an elitest aggregator .
It ’s not surprising then that memeorandum sends through the least traffic of the three aggregators I ’ve mentioned .
But you get really good traffic .
Bloggers who are going to take your post and critique , expand , pontificate .
The only unfortunate aspect to memeorandum is that unless you ’re one of the posts get broken out as a lead story the traffic it sends through is almost non-existent .
So the conversation aspect of memeorandum is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be .
Some one would say exactly the same about his corner of the blogosphere .
Now let ’s look at Digg .
Digg is all about power to the people .
To get a story up the ladder at Digg , the comrades need to vote it up .
There ’s no elite , here .
Every one has the ability to Digg .
No Digg is worth more than any other Digg .
And who is your average Digger .
Your open - source loving , technology - is - democratizing the world , techie geek .
Any body , any story can make it to the top of Digg if the people say so .
But Digg ’s ranking system encourages herd mentality .
The more popular it becomes , the higher up the list it gets , the more Diggs it gets , the higher up the list it goes and so on .
Digg traffic is all or nothing .
If you dont ’ get a start , Digg sends through just a trickle of traffic .
Make it onto the front page , though , and Digg ’s easily the more influential aggregator around as you can see by watching the WordPress rankings of those WordPress.com blogs that make it to the front .
Next up , we ’ve got Reddit .
Reddit ’s slightly more sophisticated than Digg , in terms of the way it ranks traffic .
Not only can you promote something up the batting order you can also critique it .
So where a sensationalist post has the potential to rocket up the Digg charts because of the number of Digg ’s , on Reddit , it ’s just as likely to struggle because people are going to vote it down .
Similiarly , the type of stories that do well on Reddit , are a little more high - brow than what you get at Digg .
More world news and politics , tech blog posts that make it need to be very well argued .
Reddit will get you a pretty reasonable traffic flow , even if you do n’t get onto the front page .
There appears to be far more people lurking around the back pages looking for good stuff and Reddit readers are more inclined to check you out than Digg readers .
So while all primarily have a tech - oriented audience , there are three very distinct groups served by each .
In fact , you can say these groups are analagous to our society .
memeorandum is for the crusty , upper class .
Digg is for the greater populus and Reddit is for the middle class .
What all this tells me is that there probably wo n’t be one aggregator that rules this space .
Because even though you can create different communities around a particular voting style , the more important nature of an aggregator is that the ranking methodology has to fit with the personality of the community .
So in fact , I wonder if Digg , memeorandum , Reddit will scale beyong the communities they own now .
Gabe Rivera has already said memeorandum has limitations because his community interacts very differently to how the rest of the blogosphere works .
How well with the Digg , Reddit systems work outside of the tech arena .
Techies like to be involved with technology , so they like an interactive ranking system .
Will a teenage girl , a mother - of - three , a grandfather engage with a site the same way ?

Maybe if you could actually see how much energy you 're using , you would n't leave that PC running all night .
That 's the idea behind the Static Energy + Design Network 's Power Aware Cord , a power strip whose connecting cable glows and pulses .
Its electroluminescent wires embedded inside get brighter when more power flows through , pulsing and scintillating with various patterns that are difficult to ignore .

While this appears to be just a design concept so far , it looks purty and might just remind us of what power - sucking bastards we are .
We 're usually trying to hide power cables , wall warts and power strips , but this eye - catching design might give us an excuse to leave that spaghetti bowl of wires right out in the open .
But do n't the lights in the cord suck up even more energy ?
Maybe not much .
More pics after the jump .

Am I just accustomed to old ways ?
Does the new generation , born with these restrictions , feel the weight of these bonds and recoil from my fears as paranoia ?
What can I , a person with no political interests -- a person that would really rather think that the people in office are there because they 're looking out for us , our rights , and our freedoms and not because their short - sightedness is creating a police state -- do to stem the tide ? "

These top techies were n't leery about leaving school 1 / 7 Back to Gallery
Aaron Swartz dropped out of high school after one year to study on his own .
Then he dropped out of college after one year to seek his high - tech fortune .
He was still in his teens a year later when he hit the jackpot , selling his startup in October to Wired Digital for an undisclosed but lottery - like payout .
With his boyish mien and more geek credentials than engineers twice his age , the suddenly wealthy Swartz belongs to a new generation of young , brainy geeks who began booting up and logging on when their friends were still watching " Sesame Street . "
Before they were old enough to drive , they landed paying gigs .
Now that another high - tech boom is heating up Silicon Valley , more of these technologically developed but underage techies are dropping out and starting up .
Theirs is the stuff of classic Silicon Valley mythology : young people deserting higher learning for high technology to follow in the famous footsteps of Bill Gates , Larry Ellison , Steve Jobs and Michael Dell .
These dropouts barely raise an eyebrow in high - tech circles , where their worth is measured in real - world smarts , not Ivy - League degrees .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Of course , Silicon Valley has always thrived on youth .
Virtually every revolution there has been fueled not by fossilized executives but by an anarchistic youth counterculture experimenting with technology .
" Everything that would get you detention at school will get you funding in Silicon Valley , " said Paul Saffo , a valley forecaster and essayist who has been exploring technological change and its impact on business and society for more than two decades .
And that culture can be a powerful draw .
Max Levchin , a University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign graduate who sold the company he co-founded , PayPal , to eBay for $ 1.5 billion when he was just 26 , uses his blockbuster success to persuade students at his alma mater not to follow his example .
He makes the case that young people should seize the fleeting opportunity to get a different kind of education .
" You are essentially taking a class in real - life company - building on the nickel of a venture capitalist , " Levchin said .
" It 's a pretty unbeatable deal . "
The journey is the reward
That message -- reminiscent of the Jobs mantra , " The journey is the reward " -- resonates with youngsters who frequently feel intellectually stunted and socially outcast in high school .
Some are " virtual dropouts " who run technology businesses on the side rather than focus on achievement tests and prom dates .
Others drop out altogether when they envision what the traditional career path holds .
These whiz kids shudder at the prospect of careers cut out of a Dilbert comic strip .
So they gravitate to the innovative high - tech world that embraces free thinkers .
" One of the great things about Silicon Valley is that it 's a complete meritocracy .
It 's not about where you went to school or who your parents are .
It 's about how hard you are willing to work and how bright you are , " said Pankaj Chowdhry , a 32 - year - old high school dropout .
" It 's the best place for somebody with my background . "
Chowdhry , born in New Delhi , moved with his family to Louisiana when he was 2 .
In 1981 , his parents gave him his first computer .
The modem became his passport out of a one - stoplight town where kids hunted alligators for sport .
His family 's move to the Bay Area when he was 12 left him out of sorts .
Chowdhry dropped out of Cupertino High School part way through his sophomore year because he felt he was n't learning anything useful .
He worked his way up through the ranks of a printing company , then moved on to a series of successful startups .
Today he is president of a startup that builds software for banks .
Chowdhry asked that The Chronicle not name his company because , although dropping out may be widely accepted in Silicon Valley , it is not in the financial services industry .
Chowdhry has a veritable showroom to his personal success : a collection of luxury cars .
Now , many Indians who once cast a disapproving eye turn to him for career advice .
Yet , Chowdhry says , dropping out came at a cost .
He missed out on many teenage rites of passage that round you out as a person .
And , he says , the risks can be as great as the rewards .
" When you talk to relatively intelligent people who drop out and go on to do interesting things , they talk about how much easier their lives would have been if they had stayed in school and had gone to college , " Chowdhry said .
" You have to work a lot harder if you do n't have an Ivy League diploma . "
Ben Sittler , a 30 - year - old who dropped out of college after nearly five years of enjoying mathematics and computer science but blowing requirements like English and geology , says the experiences of dropouts vary greatly .
" I 've met quite a few in the valley , " he said .
" It works well for some people and not for others .
Overall , I would recommend dropping out only to people who feel they have something better to do . "
Sittler finds himself in good company at file - sharing service BitTorrent in San Francisco .
His boss , co-founder and software prodigy Bram Cohen , first used a computer when he was 5 and designed a computer version of a popular children 's game by the time he was in seventh grade .
Cohen dropped out of college after struggling for two years .
Napster at 19
Getting some sweat equity also appealed to Sean Parker , who graduated from high school but never made it to college .
The son of an MIT - trained engineer , Parker resisted pressure to follow a more traditional path .
By the time he graduated , he had started a successful Internet business , worked at another and explored starting companies to tap into cutting - edge technologies .
Parker was just 19 when he and friend and college dropout Shawn Fanning started Napster and an Internet revolution that would rock the music world .
While his friends split for college , Parker moved to the West Coast , where he was often the youngest person in the room .
Surrounded by lawyers , bankers and venture capitalists , he missed being around people his own age .
" None of your friends are doing anything remotely like what you are doing , " he said .
" You lose all common ground . "
And Napster was hardly a typical startup .
" It was as if my life was proceeding normally and then all of a sudden this hurricane swept me off my feet .
It was a life - altering experience .
Then the hurricane passed , leaving behind it all this destruction , " Parker said .
" To deal with that at such a young age was a more jarring experience than what most entrepreneurs go through . "
It took some intestinal fortitude but Parker stuck it out .
He is a veteran of some of the valley 's headline - making companies , including Facebook , where he was the founding president .
Now that he is spending time counseling startups , instead of being the youngest guy in the room , at 26 he 's often the elder statesman .
Blake Ross has been the youngest guy in the room most of his career .
The 21 - year - old software developer was in ninth grade when he stumbled on a call for volunteer developers to help design Netscape 's latest browser .
He started as an intern at Netscape Communications when he was a 15 - year - old prep school student in Miami .
At age 17 , he helped created the Firefox Web browser , which has since grown into the biggest threat to Microsoft 's Internet Explorer since the company battled and defeated the Netscape browser for Internet domination .
He has raised seed capital from high - powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital for a stealth startup , Parakey Inc. in Mountain View .
A computer science major at Stanford , Ross pulled all - nighters trying to juggle the startup , Firefox and courses in computer science and creative writing .
By the time he was a college sophomore , the workload overwhelmed him .
He took a leave of absence from Stanford in April 2005 .
Yet the decision was n't easy .
" You wake up every day and wonder if you are making a mistake or not , " Ross said .
" I am on a completely different timeline than everyone I grew up with .
I can go back to school but I can't go back with the people I went with originally . "
And , life can get a lot lonelier in an apartment complex than in a college dorm .
But startup life keeps
Ross keyed up .
" I have more energy right now than I will have at any other time in my life , " Ross said .
" So it 's a great time to be running a startup . "
Another advantage ?
People underestimate him because of his age .
" It 's hard to believe how often people write you off even though so many young people have succeeded in Silicon Valley . "
Ross says he plans to return to Stanford , part of the back - and - forth toggle for many techies for whom learning becomes a lifelong endeavor , be it in the office or the classroom .
His may be the first generation to send some dropouts back to school .
Only one iconic old - guard , high - tech dropout went back to finish his degree :
In the early 1980s , Steve Wozniak , under the alias Rocky " Raccoon " Clark ( combining his wife 's maiden name , Clark , and his dog's name , Rocky ) , went back to UC Berkeley to get an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and computer science .
" Did n't want to sit and listen "
Not everyone is interested in getting back on the conventional track .
Evan Williams , a 34 - year - old entrepreneur who recently paid back venture capitalists who invested in his struggling podcast company so he could run it without outside pressures , never planned to get a degree .
Williams , who embodies the fiercely independent , highly individualistic and self - powered streak that characterizes most Silicon Valley standouts , left the University of Nebraska after one year because he knew he was never going to work for anyone but himself .
" I just did n't want to sit and listen to what other people had to say for four years , " said Williams , founder of San Francisco 's Obvious Corp. , previously called Odeo .
" Arguably that was arrogant .
I certainly had things to learn .
But a lot of people go to school to learn to be like everybody else . "
So far , the only company that employed Williams for any length of time was Google , and that was because he sold his blogging company to the Internet search giant , one of the few Silicon Valley companies to use college records to screen applicants .
In fact , Williams faced hurdles in getting Google to hire three of the six employees from his company who did not graduate from college .
Ironically , Google was started in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page , both Stanford doctoral program dropouts .
Of course , for every dropout 's success story there are untold stories of disappointment and failure .
Nathan Ensmenger , a University of Pennsylvania history professor who tracks the Silicon Valley labor market , says youngsters often are lured by high starting salaries and low barriers to entry .
But not everyone can hit a startup grand slam , leaving many with fewer options as they try to climb the corporate ladder that quickly tops out for techies without a degree .
" If we were shooting a movie of this , there would be a disclaimer at the bottom , ' Do not attempt this at home , ' " said Paul Graham , a startup investor and founder of Y Combinator .
" It 's an extreme example of a fundamental , underlying trend :
If you can program , you do n't have to play by the rules .
" We discourage people from starting startups too young .
You 're not a loser if you finish college first . "
Silicon Valley can't wait
But some -- including Swartz -- decide Silicon Valley can't wait .
Swartz built his first
Web site when he was 13 , an online encyclopedia written by the people who use it .
Bored in class , Swartz convinced his parents to let him study at home after his freshman year of high school .
" I could n't take it .
It seemed pointless and silly .
It was n't so much about learning .
It was about sitting in desks and following orders . "
Swartz enrolled in a handful of classes , from logic to number theory , at a community college and embarked on projects that challenged him intellectually and took him around the country .
In school , adults assumed he could n't be up to anything that interesting .
On the Internet , he was taken seriously .
At 14 , he helped develop the popular Web content - distribution software RSS .
Soon he was in demand , attending technology conferences and concentrating on such major efforts as creating universal ways to exchange online information through a group founded by Tim Berners - Lee , considered the father of the Web .
In 2002 , he helped Creative Commons , a nonprofit organization at Stanford formed by law professor Lawrence Lessig and other legal scholars to encourage the legal sharing of writing , music and other works .
It was Lessig who encouraged Swartz to attend Stanford , where he majored in sociology .
Toward the end of his freshman year , Graham e-mailed Swartz to suggest he apply for the Summer Founders Program , which offers three months of seed funding from Y Combinator .
Swartz moved to Cambridge to work on his own startup , but later joined forces with Reddit.com , which taps " the wisdom of crowds " by letting users submit and rank news and other online content .
He dropped out of Stanford .
Over the next year , Swartz worked long hours in cramped quarters hunched over a small screen , his only glimpse of the outside world through small windows that opened up on chalky skies .
Over time , the Reddit site grew in popularity .
Then came the life - changing offer from Wired Digital .
At first , the prospect of never again scrounging for loose change under threadbare couch cushions thrilled him .
Then Swartz succumbed to feelings of anxiety and guilt over the windfall .
Even now that he is more comfortable with his newfound fortune and levitating status in the online world , Swartz says he wo n't turn into another boom kid .
Fancy new car ?
" I do n't know how to drive , " Swartz wrote on his blog , Raw Thought .
Big house in the suburbs ?
" I like living in small apartments . "
Expensive clothes ?
" I 've worn a T - shirt and jeans practically every day of my life . "
Hanging with the cool kids ?
" I 'm so shy I do n't even hang out with the people I know now . "
Swartz moved to San Francisco a few weeks ago on his 20th birthday .
After a two - year stint at Wired , Swartz says , he plans to head back to academia .
But , chances are , he 'll return to the startup drawing board .
Swartz may have attained the Silicon Valley dream but -- like so many of his peers -- he 's not done dreaming .

Sometimes , people ask me if it is a sin in the church of Emacs to use the editor Vi .
It is true that Vi -Vi - Vi is the editor of the beast ....
Just for once , I would n't mind siding with the beast if that is what it takes to use Vi .
The modern avatar of Vi is Vim - the free editor created by Bram Moolenaar .
Riding from strength to strength , this editor in its 7th version is a powerhouse as far as an editor is concerned .
When ever I use Vim ( or GVim for that matter ) , it gives me the impression of the Beauty and the Beast .
It is very beautiful to look at - if you are like me who finds beauty in software , and it is also as powerful as a beast .
I use this editor exclusively for all my editing needs that , when I use any other editor , I inadvertently press escape key .
That should give you an idea of how ingrained the use of this editor has become in my computing life .
Vim 7.0 - the latest version has a slew of new features built into it .
Some of them which I am aware of are as follows :
On the fly spell checking
Vim 7.0 has an on the fly spell checker built into it similar in lines to that found in Microsoft Word .
By default , this feature is turned off .
But by navigating to Tools -> Spelling ->
" Spell check on " , you can make Vim display all the mis-spelled words in your document .
It does this by highlighting them with red coloured wriggly lines .
And all it takes to correct the misspelled words is to move the caret to the highlighted word and while in " Vi Command mode " , press ' z= ' and Vim will show a list of words closest in relation to the misspelled words and the user can choose from them .
Fig :
On the fly spell checking
Suppose , you want GVim to recognise the word GVim as a valid word .
It is possible to tell the spell checker that GVim is a good word by moving the cursor on the GVim word and pressing ' zg ' in command mode .
On a similar vein , it is possible to tell Vim spell checker that a word is wrong by pressing ' zw ' .
Vim stores the good / bad words that the user recognises in a file associated with the variable spellfile .
If the file is empty or not created , then Vim will create one automatically and store the words in this file for future use .
Other spelling related commands
: set spell
- Turns on the spell checking
: set nospell - Turns off the spell checking ( can be achieved using GUI too ) .
: ]s
: [s
- Move to the next mis-spelled word in the document .-
Same as above command but searches backwards .
z= - Shows a list of close matches to the mis-spelled word from which the user can pick the correct one .
Bracket highlighting
This feature is most useful for programmers than for ordinary users .
Vim will automatically highlight the corresponding closing bracket when the caret is moved over any bracket .
This helps in keeping track of the blocks of code and is especially useful when writing code which make use of multiple layers of brackets .
Ofcourse this feature could take up some memory .
But you can use the ' : NoMatchParen ' command to disable this feature .
Fig : Bracket highlighting
Omni completion
It is a smart kind of completion like the intellisense .
It is most useful for people who write code .
For example , if I am writing HTML code and I have saved the file with the extension .html , then Vim will automatically load the HTML tag file and when ever I want Vim to auto complete the HTML code , while in Insert mode , I press the key combination [ Ctrl+x ] [ Ctrl+o ] and Vim will smartly guess the correct keyword and insert it .
If there is any ambiguity , then Vim will show the possible completions in a pop up window .
This feature is presently available for 8 languages which include C , ( X) HTML with CSS , JavaScript , PHP , Python , Ruby , SQL and XML .
It is also possible to add custom omni completion scripts .
Fig : Omni completion - a boon to the programmer .
Open files in tabs
One of the most useful user interface is the tabs .
Support for tabs in applications have been well received by the ordinary users that most web browsers and editors now support opening pages in tabs .
Following this trend , Vim has also incorporated tab support in its latest version .
And like all things related to Vim , it is entirely possible to open new files in tabs and manage tabs using the commands entered in the Vim Command mode .
Fig : Open files in tabs .
For example , while editing a file in Vim , I wish to open another file in a new tab .
I can move to Command Mode and enter the command as follows :
: tab e /home / ravi/Desktop/myotherfile.txt
... and Vim will open the file " myotherfile.txt " in a new tab .
A few other tab manipulation commands are as follows :
: tab s -
View a list of tabs that are open with the file names .
Use the command ' : tabs ' and Vim will display a list of all the files in the tabs .
The current window is shown by a " > " and a " + " is shown for any modifiable buffers .
: tab c
: tab new
: tab split
: tab n
: tab p
- Close the current tab .-
Open a new file for editing in a separate tab . -
Open the file in the current buffer in a new tab page . -
Switching to the next tab page .- Switch to the previous tab page .
: tab r [ ewind ] -
Go to the first tab page .
You get the same effect when you use the : tab f [ irst ] command .
: tab o
Undo Branches
- Close all other tab pages .
One of the things I really like about Vim is the use of the key ' u ' to undo any changes .
When ever I make a series of mistakes while editing a document , I just move to command mode in Vim and press the key ' u ' a series of times to move to a point prior to the mistakes .
Fig :
A list of undo levels with the time
In Vim 7.0 , a new feature has been included which allows a user to jump back or forward to any point of editing .
For example , I am editing a document and after a couple of minutes ( say 10 min ) , I realise that I have made a mistake .
I can easily take the document to a point 10 minutes back by using the command :
: earlier 10 m
Or for that matter , move to a point 5 seconds ahead by using the command :
: later 5s
You can use the command : undolist to see a list of undo branches existing in the buffer .
And each branch will have a number associated with it and it is possible to move to the undo level by using the command :
: undo < number >
Anybody who has used Photoshop will find that this feature is similar to the history levels you have in Photoshop , the only difference being that in Photoshop it is for images where as in Vim it is for text .
These are not the only new features .
There are scores of others like Remote file explorer which allows one to directly edit a file residing in a remote location , better POSIX compatibility , Vim's own internal grep and so on which I have not covered here because this article is after all a visual walk through of the new features in Vim 7.0 .
It takes real genius and stellar coding skills to create and maintain such a versatile editor and Bram Moolenaar has proved yet again that he has the necessary ingredients to qualify him for the post .

Such " red flags , " as they are sometimes called , were the meat and potatoes of the keynote speech on Friday night by Alex Jones , who is the William Jennings Bryan of the 9/11 band .
Mr. Jones , a syndicated radio host , is known for his larynx - tearing screeds against corruption — fiery , almost preacherly , addresses in which he sweats , balls his fists and often swerves from quoting Roman history to using foul language in a single breath .
At the lectern Friday night , beside a digital projection reading " History of Government Sponsored Terrorism , " Mr. Jones set forth the central tenets of 9/11 Truth : that the military command that monitors aircraft " stood down " on the day of the attacks ; that President Bush addressed children in a Florida classroom instead of being whisked off to the White House ; that the hijackers , despite what the authorities say , were trained at American military bases ; and that the towers did not collapse because of burning fuel and weakened steel but because of a " controlled demolition " caused by pre-set bombs .
According to the group 's
Web site , the motive for faking a terrorist attack was to allow the administration " to instantly implement policies its members have long supported , but which were otherwise infeasible . "
The controlled - demolition theory is the sine qua non of the 9/11 movement — its basic claim and , in some sense , the one upon which all others rest .
It is , of course , directly contradicted by the 10,000 - page investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which held that jet - fuel fires distressed the towers ' structure , which eventually collapsed .
The movement 's answer to that report was written by Steven E. Jones , a professor of physics at Brigham Young University and the movement 's expert in the matter of collapse .
Dr. Jones , unlike Alex Jones , is a soft - spoken man who lets his writing do the talking .
He composed an account of the destruction of the towers ( www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/htm7.html) that holds that " pre-positioned cutter - charges " brought the buildings down .

Like a prior generation of skeptics — those who doubted , say , the Warren Commission or the government 's account of the Gulf of Tonkin attack — the 9/11 Truthers are dogged , at home and in the office , by friends and family who suspect that they may , in fact , be completely nuts .

When I first began to use BitTorrent in 2004 there was little question as to which indexing site to use .
Today , Suprnova is long gone and we are left with an array of diverse options .
This is a comparison of today 's ten most used BitTorrent sites according to Alexa.com .
I was rather surprised with these results , BTJunkie has nearly double the amount of torrents as the next leading competitor .
The reason for such the dramatic increase is that they index both private and public trackers .
Keep in mind that this benchmark is not very reliable because these sites all have different removal policies , making the quality of these numbers range .
Average of Daily Torrent Additions 4,224 854 1,154 1,050 971 890 580 1,526 640 953 BT
Junkie BTCom BushTor isoHunt Meganova Mininova TPB T- Portal T - Spy Torrentz
This is the best benchmark for figuring out which site is doing the best job .
It is the most important number because no matter what policies the site may have for keeping dead torrents around it is a tell tail sign of how much is really incoming .
At first I thought BTJunkie 's numbers must be fake , but I assure you it is real !
I tested the number posted with the number in the actual directory for the day and they matched for a week straight !

Site Review
BTJunkie - Editors Choice
This is an overall rating based on site & user features .
TorrentSpy has done a great job of " wikifing " their site , leaving much of the work to it 's users .
TorrentSpy also has great torrent upload management .
BTJunkie has a feature called Torrent Mail that will search the new torrents daily for any searches of your choice and e-mail you the results .
It 's funny because BTJunkie was a site that I had never heard of before , barely made the top ten list , and it turned out to be the largest BitTorrent index .
BTJunkie also indexes private trackers which tend to have faster , higher quality torrents .
I spoke with the operator who claims their success is due to having an automated web crawler similar to Google , which captures torrents from thousands of web sites .
The site also has an innovative feature where users can have BTJunkie search the new torrents daily and e-mail them the results .
The site is fast with powerful search options and the layout is " windows " like .
Overall this is my number one pick due to it's huge index of active torrents , hats off to BTJunkie !
BitTorrent.com
This search engine is operated by the founder of the BitTorrent protocol , Brah Cohen .
The site lacks a directory service and does not store most torrents directly on their servers .
This is probably due to being Incorporated in the United States and trying to avoid any legal troubles .
The quality of the matches returned were mediocre at best , and only provided very limited " for dummies " information .
Their index seams to be based mostly off of a few major indexes included in this study .
The site was offline several times during our testing period too so they loose points for uptime .
I personally expected better from the " creator " .
BushTorrent & TorrentReactor
I was surprised to find out these two sites shared the same index and operator .
The index is a good size with a very flexible and easy to use search .
Most of the initial matches of searches were good but near the end were several non-relevant matches .
The search gives you powerful control options for your queries by giving you the ability to match with OR or AND .
Torrentreactor has definitely overkilled the ads and includes pop-ups .
isoHunt
Established in early 2004 , this site flourished at the demise of Suprnova .
Most of the torrents in this index have tested active within a week .
The search query options are set from within the query using similar syntax to Google .
The directory is a bit odd , it is split off into a isoHunt release section and a web release section .
The interface is easy to use and loaded with JavaScript .
IsoHunt is the 3rd most popular BitTorrent site today and is also being sued by the MPAA .
Meganova
Very basic site heavily integrated with usenext advertisements .
The search is very limited , the only special option is to limit by category .
The index is one of the largest but the incoming daily torrents are a little lower then they should be for such a high number .
Mininova
This is the 2nd most popular BitTorrent site despite having around an average of only 1/3 as many torrents as other sites .
The speed , quality , and simplicity of Mininova are what keep their users happy .
Mininova was the largest successor of Suprnova 's shutdown .
The Pirate Bay
The Pirate Bay is the largest BitTorrent tracker in the world .
Famous for their blatant disregard for intellectual property rights , they are a beacon of light for a neutral Internet .
The web site is easy to use and efficient with limited capabilities .
Their index is comprised of only torrents they index on their tracker , but do n't worry because there tracker has almost 350,000 torrents .
Torrent Portal
Torrent Portal is famous for there large following of faithful uploaders .
They had the second most incoming daily torrents with 468,000 indexed , so they have a pretty good standard for active torrents .
The web page is loaded with ads that can be reduced by becoming a member .
The search gives powerful options to it 's users .
TorrentSpy
TorrentSpy is the most popular BitTorrent site .
They had the nicest interface and features out of all the sites we tested .
They scored low where it counts the most , only an average of 640 torrents a day .
We were surprised by this because it is the most popular yet it has such a poor index .
The site has advanced identifications for torrents like languages and subs that are set by the users .
Users can also report passworded archives within the torrents .
Heavy on the ads and includes pop-ups .
They are also currently being sued by the MPAA .
Torrentz
Torrentz is similar to Bittorrent.com in that it does n't actually store the torrents on their servers but outsources to many of the sites included in this study .
This is one of the only search engines that gives you the ability to search for files within the torrents .
They only index torrents that have tested active with at least one seed which makes the quality of there index the best .
It is not the best option if you are looking for something that is hard to find , torrents that have no seeds pull themselves together all the time .
Resveratrol Increases Energy In Humans , Mice
Resveratrol increases energy production in humans and increases mouse endurance on treadmills .
CAMBRIDGE , MA and Strasbourg , France  November 16th , 2006  Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and the University Louis Pasteur , Strasbourg announced that in an article published today in Cell ,  Resveratrol improves mitochondrial function and protects against metabolic disease by activating SIRT1 and PGC - 1α.
Lagouge et al. , Cell .
2006 ; 127 : 114 , SIRT1 was shown for the first time in a human population to accelerate metabolic rate .
In a human population in Finland , SIRT1 was linked to increased energy expenditure as demonstrated by genetic studies of three variants of the SIRT1 gene .
The study also showed that treating mice with resveratrol increased mitochondrial biogenesis leading to increased exercise endurance and protection from diet induced obesity .
Activation of SIRT1 , the best characterized of the recently - discovered family of sirtuin enzymes , was shown to be the mechanism by which these therapeutic benefits occur .
The doses used in mice , 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/ kg , is milligrams per day per kilogram of body weight of the mice .
Well , scale that to humans and it becomes clear the dose is very high .
A 150 lb human is 68 kilograms .
That works out to over 27 grams per day .
Mice were dosed with 200 mg / kg or 400 mg / kg of resveratrol daily in either normal chow or high fat chow .
The mice on resveratrol lost weight due to decreased fat , and this was attributed to an increase in the number and function of mitochondria .
The resveratrol - treated mice also exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and an increased metabolic rate .
Notably , mice treated with resveratrol showed a two - times increase in exercise endurance .
These effects were shown to be mediated through SIRT1 and PGC - 1α .
The scientists who did the work are at prestigious research universities .
The authors of the Cell article include the teams of the principal investigator Johan Auwerx , M.D. Ph.D. , Professor at the Medical Faculty in Strasbourg , at IGBMC ( Unité mixte de recherche CNRS , Inserm , University Louis Pasteur ) , France , and of Pere Puigserver , Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore ( now at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute / Harvard Medical School in Boston ) , both members of the Scientific Advisory Board of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals , and Sirtris scientists : Peter Elliott , Ph.D. Senior Vice President and Head of Development , Phil Lambert , Ph.D. Senior Director of Pharmacology , and Jill Milne , Ph.D. , Senior Director of Biology .
It would be hard to get regulatory approval for a drug that increased life expectancy because it is a claim that is hard to prove in a clinical trial .
But Sitris is chasing a more provable claim :
That their modified resveratrol molecule , SRT501 , will reduce the symptoms of old age and obesity such as high unhealthy blood lipids and insulin resistance in the form of type II diabetes .
 This work is significant because it shows that a SIRT1 activator can protect against metabolic disease , highlighting the therapeutic potential of sirtuins .
Resveratrol a compound found in the skin of red grapes and hence in red wine , could very well explain the French Paradox ,  said Johan Auwerx .
Sirtris has initiated a human Phase 1b clinical trial in diabetes with SRT501 , a proprietary formulation of resveratrol with improved bioavailability .
SRT501 is the first small molecule to enter human clinical trials that is designed to activate SIRT1 .
Sirtris has applied this scientific discovery to the development of SRT501 , which activates SIRT1 , for the treatment of diseases of aging such as metabolic and mitochondrial disorders .
In addition , Sirtris has a robust pipeline of novel small molecule drug candidates that are potent SIRT1 activators and are chemically distinct from resveratrol .
 This important work highlights the significance of SIRT1 as a therapeutic target for metabolic disease .
Based on the continuing scientific evidence , as shown in this most recent Cell article , we are continuing to advance drug candidates to translate the science of sirtuins into new treatments for diseases of aging , such as diabetes ,  said Peter Elliott , Ph.D. Senior Vice President and Head of Development at Sirtris Pharmaceuticals .
 These new human data support SIRT1 as a therapeutic target for metabolic disease .
Our broad pipeline of sirtuin modulators have potential in a number of diseases of aging ,  said Christoph Westphal , M.D. , Ph.D. , Chief Executive Officer of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals .
Now for the qualifiers and caveats .
Back in March 2005 Sirtris co-founder David Sinclair of Harvard said that most commercial resveratrol preparations have no active resveratrol in them - with activity measured by the ability to activate the SIR2 enzymes .
Resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation .
Most commercially available supplements I have tested have no ability to stimulate SIR2 enzymes .
Longevinex sells resveratrol to many researchers .
But their commercial resveratrol preparation has only 100 mg of resveratrol per capsule and costs more than $ 1 per capsule .
But the recent study by David Sinclair and Rafael de Cabo showing resveratrol protected mice from the harms of obesity used a dose of resveratrol that would be the equivalent of 1600 mg for a 150 lb human .
Whereas the study above on mice used the equivalent of 27 grams ( 27,000 milligrams ) of resveratrol for a 150 lb human .
Bulk sources of resveratrol from knotweed can be found on the internet .
But which of those sources is selling real active resveratrol ?
Your guess is as good as mine .
Then there 's the question of whether this stuff is safe .
We do not know .
Okay ?
Really , we do not know .
We need a big study of large numbers of people taking a gram of resveratrol a day with all sorts of checks done on them to look for bad signs .
My guess is we are not going to see such a study on resveratrol because the money is in making a patentable commercial variation of resveratrol into a marketable drug .
That 'll take 6 , 7 , 8 years more and hundreds of millions of dollars .
In the comments section of my post on the David Sinclair and Rafael de Cabo study on resveratrol you 'll see a reader who claims he 's taking over 1 gram of resveratrol a day with very beneficial effects .
He thinks he has a good trustworthy source for large doses .
Where do resveratrol and the Sirtris drug SRT501 fit into the larger picture of anti-aging treatments and life extension ?
If they work then they probably work by slowing down aging the same way that calorie restriction does .
The interest in the Sir1 and similar sirtuin genes comes from studies on calorie restriction 's effects on gene expression in yeast and rodents .
But we do not know for sure that calorie restriction will increase human life expectancies .
Now , if resveratrol and SRT501 do extend life that 's a good thing because they 'll help keep us alive until rejuvenation therapies such as gene therapies and stem cell therapies become available .
That companies are trying to develop drugs that mimic the effects of calorie restriction is a good thing .
I wish them luck and watch their progress closely .
But we still need the rejuvenation therapies and we need even greater efforts to develop rejuvenation therapies .
For more on that read about Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence ( SENS ) .
We wo n't need to slow the rate of aging when we can reverse aging .
Though slowing the rate of aging will still let us go longer between rejuvenation therapy episodes .

The TRUTH about Kwanzaa
http://www.jewishworldreview.com
-- BLACKS IN AMERICA have suffered an endless series of insults and degradations , the latest of which goes by the name of Kwanzaa .
Ron Karenga ( aka Dr. Maulana Ron Karenga ) invented the seven - day feast ( Dec. 26 - Jan. 1 ) in 1966 , branding it a black alternative to Christmas .
The idea was to celebrate the end of what he considered the Christmas - season exploitation of African Americans .
According to the official Kwanzaa Web site -- as opposed , say , to the Hallmark Cards Kwanzaa site -- the celebration was designed to foster " conditions that would enhance the revolutionary social change for the masses of Black Americans " and provide a " reassessment , reclaiming , recommitment , remembrance , retrieval , resumption , resurrection and rejuvenation of those principles ( Way of Life ) utilized by Black Americans ' ancestors . "
Karenga postulated seven principles : unity , self - determination , collective work and responsibility , cooperative economics , purpose , creativity and faith , each of which gets its day during Kwanzaa week .
He and his votaries also crafted a flag of black nationalism and a pledge : " We pledge allegiance to the red , black , and green , our flag , the symbol of our eternal struggle , and to the land we must obtain ; one nation of black people , with one G -d of us all , totally united in the struggle , for black love , black freedom , and black self - determination . "
Now , the point :
There is no part of Kwanzaa that is not fraudulent .
Begin with the name .
The celebration comes from the Swahili term " matunda yakwanza , " or " first fruit , " and the festival 's trappings have Swahili names -- such as " ujima " for " collective work and responsibility " or " muhindi , " which are ears of corn celebrants set aside for each child in a family .
Unfortunately , Swahili has little relevance for American blacks .
Most slaves were ripped from the shores of West Africa .
Swahili is an East African tongue .
To put that in perspective , the cultural gap between Senegal and Kenya is as dramatic as the chasm that separates , say , London and Tehran .
Imagine singing " G-d Save the Queen " in Farsi , and you grasp the enormity of the gaffe .
Worse , Kwanzaa ceremonies have no discernible African roots .
No culture on earth celebrates a harvesting ritual in December , for instance , and the implicit pledges about human dignity do n't necessarily jibe with such still - common practices as female circumcision and polygamy .
The inventors of Kwanzaa were n't promoting a return to roots ; they were shilling for Marxism .
They even appropriated the term " ujima , " which Julius Nyrere cited when he uprooted tens of thousands of Tanzanians and shipped them forcibly to collective farms , where they proved more adept at cultivating misery than banishing hunger .
Even the rituals using corn do n't fit .
Corn is n't indigenous to Africa .
Mexican Indians developed it , and the crop was carried worldwide by white colonialists .
The fact is , there is no Ur - African culture .
The continent remains stubbornly tribal .
Hutus and Tutsis still slaughter one another for sport .
Go to Kenya , where I taught briefly as a young man , and you 'll see endless hostility between Kikuyu , Luo , Luhya and Masai .
Even South African politics these days have more to do with tribal animosities than ideological differences .
Moreover , chaos too often prevails over order .
Warlords hold sway in Somalia , Eritrea , Liberia and Zaire .
Genocidal maniacs have wiped out millions in Rwanda , Uganda and Ethiopia .
The once - shining hopes for Kenya have vanished .
Detroit native Keith Richburg writes in his extraordinary book , " Out of America : A Black Man Confronts Africa , " that " this strange place defies even the staunchest of optimists ; it drains you of hope ... "
Richburg , who served for three years as the African bureau chief for The Washington Post , offers a challenge for the likes of Karenga : " Talk to me about Africa and my black roots and my kinship with my African brothers and I 'll throw it back in your face , and then I 'll rub your nose in the images of rotting flesh . "
His book concludes : " I have been here , and I have seen -- and frankly , I want no part of it .
....
By an accident of birth , I am a black man born in America , and everything I am today -- my culture and my attitudes , my sensibilities , loves and desires -- derives from that one simple and irrefutable fact . "
Nobody ever ennobled a people with a lie or restored stolen dignity through fraud .
Kwanzaa is the ultimate chump holiday -- Jim Crow with a false and festive wardrobe .
It praises practices -- " cooperative economics , and collective work and responsibility " -- that have succeeded nowhere on earth and would mire American blacks in endless backwardness .
Our treatment of Kwanzaa provides a revealing sign of how far we have yet to travel on the road to reconciliation .
The white establishment has thrown in with it , not just to cash in on the business , but to patronize black activists and shut them up .
This year , President Clinton signed his fourth Kwanzaa proclamation .
He crooned : " The symbols and ceremony of Kwanzaa , evoking the rich history and heritage of African Americans , remind us that our nation draws much of its strength from our diversity . "
But our strength , as Richburg points out , comes from real principles : tolerance , brotherhood , hard work , personal responsibility , equality before the law .
If Americans really cared about racial healing , they would focus on those ideas -- and not on a made - up rite that mistakes segregationism for spirituality and fiction for history .

As extremists increasingly claim it is not , and attack Western values not only through rhetoric but acts of violence , many Muslims find themselves being forced to respond by re-examining their values .
Here two Britons , both born into the Muslim faith , explain why they have ended up following different paths as far as their religion is concerned .
Nagina Shah Nagina
Shah , who walked away from her faith and family 14 years ago after a forced marriage , believes that traditional Islam and modern Western life do not mix .
Nagina 's story Aftab Malik Aftab Malik , who has discovered a new - found passion for Islam as an adult , says that traditional Islamic values can themselves help overcome extremism .
Aftab 's story NAGINA SHAH I was born into a strict Pakistani Muslim background but , when I was 19 , I decided to break away from my family .
My parents chose a husband for me - I was engaged at 14 and forced into marriage at 17
I have three brothers and three sisters , and am the youngest in the family .
I 'm the only one born in England , in 1972 , a few years after my parents had emigrated from Pakistan .
My upbringing was very strict , even by Asian community standards .
My family were Sunnis [ the majority branch of Islam ] and our faith and religion were largely influenced by - and intertwined with - our culture .
But it was backward , strict and suffocating .
I was not allowed to go out on my own or even travel on buses .
I went to an all - girls school , although my father believed girls should not really be educated .
Instead , all attention was focused on my brothers , who were expected to become doctors or lawyers .
My father preached one thing but did something else in practice .
He said we needed to be pure and pious but was himself quite volatile .
In contrast , my mother would never say boo to a goose .
The double standards really struck me .
I always felt suppressed and suffocated by my father and brothers , who ran the household .
I was never able to accept or understand why my brothers were treated better than me .
They were allowed to go out , mix with women , drive , go to college , have an opinion .
I was allowed to do none of these things .
Turning point
My parents chose a husband for me .
I was engaged to him at 14 and forced into marriage at 17 .
when I was 19 , I had had enough and I decided to run away from home .
On 8 August 1991 , I packed my bags and went .
I have since put myself through college and university and now consider myself as an independent career woman .
At the time , I left with hardly anything .
And having lived in a sheltered , reclusive environment , I suddenly had to face up to real life for the first time .
I now want to help other British Muslims who face a similar situation to me
I moved away from Leeds and lived in a hostel for a while .
I worked at the same time as going to college where I studied for my GCSEs and then A levels .
I later went on to read engineering at university .
When I was staying in the hostel , I met many other young Asian girls like me .
It was tragic because they wanted to break away from their families but they kept on going home and getting into a total mess .
There must be lots of other men and women who want to break away from their culture .
I now want to help other British Muslims who face a similar situation to me .
Torn identity I went through the most enormous life - changing experience .
I must have been numb and in shock for about two years .
I became a totally different person , and found I was also quite spiritual and could relate to many religions at different levels .
THE ISLAM DEBATE BBC Four , Wednesday , 14 September Nagina Shah and Aftab Malik are on panel
It will address issues raised in BBC Two 's Battle for Islam , which screened on Monday
Have your say and join the debate Since leaving home I have not been in touch with my family .
I would not be able to live my life the way I choose if my family have anything to do with it .
I do not blame my parents for not seeing my point of view .
They both come from a very different culture .
There is a cultural clash between my parents ' generation and mine .
The Eastern and Western cultures are so extremely different that it is difficult to find middle ground .
I believe my parents were so strict because they did not want to lose their identity , their Pakistani roots .
But by doing this they did not allow me my own identity .
The danger of organised religion is that they all teach exclusivity and preach that theirs is the one true faith .
To have one true faith means that all other faiths are wrong , hence the fighting we see around the world .
I believe the only way we will achieve peace and mutual respect on this planet is if we are all willing to change our beliefs .
I am not saying we should completely throw away our belief systems but what we need to do is let go of the beliefs that no longer work and keep the ones that do .
AFTAB MALIK
It was not until university that I began to think about what it meant to be a Muslim .
Until then , life was pretty much plain sailing .
I prayed and would fast in the month of Ramadan , but only half - heartedly .
Rather than architects of destruction , traditional Muslims were builders of a magnificent civilization synonymous with life
Experiences at the mosque taught me that Islam was something that came from the sub - continent : backward and ritualistic .
But my perception and understanding of Islam changed as I soon discovered that Islam had an intellectual and spiritual tradition .
Little did I know that I 'd become part of an increasing number of Muslims in the West who , in the past decade or so , have been seeking the revivification of an authentic , traditional wisdom ; one that rises above sectarian divisions and discredits the angry rhetoric of the orphans of modernity .
Rather than being architects of destruction , traditional Muslims were builders of a magnificent civilization synonymous with life , celebration , purity and knowledge .
Some Muslims today , in their rhetoric or by their actions , portray a faith whose adherents want a religion to die for , as opposed to live for .
These Muslims are replacing the legacy of that civilization with anger and hatred .
Confusion rife
Unfortunately , despite the huge upsurge of interest in Islam , there remains much confusion as to what it 's really about .
A twisted and mutated offspring is wreaking havoc in the name of Islam
While " the war on terrorism " has shifted relations between Islam and the West in tectonic proportions , the responses by Muslims have been different .
Some argue that 9/11 signalled the ultimate showdown between Islam and the West ; others reactively repeat the mantra " Islam is a religion of peace " .
And another segment of the community has decided it is time for some serious and critical reflection .
These messages have been mixed and confuse many people , who cannot understand why so many Muslims are angry .
Despite the immense suffering in the Muslim world , nothing can justify the heinous actions that result in the spilling of innocent blood .
Devoid of the necessary skills and tools to decipher the religious texts , minions of chaos have side - stepped over 1,000 years of scholasticism and Koranic exegesis [ critical explanation of a text ] to create their own deluded Sharia - a new law couched in Islamic terminology established solely to be the antithesis of the West .
Under this law , there is only hatred and rejection .
Under this law , Muslims and non-Muslims alike are its victims .
Classical traditions
For the integrity of Islam , these individuals and their organisations need to be seen as they are : marginal and heretical .
Traditional Islam can help calm the frantic nature so prevalent in Muslim psyche today
So far are they from classical notions of ethics and morality , manifestations of this extreme reading of Islam are more in line with " Islamicised " Marxist - Leninist notions of revolution and anti-imperialist struggle than with anything derived from the Koran and the Sunna through a classical legal tradition .
Muslim reformers who dismantled and undermined the Islamic tradition with its legal philosophy , an apparatus of law and system of spirituality during the 19th and 20th Centuries , paved the way for a twisted and mutated offspring that is wreaking havoc on the Earth in the name of Islam .
So what is traditional Islam ?
It really means orthodoxy , consisting of the four Sunni legal schools of thought ( madhahibs ) , two schools of doctrine ( aqida ) and the science of ihsan ( excellence or perfection ) , otherwise known as tasawwuf .
Traditional Islam teaches how to view tribulation and oppression through prophetic eyes and not how to contribute to it .
By restoring the equilibrium between the heart and soul , the intellect and creation , traditional Islam can help calm the frantic nature so prevalent in Muslim psyche today and , once again , marginalise and eject extremism from the Muslim discourse .

Members of Islamist political organizations , in particular , consider American actions a godsend , putting their own repressive governments under pressure and distancing their capitals from Washington , reformers say .
The Americans “ wanted to tarnish the Islamic resistance and opposition movements , but in reality they only served them , ” said Sobhe Salih , a 53 - year - old lawyer in the Muslim Brotherhood , which was swept into the Egyptian Parliament in an election last fall after capturing an unprecedented 20 percent of the seats .
“ They made them more appealing to the public , made them a beacon of hope for everyone who hates American policies . ”
Glance at any television screen — they are everywhere — and chances are that the screen will be showing mayhem in Lebanon , Baghdad or Gaza .
It usually takes a minute or so to decipher which Arab city is burning .
Popular satellite news channels like Al Jazeera say repeatedly that the carnage arrives via American policy and American weapons .
Before 2003 , the hardest step for any Islamist movement was recruitment , noted Mohamed Salah , an expert on Islamic extremist movements who writes for the pan-Arab daily Al Hayat from Cairo .
Moving someone from being merely devout to being an extremist took a long time .
No longer , he said .
Moderate Arab governments , which have pursued peace with Israel for nearly 30 years , have seen that policy undermined among their publics by Hezbollah ’s ability to strike at Israel .
“ Recruitment has become the easiest stage because the people have already been psychologically predisposed against the Americans , the West and against Israel , ” Mr. Salah said .
Moderate reformers say they are driven to despair by what they see as inconsistencies in Washington ’s Middle East policy .
For example , in Lebanon lives a black - turbaned Shiite cleric who runs a secretive militia close to Iran .
His name is Sheik Hassan Nasrallah and Washington approves of Israel ’s bombing campaign to stamp out his organization , Hezbollah .

There is another black - turbaned Shiite cleric who runs a different secretive militia close to Iran .
His name is Abdel Aziz al - Hakim , and he lives in Iraq .
He is an American friend .
It would be naive to think that ‘ outsourcing ’ is a new phenomenon ; at least the kind we see in Iraq today can be traced back to the 1940’s .
In 1947 , the National Security Act created the CIA .
Little known or discussed is the fact that one of the fist acts of the National Security Council was the subversion of Italian democracy .
In 1948 , Italy was leaning towards a leftist government .
Washington spent millions of dollars on propaganda to ensure that the election results were consistent with US desires .
While the US bullied its way without resorting to violence , it later came to light that the CIA had organized a secret paramilitary army of 15,000 troops in Italy called ‘ Operation Gladio ( derived from the Latin gladius meaning sword ) with hidden stockpiles of weapons and explosives ready to resort to violence in the event that the elections did not go Washington ’s way .
Operation Gladio continued into several other European countries .
Many members of Operation Gladio were also in a shadowy organization known as P - 2 .
One of P - 2's specialties was the art of provocation .
Leftist organizations were infiltrated , financed and / or created , and the resulting acts of terrorism were blamed on the left .
The aim of this ‘ successful ’ strategy was to show how violent and dangerous the left was and to turn the people against them .
The strategy of terrorism , provocation , and propaganda is at work in Iraq today .
This carefully planned strategy started with the bombing of the Askariya Shrine — the deliberate start of the Sunni -Shia divide .
In 1982 , Oded Yinon , a senior advisor at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a journalist , articulated the Zionist plan to Balkanize the Middle East by breaking up the Arab states of Egypt , Syria , Iraq , Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States .
“ The dissolution of Syria and Iraq later on into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in Lebanon , is Israel ’s primary target on the Eastern front in the long run , while the dissolution of the military power of those states serves as the primary short - term target , ” Yinon wrote .
While the blame was put squarely on the Sunnis for the bombing of the mosque , the Shias are blamed for taking revenge on the Sunnis , but not just any Shias , the ‘ Shia extremists backed by Iran ’ .
This is the President ’s call to war on Iran — Operation Galio or false flag at work .
But the operation is not yet complete .
It has been announced that the President has authorized the troops to kill or capture Iranians in Iraq .
This White House has a minimum of 3,800 P - 2 operatives in Iraq — they are the MEK .
( It is worthwhile repeating that MEK — Mojahedeen-e Kahlg — are a terrorist organization responsible for the assassination of Americans who have been given special persons status by President Bush .
See : US State Department : Chapter 6 , Terrorist Groups . )
Operation Gladio is a success at the word go !
A single MEK member can be captured with explosives provided by the US and Iran would be implicated .
Mr. Bush would have the American people on his side , and indeed , the world , while the whistle of bombs would shut out the cry of the innocent and they run for cover in Iran .
It is an irony that the speech by Pope Benedict XVI which caused so much outrage in the Moslem world , Sunni and Shia alike , made reference to the Prophet Mohammad ’s sword , yet the ‘ sword ’ in Operation Gladio now being taken up in Iraq to slaughter Moslems in the most devious fashion has not invoked the good Pope to speak up against the evil taking place under his nose .
However , as the Pope ’s speech demonstrated , this White House must realize that people steadfastly unite in the face of a greater enemy .
This administration must also bear in mind that had there been a divide between the Moslem sects , and a fear of a Shia ascent , A.Q. Khan and the predominantly Pakistani government would not have allowed the export of nuclear technology and equipment to Shia Iran .
The effect of the propaganda that is temporarily driving the people of the Middle East apart will wane .
At that point , the frenzy that drove their passion and hatred will be directed towards the very source that instigated their hatred .
This White House must be cautious that an attack on Iran will bring with it the retaliation of the Islamic Sword for generations to come .
The American people must demand a different legacy from their President than the one he is condemning them to .

Mythmaking on the Saudi Oil Frontier
By Robert Vitalis
STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS ; 353 Pages ; $ 29.95
The 125th anniversary issue of CVX , Chevron 's corporate magazine , recounts a story of adventure and the bridging of cultures .
In 1934 , the Standard Oil Company of California ( Socal ) sent chief geologist Max Steineke and his team to Saudi Arabia , where , after enduring four years of baking heat and mirages in the salt flats of the eastern desert , he finally discovered oil .
Steineke bonded deeply with his Arabian hosts -- " he left the most beautiful touches in the heart , " said ' Abd al - ' Aziz Shalfan , one of Socal 's first Saudi employees -- and thus established the foundation for a mutually beneficial partnership between Saudi Arabia and American oil companies that would last for decades .
So shimmers the historical halo around the Arabian American Oil Company , formed in 1944 to exploit the oil riches of Saudi Arabia 's Eastern Province .
But it is a halo , argues political scientist Robert Vitalis , that has required careful and deliberate cleaning over the years .
From the beginning , ARAMCO 's camps in Dhahran were set up according to a strict hierarchy of racial divisions .
Ostensibly based on skill levels , this system allocated the best housing and amenities to Americans -- of all ranks -- while European and South Asian workers had to make do with significantly less , and Saudi workers were consigned to " barastis , " palm - frond huts without floors or lights .
A visiting State Department official called the company 's camp " a disgrace to American enterprise , " while the American vice consul at Dhahran visited the company hospital and reported that " it is apparent that ARAMCO 's medical director takes little interest in the health and care of Arabs . "
ARAMCO fought hard to preserve its image as an exemplar of enlightened self - interest , and as a bringer of development to Saudi Arabia .
It argued that other oil firms in the region treated their workers even more poorly , and blamed the Saudi government for forcing segregation on ARAMCO for religious reasons .
Vitalis rejects the company 's " exceptionalist " thesis , pointing out that in countries like Iran -- which , before a CIA - backed coup in 1953 , had a parliament , a press and unions -- oil company reforms had gone much further than in Saudi Arabia .
Further , ARAMCO 's camp design was not a unique response to local religious culture , but was rather a direct descendant of the segregated camps set up by mining and oil firms in the American Southwest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Quite naturally , the company also found itself plagued by the same kinds of labor problems afflicting its predecessors in the United States .
Between 1945 and 1956 ( when Saudi Arabia made inciting a demonstration or strike punishable by two years in jail ) , ARAMCO 's Saudi and foreign workers staged a number of significant strikes and transportation boycotts .
The company and the U.S. Embassy reacted by blaming foreign agents and imported communist ideology , unwilling to credit the notion that workers could be motivated by a desire to improve their conditions and achieve greater equality .
As one former ARAMCO executive reminisced , " for a lot of people in the oil business back then ... if you were n't pro-ARAMCO you were pro-communist . "
A similar defensiveness would come to mark the company 's dealings with the Saudi bureaucracy .
Though relations with the House of Saud remained close , the well - educated , nationalist bureaucrats who were assuming positions of power during the 1950s and early 1960s ( men like Abdallah Tariki , who would soon become minister of petroleum and one of the founders of OPEC ) came into frequent conflict with the Americans , who feared a Nasser - inspired revolution and the nationalization of ARAMCO .
Tariki only added to these fears by seeming incorruptible ; when warned by ARAMCO negotiators that increasing " Arabization " of the company would mean a loss of revenue for the kingdom , Tariki responded that he was " not interested in profits but in principles . "
The American government , meanwhile , had similar worries .
With Middle Eastern monarchies being toppled or threatened by nationalist movements , Washington wanted stability preserved in Saudi Arabia , whose regime not only served as a bulwark against communism but had a direct bearing on the future of " our largest single overseas private enterprise , " as presidential adviser Walt Rostow described ARAMCO .
But since the preservation of monarchies was not one of America 's public goals , King Saud found himself hailed instead as a great modernizer , even as he squandered oil revenues on military hardware and empty palaces ; likewise , Saud 's successor , Crown Prince Faisal , who was proclaimed a reformer even as he clamped down on the press , locked up dissidents and shut down the country 's fleeting experiment with local elections .
" America 's Kingdom " is a fascinating exercise in what Vitalis refers to as " reverse - engineering " the power of such myths and the process of their construction , a process driven by corporation magazines , popular histories and even the reporting of major newspapers .
He is particularly critical of the New York Times , whose reporter Dana Adams Schmidt managed to parrot the U.S. government line almost perfectly , extolling Saud and then Faisal in such similar language that the paper " might as well have pulled the old story out , changed some names , and refiled it when Faisal arrived . "
Nor , unfortunately , have we grown out of this vice : American and British elites today praise visionary Iraqi and Afghan leaders to the heavens -- right up until the moment it becomes necessary to explain away policy failures by hinting at how disappointing our clients have turned out to be .
Myth , it turns out , is a remarkably flexible tool , and this alone will ensure its permanence in our political culture .
The key to a healthy heart ?
A team led by Imperial College London , which studied 4,680 people aged 40 - 59 , said it was not clear why eating more vegetable protein had such an effect .
But amino acids - the building blocks of protein - or vegetable components , like magnesium , may be key , they said .
However , they found no strong evidence that high meat consumption is linked to high blood pressure .
The study features in Archives of Internal Medicine .
Understanding more about these vegetarian proteins could help guide us in how to prevent or treat heart and circulatory disease
Belinda Linden
British Heart Foundation
Some types of amino acid have been shown to influence blood pressure , for instance arginine has been shown to dilate the blood vessels .
Different proportions of amino acids are found in meat and vegetarian matter .
Healthy lifestyle
Writing in the journal , the researchers , led by Professor Paul Elliott , said more research was needed to pin down exactly why vegetables helped lower blood pressure .
High blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke .
But they stressed : " Our results are consistent with current recommendations that a diet high in vegetable products be part of a healthy lifestyle for prevention of high blood pressure and related chronic diseases . "
Belinda Linden , medical spokesperson for the British Heart Foundation , said previous research had also shown that blood pressure was better controlled with a vegetarian diet .
She said : " Vegetables contain less salt and more antioxidant vitamins , are low in calories , high in fibre and also help to control diabetes .
" Having proteins found in vegetables rather than those derived from animals may offer a number of natural benefits for people who are at a high risk of coronary heart disease , stroke or diabetes .
" Understanding more about these vegetarian proteins could help guide us in how to prevent or treat heart and circulatory disease and allow us to lead an appropriate healthy lifestyle . "
During the study , volunteers had their blood pressure read eight times .
Each participant wrote down everything they had eaten and drunk over the previous 24 hours before each check - up , including dietary supplements .
Q . What ’s your perception of where we ’re headed with even conservative predictions for growth of both populations and energy use ?
A. I think we ’re headed straight back to the Earth ’s second stable state , which is a hot state that it ’s been in many times before in the past .
It ’s about 14 degrees warmer than it is in these parts of the world now .
It means roughly that most life on the planet will have to move up to the Arctic basin , to the few islands that are still habitable and to oases on the continents .
It will be a much - diminished world .
Q. Can you explain why you think nuclear power is so vital ?
A . The really bad thing we did way back when was starting to burn things in the atmosphere to get energy .
We started with fire , just cooking food , and probably could have gotten away with that .
But once we started burning forests to drive the animals out as a cheap way of hunting , then we started on our downward course .
What we ’re doing now with fossil fuels is just as bad .
We live in a nuclear - powered universe .
We ’re the oddballs by getting energy from burning carbon .
My justification of nuclear power is that we ’ve reached a stage now where the dire things that threaten us are so great that even the results of an all - out nuclear war pale into insignificance as unimportant compared to what ’s going to happen .
Q . You seem to say we have to get over the idea that renewable energy sources — wind , solar — in the short run , are a useful way out of this .
Roma – “ Rispetto a Windows , con Linux cambiano i nomi dei programmi… per il resto è tutto molto simile .
All ’inizio ho avuto un po ’ di problemi .
Adesso sto incominciando ad abituarmi .
I programmi sono migliori secondo me , con molte funzioni in più .
Il fatto di non pagare , poi , è bellissimo !
E poter scaricare da casa nostra tutto ciò che si vuole gratis è ancora più bello ! ” .
La “ rivoluzione ” passa da queste semplici parole scritte da un alunno delle scuole elementari altoatesine che ha iniziato a “ masticare ” programmi open source da poco .
Insieme ai suoi compagni sta scoprendo il software non proprietario e inizia ad infarinarsi di concetti centrali , come la condivisione del sapere , la libertà di sviluppo e molto altro ancora .
Già , perché in Alto Adige stanno tentando una sfida che ha del pionieristico : i sistemi informatici di tutte le scuole ( elementari e medie ) in lingua italiana della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano / Bozen , sono stati aggiornati con il sistema operativo libero FUSS - Soledad GNU / Linux , una personalizzazione , realizzata da un team di esperti , della più conosciuta distribuzione Debian GNU / Linux .
Free Upgrade Southtyrol ’s Schools ( FUSS ) è un progetto finanziato dal Fondo Sociale Europeo .
“ L’idea di fondo del progetto è pensare l’informatica come strumento trasversale per l’insegnamento ” , si legge nel sito , “ e non solo come disciplina specifica o come semplice addestramento all ’utilizzo di alcuni pacchetti software , fornendo in questo modo un valido supporto alla didattica .
In conformità a questa scelta distribuiamo a studenti , docenti e famiglie il software utilizzato a scuola , favorendo in questo modo una cultura informatica basata sulla condivisione e la diffusione delle conoscenze ” .
Ad oggi circa 16.000 ragazzi hanno trovato nelle loro scuole 2.460 PC nei quali gira solo ed esclusivamente software libero .
Una scelta dettata anche dal miglior adeguamento del software per le esigenze specifiche dei singoli corsi di studio .
Una vera novità per insegnanti ed alunni che hanno dovuto superare il blocco psicologico del “ diverso ” , oltrepassato brillantemente da tutti , ma non sempre facilmente .
Ora i giovani studenti sembrano essere più che soddisfatti .
Un segnale importante .
Per capire la portata del progetto basta elencare qualche numero : sono 83 scuole coinvolte , 2460 pc , 70 server , 1.600 docenti , 16.000 studenti , 20.000 live - cd distribuiti tra gennaio e febbraio 2006 , 120 cdrom utilizzati per le installazioni , 12 mila chilometri percorsi dai tecnici che hanno dovuto lavorare nei diversi plessi scolastici .
A Paolo Zilotti , responsabile IT dell ’ Intendenza Scolastica della Provincia di Bolzano , abbiamo chiesto di illustrarci meglio difficoltà e successi .
Punto Informatico : Come prima cosa chiariamo il perché di questo progetto
Paolo Zillotti : La scelta di usare software libero nella scuola è anzitutto , al di là delle ragioni economiche o tecniche , una scelta etica e politica .
È cioè la scelta di rifarsi , nell ’insegnamento , ai valori della libertà e della condivisione del sapere , e non solo quella di usare software efficiente , stabile e sicuro .
PI : Diciamo quindi software libero come valore educativo ?
PZ : La filosofia che sta alla base del software libero , quella della libertà di accesso alle informazioni e della condivisione della conoscenza , si adatta naturalmente al compito educativo di una nuova scuola .
Inoltre usare software libero rappresenta la scelta di utilizzare patrimonio comune dell ’umanità , il cui miglioramento e diffusione vanno a beneficio di tutti , e non di una singola entità .
PI : Come è iniziata questa avventura altoatesina ?
PZ : Il piano di azione per lo sviluppo della società dell ’informazione in Alto Adige “ e- Suedtirol 2004 - 2008 ” , fa esplicito riferimento al ruolo fondamentale della scuola nella fase di alfabetizzazione informatica della società altoatesina e auspica la creazione di Centri di Competenza per supportare l’innovazione , in particolar modo per quanto concerne l’introduzione di software libero nella pubblica amministrazione e nella scuola .
PI : … dal luglio 2005 avete iniziato la fase operativa …
PZ : La Sovrintendenza scolastica italiana , in convenzione con la Formazione professionale in lingua italiana , ha deciso di promuovere la realizzazione congiunta di sperimentazioni , progetti , percorsi formativi e materiali didattici , ai fini di aumentare le conoscenze e le competenze degli operatori scolastici circa i programmi per computer distribuiti con licenza libera .
Abbiamo attraversato diverse fasi ora siamo al dunque .
PI : Come hanno reagito gli insegnanti ?
PZ : Superato il momento di panico iniziale ed il carico di lavoro maggiore dovuto all ’apprendimento di nuove modalità operative , l’operazione è stata accettata senza grosse difficoltà .
PI : Sono stati organizzati corsi di aggiornamento ?
PZ : Certo , corsi brevi di 10/20h ( desktop , open office , specifici per discipline di insegnamento , programmi specifici ) , amministrazione di sistema , per un totale di circa 2.400 h. ai quali hanno partecipato oltre il 50 % dei docenti in forma assolutamente volontaria .
Addirittura fra qualche giorno sono previsti “ Installation party ” in tutto il territorio provinciale , vere e proprie feste e momenti di confronto .
PI : Lei che è il responsabile per le 83 scuole coinvolte , può spiegare a chi volesse tentare di replicare il vostro progetto quali sono state le difficoltà maggiori ?
PZ : Le fasi più impegnative sono state l’installazione dei sistemi ( luglio - agosto ) portata a termine in 23 giorni , l’adeguamento alle esigenze delle singole scuole ; la revisione quotidiana : piano operativo , metodologie , segnalazione / discussione e risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate .
PI : E gli alunni come hanno reagito ?
PZ : Come si può vedere anche qui i pareri sono tutti entusiasti .
Tutti erano abituati a Windows ed i primi momenti di transizione sono stati i più difficili .
Ma lo smarrimento è durato pochissimo .
Ora hanno capito quante potenzialità in più possono sfruttare .
Penso abbiano recepito anche la logica e la filosofia di fondo .
Ma la cosa che li ha divertiti di più è stata quella di non pagare e di poter scaricare tutto da Internet semplicemente … molti proprio non riuscivano a crederci .
PI : Per finire ci dia una panoramica dell ’ hardware utilizzato
PZ : Non è stato acquistato hardware ad - hoc ma utilizzato quello già presente nelle scuole .
Per i desktop , una compilation che va da PIII 400 fino a Athlon64 / PIV 3000 , lo stesso per i server ( biprocessori PIV , Xeon ) .
Per quanto riguarda le distribuzioni , parliamo di i386 basata su Debian GNU / Linux che prevede due versioni : standard e live installabile .
Base comune tra server e client :
– server : servizi vari ( ldap , bind , samba , nfs , http , db , proxy / cache , content filter , firewall , router )
– client : applicativi vari organizzati per task .
Le personalizzazioni : installer , kernel , desktop , task a seconda del tipo di scuola , accesso semplificato alle funzioni principali , desktop predefinito GNOME ( KDE è incluso ) , 5 lingue installate di default e configurate ( it , de , en , fr , es ) .

Past Peak points to a story about the unfolding impact of global warming on the arctic .
hey never used to need air conditioners up in the Arctic .
But earlier this year , officials in the Canadian Inuit territory of Nunavik authorized the installation of air conditioners in official buildings for the first time .
Artificial cooling was necessary , they decided , because summertime temperatures in some southern Arctic villages have climbed into the 80s in recent years .
Inuit families in the region never used to need to shop in grocery stores , either .
But the Arctic seas that always stayed frozen well into the summer have started breaking open much earlier , cutting off hunters from the seasonal caribou herds on which their families depend for sustenance .
And experienced Inuit hunters , as comfortable reading ice conditions as professional golfers are reading greens , had seldom fallen through the ice and drowned .
But this year in Alaska , more than a dozen vanished into the sea .
" These are men used to running their trap lines , people who know the area well , yet they are literally falling through , they are just gone , " said Patricia Cochran , executive director of the Alaska Native Science Commission in Anchorage and chairwoman of the Inuit Circumpolar Council .
" The ice conditions are just so drastically different from all of their hunting lifetimes . "
It took a while , but global warming , the relentless greenhouse gas phenomenon that most scientists believe has altered climates across much of the rest of the world , appears to have finally breached the northern polar redoubt .
And the effects on aboriginal societies trying to hold fast to traditional ways have been jarring .
The people of this far northern Canadian hamlet of 250 used to hunt eider ducks every summer , using the meat and eggs for food and the soft feathers for clothing .
But this past summer was the third in a row that the Inuit could n't reach the nesting grounds because the ice around them was too thin .
The seals have changed , as well .
" Now when we are trying to take the fur off the seals , it 's very hard to do , " said David Kalluk , 65 , a village elder and veteran hunter .
" It 's like it 's burned onto them .
Maybe this is because the sea is warmer . "
Wayne Davidson , the resident meteorologist in Resolute Bay for 20 years , says monthly temperatures throughout the year are 5 to 11 degrees higher than recent historical averages .
For example , Davidson said , the average daily temperature last March was minus 13.4 degrees Fahrenheit , compared with an average of minus 24.2 degrees from 1947 to 1991 .
" Science for us in the Arctic is experience , " Davidson said .
" Resolute used to be a horrible place to live as far as weather is concerned , absolutely brutal .
Now it 's much milder . " [...]
" The basic question of global warming is no longer a subject of dispute in the scientific literature , " said Naomi Oreskes , a professor of the history of science at the University of California , San Diego , who reviewed 928 scientific papers about climate change published between 1993 and 2003 and found none challenging evidence of human contributions to global warming .
" The discussion has moved on to how quickly will things change in the future , the rate of ice melting and differing climate models , " Oreskes said .
" There 's almost nobody left anymore who does n't accept that global warming is real . "
It certainly feels real enough to the people of Resolute Bay .
From their perch on the edge of the Barrow Strait , they watched this summer as the waters of their rocky bay melted and filled with drifting icebergs — a view as depressing as it was picturesque , because in years past the water remained frozen solid enough to traverse aboard sleds and snowmobiles to their traditional hunting grounds .
" The heat of the sun is different now , " said Kalluk , the village elder , trying to make sense of the changes .
" I think there is global warming , because snow that has never melted before is starting to melt now . "
MOST of the power generated by mankind originates from the sun .
It was sunlight that nurtured the early life that became today 's oil , gas and coal .
It is the solar heating of the Earth 's atmosphere and oceans that fuels wave power , wind farms and hydroelectric schemes .
But using the sun 's energy directly to generate power is rare .
Solar cells account for less than 1 % of the world 's electricity production .
Recent technological improvements , however , may boost this figure .
The root of the problem is that most commercial solar cells are made from silicon , and silicon is expensive .
Cells can be made from other , cheaper materials , but these are not as efficient as those made from silicon .
The disparity is stark .
Commercial silicon cells have efficiencies of 15 % to 20 % .
In the laboratory , some have been made with an efficiency of 30 % .
The figure for non-traditional cells is far lower .
A typical cell based on electrically conductive plastic has an efficiency of just 3 % or 4 % .
What is needed is a way to boost the efficiency of cells made from cheap materials , and three new ways of doing so were unveiled this week in San Francisco , at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society .
... The technique used by Dr Lee and Dr Heeger boosts the efficiency of plastic cells to 5.6 % .
That is still poor compared with silicon , but it is a big improvement on what was previously possible .
Dr Lee concedes that there is still a long way to go , but says that even an efficiency of 7 % would bring plastic cells into competition with their silicon cousins , given how cheap they are to manufacture .
A second approach , taken by Michael Grätzel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , is to copy nature .
Plants absorb solar energy during photosynthesis .
They use it to split water into hydrogen ions , electrons and oxygen .
The electrons released by this reaction are taken up by carrier molecules and then passed along a chain of such molecules before being used to power the chemical reactions that ultimately make sugar .
Dye - sensitised solar cells seek to mimic this assembly line .
The dye acts like chlorophyll , the pigment that makes plants green and that is responsible for absorbing sunlight and liberating electrons .
The electrons are passed via a semiconductor to an electrode , through which they leave the cell .
By using a dye called phthalocyanine , which absorbs not only visible light but also infra-red wavelengths , Dr Grätzel has been able to raise the efficiency of the process to 11 % .
That , he says , should be enough to make dye - sensitised cells competitive with silicon .
The third technique , being developed by Prashant Kamat of the University of Notre Dame , Indiana , and his colleagues , uses that fashionable scientific tool , the carbon nanotube .
Group IV Semiconductor , Inc. , Ottawa , CA , has announced a three - year , $ 9.1 million initiative aimed at developing solid state lighting products made of silicon that use 90 per cent less energy than a traditional incandescent light bulb and last up to 50 times longer .
The goal of Group IV 's silicon - based technology is to dramatically reduce the cost of solid - state lighting — overcoming the critical price barrier and enabling widespread adoption .
While compact fluorescent bulbs ( CFLs ) have caught on lately with their promise of energy savings , they ’re still only about 20 to 25 percent efficient .
Lamps that use solid - state lighting ( SSL ) technology , by comparison , can achieve efficiency levels as high as 80 percent .
The global lighting market is worth about $ 12 - billion , Group IV estimates .
The company says about 20 per cent of the world 's electricity demand is for lighting through light bulbs .
Indonesia has notified Japanese companies that it intends to halve exports of liquefied natural gas to Japan by as early as 2010 , sources said Thursday ... With the soaring price of crude oil , and growing concerns over environmental problems , countries including China , South Korea and the United States have started importing LNG .
This increase in demand from other nations , and subsequent reduction in LNG imports from Indonesia , is likely to have a significant impact on Japan 's energy strategy , observers note . "
( Hmmm ... you think ? )
" Japan hopes to compensate for the reduced amount with imports from other locations such as the Sakhalin - 2 project plant in Russia .
However , with the Russian government recently cancelling a permit for an oil and gas development project by an international joint venture , the prospects for domestic gas and electric company procurement have become increasingly gloomy .
.... Japanese companies are currently negotiating with the Indonesian government on the assumption that imports will be cut by half in the renewed contracts .
But with the Indonesian government suggesting it may call for further dramatic reductions , negotiations could become even more complicated , the sources said .
Bear with me for a second here .
This is n't an easy topic .
That 's because no one understands Credit - Default Swaps ( CDSs ) , or other complex credit - derivatives , but it is important that we try to understand the implications of their exponential increase .
Sure , some people claim to understand : hedge fund managers , investment bankers , etc .
They understand the derivatives marketplace just like neuroscientists understand consciousness — they know the component parts , they can use them as tools barely under their control , but when it comes to understanding exactly how the greater dynamic emerges from the component parts they are in the dark .
No one really understands the credit - derivative market , but everyone is impacted by it .
Credit - derivatives represent the creation of money out of thin air , like some act of financial wizardry .
Take a Credit - Default Swap , for example .
Here ’s how it works : Corp .
A needs to raise funds to expand operations , so they issue a $ 10 million bond .
Pension Fund B buys that bond , but is concerned with the risk of Corp .
A going bankrupt and defaulting on the bond .
So Hedge Fund C offers what is , in effect an insurance policy — Pension Fund B pays Hedge Fund C $ 200,000 , and in exchange if Corp .
A defaults on the bond , Hedge Fund C covers the $ 10 million for Bank B .
Here ’s the magic : because this insurance policy creates the market for this otherwise too - risky bond from Corp .
A in the first place , and because the par-value of the credit - default swap ( the insurance policy ) that the Hedge fund issues does nothing more than eat up the difference between the risk - premium on this bond , this $ 200,000 that the hedge fund makes is essentially fabricated out of thin air .
Do n’t forget to sprinkle in a liberal portion of fractional - reserve - banking fairy dust and viola : now you understand the credit - derivatives market as well as anyone else in the world .
Clear as mud ?
Try this on for size : there were $ 25 Trillion dollars in credit derivatives issued so far in 2006 .
That ’s about half the size of the world economy .
Oh , and it ’s unreported , unregulated , and largely non-transparent .
But wait , it gets better
A few months ago , I plugged David Korten 's latest book The Great Turning : From Empire to Earth Community , which deals with one of my favorite topics , namely extricating oneself from the great " rat race " as much as possible .
This resulted in a good conversation about the book .
But while the book serves as a fine overview of how we came to be in the present mess , the final three chapters on what to do about it were on the weak side .
They did n't leave the reader with a clear set of ideas on what to do after they had finished reading it .
Now a new book is out which performs this task admirably although there is no connection between the two .
It 's called The Flip : Turn Your World Around and is co-written by Jared Rosen and David Rippe .
I would say that the book title refers to a mental or gestalt flip we can all do instantly to change how we view situations and circumstances .
I am about half - way through this book and like very much the way it 's organized .
The eleven chapters focus on the key areas of life such as our values , health , finances , media exposure , diets , religion , and work life , etc .
The first half of every chapter explains how to look at these areas differently -- in a healthier and more balanced manner -- and then the second half provides short interviews with people who did " the Flip " and serve as living proof that it can be done .
Each chapter is short and easy to digest but offers a fresh perspective .
I find that often all that 's required to make a change in one 's life is to first simply realize that there are other ways of being and doing .
This book is a good starting point for doing the flip .
Let me share a personal example with you .
Back in 1982 one of my philosophy profs was talking about the detrimental effect watching television has on your life .
He summed his position up with the immortal words , " If you watch television , Madison Avenue has your mind colonized . "
I thought about it for a few days and then cancelled my cable subscription and left the set connected only to the VCR ( now replaced by a DVD player which is used to watch two movies per week from Netflix . )
I have never regretted the decision to rid myself of the lobotomy box .
The United States is an unusual country in that it does not have a government in the normal sense of the word .
This is because many politicians who ostensibly represent the people are primarily answerable to , and therefore controlled by , the big business interests who ultimately determine their fate .
These interests are collectively known as the Military - Industrial complex and this power grid is the effective government of the United States .
The Defense , Oil and Pharmaceutical lobbies in particular have immense power in Washington .
This state of affairs explains why the food supply in the United States is adulterated with genetically modified crops and harmful additives such as Aspartame , and other substances that promote obesity .
When the Cold War ended in the early 90's , the people had a reasonable right to expect a " peace dividend " - reduced defense expenditure , because the United States no longer had any enemies of significance .
The defense industry did n't like this at all , they were getting a big slice of the pie , and it is reasonable to suppose that they would bring whatever leverage they could to bear to ensure that their cut did not decrease , and if they could get it increased , so much the better .
It is therefore obvious that the events of 11th September 2001 were like a Las Vegas jackpot to them .
Barely had the victims been buried than big increases in the Defense budget were announced .
Big defense budgets require an enemy to justify them , and if there is no enemy , well , you just have to invent one , hence the " War on Terror " .
Clearly , it is not enough to have an enemy in name only , you need , in addition , to get them stirred up and energized , and hence readily identifiable to the masses back home as an enemy .
This is achieved by perpetrating atrocities and outrages against them , and making sure that these are publicized sufficiently to get the populations of the target countries or racial or religious groups sufficiently incensed to take to the streets and want revenge , the goal being to foment as much polarization as possible .
This is the underlying reason for the interrogation and torture of prisoners , and for the recent pulverizing of Lebanon by Axis forces emanating from Israel .
The elites within the Axis powers , who , to whatever extent they are religious , are either Christians or Zionists , view Arabs and Muslims in the same way that a gardener regards ants or termites - at best as an irrelevance to be tolerated , perhaps utilized as a source of slave labor , and at worst as a pest to be exterminated .
When you understand this point you can readily appreciate why the Axis powers would be quite happy to foment an inter -Arab war , Shiites versus Sunnis , for example , and then stand back and watch with satisfaction as they wipe each other out - as long as they do n't damage the oilfields .
Not that they have much more respect for citizens in their own countries , who they broadly class into two groups .
One is civilians who are farmed for their labor and tax revenue ; the working classes of course , but also the broad swath of the middle class , the stewards of the system , who like to think that they are in control of their own lives , but are in reality just operatives for the elites .
The other group is military personnel who are the unwitting henchmen that do their dirty work in far flung lands , putting their lives on the line to serve their master 's geopolitical ambitions .
Dr Josef Goebbels , the godfather of propaganda , who was head of propaganda in Nazi Germany in the 30‘s , would have thought he had woken up in heaven , had he found himself suddenly transposed to being in charge of the Axis propaganda machine in our times .
The greatest mind control machine in the history of the human race , the television set , is to be found in virtually every home in the developed world , sometimes several of them , and the people were n't forced to accept them , they went out and bought them of their own accord .
The seductive allure of the screen is much more attractive to most than the effort involved in reading .
Nowadays the television is the main source of information for the vast majority of the population - if you can gain control of its throughput you can control the minds of the masses .
In the United States , almost all Newspaper and Television stations are controlled from above by the process of syndication , which means there is in effect no such thing as an independent local press .
Bernays defined the profession of " counsel on public relations " as a " practicing social scientist " whose " competence is like that of the industrial engineer , the management engineer , or the investment counselor in their respective fields . "
To assist clients , PR counselors used " understanding of the behavioral sciences and applying them — sociology , social psychology , anthropology , history , etc . "
In Propaganda , his most important book , Bernays argued that the scientific manipulation of public opinion was necessary to overcome chaos and conflict in society :
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society .
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
...
We are governed , our minds are molded , our tastes formed , our ideas suggested , largely by men we have never heard of .
This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized .
Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society .
...
In almost every act of our daily lives , whether in the sphere of politics or business , in our social conduct or our ethical thinking , we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons ... who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .
It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind .
Bernays ' celebration of propaganda helped define public relations , but it did not win the industry many friends .
In a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt , Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter described Bernays and Ivy Lee as " professional poisoners of the public mind , exploiters of foolishness , fanaticism and self - interest . "
And history showed the flaw in Bernays ' identification of the " manipulation of the masses " as a natural and necessary feature of a democratic society .
The fascist rise to power in Germany demonstrated that propaganda could be used to subvert democracy as easily as it could be used to " resolve conflict . "
In his autobiography , titled Biography of an Idea , Bernays recalls a dinner at his home in 1933 where :
Karl von Weigand , foreign correspondent of the Hearst newspapers , an old hand at interpreting Europe and just returned from Germany , was telling us about Goebbels and his propaganda plans to consolidate Nazi power .
Goebbels had shown
Weigand his propaganda library , the best Weigand had ever seen .
Goebbels , said Weigand , was using my book Crystallizing Public Opinion as a basis for his destructive campaign against the Jews of Germany .
This shocked me .
...
Obviously the attack on the Jews of Germany was no emotional outburst of the Nazis , but a deliberate , planned campaign .
The story of the relationship between Sigmund Freud and his American nephew , Edward Bernays .
Bernays invented the public relations profession in the 1920s and was the first person to take Freud 's ideas to manipulate the masses .
He showed American corporations how they could make people want things they did n't need by systematically linking mass - produced goods to their unconscious desires .
Bernays was one of the main architects of the modern techniques of mass - consumer persuasion , using every trick in the book , from celebrity endorsement and outrageous PR stunts , to eroticising the motorcar .
His most notorious coup was breaking the taboo on women smoking by persuading them that cigarettes were a symbol of independence and freedom .
But Bernays was convinced that this was more than just a way of selling consumer goods .
It was a new political idea of how to control the masses .
By satisfying the inner irrational desires that his uncle had identified , people could be made happy and thus docile .
It was the start of the all - consuming self which has come to dominate today 's world .
The Economist has a look at the rapidly expanding solar power industry - no link to global warming or peak oil , but at least they are paying a small amount of attention to the future .
The Energy Blog has a post on developments in solid state lighting - other recent posts that caught my eye include some on ocean power developments in South Africa and San Francisco , and new battery technology from Firefly and NanoeXa Deconsumption points to an article about Indonesia threatening to cut back LNG exports to demand .
If this eventuates , I suspect it will be good news for at least one of Inpex Woodside or Oil Search Jeff Vail has been meditating on complex credit derivatives and the prospect of financial collapse .
Peter at Karavans has a review of a book called " The Flip " , which includes the great quote " If you watch television , Madison Avenue has your mind colonized " .
I like the way a lot of tinfoil writers refer to TV as the " mind control device ) - or , more subtly , " the glass hammer " .
Hopefully YouTube and Google Video will slowly replace it with something more balanced .
Though I guess its entirely possible we 'll just end up with MySpace instead ... ( Karavans also recently hosted a Carnival of the Green ) .
An example of TV being referred to as a mind control device can be found in this rambling essay on the likelihood of an attack on Iran and the impact on oil prices ( amazingly enough he thinks they will go up ) .
I 'm not sure Josef Goebbels should really be called the godfather of propaganda - he was more of a skilled practitioner ( though the best propaganda would n't be seen as such - it would be generally be believed by most " normal " people to be true ) .
The actual father of propaganda was a man named Edward Bernays , who was a nephew of Sigmund Freud .
Bernays and his work were the subject of a TV series by Adam ( " Power of Nightmares " ) Curtis called The Century of the Self
Feeling the heat : Plants ' behaviour is affected by the climate
Scientists from the Met Office and the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) say the year was probably the hottest in central England since records began .
The average growing season temperature was the highest recorded in central England , while previous maximums for individual months were also passed .
Globally , 2006 was the sixth hottest year on record , cooled by La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean .
The top 10 warmest years recorded globally have all occurred during the last 12 years .
Hotter than July
The Central England Temperature Record ( CET ) is the oldest continuous dataset for temperature anywhere in the world .
THE 10 WARMEST YEARS 2006 10.84C ( 1.37C above average ) 1999 10.63C ( + 1.16C ) 1990 10.63C ( + 1.16C ) 1949 10.62C ( + 1.15C ) 2002 10.60C ( + 1.13C ) 1997 10.53C ( + 1.06C ) 1995 10.52C ( +1.05C ) 2003 10.50C ( + 1.03C ) 1989 10.50C ( +1.03C ) 2004 10.48C ( + 1.01C ) ( Difference from mean Central England Temperature 1961-90 )
Its principal finding this year is that the average temperature for 2006 was almost certainly the highest ever seen in 347 years of CET measurements .
Researchers cannot be absolutely certain until the year has ended .
The average temperature for the year up to 13 December stands at 10.84C .
In the 1950s , the CET showed an average of about 9.4C .
" This year sees the highest average temperature recorded since the CET series began in 1659 , and the rise above the average is significantly higher than that for the two hottest years we have experienced , " said Professor Phil Jones of UEA 's Climatic Research Unit .
Among the other records set were :
the warmest ever April to October growing season , with a mean temperature of 14.6C
the warmest month on record - July , which saw a mean temperature of 19.7C
the warmest ever September , with an average of 16.8C
the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK during July - 36.5C , at Wisley
the warmest ever autumn , with a mean temperature of 12.6C
the highest July temperature ever recorded in Wales - 34.6C at Gogerddan
" The figures support recent research ... which showed links between human behaviour and the warming trend . "
Globally , temperatures were 0.42C above the average for the period 1961 - 1990 .
By comparison , 1998 was 0.52C above average .
The researchers say temperatures were cooled in the first half of the year by La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean .
During La Nina , sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific fall below normal .
La Nina conditions are one extreme of a natural cycle which also incorporates El Nino , associated with higher global temperatures .
Parts of Australia are experiencing their worst drought on record , which is reducing economic growth .
I 've been working in Smallalk and Seaside for quite a while now , but something I have n't quite gotten around to yet is trying to hook Squeak up to a database in a manner that I think could actually scale for a professional project .
Now , I mean directly hook it up , so far , professionally , I 've been using it against web services written in .
Net against Microsoft SQL Server , which scales just fine , but leaves me still working in .
Net , and I 'd much rather work in pure Smalltalk .
Object Databases
I 've tried several object databases , GOODS , Magma , and OmniBase , and while interesting experiences , I find them not quite acceptable for various reasons .
OmniBase is file based , and has odd semantics that make hooking it up to multiple images and programming web apps against it difficult .
GOODS is very low level and bare bones , it works great , but you have to pre-index all your data , it has no query capabilities beyond what you provide in your object model , which can make performance quite horrible unless you know exactly what you 're doing and make very strict choices about how your data is stored .
GOODS is also a one man show , so I 'm not thrilled by the support I 'd have available , were I trying to do something serious with it , though it works great for hobby and prototype programming .
Magma has queries , and is very similar to GOODS as far as ease of use goes but like GOODS , it 's a one man show , and I just would n't feel comfortable doing anything truly serious on a one man show kind of database .
This , for Squeak at least , seems to rule out object databases , for me anyway , though I hear Gemstone is going to support Seaside .
I 'm hopeful , for Gemstone is truly an enterprise ready object database , it 's just vaporware at this point , nothing production ready .
All of them seem rather slow when it comes to bulk inserts , and there are various solutions and workarounds depending on which version of Squeak you 're running , but a guy can only jump through so many hoops before he says " fuck it " .
I 've hit that point more than a few times when working with larger datasets and trying to do bulk inserts or queries .
Now , do n't get me wrong , Goods , Magma , and OmniBase are great products , and I 'm sure have their uses , they 're just not something I 'd throw up to my boss and say " hey , let 's use this for this big upcoming project " , because it's hard enough throwing Squeak at them and having to support that decision over something like .
Net which everyone already knows how to use , let alone taking away their familiar relational databases .
I 'd actually prefer something like Gemstone , time will tell if that preference pans out .
Relational Databases
So , on to relational databases .
Squeak has ODBC support , but it 's single threaded and blocks the VM when querying , so while it works for demos and low traffic apps against pretty much any database , I would n't try anything too big with it ; it just can't scale .
Blocking the whole VM , every time you run a query , just leaves me feeling a bit dirty and not too proud of whatever I just wrote .
Squeak basically supports two popular relational databases that I know of , natively , MySQL and PostgreSQL .
Now , I use MySql for this blog , so I have some experience managing it , and I 'm just not a big fan , compared to Microsoft SQL Server , which I work with professionally daily , MySQL just sucks , but PostgreSQL is a different story , I 'm quite impressed with the latest release , which looks and runs very nice on Windows servers and has a nice admin tool .
MySQL is IMHO not much better than Microsoft Access , it 's not an enterprise database .
PostgreSQL , I think is much more comparable to SqlServer and Oracle and could be used for any size app .
I have much more faith in its abilities and it has some cool features like table inheritance , which to an object bigot like myself , just makes me think relational databases are n't totally void of innovation .
Now if I can just talk my DBA into giving up Sql Server , ummm ... yea , not gonna happen , but I 've got a side project coming up that 'll be totally green field development , no legacy database to worry about , hence my renewed interest in PostgreSQL , my new database of choice with Squeak .
Getting Started
So I installed the latest PostgreSQL , installed the PostgreSQL Client for Squeak from SqueakMap , then the GLORP port from SqueakMap , and gave it a shot .
I was immediately confronted with a nasty error that reminded me why I gave up last time I tried PostgreSQL .
Something about the PostgreSQL driver 's state machine not being valid , luckily enough time had passed that a few minutes Googling turned up a simple answer this time , unlike the last .
PostgreSQL installs with MD5 connection encryption turned on , which Squeak does n't support out of the box .
There are two fixes , either install the Cryptography package from SqueakMap , or turn encryption in PostgreSQL to " password " with a simple configuration change to the pg_hba.conf .
I chose the latter , as its default install only accepts local connections anyway I 'm not too concerned with encryption .
PostgreSQL fires up and runs without a problem , GLORP tests all run fine , so now I just have to learn GLORP and how to map my objects into PostgreSQL , but that , is going to have to be another story .
I 'm going to map the simple blog in Seaside into a PostgreSQL database to learn GLORP , and I 'll post that code once I figure it out .
I 've done a bit already , and so far , I 'm quite happy with GLORP .
What is striking about the current debate in Washington - whether to " surge " troops to Iraq and increase the size of the U.S. Army - is that roughly 100,000 bodies are missing from the equation :
The number of American forces in Iraq is not 140,000 , but more like 240,000 .
What makes up the difference is the huge army of mercenaries - known these days as " private contractors . "
After the U.S. Army itself , they are easily the second - largest military force in the country .
Yet no one seems sure of how many there are since they answer to no single authority .
Indeed , the U.S. Central Command has only recently started taking a census of these battlefield civilians in an attempt to get a handle on the issue ...
The private contractors are Americans , South Africans , Brits , Iraqis and a hodgepodge of other nationalities .
Many of them are veterans of the U.S. or other armed forces and intelligence services , who are now deployed in Iraq ( and Afghanistan and other countries ) to perform duties normally carried out by the U.S. Army , but at salaries two or three times greater than those of American soldiers .
They work as interrogators and interpreters in American prisons ; body guards for top U.S. and Iraqi officials ; trainers for the Iraqi army and police ; and engi-neers constructing huge new U.S. bases .
They are often on the front lines .
In fact , 650 of them have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion
Their salaries , are , in the end , paid directly by the U.S. government - or tacked on as huge additional " security charges " to the bills of private American or other contractors .
Yet the Central Command still does n't have a complete list of who they are or what they are up to .
The final figure could be much higher than 100,000 .
The U.S. Congress , under Republican control until now , knows even less .
Yet these private contractors man their own helicopters and Humvees and look and act just like American troops .
" It takes a great deal of vigilance on the part of the military commander to en-sure contractor compliance , " William L. Nash , a retired general , told the Washington Post .
" If you 're trying to win hearts and minds and the contractor is driving 90 miles per hour through the streets and running over kids , that 's not helping the image of the American army .
The Iraqis are n't going to distinguish between a contractor and a soldier . "
But who , in the end , do these contractors answer to ?
The U.S. Central Command ?
Their company boss ?
Or the official they 've been assigned to protect ?
A recent case in point :
The former Iraqi minister of electricity , who had been imprisoned on corruption charges , managed to escape in broad daylight in the heavily fortified Green Zone .
Iraqi officials claim he was spirited away by con-tractors from a private security detail that had been hired when he was minis - ter .
Which raises another question .
Who has jurisdiction over these private contrac - tors if they run afoul of the law in Iraq ?
Also , are they supposed to follow the Geneva Conventions ?
Or George W. Bush 's conventions ?
For instance , according to The New York Times , although 20 civilian contractors working in U.S. prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq - including Abu Ghraib - have been charged with mistreating prisoners , none has ever been successfully prosecuted .
Another point , which brings us back to the discussion about increasing Ameri-can troop levels in Iraq :
It would seem that the Pentagon could outsource a " surge " by a simple accounting sleight of hand , quietly contracting for another 10,000 or 20,000 mercenaries to do the job , and the Congress and press would be none the wiser .

How to render the Segway Human Transporter obsolete :
Every once in a while someone invents something so simple and elegant that it makes you say " damn , why did n't I think of that ? "
Then there are the other inventions , the ones that make you say " man , I know exactly why I did n't think of that : that 's the dumbest thing I 've ever seen . "
Introducing Segway , transporter of humans .
Of all the places you 'll inevitably be transported to , the first place will be the bank because the Segway will cost you one healthy kidney , $ 4,500 , and a pint of virgin blood .
The reason for this cost : superfluous bullshit like high - voltage field - effect transistors or FETs .
What the hell does a FET do ?
Nobody knows , but I guarantee some nerd spent months writing a graduate thesis on why it 's important ( and failing ) .
The Segway is packed full of useless , but important - sounding extras like " angular - rate sensors " ( or " gyroscopes " to anyone with something better to do than to look up obfuscated $ 6 words to describe a spinning wheel ) , and two digital signal processor controller boards with enough processing power to give even the beefiest desktop PC penis envy .
The controller boards monitor the system 100 times per second for conditions that require a response , adjusting the motors up to 20,000 times per second ( give or take 19,000 ) , making calculations based on information from five solid - state gyroscopes .
You'd think all of this technology would be able to do something useful like cure cancer or make an episode of " Will and Grace " funny , but alas , all it does is balance a pole .
Much like the introduction to an IMAX film , the Segway engineers boast about the inherent inefficiencies of their " innovation : " redundant sensors , microprocessors , and controller boards that cost a fortune , and all for what ?
A balancing act ?
Well I came up with an innovation of my own that will help balance a Segway without years of research and millions of dollars invested in obscure technology .
The secret ?
Yes , that 's right , what many people do n't realize is that you can be just as space efficient and stable with a third wheel .
Hell , it does n't even need to be turned on to balance itself .
Amazing !
In fact , the only thing this revolutionary new model requires from the old Segway are the motors , gear box , wheels and batteries .
Throw the rest of that shit away .
What 's the point of all this technology if it costs a fortune ?
Here 's a bonus : add shock absorbers to the front wheel to compensate for tilt .
Man someone should hire me full time just to ruin other people 's inventions .
I must admit though , the Segway is quite revolutionary .
So revolutionary in fact , that it takes nothing less than a programmer and a few days to build one from scratch for less than half the cost .
The Segway has been thoroughly owned .
2,200,917 people did n't realize how easy it was to hand Dean Kamen his ass on a plate .

A UCSF researcher has determined that a key reason for the epidemic of pediatric obesity , now the most commonly diagnosed childhood ailment , is that high - calorie , low - fiber Western diets promote hormonal imbalances that encourage children to overeat .
In a comprehensive review of obesity research published in the August edition of the journal Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism , Robert Lustig , MD , professor of clinical pediatrics at UCSF Children 's Hospital , says that food manufacturing practices have created a " toxic environment " that dooms children to being overweight .
" It will take acknowledgement of the concepts of biological susceptibility and societal accountability and de-emphasis of the concept of personal responsibility to make a difference in the lives of children , " Lustig says .
According to the National Institutes of Health , the number of children who are overweight in the United States has doubled during the past three decades .
Currently one child in five is overweight .
The increase is true for children and adolescents of all age groups and races and for boys and girls .
Diseases that once were only seen in adults , like type 2 diabetes , now are occurring in increasing numbers in children , according to Lustig .
Overweight children tend to become overweight adults , which also puts them at greater risk of high blood pressure , heart disease , and stroke .
Children who are obese also are socially ostracized and teased , putting them at risk for depression and other psychiatric conditions , he adds .
" Our current Western food environment has become highly ' insulinogenic , ' " Lustig says , " as demonstrated by its increased energy density , high - fat content , high glycemic index , increased fructose composition , decreased fiber , and decreased dairy content . "
" In particular , fructose ( too much ) and fiber ( not enough ) appear to be cornerstones of the obesity epidemic through their effects on insulin , " he adds .

Lustig says that it has long been known that the hormone insulin acts on the brain to encourage eating through two separate mechanisms .
First , it blocks the signals that travel from the body 's fat stores to the brain by suppressing the effectiveness of the hormone leptin , resulting in increased food intake and decreased activity .
Second , insulin promotes the signal that seeks the reward of eating carried by the chemical dopamine , which makes a person want to eat to get the pleasurable dopamine " rush . "
Calorie intake and expenditure normally are regulated by leptin , Lustig says .
When leptin is functioning properly it " increases physical activity , decreases appetite , and increases feelings of well - being . "
Conversely , when leptin is suppressed , feelings of well - being and activity decrease and appetite increases -- a state called " leptin resistance . "
Changes in food processing during the past 30 years , particularly the addition of sugar to a wide variety of foods that once never included sugar and the removal of fiber , both of which promote insulin production , have created an environment in which our foods are essentially addictive , he adds .
Lustig also notes that children cannot be blamed or expected to take personal responsibility for their dietary behavior in an environment when the foods they are offered -- especially cheaply prepared " fast foods " that are full of sugar and devoid of fiber -- are toxic .
" The concept of personal responsibility is not tenable in children .
No child chooses to be obese , " he says .
" Furthermore , young children are not responsible for food choices at home or at school , and it can hardly be said that preschool children , in whom obesity is rampant , are in a position to accept personal responsibility . "
" If we do n't fix this , our children will continue to lose , " he emphasizes .

Presentation Tips
This collection of tips was transcribed from a seminar given in Seattle by Edward Tufte .
He attributes these tips to another author ( but I ca n't remember who it was ) .
Show up early , and something good is bound to happen .
You may have a chance to head off some technical or ergonomic problem .
Also , whereas at the end of a talk people are eager to rush off and avoid traffic , at the beginning they filter in slowly .
It 's a great time to introduce yourself .
, and something good is bound to happen .
You may have a chance to head off some technical or ergonomic problem .
Also , whereas at the end of a talk people are eager to rush off and avoid traffic , at the beginning they filter in slowly .
It 's a great time to introduce yourself .
Have a strong opening .
Tufte offers a few ideas for structuring your opening : Never apologize .
If you 're worried the presentation wo n't go well , keep it to yourself and give it your best shot .
Besides , people are usually too preoccupied with their own problems to notice yours .
Open by addressing the following three questions :
What 's the problem ?
Who cares ?
What 's your solution ?
As an alternate but more sophisticated technique , Tufte offers the following anecdote .
a high - school mathematics teacher was giving a lecture to an intimidating audience : a group of college math professors .
Early in the presentation , the teacher made a mathematical error .
The professors immediately noticed and corrected the problem .
And for the rest of the lecture , they were leaning forward , paying attention to every word , looking for more errors !
.
Tufte offers a few ideas for structuring your opening : PGP : with every subtopic , move from the Particular to the General and back to the Particular .
Even though the purpose of a subtopic is to convey the general information , bracing it with particulars is a good way to draw attention and promote retention .
: with every subtopic , move from the Particular to the General and back to the Particular .
Even though the purpose of a subtopic is to convey the general information , bracing it with particulars is a good way to draw attention and promote retention .
Not so much a tip as a law : Give everyone at least one piece of paper .
A piece of paper is a record , an artifact from your presentation .

Know your audience .
This is of course a general piece of advice for public speaking , but Tufte adds his own twist : know your audience by what they read .
Knowing what they read tells you what styles of information presentation they are most familiar and comfortable with .
Adapting your presentation to those styles will leave fewer barriers to the direct communication of your material .

Rethink the overhead .
Tufte spent a lot of time explaining why the overhead projector is the worst thing in the world .
There 's a lot of truth to what he said .
Bulleted lists are almost always useless .
Slides with bulleted lists are often interchangeable between talks .

The audience is sacred .
Respect them .
Do n't condescend by " dumbing down " your lecture .
Show them respect by saying what you believe and what you know to be the whole story .

Humour is good , but be careful with it .
Humour in a presentation works best when it actually drives the presentation forward .
If you find you 're using canned jokes that do n't depend on the context of the presentation , eliminate them .
Also , be very careful about jokes that put down a class of people .
If you 're going to alienate your audience , do it on the merits of your content .

Avoid masculine ( or even feminine ! ) pronouns as universals .
It can be a nuisance to half the audience .
As universals , use the plural " they " .
The Oxford English Dictionary has allowed " they " as a gender neutral singular pronoun for years .

Take care with questions .
Many people judge the quality of your talk not by the twenty minutes of presentation , but on the thirty seconds you spend answering their question .
Be sure to allow long pauses for questions .
Ten seconds may seem like a long pause when you 're at the front of the room , but it flows naturally from the audience 's point of view .

Finish early , and something good is almost bound to happen .
If nothing else , people will be able to leave early , and suddenly they 'll have an extra couple of minutes to do things they did n't think they 'd get to .
People will really like you if you do that .

Practice .
Practice over and over and over .
If you can , record your presentation .
Play it back and watch yourself .
You 'll discover a thousand horrible , horrible things you never knew about yourself .
Now watch it again without the sound .
Why are your hands flying around like that ?
Now listen to it without the picture .
Get rid of those ums !
Now watch it at twice the normal speed .
This emphasizes low - frequency cycles in your gestures .

The two most dehydrating things you can do in modern civilization are live presentations and air travel .
In both , the way to stay sharp is to drink lots of water .
Take care of your body , especially your voice .
If possible , avoid alcohol too .
Post scriptum
October 18th , 1999 : Amazing .
Seems my good deed of providing this list over the web has been carried out before , and pretty close to home .
Ted Romer , a former student in my department , transcribed almost the exact same list back in 1995 !
October 24th , 1999 : I guess the trend is catching .
Recently , AJ attended the Tufte seminar .
She transcribed a more extensive set of notes that you also might want to look at .
October 24th , 1999 : Thanks to Shimon Schocken from Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya for pointing out a typo on this page .
I 'll sleep better tonight !
October 4th , 2001 : Bernhard Reiter points out that the above links to Ted Romer 's home page are now defunct .
I do n't even remember how many years ago he left the department .
It is almost universally accepted now that the Earth is getting warmer .
Simply looking at the statistics will tell you this - people who would argue otherwise tend to be the kind of tinfoil hat people who also believe that imminent magnetic pole reversal will kill everybody on Earth in 2030 - something and that comets do n't exist and so on and so forth .
The real question that we should all be asking ourselves is not whether the Earth is getting warmer .
The question is : how will this affect us ?
Obviously there will be positive effects - for example , to delineate the new period of heat and sunshine , a new fourth season , provisionally titled " Sum - mer " , may have to be introduced into the regular Spring - Autumn - Winter calendar in the United Kingdom , and the opportunity to consume ice cream all year round may also prove attractive .
Also , who would n't want to live on the sunny Swiss coast ?
But , like any change anybody ever made to anything ever , there will also be negative effects , which will most likely outweigh the positive .
As the equatorial regions of our planet grow hotter , vital industries serving the Western world from that region may diminish in capacity and - to put it bluntly - life will not be so cushy .
People will have to relocate in the wake of extreme weather conditions like floods and hurricanes , which will cost the global taxpayer a stunning amount of cash overall .
Granted , it may be that the changes occur smoothly enough that very few people actually perish as the Earth grows warmer , but we will NOT enjoy the transition period and the brave new world WILL prove relatively expensive to adapt to .
Overall , then , the prevailing opinion among scientists ( although this is by no means as universally agreed upon as the existence of global warming itself ) is that global warming would be a bad thing .
It is only upon agreement of this point that we move on to the third question , which is " Can we reduce global warming ? " , and the fourth question , by far the most contentious , " What is causing global warming in the first place ? "
Now , some people take the highly controversial view that global warming is a wholly natural event - the Earth is well known to have gone through phases of being warm and being cold in the past .
The implication they take from this is that global warming cannot , or should not , be fought - we have no choice but to put up with it !
( Note that this is n't actually a logically airtight argument .
Mankind fights and generally wipes the floor with nature all the time . )
Most of the people who put forward this point of view tend to be the kind of people whose corporations ' factories ' continously accelerating output of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases are what most sane observers believe is the actual reason behind global warming .
( GLOBAL WARMING IS PEOPLE !
PEEEEEEEOPLE !)
I take a third point of view .
I'm of a more scientific bent - I am a mathematician , a logician , a rational reasoner .
I say that reducing CO 2 output would n't do the job - even if we reduced it to zero and planted trees to scoop up the excess - because that 's not the CAUSE of global warming .
We need to cut straight to the source .
The Sun is the cause of global warming .
We need to turn off the Sun .
Do n't worry , I do n't mean permanently .
Proposal
The average surface temperature of Earth 's atmosphere is about 14 °C or 287 Kelvins .
This has been measured to increase by about 0.6 Kelvins over the last 200 years , or about 0.2 % of its absolute temperature .
Which means the Sun is giving out roughly 0.2 % more energy than we need to keep it at the required temperature .
Therefore , if we make it so the Sun gives out about 0.2 % less energy , everything will be fine !
Thus I propose that we turn off the Sun for roughly 0.2 % of each solar day , or two to four minutes every 24 hours .
Naturally if these back - of - the - envelope calculations prove inaccurate we can increase or decrease the period of deactivation as needed .
The effects of turning the Sun off for 2 to 4 minutes per day will not differ significantly from those of a total solar eclipse .
Eclipses occur roughly twice per year and typically last a comparable period of time , although eclipses lasting as long as 11 minutes are known to be possible .
Light - sensitive street lights on the affected hemisphere of the Earth will temporarily light up ; birds will stop singing ; people will not be able to see each other very well ; that sort of thing .
Assessment
Pros
We can end global warming now and forever by this method .
We no longer have to worry about strictly limiting our CO 2 output , which would require an enormous effort , as well as being time - consuming and unprofitable .
Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will no longer be a problem ( until around the year 2100 when they approach the level which is lethal to human life - at which point other solutions will doubtless present themselves ) .
We can save 0.2 % on our energy bill , which , I 'm sure we all know , is both very large and almost completely unpaid .
Cons
The onset of the deactivation would be much more rapid than the minutes - long lead - up period to a solar eclipse - in fact , nearly instantaneous .
In particular , this will catch motorists and cyclists by surprise .
To minimise the danger thus posed , I would propose that the deactivations be arranged to occur as predictably and regularly as possible - preferably at the exact same time every day .
In order that the minimum number of people are inconvenienced by the momentary loss of illumination , I would also propose to arrange for the deactivations to occur at midnight UTC , while the Sun is approximately centred over the Pacific Ocean .
Japan would thus see the deactivations around dawn ; the American west coast , around dusk .
Most other places would be unaffected , as it would already be night - time .
Still , bad luck for Hawaii .
While the Sun is known to vary slightly in luminosity over an 11 - year cycle , the long - term effects of entirely deactivating our parent star for 3 minutes are unknown and unexplored , as the temporary total deactivation of a star is totally unprecedented in astronomical science .
It can be conjectured that without the supporting pressure of internal fusion the Sun 's layers will most likely collapse inwards under gravitational attraction until one of two things happens - either it becomes a neutron star , or we switch it back on again and normal operation is resumed .
This raises the additional questions of whether switching the Sun back on after it has collapsed too far ( say , fifteen minutes ) would cause a supernova to occur , and what ( if anything ) would happen if we attempted to reactivate nuclear fusion processes in a neutron star .
Moderating the amount of heat reaching the Earth by this method is specifically forbidden in the Sun 's user manual , and voids the warranty .
Conclusion
Clearly the major issue arising from the proposal not whether we should go ahead with it ( we should ) or even when ( as soon as possible ) but where and who .
Specifically , where should the Switch be built ?
And who should be permitted access to it ?
Once these admittedly knotty issues are resolved , however , the hard part is over with ; all we need to do is persuade every nation of the world to cooperate and global warming is as good as ended !
