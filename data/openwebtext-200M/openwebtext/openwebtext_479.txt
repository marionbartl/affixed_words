Class actions charged against NVIDIA and ATI ( now AMD ) reveal that the two companies may have staged a competition over the past half - a- decade or so .
A judge read out an email which suggested price fixing was rife in the graphics card market .
That follows a class action of 51 different plaintiffs , now combined into one , and across different legal jurisdictions , alleging cartel behaviour not only in graphics chips , but flat panels and CRTs too .
In other words , NVIDIA and ATI may have been fixing prices of their products for a while now , it is believed that they held secret meetings to discuss staged competition , chart out prices , timings of product launches among other things .
These pseudo - competitions staged provided improved sales among other things .
A PDF File available to us at this point shows that the two indulged in conspiracy to mutually benefit from staged competition , so as to : Provided , are charts that show price - spread between NVIDIA and ATI products .
Three major time - scales : Before the ' conspiracy period ' , during and after a federal grand jury launched an investigation and issued subpoenas to both companies :
Of course , the latest price - cut of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 200 series products does n't seem to have been taken into account , the price spread between NVIDIA and ATI with their highest - offerings is zero .

wow it makes sense .. this why nvidia and ati always seem to pop out new products out of the blue to go head on with the other .. and would explain by nvidia and amd are " buddying " when it comes to the cuda and physx , and why they have n't had any suits against each other , dispite all of the bad stuff each of them have done to each other .

We all know what was going on in 2003 .
Just how many $ 500 cards we released in that year .
I lost count after 5 by each company .
That seemed to go on forever , until the 8 series NV cards broke it open & AMD when back to the drawing board .
At some point they can't call it competition anymore .
Its definitely competition now but what was going on back then was pretty damn apparent .
This is what happens when one co tries to break the manotony .

Nvidia to AMD ; AMD to Nvidia " We hate each other "
- both hug each other warmly -

Nvidia ... is so screwed .
Now watch GTX280 prices skyrocket .

Think about it :
Two big companies with no main competitors other than each other get together and figure out a way to bring in the most cash .
Obviously the most blunt way would be raising the price of their products .
Usually when the price of a product goes up it 's because of a few reasons : Manufacturing cost , and availability .
Here , they were simply raising the price for no reason other than maximum return .
If this is all true , we 've all basically been getting reemed with no lube for a very long time .

I thought it was obvious .
They just started to throw rocks at each other again when NV broke the mold with the 8 series .
AMD could n't keep up anymore so all bets were off .
Between 2002 & 2007 , the price difference between those 2 idiots ' high - end model was nil .
There was none of this I come out with a $ 800 card that reigns for a year which gets eaten by a $ 450 card just to be trumped by a $ 600 card which is upgraded to a $ 650 card which is utterly destroyed by a $ 500 card .
Life sucks AMD & NV does n't it .
They would have probably never found out if the 2 idiots did n't start to fight like cats & dogs .

let 's wait what turn 's out to be true .
and is n't it normal that they try to cooperate to keep prices high ?
every industry trys to , even if it is illegal : rolleyes :
only thing i'm worried about is that they form more a monopole on GPU 's like intel and AMD .
2 is not enought for a sector , but i wo n't buy any other as there 's no better one ?
remember the day's where you could choose between cyrix intel amd ect .
? like Ati Nvidia 3dfx .

yeah they go back and fourth in the war you have the top card next time i can have the top card
a mid range card comes out then another better mid range card comes out by the other
its silly i bet the whole 3000 series and 9000 series is a sham and they couldve done that to start with
i mean didnt you notice how close it was back when you had the x1000 series and the 7000 series
the whole 6 series and x800 cards were a sham too not much in it
i bet the it all started with the 9800 radeon i mean that was a pricey beast Posted on Jul 16th 2008 , 15:21 Reply

I hope Larrabee breaks this stuff up .
Its OK now , since both companies are feeling the effects of their own BS but it could go back to it at anytime .
They are already bitching about the CUDA stuff -
That means they are actually talking to each other : eek :
Its headed that way again , where we see another set of 5 $ 500 cards <-- arbitrary number , that are not worth it .
If this does n't go down , the G300 & R800 could very well be the same price at launch .
That 's when we know they are doing it again , especially when NV is keeping a track on AMD 's prices .
It probably happened that way at first , but continuing it for 5 yrs is unforgivable .
The FXs were not worth it at all & the prices for the 2900s made me sick .

nothing new the same is in oil branch and who 's sue the few big supplier ?
nobody even they recognize that the price is not normal they 're selling double why not if are buyers and this can be extended to almost any product
if anyone made a product before sell 1st he made a market / price research to adjust his price and if the market can hold a 100 % win ( based on a similar but not identical product ) i bet he would n't sell it with a 30 % margin ; people do n't know the manufacturing cost for this reason Posted on Jul 16th 2008 , 15:31 Reply

Matrox have long since confined themselves to a box we call ' industry ' - they need to take up arms & come out with a pincer move against ATi / Nv to show the world their absence has not been for nothing ....
either that or one of the 3rd party companies like HiS & XFX , GeCube etc etc need to step out & start makin their own graphics cards ..... someone call up matrox & tell them how much the enthusiast market is missing them .

They were cheap , when they were compared to the 8 series .
Who knew they had that GTX up their sleeves when the 7900s ended up bombing with a dual disaster .
This is when the pricing BS ended .
But NV ended up going into another universe of prices with the 8 series .
The performance over anything else may have warranted it but I know I did n't like it one bit .
It only took 2 generations for AMD to catch up , but now since they did it could easily go back .
Both companies need to price there cards according to what they will do ( & how much we will pay for them ) .
Having them locked - in w/o that real value only leaves the customer hanging out to dry .
These relatively high NV prices over the last 3 yrs may have put us out of perspective of what these things should cost .

I agree .
The prices are great right now and they have been for the past year .
Last year it would have cost me 4 x as much to max the newest games .

Repressive governments are arresting more bloggers than ever as they struggle to cope with the threat posed by the internet , researchers have claimed .
Thirty six people were arrested last year because of what they had written on their blogs and personal websites – an increase of more than three times on the figures from 2006 , according to researchers at the University of Washington in the US .
The latest edition of the annual World Information Access report says that there has been a significant increase in those falling foul of the law in countries such as China , Egypt and Burma .
" Egypt , Iran and China are the most dangerous places to blog about political life , accounting for more than half of all arrests since blogging became big , " said Phil Howard , an assistant professor of communication at the university .
He believes that the figure of 36 may be a dramatic underestimate , because many arrests are never made public .
" The real number of arrested bloggers is probably much higher , since many arrests in China , Zimbabwe and Iran go unreported in the international media , " he said .
Blogs have become massively popular way for people in countries with authoritarian regimes to express themselves , and part of the increase could be explained by this growing popularity – there are estimated to be more than 70 million such websites in China alone .
But the fact that governments are paying increasing attention to what people say about them online means that it is becoming more dangerous for those who choose to write about their life on the web .
While the reasons for the arrests vary from place to place , the most common transgression involves organising a social protest .
This was the reason given for five of Egypt 's record nine arrests in 2007 , as well as incidents in Burma , China and Iran .
While not all those arrested because of their blogs were imprisoned , the report says that the average sentence for those who were sent to jail was 15 months .
However , the numbers so far in 2008 seem significantly lower , with just five bloggers having been arrested around the world during the first quarter of the year - including Welshman Gavin Brent , who was convicted in April of writing " grossly offensive and menacing messages " on his site .
Another of those arrested so far this year Burmese blogger Nay Phone Latt , who disappeared in January before it emerged that he had been charged under the country 's notorious Emergency Provision Act , which has been used to silence a number of dissidents since the anti-government protests last year .
An RAF source told the Sun newspaper : " With the right sensor array , they can see if a suspected terrorist is at home , listen in to and record his mobile calls and tell you if his car engine is hot , warm or cold . "
From Don Knotts ' portrayle of " Mr. Limpet " to the children 's favorite " Nemo " and the tuna - pitching character in the " Sorry , Charlie " commercials , we all have seen fish that can talk .
But that 's just fiction , right ?
Well ...
Researchers say real fish can communicate with sound , too .
And they say ( the researchers , that is ) that your speech skills and , in fact , all sound production in vertebrates can be traced back to this ability in fish .
( You got your ears from fish , too . )
The new study was led by Andrew Bass ( we did not make this up ) of Cornell University .
The scientists mapped developing brain cells in newly hatched midshipman fish larvae and compared them to those of other species .
They found that the chirp of a bird , the bark of a dog and all the other sounds that come out of animals ' mouths are the products of the neural circuitry likely laid down hundreds of millions of years ago with the hums and grunts of fish .
" Fish have all the same parts of the brain that you do , " Bass explained .
His team traced the development of the connection from the midshipman fish 's vocal muscles to a cluster of neurons located in a compartment between the back of its brain and the front of its spinal cord .
The same part of the brain in more complex vertebrates , such as humans , has a similar function , indicating that it was highly selected for during the course of evolution .
The finding is published in the July 18 issue of the journal Science .
The fish that Bass studied are interesting in their own right .
After building a nest for his potential partner , the male midshipman fish calls to nearby females by contracting his swim bladder , the air - filled sac fish use to maintain buoyancy .
The sound is a hum , something like a long - winded foghorn .
Female midshipman dig it , and they only approach a male 's nest if he makes this call .
During midsipman mating season , houseboat owners in San Francisco Bay have complained that their homes vibrate from the humming , which sound like a high - speed motor running underwater .
By better understanding how these fish hear , the study offers new avenues to explore the causes of human deafness , the researchers say .
Old habits die hard , I suppose

So the McCain people continue to freak out over Gen. Wesley Clark ’s continued refusal to back down from his statements about McCain ’s war experience as a proof he can lead :
Despite criticism from Republicans , Clark declined to back down in an interview Tuesday morning with ABC .
“ The experience that he had as a fighter pilot is n’t the same as having been at the highest levels of the military and having to make … life or death decisions about national , strategic issues , ” he said .
Asked whether he felt he owed McCain an apology , Clark responded , “ I ’m very sorry that this has distracted from the message of patriotism that Sen. Obama wants to put out . ” [… ]
“ I think that you can always cite a candidate ’s service in the armed forces as a testimony to his character and his courage .
But I do n’t think early service justifies moving away from looking at a candidate ’s judgment , ” he replied .
McCain wants blood , of course :
“ I think the time has come for Sen. Obama to not just repudiate Gen.
Clark , but to cut him loose , ” McCain said en route to Colombia .
One ally of the Republican presidential contender accused Obama of “ winking and nodding ” when he should be condemning Clark and his comments .
“ This is now about Obama , not Wesley Clark , ” added Orson Swindle on a conference call with reporters organized by the McCain ’s campaign .
Swindle , a retired colonel and – like McCain – prisoner of war in Vietnam , added that Obama should tell his surrogates to “ knock this crap off . ”
It should be pointed out though that Wesley Clark was a Clinton supporter who only became an Obama surrogate after she dropped out and I am not even sure if he has an official role at all in the campaign .
It should also be pointed out that Obama has been extremely complimentary about John McCain ’s service in Vietnam .
I also ca n’t think of any other incidents in which Obama surrogates have taken a shot at Johnny Mac ’s military service , which actually is n’t relevant anymore as the world and “ war ” are completely different than when Mac was fighting “ the gooks ” that he will always hate ( his words , from 2000 ) , despite our normalized relations and the passage of more than 35 years since the Vietnam war .
Sure , it ’s almost understandable considering his background , but still , is that really the kind of world view we need with his finger on the button ?
However , what is more unfortunate is that Clinton supporters are not yet up to speed on this whole ‘ new politics ’ thing .
Their failure to understand it is why they lost and the sooner they realize it ( and stop blaming sexism ) , the better off everyone will be .
There is a new sheriff in town and this personal attack shit is not going to fly anymore – no matter how accurate it is .
And it is another reason Obama should not cozy up to the Clintons any more than necessary .
Arm ’s length , Barry .
Arm ’s length .
I ’m just saying .
But back to Clark .
McCain ’s folks called on top lapdog Lindsey Graham , who immediately went out and pulled a Scalia ( “ using logic that contradicts even itself ” ) :
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , rebutted Clark ’s claim by arguing that McCain ’s years as a prisoner of war and the mistreatment he endured made him uniquely qualified to lead the campaign in the Senate to ban the use of torture in the interrogation of detainees in the war on terror .
“ Nobody could have taken the floor and spoken about detainee policy ” the same way , Graham added .
See , here ’s where I am confused : did n’t McCain cave to what the President want on that bill ?
Is n’t that an issue on which he flip - flopped , ignoring his own history as a prisoner of war ?
So he ’s uniquely qualified to lead because he gave in and we still torture ?
Or perhaps the headline of this post should read , " American media : you suck at fact - checking . "
Iran 's state - run media agency has been accused before of having digitally manipulated images released to foreign media .
This week , as word spread of purported missile tests in Iran , the validity of an image of four missiles shooting into the sky turned out to be photoshopped — but not before a bunch of big news organizations printed it as legit .
From the NYT blog The Lede :
Unfortunately , it appeared to contain one too many missiles , a point that had not emerged before the photo appeared on the front pages of The Los Angeles Times , The Financial Times , The Chicago Tribune and several other newspapers as well as on BBC News , MSNBC , Yahoo !
News , NYTimes.com and many other major news Web sites .
Agence France - Presse said that it obtained the image from the Web site of Sepah News , the media arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , on Wednesday .
But there was no sign of it there later in the day .
Today ,
The Associated Press distributed what appeared to be a nearly identical photo from the same source , but without the fourth missile .
This morning , Agence France - Presse retracted the image as " apparently digitally altered . "
Here 's the caption on the NYT illustration above :
In the four - missile version of the image released Wednesday by Sepah News , the media arm of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , two major sections ( encircled in red ) appear to closely replicate other sections ( encircled in orange ) .
Boing Boing readers are invited to further manipulate the image , whip up nuclear cat macros , or create topically specific fan - remixed versions of YOU SUCK AT PHOTOSHOP .
Post links in the comments , and our digital manipulation ambassadors will evaluate as hastily as a nuclear missile seeks the heavens .
UPDATE : And the winner is …

I fixed up a number of inaccuracies for them . "

You can use your phone to check your calendar , contacts , music , email and more – just do n't try using it to make calls .
That 's the rule for drivers without hands - free devices in an increasing number of states – including California , starting next week .
Beginning July 1 , adult California drivers talking on their mobile phones without a hands - free device are subject to a $ 20 fine and a run-in with the law .
The Golden State 's new traffic ordinance follows similar versions adopted in Connecticut , New Jersey , Washington state , the District of Columbia , New York and the Virgin Islands .
While the fines are n't wallet - busting , there 's a hitch .
Except in Washington state , an officer can pull you over solely for talking on the phone without a headset .
The laws are even stricter for new drivers .
As many as 17 states and the District of Columbia ban cellphone use entirely for minors and new motorists while operating a vehicle ( see map ) .
They include California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Nebraska , New Jersey , North Carolina , Oregon , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia and West Virginia .
The states ' cellphone driving laws were adopted with safety in mind .
Studies by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis ( .pdf ) suggest 2,600 people are killed and as many as 330,000 people are injured each year in the United States in cellphone - related driving accidents .
" According to some estimates , getting drivers ' hands off the cellphones and onto the steering wheel will save almost 300 lives a year in California , " Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said at a recent news conference .
However , hands - free devices may not help .
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have noted that voice - activated or hands - free calling is a major distraction , too .
Also , while talking may be banned , text messaging generally is n't .
Only Washington , Minnesota and New Jersey ban texting outright .
That means in California , for example , a motorist can legally fumble around with a handset sending a text message , but will be breaking the law if he holds the phone up to his ear and starts talking .
Electronic stores , mobile - phone shops and online retailers are taking advantage of the new law to offer a wide range of specials on hands - free headsets .
Headsets.com , for example , is offering a free ( wired ) headset to anyone who sends them a copy of a traffic citation for making calls while driving .
And be sure to check out Wired.com 's roundup of wireless headsets for our recommendations on the best hands - free gear for your phone .

Trumbo : Reminders of Political Persecution in America
The Fall of Dalton Trumbo
Trumbo is a new film about the Hollywood blacklisting of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , opening in theaters this week .
The film includes a wealth of documentary footage from the House Un- American Activities Committee years and is , in its own way , a very personalized history of the notorious Hollywood blacklist .
Dalton Trumbo was a prolific Hollywood screenwriter who wrote dozens of movie scripts during the 1930s and ’ 40s , including Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo and Kitty Foyle .
His anti-war novel Johnny Got His Gun won the National Book Award in 1939 .
But in 1947 , Trumbo was called before the House Un- American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) as part of the Hollywood Ten , who were questioned about their ties to the Communist Party .
Trumbo refused to testify and was found in contempt of Congress .
Subsequently , he was kicked out of the screenwriter ’s guild , and all of the Hollywood motion picture studios almost immediately blacklisted him .
For his refusal to testify in the HUAC hearings , Trumbo eventually served nearly a year in federal prison .
Dalton Trumbo ’s ruination took him from being one of Hollywood ’s highest - paid writers to a Hollywood pariah .
After Trumbo was released from prison , he remained on Hollywood ’s blacklist for nearly a decade , but went on to have a prodigious writing career under a list of at least 13 pseudonyms ( writing for films that included Roman Holiday , Gun Crazy , The Brave One ) .
Trumbo ’s film The Brave One , written under the pseudonym Robert Rich , won an Academy Award in 1957 .
It is the only unclaimed Oscar in the history of the Academy Awards .
Trumbo finally received credit for his work on Exodus and Spartacus in 1960 .
In 1970 , Dalton Trumbo delivered a speech about the HUAC hunt for good guys and bad , which contained this admonishment : “ There was bad faith and good , honesty and dishonesty , courage and cowardice , selflessness and opportunism , wisdom and stupidity , good and bad on both sides ; and almost every individual involved , no matter where he stood , combined some or all of these antithetical qualities in his own person , in his own acts . ”
Dalton Trumbo ’s life story stands as a poignant reminder of a weird , scary time , a paranoid era which , some think , could happen again .
Some Hollywood observers maintain that the potential for similar political persecution still exists , perhaps not in the exact form it happened before .
However , they claim that there are things going on now in the current political administration that should serve as reminders that it could happen again .

Studs Terkel and the HUAC Blacklist
This article has also been written in honor of a friend , 96 years old Studs Terkel .
At the time when Senator McCarthy began blacklisting supposed subversives , Studs Terkel hosted Studs ’ Place , a network television program on NBC , and wrote a regular column for the Chicago Sun Times .
However , immediately after he refused to give names to McCarthy ’s House Un-American Activities Committee , NBC pulled his television program and the Sun - Times cancelled his newspaper column .
Terkel was unable to work until 1953 , when a Chicago radio station hired him , telling Terkel “ p*ss on the blacklist . ”
Subsequently , Terkel has written a number of acclaimed books , won the Pulitzer Prize ( 1985 ) , two National Book Awards , and received The National Humanities Award ( 1997 ) and The George Polk Career Award ( 1999 ) .

Abstract
Forth is unique among programming languages in that its development and proliferation has been a grass - roots effort unsupported by any major corporate or academic sponsors .
Originally conceived and developed by a single individual , its later development has progressed under two significant influences : professional programmers who developed tools to solve application problems and then commercialized them , and the interests of hobbyists concerned with free distribution of Forth .
These influences have produced a language markedly different from traditional programming languages .
Presented at the ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference ( HOPL II , April , 1993 ) .

1. Chuck Moore ’s Programming Language
1.1 Early Development
Moore ’s programming career began in the late 1950s at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory with programs to compute ephemerides , orbital elements , satellite station positions , etc. [ Moore , 1958 ] , [ Veis , 1960 ] .
His source code filled two card trays .
To minimize recompiling this large program , he developed a simple interpreter to read cards controlling the program .
This enabled him to compose different equations for several satellites without recompiling .
This interpreter featured several commands and concepts that survived into modern Forth , principally a command to read “ words ” separated by spaces and one to convert numbers from external to internal form , plus an IF … ELSE construct .
He found free - form input to be both more efficient ( smaller and faster code ) and reliable than the more common Fortran practice of formatting into specific columns , which had resulted in numerous re-runs due to mis-aligned columns .
In 1961 , Moore received his BA in Physics from MIT and entered graduate school at Stanford .
He also took a part - time programming position at the Stanford Linear Accelerator ( SLAC ) , writing code to optimize beam steering for the ( then ) pending two - mile electron accelerator , using an extension of some of his prior work with least - squares fitting .
A key outgrowth of this work was a program called CURVE , coded in Algol ( 1964 ) , a general - purpose non-linear differential - corrections data fitting program .
To control this program , he used an enhanced version of his interpreter , extended to manage a push - down stack for parameter passing , variables ( with the ability to explicitly fetch and store values ) , arithmetic and comparison operators , and the ability to define and interpret procedures .
In 1965 , he moved to New York City to become a free - lance programmer .
Working in Fortran , Algol , Jovial , PL / I and various assemblers , he continued to use his interpreter as much as possible , literally carrying around his card deck and recoding it as necessary .
Minicomputers appeared in the late ’ 60s , and with them teletype terminals , for which Moore added operators to manage character input and output .
One project involved writing a Fortran - Algol translator and file - editing utilities .
This reinforced for him the value of spaces between words , which were not required in Fortran source .
Newly married and seeking a small town environment , Moore joined Mohasco Industries in Amsterdam , NY , in 1968 .
Here he developed computer graphics programs for an IBM 1130 minicomputer with a 2250 graphic display .
This computer had a 16 - bit CPU , 8 k RAM , his first disk , keyboard , printer , card reader / punch ( used as disk backup ! ) , and Fortran compiler .
He added a cross-assembler to his program to generate code for the 2250 , as well as a primitive editor and source - management tools .
This system could draw animated 3 - D images , at a time when IBM ’s software for that configuration drew only static 2 - D images .
For fun , he also wrote a version of Spacewar , an early video game , and converted his Algol Chess program into the new language , now ( for the first time ) called FORTH .
He was impressed by how much simpler it became .
The name FORTH was intended to suggest software for the fourth ( next ) generation computers , which Moore saw as being characterized by distributed small computers .
The operating system he used at the time restricted file names to five characters , so the “ U ” was discarded .
FORTH was spelled in upper case until the late 1970s because of the prevalence of upper - case - only I /O devices .
The usage “ Forth ” was generally adopted when lower case became widely available , because the word was not an acronym .
Moore found the Forth - based 1130 environment for programming the 2250 superior to the Fortran environment in which the 1130 software was developed , so he extended it into an 1130 compiler .
This added looping commands , the concept of keeping source in 1024 - byte blocks and tools for managing them , and most of the compiler features we recognize in Forth today .
Most important , there was now a dictionary .
Procedures now had names , and the interpreter searched a linked list of names for a match .
Names were compiled with a count and three characters , a practice learned from the compiler writers of Stanford and which prevailed in Forth until the 1980s .
Within a dictionary entry was a “ code field ” containing the address of code to be executed for that routine .
This was an indirect threaded code implementation ( see Section 5.2 ) and was in use five years before Dewar ’s paper on indirect threaded coded appeared in Communications of the ACM [ Dewar 1975 ] .
The use of indirect threaded code was an important innovation , since an indirect jump was the only overhead once a word had been found .
Dictionary entries could consist either of pointers to other “ high level ” routines or of machine instructions .
Finally , in order to provide a simple mechanism for nesting routines , a second stack called the “ return stack ” was added .
The benefit of having a stack reserved for return addresses was that the other stack could be used freely for parameter passing , without having to be “ balanced ” before and after calls .
The first paper on Forth was written at Mohasco [ Moore , 1970a ] .
In 1970 Mohasco assigned Moore to an ambitious project involving a new Univac 1108 handling a network of leased lines for an order - entry system .
He ported Forth onto the 1108 , and arranged for it to interface to COBOL modules that did the transaction processing .
The 1108 Forth was coded in assembler .
It buffered input and output messages and shared the CPU among tasks handling each line .
It also interpreted the input and executed the appropriate COBOL modules .
This version of Forth added mechanisms for defining and managing tasks , and also an efficient scheme for managing disk block buffers similar to schemes in use today .
Unfortunately , an economic downturn led Mohasco to cancel the 1108 project before completion .
Moore immediately gave notice , then wrote an angry poem and a book on Forth [ Moore , 1970b ] that was never published .
It described how to develop Forth software and encouraged simplicity and innovation .
1.2 Philosophy and Goals
To Moore , Forth was a personal response to his frustration with existing software tools , which he viewed as a sort of “ tower of Babel ” [ Moore , 1970a ] :
The software provided with large computers supplies a hierarchy of languages : the assembler defines the language for describing the compiler and supervisor ; the supervisor the language for job control ; the compiler the language for application programs ; the application program the language for its input .
The user may not know , or know of , all these languages : but they are there .
They stand between him and his computer , imposing their restrictions on what he can do and what it will cost .
And cost it does , for this vast hierarchy of languages requires a huge investment of man and machine time to produce , and an equally large effort to maintain .
The cost of documenting these programs and of reading the documentation is enormous .
And after all this effort the programs are still full of bugs , awkward to use and satisfying to no one .
Moore conceived of Forth as replacing the entire “ vast hierarchy ” with a single layer , requiring only two elements : a programmer - to - Forth interface , consisting of minimal documentation ( minimal because the interface should be simple and natural ) , and the Forth - machine interface , consisting of the program itself .
His view was entirely personal , considering his own needs in the light of his own experience .
The following excerpts from his unpublished book [ Moore , 1970b ] , describe this view :
I ’ve written many programs over the years .
I ’ve tried to write good programs , and I ’ve observed the manner in which I write them rather critically .
My goal has been to decrease the effort required and increase the quality produced .
In the course of these observations , I ’ve found myself making the same mistakes repeatedly .
Mistakes that are obvious in retrospect , but difficult to recognize in context .
I thought that if I wrote a prescription for programming , I could at least remind myself of problems .
And if the result is of value to me , it should be of value to others … .
Above all , his guiding principle , which he called the “ Basic Principle , ” was , “ Keep it simple ! ”
Throughout his career he has observed this principle with religious dedication .
As the number of capabilities you add to a program increases , the complexity of the program increases exponentially .
The problem of maintaining compatibility among these capabilities , to say nothing of some sort of internal consistency in the program , can easily get out of hand .
You can avoid this if you apply the Basic Principle .
You may be acquainted with an operating system that ignored the Basic Principle .
It is very hard to apply .
All the pressures , internal and external , conspire to add features to your program .
After all , it only takes a half - dozen instructions , so why not ?
The only opposing pressure is the Basic Principle , and if you ignore it , there is no opposing pressure .
The main enemy of simplicity was , in his view , the siren call of generality that led programmers to attempt to speculate on future needs and provide for them .
So he added a corollary to the Basic Principle : “ Do not speculate ! ”
Do not put code in your program that might be used .
Do not leave hooks on which you can hang extensions .
The things you might want to do are infinite ; that means that each has 0 probability of realization .
If you need an extension later , you can code it later — and probably do a better job than if you did it now .
And if someone else adds the extension , will he notice the hooks you left ?
Will you document this aspect of your program ?
This approach flew in the face of accepted practice then as now .
A second corollary was even more heretical : “ Do it yourself ! ”
The conventional approach , enforced to a greater or lesser extent , is that you shall use a standard subroutine .
I say that you should write your own subroutines .
Before you can write your own subroutines , you have to know how .
This means , to be practical , that you have written it before ; which makes it difficult to get started .
But give it a try .
After writing the same subroutine a dozen times on as many computers and languages , you ’ll be pretty good at it .
Moore followed this to an astounding extent .
Throughout the 1970s , as he implemented Forth on 18 different CPUs ( Table 1 ) , he invariably wrote for each his own assembler , his own disk and terminal drivers , even his own multiply and divide subroutines ( on machines that required them , as many did ) .
When there were manufacturer - supplied routines for these functions , he read them for ideas , but never used them verbatim .
By knowing exactly how Forth would use these resources , by omitting hooks and generalities , and by sheer skill and experience ( he speculated that most multiply / divide subroutines were written by someone who had never done one before and never would again ) , his versions were invariably smaller and faster , usually significantly so .
Moreover , he was never satisfied with his own solutions to problems .
Revisiting a computer or an application after a few years , he often re-wrote key code routines .
He never re-used his own code without re-examining it for possible improvements .
This later became a source of frustration to Rather , who , as the marketing arm of FORTH , Inc. ( see Section 2.2 ) , often bid jobs on the assumption that since Moore had just done a similar project this one would be easy — only to watch helplessly as he tore up all his past code and started over .
Today , Moore is designing Forth - based microprocessors using his own Forth - based CAD system , which he has re-written ( and sometimes rebuilt , with his own hardware ) almost continuously since 1979 .
Moore considered himself primarily an applications programmer , and regarded this as a high calling .
He perceived that “ systems programmers ” who built tools for “ applications programmers ” to use had a patronizing attitude toward their constituents .
He felt that he had spent a great fraction of his professional life trying to work around barriers erected by systems programmers to protect the system from programmers and programmers from themselves , and he resolved that Forth would be different .
Forth was designed for a programmer who was intelligent , highly skilled and professional ; it was intended to empower , not constrain .
The net result of Moore ’s philosophy was a system that was small , simple , clean — and extremely flexible : in order to put this philosophy into practice , flexible software is essential .
The reason people leave hooks for future extensions is that it ’s generally too difficult and time - consuming to re-implement something when requirements change .
Moore saw a clear distinction between being able to teach a computer to do “ anything ” ( using simple , flexible tools ) and attempting to enable it to do “ everything ” with a huge , general - purpose OS .
Committing himself to the former , he provided himself with the ideal toolset to follow his vision .
2. Development and Dissemination
By the early 1970s , Forth had reached a level of maturity that not only enabled it to be used in significant applications , but that attracted the attention of other programmers and organizations .
Responding to their needs , Moore implemented it on more computers and adapted it to handle ever larger classes of applications .
2.1 Forth at NRAO
Moore developed the first complete , stand - alone implementation of Forth in 1971 for the 11 - meter radio telescope operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) at Kitt Peak , Arizona .
This system ran on two early minicomputers ( a 16 KB DDP - 116 and a 32 KB H316 ) joined by a serial link .
Both a multiprogrammed system and a multiprocessor system ( in that both computers shared responsibility for controlling the telescope and its scientific instruments ) , it was responsible for pointing and tracking the telescope , collecting data and recording it on magnetic tape , and supporting an interactive graphics terminal on which an astronomer could analyze previously recorded data .
The multiprogrammed nature of the system allowed all these functions to be performed concurrently , without timing conflicts or other interference .
The system was also unique for that time in that all software development took place on the minis themselves , using magnetic tape for source .
Not only did these Forth systems support application development , they even supported themselves .
Forth itself was written in Forth , using a “ metacompiler ” to generate a new system kernel when needed .
To place these software capabilities in context , it ’s important to realize that manufacturer - supplied system software for these early minicomputers was extremely primitive .
The main tools were cross assemblers and FORTRAN cross compilers running on mainframes ( although the FORTRAN cross compilers were too inefficient to do anything complex , given the tiny memories on the target machines ) .
On - line programming support was limited to assemblers loaded from paper tape , with source maintained on paper tape .
Digital Equipment Corp. had just announced its RT - 11 OS for its PDP - 11 line , which offered limited foreground - background operation ; no form of concurrency was available for the H316 family .
Multiuser operation of the sort that enabled NRAO ’s astronomers to graphically analyze data while an operator controlled the telescope and live data was flowing in , was unheard - of .
Edward K. Conklin , head of the Tucson division of NRAO which operated the 11 - meter telescope , found it difficult to maintain the software since Moore was based at NRAO ’s headquarters in Charlottesville , VA .
So in 1971 he brought in Elizabeth Rather , a systems analyst at the University of Arizona , to provide local support on a part time basis .
Rather was appalled to find this critical system written in a unique language , undocumented and known to only one human .
Her instinctive reaction was to re-write the whole thing in FORTRAN to get it under control .
Alas , however , there was neither time nor budget for this , so she set out to learn and document the system as best she could .
After about two months , Rather began to realize that something extraordinary was happening : despite the incredibly primitive nature of the on - line computers , despite the weirdness of the language , despite the lack of any local experts or resources , she could accomplish more in the few hours she spent on the Forth computers once a week than the entire rest of the week when she had virtually unlimited access to several large mainframes .
She wondered why .
The obvious answer seemed to lie in the interactive nature of Forth .
The programmer ’s attention is never broken by the procedural overhead of opening and closing files , loading and running compilers , linkers , loaders , debuggers , etc .
But there ’s more to it than that .
For example , all the tools used by Forth ’s OS , compiler , and other internal functions are available to the programmer .
And , as Chuck Moore intended , its constraints are minimal and its attitude is permissive .
Forth devotees still love to debate the source and magnitude of such productivity increases !
Rather immediately left the University and began working for NRAO jointly with Kitt Peak National Observatory ( KPNO ) , an optical observatory with which NRAO shared facilities , maintaining the Forth system for NRAO and developing one for KPNO ( which was later used on KPNO ’s 156 ″ Mayall telescope and other instruments [ Phys. Sci. 1975 ] ) .
During the next two years she wrote the first Forth manual [ Rather , 1972 ] and gave a number of papers and colloquia within the observatory and related astronomical organizations [ Moore , 1974a ] .
In 1973 Moore and Rather replaced the twin - computer system by a single disk - based PDP - 11 computer [ Moore , 1974 a&b ] .
This was a multi-user system , supporting four terminals in addition to the tasks controlling the telescope and taking data .
It was so successful that the control portions of it were still in use in 1991 ( data acquisition and analysis functions are more dependent on experimental equipment and techniques , which have changed radically over the years ) .
The system was so advanced that astronomers from all over the world began asking for copies of the software .
Versions were installed at Steward Observatory , MIT , Imperial College ( London ) , the Cerro Tololo ( Chile ) Inter - American Observatory , and the University of Utrecht ( Netherlands ) .
Its use spread rapidly , and in 1976 Forth was adopted as a standard language by the International Astronomical Union .
2.2 Commercial Minicomputer Systems
Following completion of the upgraded system in 1973 , Moore and his colleagues Rather and Conklin formed FORTH , Inc. to explore commercial uses of the language .
FORTH , Inc. developed multiuser versions of Forth [ Rather , 1976a ] for most of the minicomputers then in use ( see Table 1 ) , selling these as components of custom applications in a widely diverse market , ranging from data base applications to scientific applications such as image processing .
The minicomputers and applications of 1970s provided the environment in which Forth developed and stabilized , to the extent that all of the innovations contributed by independent implementors in the years that followed represented relatively minor variants on this theme .
Because of this , we shall take a close look at the design and structure of these systems .

2.2.1 Environmental constraints
Minicomputers of the 1970s were much less powerful than the smallest microcomputers of today .
In the first half of the decade not all systems even had disks — 1/2 ″ tape was often the only mass storage available .
Memory sizes ranged from 16 to 64 Kbytes , although the latter were considered large .
In the early 1970s , most programming for minis was done in assembly language .
By the middle of the decade compilers for Fortran and BASIC were available , and manufacturer - supplied executives such as DEC ’s RT - 11 supported foreground - background operation .
Multiuser systems were also becoming common : a PDP - 11 or Nova could be expected to support up to eight users , although the performance in a system with eight active users was poor .
On this hardware , Moore ’s Forth systems offered an integrated development toolkit including interactive access to an assembler , editor and the high - level Forth language , combined with a multitasking , multiuser operating environment supporting 64 users without visible degradation , all resident without run-time overlays .
Although time - critical portions of the system were written in assembler , as most applications required very high performance , Moore could port an entire Forth development environment to a new computer in about two weeks .
He achieved this by writing Forth in Forth — any Forth computer could generate Forth for another , given the target system ’s assembler and code for about 60 primitives .
Since the first step in a port was designing and writing the target assembler , it is possible that Moore has written more assemblers for different processors than anyone else .
Being able to port the system easily to new architectures was important , since the minicomputer market was extremely fragmented .
A large number of CPUs was available , and each was supported by a large number of possible disk controller and drive combinations .
Today , by contrast , the microcomputer market is dominated by a very short list of processor families , and adherence to de- facto standards such as the PC / AT is the norm .
Installations were done on site , since it was impractical to ship the minicomputers .
When LSI - 11 ’s first became available , Moore bought one and mounted it in a carry - on suitcase , with a single 8 ″ floppy drive in a second suitcase .
This portable personal computer accompanied him everywhere until 1982 , acting as a “ friendly ” host for generating new Forths .
2.2.2 Application requirements
If the principal environmental constraints were memory limitations and a need to serve a broad spectrum of CPU architectures , the application requirements were dominated by a need for performance .
Here are some of the principal application areas in which Forth achieved success in this period :
1. Commercial / business data base systems :
First developed for Cybek Corp. under the guidance of Arthur A. Gravina , these systems supported multiple terminals on a Data General Nova , handling high - speed transaction processing .
The first was written for Vernon Graphics , Inc. , a service bureau to Pacific Telephone , in 1974 .
It supported 32 terminals processing transactions against a 300 MB data base .
In its first week the system handled over 100,000 transactions a day ( 40,000 was the requirement ) .
The system was subsequently upgraded to support 64 terminals and a 600 MB data base , with no discernable degradation in response times , which remained under one second .
Cybek subsequently marketed this system for business applications in banking and hospital management ; its current version is marketed by a division of McDonnell Douglas .
A similar effort by Source Data Systems in Iowa produced a multi-terminal data - entry system marketed by NCR Corp. for hospital management and similar applications .
The performance of such a system is overwhelmingly dominated by operating system issues , principally the ability of the native Forth block - based file system to read and write data files very quickly .
2. Image Processing :
FORTH , Inc. developed a series of image processing applications for the Naval Weapons Research Center , NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , the Royal Greenwich Observatory in England , and others .
Central to these was a need for performing standardized operations ( e.g. , enhancement , windowing , etc. ) on images residing on different kinds of hardware .
The approach taken included many features now associated with object oriented programming : encapsulation ( the basic object was an “ image , ” with characteristic parameters and methods ) , inheritance ( you could add new images that would inherit characteristics of previously defined classes of images ) and dynamic binding of manipulation methods .
Moore , the principal architect of this approach , was unaware of any academic work in this area .
Striving to achieve the same goals as later OOPS writers , he independently derived similar solutions .
Image processing systems are also distinguished by a need to manipulate and move large quantities of data very fast ; a 512x512x16 image , for example , occupies 512 KB .
In addition to the high - speed disk performance that characterized Forth data base systems , these also required fast processing speed and the ability to handle algorithms such as FFTs .
As many minicomputers lacked hardware floating - point arithmetic , Forth included flexible integer and fixed - point fraction operators , as well as specialized array primitives .
3. Instrumentation and control :
Forth was first developed and used for this purpose at NRAO , and Forth is widely used for instrumentation and controls today .
FORTH , Inc. did several more astronomical systems ( for the Universities of Wyoming [ Gehrz , 1978 ] , Minnesota , Hawaii and Illinois ; Cal Tech ; plus the Royal Greenwich Observatory and St Andrews University in the UK ) .
In addition , a number of commercial instrument manufacturers such as Princeton Applied Research ( now a division of EG&G ) and Nicolet Instruments adopted Forth as a language for internal development .
These applications are characterized by high data rates , as much as 20 KHz in some cases , which really strained the CPU speed of the processors available .
Fast interrupt response was essential , along with high - speed multitasking to allow data acquisition to proceed concurrently with operator activity and instrument control .
2.2.3 Influences
The evolution of Forth prior to 1978 was completely dominated by Moore himself .
As we have seen , Moore was and is a fanatic minimalist , dedicated to the principle of zero - based design in which every feature and every instruction must justify its existence or be ruthlessly scrapped .
Moore originally developed the system for his own use .
It surprised him a little to find that Rather and the other early users also liked it and found it enhanced their productivity as much as it did his .
But even after the formation of FORTH , Inc. and its open marketing of the system , the selection and design of support tools and the general programming interface was dominated by his personal tastes .
Moore was working primarily as a consultant , supported by others within FORTH , Inc. , installing a Forth system on a customer ’s computer as the first step in developing a custom application .
Since the customer was primarily interested in the application , it was imperative that the port be completed quickly and inexpensively .
The extreme simplicity of Forth made this possible without compromising the performance of the application .
Each of these projects contributed its own lessons , tools and techniques .
Moore carried microfiche listings of all previous projects in his briefcase , and often referred to them to get the code for some unique primitive or driver from the past .
Frequently used words might become a standard fixture of the system .
Also , improved techniques for solving common problems were integrated into the system .
This pattern of continual evolution created customer support headaches for FORTH , Inc. , however , as no two installed systems were the same .
In most cases the installation included a five - day Forth programming course taught by Rather , who had to check every evening to make sure that the system still behaved the way it was being taught .
2.3 Early Microprocessor Systems
In 1976 , Robert O. Winder , of RCA ’s Semiconductor Division engaged FORTH , Inc. to implement Forth on its new CDP - 1802 8 - bit microprocessor [ Rather , 1976 b ] , [ Electronics , 1976 ] .
The new product , called “ microFORTH , ” was subsequently implemented on the Intel 8080 , Motorola 6800 and Zilog Z80 , and sold by FORTH , Inc. as an off - the - shelf product .
microFORTH was successfully used in numerous embedded microprocessor instrumentation and control applications in the United States , Britain and Japan .
2.3.1 Environment and applications
microFORTH was FORTH , Inc. ’s first experience with off - the - shelf , mail - order software packages ; the minicomputer systems were all installed on - site .
The mail - order operation was made possible by the rapid standardization of the industry on 8 ″ “ IBM - format ” floppy disks , and the relatively small number of development systems for each CPU type .
These microprocessors were all 8 - bit devices , typically with 16 K bytes of memory in the development system .
The target systems were usually custom boards ( although Intel ’s Single Board Computer series quickly became popular ) and the software was expected to run from PROM in an embedded environment without disk or ( usually ) terminal .
This was significantly different from the minicomputer environment , where there was always a disk , and a program was expected to run on the same ( or identical ) computer as the one used for development .
Most microprocessor manufacturers offered development platforms consisting of the same microprocessor as in the target , up to 64 K bytes of RAM , a serial line for a terminal , a parallel printer port , and two 8 ″ floppy disk drives .
Software support was mainly assembler , although Intel soon introduced PL/ M .
In - circuit emulators and separate utilities were introduced for debugging .
microFORTH was principally marketed as an interactive alternative to assembler which , unlike PL/M , was available across most microprocessor families and therefore offered a higher degree of transportability .
2.3.2 Language definition
Following some initial experimentation with 8 - bit stack width and 128 - byte block buffers , it was quickly decided to maintain the same basic internal architecture as on the minicomputer systems .
The organization of the program changed significantly , however .
microFORTH came with a target nucleus designed to run from PROM .
This nucleus was only 1 K in size , containing primitives such as single - precision arithmetic and other very basic functions .
The development environment supported writing and testing code interactively , and then compiling a version of that code designed to mate to the run-time nucleus .
A version of VARIABLE was provided to support segregated ROM / RAM data space ( CONSTANTs were in PROM ) , and defining words were adapted so that user - defined structures could be made to reside in either .
And whereas previously VARIABLEs could be initialized at compile time , that capability was removed , as it ’s difficult to initialize target RAM when a ROM is being compiled without setting up a “ shadow ” table ; ROM space was considered too precious for that .
The multiprogramming support was initially stripped out , although it later came back using a new , faster task - swapping algorithm , and the data base tools vanished completely .
FORTH , Inc. never released the metacompiler used to generate Forth on new minicomputer CPUs .
A variant of this metacompiler became an integral part of microFORTH , however , as it was used to generate the ROMable code for the target application .
This was significant , as we shall see in the next section .
2.3.3 Influences
The principal architect of microFORTH was Dean Sanderson .
Although Sanderson worked closely with Moore and shared most of his basic philosophies , differences in style and approach were inevitable .
But the major new influence came from the broader customer base that resulted from the wider marketing of microFORTH .
It was customer pressure that brought back multiprogramming , and this larger customer base also caused standards groups to form .
2.4 Language Definition
The commercial mini and microcomputer implementations produced by FORTH , Inc. in the early - and mid-1970s for the first time encapsulated the principles and elements of Forth as it is used today .
For this reason , we shall summarize these briefly .
2.4.1 Design principles
Much as algebra was the “ metaphor ” for FORTRAN , Forth was conceived on the model of English prose ( though some have suggested that its postfix notation tends to resemble verb - at - the - end languages such as German ) .
Its elements ( “ words ” ) are named data items ( roughly equivalent to nouns ) , named procedures ( equivalent to verbs ) , and defining words ( special kinds of verbs capable of creating data items with customized characteristics ) .
Words may be defined in terms of previously defined words or in machine code ( using the embedded assembler ) .
Forth “ words ” are functionally analogous to subroutines in other languages .
They are also equivalent to commands in other languages – Forth blurs the distinction between linguistic elements and functional elements .
Words are referenced ( either from the keyboard or in program source ) by name .
As a result , the term “ word ” is applied both to program ( and linguistic ) units and to their text names .
In parsing text , Forth considers a word to be any string of characters bounded by spaces ( or “ white space ” characters in some file - based systems ) .
Except for these , there are no special characters that cannot be included in a word or start a word , although many programming teams adopt naming conventions to improve readability .
Words encountered in text fall into three categories : defined words ( i.e. , Forth routines ) , numbers , and undefined words .
There are no explicit typing mechanisms in Forth , a feature which sometimes surprises newcomers , but is generally admired by experienced Forth programmers .
2.4.2 Structured programming disciplines
Architecturally , Forth words adhere strictly to the principles of “ structured programming ” as articulated by Dijkstra [ e.g. , Dijkstra , 1969 ] and “ modular programming ” [ Parnas , 1971 ] .
These principles may be summarized as follows :
Every program is described as a linear sequence of self - contained modules .
A module has one entry point and one exit point and ideally performs one function , given a set of inputs and a set of outputs .
A module can contain :
references to other modules
decision structures ( IF THEN statements )
looping structures
Top - down design and bottom - up coding and testing are strongly encouraged by Forth ’s structure .
As was the case with Moore ’s independent development of OOP - like features in his image processing system , Moore was unfamiliar with the contemporary literature on structured programming .
These principles were first called to his attention in 1973 by Rather , who received several comments on the apparent relationship between Forth and structured programming in seminars she was giving on Forth .
On reading one of Djikstra ’s papers , Moore observed , “ it just seems like good programming practice to me . ”
In fact , advanced Forth programmers with knowledge of the underlying implementation know ways of “ cheating , ” but such practices are frowned upon , and definitely not supported or encouraged by the structure of the language .
2.4.3 Elements of Forth
Moore ’s Forth systems of the early 1970s were built on a nucleus of only 4 K bytes .
This tiny program included disk ( or tape ) and terminal drivers and the ability to search and build the dictionary .
This nucleus was then used to compile from source the balance of the programming environment , including the assembler , editor , multiuser support and several hundred general commands .
Booting the system , including compiling most of it from source into executable form , took only a few seconds .
A metacompiler , also written in Forth , was used to compile the nucleus .
The entire source for the system was about 40 pages long .
These systems were “ native , ” that is , running without any host OS or executive .
This was a necessity in the early days , as OSs were n’t available .
Later , it was regarded as a significant advantage , as I/O services in a native Forth environment were much faster than could be supplied by a general purpose OS .
The principal elements of Forth will be discussed briefly in the sections that follow .
2.4.3.1 Dictionary
A Forth program is organized into an extensible dictionary that occupies almost all the memory used by the system .
The dictionary is classically implemented as a linked list of variable - length items , each of which defines a word .
The content of each definition depends upon the type of word ( data item , constant , sequence of operations , etc. ) .
On multi-user Forth systems individual users may have private dictionaries , each of which is connected to a shared , re-entrant system dictionary .
2.4.3.2 Push - down stacks
Forth maintains two push - down stacks , or LIFO lists ( on a multiprogrammed version , a pair for each task ) .
These are used to pass data between Forth words and for controlling logical flow .
A stack contains one - cell items , where a cell is 16 bits wide on 8 - bit and 16 - bit computers and 32 bits wide on most implementations for 32 - bit processors such as the 680×0 family .
Extended - precision numbers occupy two stack positions , with the most significant part on top .
Items on either stack may be addresses or data items of various kinds .
Stacks are of indefinite size , and usually grow towards low memory .
Forth ’s explicit use of stacks leads to a “ postfix ” notation in which operands precede operators .
Since results of operations are left on the stack , operations may be strung together effortlessly , and there is little need to define variables to use for temporary storage .
2.4.3.3 Interpreters
Forth is an interpretive system , in that program execution is typically controlled by a small machine - code routine ( often only two or three instructions ) interpreting lists of pointers or tokens for abstract machine functions .
This architecture is much faster than classical interpreters , as used in BASIC and PROLOG for example , enabling it to perform satisfactorily in the real - time applications for which it was designed .
This internal engine is often referred to as the “ inner ” or “ address ” interpreter , as distinct from Forth ’s more traditional text interpreter which processes source and user input .
The text interpreter extracts strings separated by spaces from the terminal or mass storage , looking each word up in the dictionary .
If a word is found it is executed by invoking the address interpreter , which processes a string of addresses compiled in a word definition by executing the definition pointed to by each .
The text is not stored in memory , even in condensed form .
If a word is not found , the system attempts to convert it as a number and push it onto the stack .
If number conversion fails ( due to a non-numeric character ) , the interpreter aborts with an error message .
The address interpreter has two important properties .
First , it is fast , often requiring as few as one or two machine instructions per address .
Second , it makes Forth definitions extremely compact , as each reference requires only one cell ( or computer word ; Forth users prefer to avoid the use of “ word ” as a hardware unit because of its use to denote an element in the language ) .
In contrast , a subroutine call constructed by most compilers requires instructions for handling the calling sequence before and after a CALL or JSR instruction and address , and typically save and restore registers within the subroutine .
Forth ’s stack architecture obviates the need for an explicit calling sequence , and most implementations make global register assignments in which certain system state variables are assigned to dedicated registers , and all other registers are designated scratch registers for use in code words .
2.4.3.4 Assembler
Most Forth systems include a macro assembler for the CPU on which they run .
When using CODE the programmer has full control over the CPU , as with any other assembler , and CODE definitions run at full machine speed .
The assembler lets the programmer use explicit CPU - dependent code in manageable pieces with machine - independent interfacing conventions .
To move an application to a different processor requires re-coding only the CODE words , which will interact with other Forth words in exactly the same manner .
Forth assemblers feature an unusual design , which has two goals :
to improve transportability between processors by standardizing assembler notation as much as possible without impairing the programmer ’s control of the processor , and to yield a compact assembler that can be resident at all times to facilitate interactive programming and debugging .
In a classical Forth assembler , the op - code itself is a Forth word which assembles the instruction according to operands passed on the stack giving the addressing information .
This leads to a format in which the addressing mode specifiers precede the op - code ( consistent with the postfix notation used elsewhere in Forth ) .
Moore also standardized notation for addressing modes , although he usually used the manufacturer ’s instruction mnemonics .
Registers were generally referred to by number , except for registers assigned to key internal system functions .
For example , the stack pointer is usually in a register called S. One would address the second item on a two - byte wide stack using the phrase 2 S ) .
Forth assemblers support structured programming in the same way that high - level Forth does .
Arbitrary branching to labelled locations is discouraged ; on the other hand , structures such as BEGIN … UNTIL and IF … ELSE … THEN are available in the assembler ( implemented as macros that assemble appropriate conditional and unconditional branches ) .
Such structures are easy to implement because the stack is available during assembly to carry addressing information .
Conventional assemblers leave the code in a file , which must be integrated with code in files from high - level language compilers ( if any ) by a linker before the resultant program can be loaded into memory for testing .
The resident Forth assembler assembles the code directly into memory in executable form , thus avoiding the linking step .
The Forth assembler is used to write short , named routines that function just like high - level Forth words : when the name of the routine is invoked , it will be executed .
Like other Forth routines , code routines expect their arguments on the stack and leave their results there .
Within code a programmer may refer to constants ( to get a value ) , variables ( to get an address ) or other defined data types .
Code routines may be called from high - level definitions just as other Forth words , but do not themselves call high - level or code definitions .
These features enable Forth programmers to write code in short , easily testable modules that are automatically integrated into an application .
Programming is fully structured , with consistent rules of usage and user interface for both assembler and high - level programming .
Words are tested incrementally , while the desired behavior is fresh in the programmer ’s mind .
Most new words can be tested simply by placing input values on the stack , typing the word to be tested and validating the result left on the stack by displaying it .
The result is complete control of the computer , high performance where needed , and overall shortening of development time due to interactive programming at all levels .
2.4.3.5 Disk support
Classical Forth divides mass storage into “ blocks ” of 1024 bytes each .
The block size was chosen as a convenient standard across disks whose sector sizes vary .
At least two block buffers are maintained in memory , and the block management algorithm makes it appear that all blocks are in memory at all times .
The command n BLOCK returns the memory address of block n , having read it if necessary .
A buffer whose contents is changed is marked so that when it needs to be reused its block is automatically written out .
This algorithm provides a convenient form of virtual memory for data and source storage , with a minimum number of physical disk accesses required .
FORTH , Inc. ’s data base applications build data files out of blocks , with a file defined as spanning a specified range of blocks ; data access is through operations performed against named fields within selected files .
In native Forths , the block system is both fast and reliable , as the disk driver computes the physical address of the block from its number – no directory is required .
In disk - intensive applications , performance can be enhanced by adding more buffers , so more blocks will be found in memory ; the buffers become a disk cache .
In the 1980s , Forth systems became available running under conventional OSs , as we shall see .
Many of these support blocks within host OS files , although some have abandoned blocks altogether .
As blocks provide a compatible means of accessing mass storage across both native and non-native systems , ANS Forth ( Section 5.1 ) requires that blocks be available if any mass storage support is available .
2.4.3.6 Multiprogramming
The earliest Forth systems supported multiprogramming , in that the computer could execute multiple concurrent program sequences .
In 1973 , Moore extended this capability to support multiple users , each with a terminal and independent sub- dictionaries and stacks .
The entity executing one of these program sequences or supporting a user is referred to as a task .
Many of today ’s Forths support multiprogramming , and most of these use variants of Moore ’s approach .
This approach allocates CPU time using a cooperative , non-preemptive algorithm : a task relinquishes the CPU while awaiting completion of an I/ O operation or upon use of the word PAUSE , which relinquishes the CPU for exactly one lap around the round - robin task queue .
Moore ’s systems used interrupts for I/O .
Interrupts were directly vectored to the response code using an assembler macro , without intervention by the Forth executive .
Interrupt code performed only the most time - critical operations ( e.g. , read a number , increment a counter ) , then reenabled the task that had been suspended pending the interrupt .
The task would actually resume operation the next time it was encountered in the round - robin task loop , at which time it would complete any high - level processing occasioned by the event and continue its work .
In theory this non-preemptive algorithm is vulnerable to a task monopolizing the CPU with logically or computationally intensive activity , but in practice real - time systems are so dominated by I/O that this is rarely a problem .
Where CPU - intensive operations do occur , PAUSE is used to “ tune ” performance .
Event : VRTX OS9 PDOS polyFORTH Interrupt response 91 43.75 93.4 7.0 Context switch 128 186.25 93.4 36.0 Suspend task 180 316.25 184.7 6.8
Copy memory ( 80 bytes ) 212.5 97.0
Consultant Bill Cox pointed out [ Cox , 1987 ] that a non-preemptive algorithm such as this has several advantages .
First , the task scheduler itself is simpler and faster , taking as little as one machine instruction per task .
Second , since a task is suspended only at known , well - defined times , it has less “ context ” to be saved and restored , so the context - switch itself is faster .
Third , task code can be written with the knowledge of exactly when the task does or does not control the CPU , and management of shared resources is considerably simplified .
Cox compared the performance of several real - time OSs ; the results are given in Table 2 .
Tasks were constructed when the system was booted , and each was given a fixed memory allocation adequate to the functions it was intended to perform .
As re-booting took only a few seconds , it was easy to reconfigure a task .
2.4.3.7 Computation
Until the late 1970s , few minicomputers offered floating point arithmetic — indeed , many lacked hardware multiply and divide .
From the beginning , however , Forth was used for computationally intensive work .
Controlling the radio telescope , for example , required converting wanted positions from the celestial coordinates in which astronomical objects are located to an azimuth / elevation coordinate system once per second and interpolating intermediate positions five times per second , with data acquisition and operator activity proceeding concurrently .
Moore ’s approach was to build into Forth the ability to manipulate integers effectively .
For example , the command */ multiplies two single - cell integers and divides by a third , with a double - length intermediate product .
This reflects the way most multiply and divide machine instructions work , and enables calculations such as :
12345 355 113 */
This phrase multiplies 12345 by the ratio 355/113 , which represents PI with an error of 8.5 x 10 - 8 [ Brodie , 1981 ] .
The ability to multiply by a ratio is ideal for calibration and scaling , as well as rational approximations .
Similarly , the word / MOD performs a single division , returning both the quotient and remainder .
A rich set of single , double and mixed - precision operations such as these make integer arithmetic much more usable than it is in most languages .
Moore expressed angles internally as 14 - bit , 15 - bit or 30 - bit fixed - point binary fractions .
He provided a set of primitives to convert to and from angle formats ( e.g. , dd : mm:ss ) , and a math library supporting transcendental functions for these formats based largely on algorithms from [ Hart 1968 ] .
Operations such as the Fast Fourier Transform were provided in some applications , built on specialized primitives supporting complex numbers as scaled integer pairs .
Today fast floating - point processors are common .
Many Forths support floating point , as does ANS Forth .
But in many cases , such as embedded systems on simple microcontrollers , Forth ’s integer arithmetic still provides simpler , faster solutions .
2.4.3.8 Data types
Perhaps nowhere was Moore ’s personal philosophy more in evidence than in his approach to data typing .
Basically , he wanted to assume full responsibility for manipulating data objects in whatever way he wished .
If pressed on this point , he would say , “ If I want to add 1 to the letter A , it ’s none of the compiler ’s business to tell me I can ’t . ”
Standard words in Forth support single and double - precision CONSTANTs , which return their values on the stack , and VARIABLEs , which return a pointer .
CREATE names the beginning of a data region in which space can be reserved .
The pointer returned by a CREATEd entity can be incremented to index into an array .
The nature of the values kept in constants and variables was entirely arbitrary ; there is normally no explicit type checking .
Strings are normally kept in memory with their length in the first byte .
The address of this structure , or the address and length of the actual string , can be passed on the stack .
CONSTANT , VARIABLE and CREATE are “ defining words , ” that is , they define new words with characteristic behaviors .
Forth also provides tools to enable the programmer to build new defining words , specifying a custom behavior both at compile time ( e.g. , setting up and initializing a table ) and run-time ( e.g. , accepting an index and automatically applying it to the base address of the structure ) .
3. Forth Without Chuck Moore
microFORTH was heavily marketed , and attracted a lot of attention in the late ’70s .
One side effect of this was the growth of an active and enthusiastic group of hobbyists who fell in love with Forth .
In their wake came new companies marketing versions of Forth in competition with FORTH , Inc .
At the same time , Moore himself was becoming increasingly drawn toward hardware implementations of Forth , and less involved in software production at FORTH , Inc. ( which he left in 1982 to pursue his hardware interests full time ) .
In this section we examine the development of Forth under these diverse new influences .
3.1 The Forth Interest Group
In the late 1970s , Northern California was afire with the early rumblings of the Computer Revolution .
Groups of interested individuals such as the “ Home Brew Computer Club ” were meeting to share interests and experiences .
Magazines such as Radio Electronics published step - by - step instructions on how to build your own video display terminal , and even how to build your own microcomputer system .
Due to the high cost of memory and low level of VLSI integration , typical “ homebrew ” computers were very resource - constrained environments .
Echoing back to the first generation computers , there was insufficient memory to concurrently support an editor , assembler and linker .
Mass storage was slow and expensive , so many homebrew systems used paper tape or audio cassette tapes for I/O .
Although some BASIC language products were available , they were typically very slow , and incapable of supporting significant programs .
The stage was thus set for something else to meet the expanding needs of these hardy explorers and “ early adopters . ”
Forth had been born and bred to exploit the minimal facilities of resource - constrained systems .
It carried neither the excess baggage of a general solution nor a requirement for an existing file or operating system or significant mass storage .
As Forth was used to tackle more and more difficult embedded computer applications , it started to claim the attention of the Northern California homebrew computer enthusiasts .
Bill Ragsdale , a successful Bay Area security system manufacturer , became aware of the benefits of microFORTH , and in 1978 asked FORTH , Inc. to produce a version of microFORTH for the 6502 .
FORTH , Inc. declined , seeing much less market demand for microFORTH on the 6502 than the more popular 8080 , Z80 and 6800 CPUs .
Ragsdale then looked for someone with the knowledge of microFORTH and intimate familiarity with the 6502 to port a version of microFORTH to the 6502 .
He found Maj .
Robert Selzer , who had used microFORTH for an AMI 6800 development system on an Army project and was privately developing a standalone editor / assembler / linker package for the 6502 .
Selzer wrote a 6502 Forth assembler , and used the Army ’s microFORTH metacompiler to target compile the first 6502 stand - alone Forth for the Jolt single board computer .
Selzer and Ragsdale subsequently made substantial modifications and improvements to the model , including exploitation of page zero and stack - implicit addressing architectural features in the 6502 .
Many of the enhancements that characterized the later public - domain versions were made during this period , including variable - length name fields and modifications to the dictionary linked - list threading .
A metacompiler on the Jolt could target a significantly changed kernel to a higher address in memory .
A replacement bootable image would then be recompiled by the new kernel into the lower boot address , which could then be written out to disk .
At this point , Ragsdale had a system with which to meet his professional needs for embedded security systems .
During this period the Forth Interest Group ( FIG ) was started by Ragsdale , Kim Harris , John James , David Boulton , Dave Bengel , Tom Olsen and Dave Wyland [ FIG 1978 ] .
They introduced the concept of a “ FIG Forth Model , ” a publicly available Forth system that could be implemented on popular computer architectures .
The FIG Forth Model was derived from Ragsdale ’s 6502 system .
In order to simplify publication and rapid implementation across a wide variety of architectures , a translator was written to convert Forth metacompiler source code into text that , when input to a standard 6502 assembler , would replicate the original kernel image .
In this way , neither the metacompiler nor its source code needed to be published .
This is an important point .
Forth metacompilation is a difficult process to understand completely .
It requires the direct manipulation of three distinct execution phases and object areas , and is not something that a casual user wanted or needed .
By publishing assembler listings , the Forth Interest Group was able to encapsulate a Forth run-time environment in a manner that could be easily replicated and / or translated to the assembly language of a different computer architecture .
It was the intention of the original team of implementors to thus stimulate the development of compatible Forth systems and the appearance of new vendors of Forth products .
After the 6502 FIG Model was published , FIG implementors published compatible versions for the 8080 and 6800 microcomputers and the PDP - 11 and Computer Automation minicomputers .
Over the years , volunteers added other platforms and documentation .
The 1982 Forth Encyclopedia by Mitch Derick and Linda Baker [ Derick , 1982 ] provided an exhaustive 333 - page manual on FIG Forth , with flow charts of most words .
In 1983 an ad in Forth Dimensions , the FIG newsletter [ FIG , 1983 ] , listed : RCA 1802 , 8080 , PACE , 6502 , 8086/88 , 6800 , 6809 , 9900 , Nova , Eclipse , VAX , Alpha Micro , Apple II , 68000 , PDP11 / LSI11 and Z80 .
Today there are several thousand members of the Forth Interest Group in over fifteen countries .
Since 1980 , FIG has sponsored an annual conference called FORML ( Forth Modification Laboratory ) , an educational forum for sharing and discussing new or unproven proposals intended to benefit Forth , and for discussion of technical aspects of Forth .
Its proceedings are available from the Forth Interest Group .
3.2 Commercial and Public Domain Systems for Personal Computers
Apple Computer grew out of the bubbling computer enthusiasm in the San Francisco Bay area , and with it a whole new generation of resource - constrained computers .
Although BASIC was available in ROM , Forth was used to write a number of popular text editors and games on the Apple ] [ , allowing resident development of significant programs within its scarce memory and disk constraints .
It is hard now , with ubiquitous megabytes of memory and disk , to imagine what it was like to develop significant programs on a 40 - column wide screen within 16 K of memory and 100 K of disk storage .
Vendors of low cost Forth systems sprang up almost overnight , each supporting their favorite personal computer , most of them basing their systems on the FIG model .
In 1979 , for example , Miller Microcomputer Services announced MMSFORTH for the TRS - 80 [ TRS - 80 , 1979 ] , and by 1980 Computerworld reported [ Taylor , 1980 ] that MMS had over 100 user groups for its product .
When IBM entered the personal computer business with their original PC product offering , they chose to distribute a version of the popular Apple ] [ text editor EasyWriter , written in Forth , as an IBM product .
Laboratory Microsystems ( LMI ) introduced a commercial IBM PC Forth system in 1982 .
Numerous commercial and public domain Forth products followed , and significant software product development began .
Following its introduction of the first commercial Forth for the IBM - PC , LMI maintained a continuing strategy of producing cutting - edge Forth systems for the PC , including a 32 - bit real - mode implementation ( February 1983 ) , an OS / 2 - based Forth ( February 1988 ) and a Windows version ( 1992 ) .
Along the way LMI ’s founder , Ray Duncan , became an acknowledged authority on Microsoft OSs [ e.g. Duncan , 1988 ] .
FORTH , Inc. ’s PC offering was polyFORTH , which combined the multiuser support and data base tools of its minicomputer products with the ROMable architecture of microFORTH .
By 1984 FORTH , Inc. was supporting up to 16 users on a PC with no visible degradation , running polyFORTH first as a native OS and later as a co-resident OS with MS - DOS .
By the late 1980s , polyFORTH users such as NCR were supporting as many as 150 users on a single 80386 - based PC .
In 1978 , Maj . Seltzer gave Don Colburn a copy of the 6502 Forth he wrote for Ragsdale in exchange for Colburn ’s writing two articles on Selzer ’s 6502 work .
Colburn subsequently used this as a basis for a version based on the preliminary FORTH - 77 standard ( the only FORTH - 77 implementation of which the authors are aware ) .
In the Fall of 1979 , Colburn generated a FIG - compatible system for prototypes of the 68000 .
A multitasking , multiuser version of this product called MultiForth was demonstrated to Motorola in January , 1980 , well ahead of production shipments of the 68000 .
When Hewlett Packard ’s desktop computer division designed a new generation of desktop computers around the 68000 in 1982 , the first available third - party language product they distributed under an HP part number was MultiForth .
Colburn ’s company Creative Solutions also introduced MacForth , the first resident development system for the 128k Apple Macintosh , immediately after the Mac ’s debut in January of 1984 .
Because MacForth uniquely provided direct access to the entire Macintosh “ Toolbox ROM ” routines in a resident programming environment , along with comprehensive application examples , a majority of the first generation of Macintosh application programmers learned how to create and use pull - down menus , windows , graphics and mice with MacForth .
Significant large - volume spreadsheets , 2D and 3D rendering and design packages , CAD / CAM design tools , games , medical diagnostics , image enhancement programs , accounting packages , desktop planetariums and process control applications were written on early Macintoshes in MacForth .
By 1985 there were over seventy vendors of Forth systems , ranging from single individuals to multi-million dollar organizations .
In 1982 Lawrence Forsley founded the Institute for Applied Forth Research , now called simply the Forth Institute .
This organization sponsored an annual Conference on Forth Applications at the University of Rochester , Rochester NY , and publishes the Journal of Forth Application and Research , a refereed technical periodical on applications of Forth , new developments and techniques , and surveys of specific areas of Forth .
In 1989 , George Shaw and others formed an ACM Special Interest Group on Forth called SIGForth , which also sponsors a newsletter and an annual conference .

Byte Magazine dedicated its August , 1980 issue to Forth .
It was their largest - selling issue to date , and was reprinted several times .
3.2.1 Design principles
FIG Forth was optimized for portability rather than performance .
Only a very few primitives were coded in assembler , and the rest of the logic was implemented using high - level Forth .
As a result it was fairly slow — some operations , such as dictionary searches , were a factor of ten slower than representative commercial implementations .
Other internal decisions were similarly made with the neophyte in mind .
For example , the earlier FORTH , Inc. systems compiled word names as the length of the name and the first three characters .
This gave a lower collision rate than simple truncation , and was adequate most of the time .
But the FIG model used variable - length names up to 31 characters , thereby trading size for user - friendliness .
This was somewhat controversial at the time ( see Fig. 1 ) , but by the mid 1980s , most systems had converted to this usage .
The advent of personal computers provided Forth implementers with the incentive to learn to run under a host OS .
The first non-native systems were developed in 1980 by Martin Tracy of Micromotion ( for the Apple ] [ ) and Ray Duncan of Laboratory Microsystems , Inc. ( for CP / M on Z80’s ) .
LMI ’s system also featured a full - screen editor .
In 1981 , LMI added support for software and hardware floating point , and also pioneered performance enhancements such as native code translation and caching dictionary lookups in a hash table to accelerate dictionary searches .
The advent of non-native Forth implementations introduced an issue that remains controversial in Forth practice today , the use of host OS files for mass storage .
There are two main approaches : abandoning traditional blocks altogether in favor of directly manipulating source and data in files , and mapping blocks to host OS files .
The former approach is favored by implementers who are concentrating on systems for a particular OS ( e.g. , MS - DOS ) , whereas the latter is preferred by organizations such as FORTH , Inc. that support both native and non-native products .
Creative Solutions ’ MacForth used very compact object image strategies , including token threading and separated name heads to maximize the amount of memory available for program development on the original 128K Macintoshes .
Other novel features included runtime relocation of the executable image and exclusion of word names in runtime systems without metacompilation .
MacForth included a seamless programming environment , incorporating screen based text editor , compiler , interpreter , and assembler in under 20 k bytes of memory .
3.2.2 Influencess
The FIG Model was in the public domain , and was ported to a wide variety of computer systems .
Because the internal design of FIG Forth was essentially the same across all machines , programs written in FIG Forth enjoyed a substantial degree of portability , even for “ system - level ” programs that directly manipulated the internals of dictionary entries and other implementation - dependent features .
Because FIG
Forth was the first introduction to Forth for many people , it is widely associated with “ the nature of Forth . ”
However , FIG Forth was not representative of all commercial implementations of this era .
Commercial vendors tended to be much more performance - conscious , and elected implementation strategies that optimized performance or size rather than porting ease , as we have seen .
The first major effort to standardize Forth was a meeting in Utrecht in 1977 , attended by several astronomical Forth users and FORTH , Inc. ( at that time the only commercial vendor ) .
They produced a preliminary standard called FORTH - 77 , and agreed to meet the following year .
Meetings in 1978 and 1979 on Catalina Island in California , now including representatives from the Forth Interest Group and other producers , yielded a more comprehensive standard called FORTH - 79 .
Although FORTH - 79 was very influential , many Forth users and vendors found flaws in it ; in 1982 two meetings were held to update the standard , and in 1983 a new standard was released called FORTH - 83 .
Both FORTH - 79 and FORTH - 83 specified a 16 - bit , twos - complement , unaligned , linear byte - addressed virtual machine , and included a number of assumptions about implementation techniques .

Figure 1 . “ Letter to the Editor ” of Forth Dimensions [ Moore , 1983 ] concerning the practice of storing names of Forth words as a count and first three characters .
Unfortunately , some of the changes in FORTH - 83 produced grave incompatibilities with existing code .
For example , the formal representation of a “ true ” flag had always been 1 , and the word NOT inverted a Boolean flag .
In FORTH - 83 , “ true ” became - 1 and NOT became a bit - wise complement .
Other problems involved the specification for floored division in FORTH - 83 and a serious ambiguity in the specification of parameters for certain loop structures .
The effect of these incompatibilities was divisive .
Although most implementors agreed that FORTH - 83 was an improvement and adopted the new standard , there remains a vocal group who never converted , and who remain skeptical of the whole standards process .
Of the systems listed in Table 3 , for example , most are fairly close to FORTH - 83 compatibility ; notable exceptions are MacForth , mmsFORTH and mvpFORTH , all of which stayed with FORTH - 79 .
In 1981 Prentice Hall published Starting FORTH , by Leo Brodie [ Brodie , 1981 ] , then an employee of FORTH , Inc .
Both lucid and entertaining ( Brodie drew memorable cartoon figures representing important Forth primitives ) , Starting FORTH was also a thorough introduction to the language .
It sold over 110,000 copies ( for a time it was the best - seller in Prentice Hall ’s computer line ) and exerted a powerful influence on many people learning about Forth for the first time , as well as on vendors scrambling to be compatible with it .
Although the first edition was primarily based on FORTH , Inc. ’s polyFORTH , it included many footnotes and examples in FIG Forth and other dialects .
The second edition ( 1987 ) was based on the FORTH - 83 standard .
Another major influence in the personal computer marketplace has been the competition between public - domain and commercial versions of Forth .
In the mid-1980s , the FIG model was gradually replaced by the public domain F83 ( produced by Henry Laxen , Mike Perry and others operating under the name “ No Visible Support Software ” ) , a multitasking system originally released on the IBM - PC .
Versions have been developed by many independent programmers on a wide variety of other platforms .
This system is so widespread that many people are led by its name to confuse it with the FORTH - 83 standard .
In fact , although it is largely compatible with FORTH - 83 , F83 goes well beyond the limited FORTH - 83 standard in its features .
In the late 1980s , Tom Zimmer and others produced an even more extensive public - domain system for PCs called F - PC , which includes several megabytes of source code and utilities .
But except for these , most public - domain Forths are rather limited .
Public - domain Forths have certainly helped to ensure that Forth is widely known .
But their influence is n’t entirely benign .
According to Tyler Sperry , editor of Embedded Systems Programming Magazine [ Sperry , 1991 ] :
The problem is that it is relatively easy to implement your own minimal Forth system .
The kernel , after all , is only a few hundred bytes of code … .
Unfortunately , bringing up a Forth interpreter is like writing a Small C compiler : it ’s only a toy without a well - developed library .
One of the biggest problems with public - domain and shareware systems is that their libraries are often only partially completed , with sketchy documentation .
And that ’s putting the situation kindly .
People who have only seen or used limited public - domain Forth implementations often perceive that Forth itself is a toy .
And suppliers of high - quality commercial systems must deal with prospective customers ’ assumptions that all Forths are the same , an assumption that naturally creates considerable price resistance given that the public - domain versions are extremely inexpensive .
The standing joke within the Forth community , however , is that “ when you ’ve seen one Forth … you ’ve seen one Forth . ”
The range in quality of code and documentation , nature and extent of libraries , as well as product support , is enormous .
A prospective user is well advised to evaluate a number of both public domain and commercial offerings .
3.3 Embedded Systems
3.3.1 Environment and applications
Forth ’s ability to make maximum use of limited hardware resources made it a natural choice for embedded uses of microprocessors .
Some of these have been small : an RCA 1802 - based cardiac monitor ( 1979 ) that performed a detailed waveform analysis of heart beats was not much larger than the 1 ″ x 2 ″ tape cassette it used to record abnormalities .
Some were large , such as the 750 - ton stretch press used by Lockheed to form panels for the C5B airplane wings in the early 1980s .
Some were distributed , such as the roughly 500 networked processors used for an extensive facility management system at the King Khaled International Airport at Ryadh , Saudi Arabia [ Rather , 1985 ] .
Forth has been especially successful in developing firmware for hand - held devices made by companies such as Itron and MSI Data .
In 1990 , Federal Express won the prestigious Malcolm Baldridge quality award for its package - tracking system , whose data entry is performed by Forth - based hand - held devices carried by Federal ’s 50,000 couriers and agents world - wide .
Forth ’s extreme modularity facilitates thorough , systematic testing , which has made it attractive for applications requiring high reliability .
As a result , it has been used in a number of satellites and Space Shuttle experiments .
McDonnell Douglas used polyFORTH in their Electrophoresis in Space project [ Wood , 1986 ] to control the cargo bay factory itself ( multiple 68000 VME - bus boards ) , the astronaut ’s control console ( a laptop PC ) , and their ground - based analysis computer ( a Compaq PC ) .
The November , 1990 Columbia shuttle flight carried four astronomy payloads , of which three were programmed in Forth [ Ballard 1991 ] , and the January , 1992 , Spacelab flight featured a Microgravity Vestibular Investigation ( MVI ) experiment using a polyFORTH system for on - board control and analysis [ Paloski , 1986 ] and MACH2 in a ground - based Macintosh for analysis .
Probably the most prolific single purveyor of embedded Forths is Sun Microsystems , whose SPARC workstations all use a programmable Forth - based monitor called Open Boot , developed by Mitch Bradley and associates .
Bradley believes [ Bradley , 1991 ] that Forth was successful for this purpose because it offered :
a CPU - independent “ virtual machine ” to use for the byte - coded portable drivers ;
a debugging environment for those drivers ;
an interactive command language , with complete programming language capability , that was useful for hardware startup and debugging ;
a built - in debugging environment for the firmware itself ( firmware is otherwise rather painful to debug ) ;
a debugging environment for the operating system software ;
extensibility , allowing easy support of new hardware requirements and features ; and
great flexibility in tuning the implementation for speed / space tradeoffs .
At least one other major board - level CPU vendor has adopted Open Boot firmware across their product line , and there is a working group developing an IEEE standard for it .
3.3.2 Design principles
From the minis of the ’70s to the PCs of the ’ 80s , most Forth systems have supported development on the same computer on which the completed application is to run .
Even the microprocessor systems of the late ’ 70s and early ’ 80s were developed on the same CPU ( as opposed to cross development ) , with development software features for stripping the development tools and producing a ROMable target .
Most embedded systems lack a disk , a terminal , or both , thereby rendering themselves inhospitable to even the leanest Forth programming environment .
Nonetheless , some vendors do provide on - board Forths in microcontrollers .
Examples include the Rockwell AIM 65 mentioned above , and microcontroller boards sold by New Micros , Inc. of Texas ; Vesta Technologies , Inc. , in Colorado ; and Opto - 22 in California .
But as PCs became ubiquitous , they also became popular as hosts for more comfortable and powerful Forth cross-development environments .
These have generally been based on modified versions of the classical Forth metacompilers , adapted to support cross development .
The traditional Forth dictionary is integrated : a “ definition ” includes the word ’s name ( which can be found in a dictionary search performed by the text interpreter ) , an executable portion ( typically a pointer to code which executes words of a particular class , such as colon definitions , variables , constants , etc. ) , and data space ( containing one or more values or addresses of words that make up the content of the definition ) , all classically in contiguous memory locations ( but see Section 5.2 , Implementation Strategies ) .
A metacompiler divides these structurally into portions that are used by the host system ’s compiler ( equivalent to a symbol table ) and portions required at run-time in the target .
In order for a target program to be ROMable , the compiler must also manage separate ROM and RAM data spaces , usually using multiple sets of dictionary pointers .
4. Hardware Implementations of Forth
The internal architecture of Forth simulates a computer with two stacks , a set of registers , and other well - defined features .
As a result , it was almost inevitable that someone would attempt to build a hardware representation of the actual Forth computer .
The first such effort was made in 1973 by John Davies , of the Jodrell Bank Radio Astronomy Observatory near Manchester , England .
Davies ’ approach was to re-design a Ferranti computer that had gone out of production to optimize its instruction set for Forth .
The first actual Forth computers were bit - sliced board - level products .
The first of these was made by a California company called Standard Logic , in 1976 .
By making a minor modification in the instruction set of their board - level computer , Standard Logic ’s chief programmer Dean Sanderson was able to implement the precise instruction that Forth uses in its “ address interpreter ” to move from one high - level command to the next .
Their system was used widely by the U. S. Post Office .
In the early 1980s , Rockwell produced a microprocessor with Forth primitives in on - chip ROM , the Rockwell AIM 65F11 [ Dumse , 1984 ] .
This chip has been used quite successfully in embedded microprocessor applications .
However , no attempt was made to adapt the actual architecture of the processor ( basically a 6502 ) for Forth support .
In 1981 , Moore himself undertook to design an actual Forth chip .
Working first at FORTH , Inc. and subsequently with a start - up company called Novix , formed to develop the chip , Moore completed the design in 1984 , and the first prototypes were produced in early 1985 [ Golden , 1985 ] .
This design was subsequently purchased and adapted by Harris Semiconductor Corp. , and formed the basis of their line of RTX processors .
Starting in the early 1980s , a group at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland developed a series of experimental Forth processors for use in space instrumentation [ Hayes , 1987 ] .
The most successful of these , marketed as the SC - 32 by Silicon Composers of Palo Alto , CA , was used to control the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope which flew in the Columbia Space Shuttle in November , 1990 [ Ballard , 1991 ] .
It continues to be the basis for more space instruments under development .
Moore himself , working on his own , has continued to develop Forth - based processors for special applications .
The various Forth processors have had an influence on Forth software systems .
In order to take full advantage of these architectures , Forth compilers were developed by Moore , FORTH , Inc. and Laboratory Microsystems that generated machine code optimized for the chip ’s internal architecture .
A native looping structure in the Novix and Harris chips called FOR … NEXT ( which counted down from a single - argument upper limit to zero ) led to adoption of this structure in other Forths as well .
5. Present and Future Directions
The computer industry has always been characterized by rapid and profound changes .
Since Forth was last standardized in the early 1980s , the speed , memory size and disk capacity of affordable personal computers have increased by factors of more than 100 .
8 - bit processors are now rare in PCs ( although they are still widely used in embedded systems ) , and 32 - bit processors are common .
Operating systems , programming environments and user interfaces are far more sophisticated .
Many recent Forth implementations , both commercial and public - domain , have attempted to address these issues .
5.1 Standardization Efforts
At the time of writing ( November , 1992 ) , a Technical Committee X3J14 ( of which authors Rather and Colburn are members ) is nearing completion of an ANS Forth .
Among the 20 voting members in the TC are vendors ( FORTH , Inc. , Creative Solutions , Sun Microsystems and a division of NCR ) , some large user organizations ( Ford Motor Co. , NASA ) , and a number of smaller user organizations , consultants and experts .
Starting in 1987 , this group has addressed a number of problems with FORTH - 79 and FORTH - 83 , as well as some contemporary issues .
A few of the issues addressed in the draft standard follow , as they represent current areas of lively debate and technical activity among Forth users and implementors .
ANS Forth attempts to reconcile some of the divisions caused by the incompatibilities between FORTH - 79 and FORTH - 83 .
For example , it retains 0= to perform the FORTH - 79 NOT function , introduces INVERT to perform the FORTH - 83 NOT , and removes the word NOT .
This enables application writers who depend on either version to leave their programs unchanged , and achieve compatibility by adding a simple shell in which NOT is defined as a synonym for the preferred behavior .
The proposed standard also removes virtually all restrictions on implementation options , provides for independence from CPU word size , and offers a number of optional extension word - sets for functions such as host OS file compatibility , dynamic memory allocation and floating point arithmetic .
Some significant issues addressed by ANS Forth follow .
5.1.1 Cell size
FORTH -79 and FORTH - 83 mandated a 16 - bit architecture , including stack width , addresses , flags and numbers .
ANS Forth specifies sizes in terms of a “ cell , ” whose width is implementation - defined but must be at least 16 bits .
Words have been added to increment addresses transportably by a cell , a character , or an integral number of cells or characters .
5.1.2 Arithmetic
Amid great controversy , FORTH - 83 mandated floored division .
Not only was this incompatible with prior usage ( which did n’t specify the algorithm for handling signed division ) , it is also at variance with hardware multiply / divide instructions on most processors .
But many people felt strongly that floored division is mathematically more appropriate , and that it was important to specify .
Recognizing that there were many implementations on both sides of this issue , the TC opted to allow either floored or truncated division .
The implementation must specify which default it uses , and must provide primitives supporting both methods .
5.1.3 Control structures
One of the unique characteristics of Forth is the degree to which its own internal tools are accessible to the application programmer .
For example , there is one lexical analyzer used by the compiler , assembler , and text interpreter ; it is also available for command and text parsing in applications .
Similarly , the tools that implement control structures such as loops and conditionals are available for making custom structure words .
In 1986 Wil Baden demonstrated [ Baden , 1986 ] that the standard Forth structure words plus a few extensions made from these underlying tools are adequate to make any structure , including solutions to problems posed in D. E. Knuth ’s paper “ Structured Programming with go to statements ” [ Knuth , 1974 ] .
Structure Description DO … LOOP
Finite loop incrementing by 1 DO … +LOOP Finite loop incrementing by BEGIN … UNTIL Indefinite loop terminating when is ' true '
BEGIN … WHILE … REPEAT
Indefinite loop terminating when is ' false ' BEGIN … AGAIN Infinite loop IF … ELSE … THEN Two - branch conditional ; performs words following IF it is ' true ' and words following ELSE if it is ' false ' .
THEN marks the point at which the paths merge .
IF … THEN
Like the two - branch conditional , but with only a ' true ' clause .
FORTH -79 and FORTH - 83 provided syntactic specifications for the common structures listed in Table 4 , as well as an “ experimental ” collection of structure primitives .
The latter were not widely adopted , however , and few implementations perform the kind of syntax checking the standards anticipated .
F83 offers a limited form of syntax checking , in that it requires the stack ( which is used at compile time for compiling structures ) to have the same size before and after compiling a definition , the theory being that a stack imbalance would indicate an incomplete structure .
Unfortunately , this technique prevents the very common practice of leaving a value on the compile - time stack which is to be compiled as a literal inside a definition .
Common practice often took advantage of knowledge about how the structure words worked at compile time to manipulate them in creative ways .
The ANS Forth Technical Committee sanctioned this by providing specifications of both the compile - time and run-time behaviors of the structure words , so that they may be combined in arbitrary order .
A set of structure primitives is provided in a “ programming tools ” wordset , and the word POSTPONE is provided to enable programmers to write new structure words that reference existing compiler directives in order to provide a portion of the desired new behavior .
5.2 Implementation Strategies
The original Forth systems developed by Moore in the 1970s compiled source from disk into an executable form in memory .
This avoided the separate compile - link - load sequences characteristic of most compiled languages , and led to a very interactive programming style in which the programmer could use the resident Forth editor to modify source and re-compile it , having it available for testing in seconds .
The internal structure of a definition was as shown in Fig. 2 , with all fields contiguous in memory .
The FIG model and its derivatives modified the details of this structure somewhat , but preserved its essential character .
Forth systems implemented according to this model built a high - level definition by compiling pointers to previously defined words into its parameter field ; the address interpreter that executed such definitions proceeded through these routines , executing the referenced definitions in turn by performing indirect jumps through the register used to keep its place .
This is generally referred to as indirect - threaded code .
The need to optimize for different conditions has led to a number of variants in this basic implementation strategy however .
Some of the most interesting are :
Direct threaded code .
In this model , the code field contains machine code instead of a pointer to machine code
This is somewhat faster , but typically costs extra bytes for some classes of words .
It is most prevalent on 32 - bit systems .
Subroutine - threaded code .
In this model , the compiler places a jump - to - subroutine instruction with the destination address in - line .
This technique costs extra bytes for each compiled reference on a 16 - bit system .
It is often slower than direct - threaded code , but it is an enabling technique to allow the progression to native code generation .
Native code generation .
Going one step beyond subroutine - threaded code , this technique generates in - line machine instructions for simple primitives such as + and jumps to other high - level routines .
The result can run much faster , at some cost in size and compiler complexity .
Native code can be more difficult to debug than threaded code .
This technique is characteristic of optimized systems for the Forth chips such as the RTX , and on 32 - bit systems where code compactness is often less critical than speed .
Optimizing compilers .
A variant of native code generation , these were invented for the Forth processors ( discussed in Section 1.5 ) that can execute several Forth primitives in a single cycle .
They looked for the patterns that could be handled in this way and automatically generated the appropriate instruction .
The range of optimization was governed by the capabilities of the processor ; for example , the polyFORTH compiler for the Novix and RTX processors had a four - element peephole window .
Token threading .
This technique compiles references to other words using a token , such as an index into a table , which is more compact than an absolute address .
Token threading was used in a version of Forth for a Panasonic hand - held computer developed in the early 1980s , for example , and is a key element in MacForth .
Segmented architectures .
The 80 ×86 family supports segmented address spaces .
Some Forths take advantage of this to enable a 16 - bit system to support programs larger than 64 K .
Similarly , implementations for Harvard - architecture processors such as the 8051 and TI TMS320 series manage separate code and data spaces .
Although the early standards assumed the classical structure , ANS Forth makes a special effort to avoid assumptions about implementation techniques , resulting in prohibitions against assuming a relationship between the head and data space of a definition or accessing the body of a data structure other than by pre-defined operators .
This has generated some controversy among programmers who prefer the freedom to make such assumptions over the optimizations that are possible with alternative implementation strategies .
5.3 Object - oriented Extensions
Forth ’s support for custom data types with user - defined structure as well as compile - time and run-time behaviors has , over the years , led programmers to develop object - based systems such as Moore ’s approach to image processing described above ( Section 2.2.2 , item 2 ) .
Pountain [ 1987 ] described one approach to object - oriented programming in Forth , which has been tried by a number of implementors .
Several Forth vendors have taken other approaches to implementing object - based systems , and this is currently one of the most fertile areas of exploration in Forth .
In 1984 , Charles Duff introduced an object - oriented system written in Forth called Neon [ Duff , 1984 a , b ] .
When Duff discontinued supporting it in the late 1980s it was taken over by Bob Lowenstein , of the University of Chicago ’s Yerkes Observatory , where it is available as a public - domain system under the name Yerk .
More recently , Michael Hore re-implemented Neon using a subroutine - threaded code ; the result is available ( also in the public domain ) under the name MOPS .
Both Yerk and MOPS are available as down - loadable files on a number of Forth - oriented electronic bulletin boards listed at the end of this paper .
6. A Posteriori Evaluation
The early development of FORTH was in many ways quite different from that of most other programming languages .
Whereas they generally emerged full featured with unambiguous formal specifications for language syntax and semantics , Forth enjoyed a lengthy , dynamic adolescence , in which each fundamental presupposition of the language was tested on the anvil of actual applications experience .
During this period , Moore , unencumbered by a large following of users , often made revolutionary changes to the language on a daily basis to suit his current view of what the language should be .
He had complete control and responsibility for the machine at hand , from the first bootstrap loader to the completed application .
The language converged toward the actual needs of one man solving a broad class of technically challenging problems in resource - constrained environments .
The resulting method of problem solving , expressed by the resulting de facto language specification , has proven useful to others .
Given the complete flexibility to add syntax checking , data typing , and other more formal structures often considered essential to programming languages , most of the several hundred people who have independently implemented versions of Forth for their own use have not done so .
The results of their efforts , as surveyed by the ANS Forth Technical Committee , represent a startlingly democratic ratification of Moore ’s personal vision .
6.1 Meeting Objectives
without a formal language design specification citing clearly defined objectives , we can only evaluate the stated objectives of the inventor of the language and those who have used it .
Personal productivity and intellectual portability were Moore ’s primary stated objectives .
Forth has been ported across the vast majority of programmable computers and has been embodied in several different dedicated Forth computer architectures .
In 1979 , Chuck Moore looked back on ten years ’ experience with Forth and observed [ Moore , 1979 ] :
My original goal was to write more than 40 programs in my life .
I think I have increased my throughput by a factor of 10 .
I do n’t think that throughput is program - language limited any longer , so I have accomplished what I set out to do .
I have a tool that is very effective in my hands — it seems that it is very effective in others ’ hands as well .
I am happy and proud that this is true .
Today he sees no reason to change this assessment .
The developers of FIG Forth saw their systems spread all over the world , along with chapters of their organization , and influence Forth programmers everywhere .
Their goal of instantiating additional commercial vendors of Forth products was also achieved .
Of the many entrepreneurs who committed their careers and fortunes to Forth - based enterprises , few have become rich and famous for their efforts .
But most have had the satisfaction of seeing their own productivity increased just as Moore did , and of having seen seemingly impossible project objectives met because of the power and flexibility of the language .
They have also enjoyed prosperity in making this capability available to their clients and customers .
Given Moore ’s criteria of productivity and portability , perhaps the best measure of achieving these objectives is the very large quantity and range of application programs that have been written in Forth by a small number of programmers across a very broad variety of computers .
6.2 Major Contributions of Forth
In 1984 , Leo Brodie wrote a book on designing Forth applications called Thinking Forth [ Brodie , 1984 ] .
In it , he quoted a number of Forth programmers on their design and coding practices .
In an Epilogue , several of them commented that Forth had significantly influenced their programming style in other languages , and indeed their approaches to problem solving in general .
Here are two examples , which are typical of observations of Forth users in general :
[ The ] essence of good Forth programming is the art of factoring procedures into useful free - standing words .
The idea of the Forth word had unexpected implications for laboratory hardware design .
Instead of building a big , monolithic , all - purpose Interface , I found myself building piles of simple little boxes which worked a lot like Forth words : they had a fixed set of standard inputs and outputs , they performed just one function , they were designed to connect up to each other without much effort , and they were simple enough that you could tell what a box did just by looking at its label .
Because Forth is small , and because Forth gives its users control over their machines , Forth lets humans control their applications .
It ’s just silly to expect scientists to sit in front of a lab computer playing “ twenty questions ” with packaged software .
Forth lets a scientist instruct the computer instead of letting the computer instruct the scientist .
Forth has changed my thinking in many ways .
Sinc
It was not easy to be a SEGA Saturn fan .
Almost every success of the 16 - bit blockbuster Genesis was undone through a series of poor decisions , from marketing to treatment of third - party publishers .
The botched surprise launch .
The prohibitive pricing .
Those horrid game cases .
It was almost as if SEGA wanted to lose the generation to the then - upstart PlayStation .
And it did , crushed under Sony 's brilliant selling power that reintroduced games to a mainstream audience that had largely ignored vids since the fall of the Atari 2600 -- and the entire industry -- in 1984 .
The Nintendo 64 also outpaced the Saturn by a large margin , thanks to incredible games like Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time .
Remember when mags were stacking screenshots of the icky - looking pack - in Virtua Fighter up against the PlayStation brawler Battle Arena Toshinden ?
That 's when I first wondered if SEGA was n't in for trouble , even though VF ( and later , Virtua Fighter Remix ) played circles around the shallow Toshinden .
It 's not like SEGA did n't put out any effort .
Hardcore gamers loved titles like the Panzer Dragoon series , NiGHTS , the hard - to - find Burning Rangers , and Guardian Heroes .
Fans of SEGA 's fantastic arcade games were treated to great ports , such as Virtua Fighter 2 , Virtua Cop , and SEGA Rally .
( Daytona USA played well , but served as revelation that the Saturn was not the mightiest polygon - pusher . )
But catering to only a fraction of the core crowd willing to sit out major third - party releases just to play SEGA 's first - party offering was a losing strategy .
If you want to pinpoint the moment SEGA was doomed to be out of the hardware game , the Saturn launch is it .
But even though the system under - performed ( it did n't tank ) and some of its best games were harbored only in Japan ( ahem , Radiant Silvergun ) , it is home to some very , very cool games that still play like a million bucks , even if they only look like a hundred .
Dragon Force helped fill a pitiful void in the Saturn library : RPGs .
Localized for America by the famous ( infamous ) Working Designs , Dragon Force is a strategy - RPG extravaganza that features hundreds of sprites on - screen at the same time ( the Saturn was a very capable 2D machine ) fighting in epic battles .
At the start of the game , you select a general out of a cabal of six and then view all machinations from his perspective .
This essentially means you can play the game six times with different outcomes and story lines .
The massive map and real - time management elements boost this incredibly comprehensive strategy game into the stratosphere .
It 's a rare find now , but for fans of the genre , the search is worth the effort .
The 32 - bit generation was marked as the great passing of 2D games , but nobody told SEGA .
Astal is a brilliant , gorgeous side - scrolling adventure game that is memorable for its captivating look and methodical platforming .
As the super - strong Astal , you must pound through hundreds of crystalline enemies to rescue Leda from the evil demon Jerado .
Astal is aided by a bird companion that can interfere with enemies and bring back items .
The game came out early in the Saturn 's lifespan and was largely ignored -- no thanks to the garish box art .
But those that did take Astal home cherished this beautiful example of a fading genre .
Saturn Bomberman is easily one of the top ten multiplayer console games , thanks to its huge 10 - player fields that were loaded with laughter and mayhem .
The single - player game is a fine Bomberman specimen , but with multitaps ( the Japanese version shipped with one shaped like Bomberman 's head ) the 10 - player game steals the show .
The game features sharp visuals even when the camera is pulled back far enough to see the whole stage and it is arguable that no Bomberman game since this edition has controlled as well .
Sure , the Saturn Stunner light gun looks ridiculous in your hand -- it was bright orange and freakishly bulky .
But it is pin-point precise , making the home port of Virtua Cop an arcade fan 's dream .
This three stage game is a tad short since it is an arcade port , but with another player , Virtua Cop has incredible replay value .
The sequel , Virtua Cop II , is also fantastic on the Saturn , but the original game 's pacing and wonderful crap dialog puts it over the top .
Who did n't love shooting up all those black - suited thugs in the shipyard over and over ?
SEGA 's arcade ports on the Saturn improved over time -- something made quite obvious by the jump between launch title Daytona USA and SEGA Rally Championship .
While not even close to being a pixel - perfect port , this higher - res racer replicates the arcade game well enough to keep those quarters in your pocket .
Tearing through the muddy tracks as your navigator offers advance intel on upcoming corners ( or is he making a pass at you -- " Long medium right , baby ? " ) is immensely enjoyable , even if the game shipped with only three tracks .
Awesome music ( " Game over , yeah ! " ) just sweetens the deal .
Yes , the Dreamcast version is much better and the current - gen sequel -- which , shamefully , none of you bought -- is stunning , but this Saturn arcade port was one of the top reasons to stick by SEGA as it flailed through the 32 - bit days .
The original Panzer Dragoon that flanked the Saturn at launch was nothing short of revelation .
But this sequel improves on almost everything , offering better graphics , smoother animations , changing dragon forms , and branching routes .
The latter two features bounce Panzer 's replay value through the ceiling , especially when coupled with the new Berserk attack system that practically turn your dragon into a winged army when unleashed on a horde of incoming monsters or airships .
The art direction has little equal in videogames , as the Panzer universe is a thing of true beauty .
Panzer Dragoon Orta for the original Xbox is even more handsome , if you can believe that .
One of the best vids of the entire generation .
The recent Wii release almost took a little of the shine off NiGHTS nostalgia , but spend a little time with the original and you 'll be reminded of why this game is such a beloved cult classic .
Everything falls into place just right , from the soundtrack to the atmosphere , as you help Claire , Eliot , and the titular NiGHTS soar through dreamworlds ( and nightmare boss battles ) to collect Ideyas .
The analog controller lets you swirl and twirl through the colorful skies , performing wonderful acrobatics .
NiGHTS was n't enough to stave off the coming of Super Mario 64 ( or even Crash Bandicoot ) , but for a select group of SEGA loyalists , NiGHTS was reward enough for sticking with the Saturn .
Sporting another terrible box that worked overtime to keep players away , Treasure 's Guardian Heroes is one of the most prized Saturn games .
This beat - 'em - up is anything but a rote copy of Streets of Rage or Final Fight .
As one of five heroes , including a lumbering skeleton in magical armor , you push through thousands of enemies that walked the lands .
Combos , big hits , and experience points give this bruiser real depth .
The branching story lines keep you coming back .
And the game looks as good as it plays , featuring some astounding hard - drawn sprites and gorgeous backdrops .
This is one of those games that might be almost as fun to watch as it is to play , especially when that skeleton roars to life just as it runs through a stack of enemies with its behemoth of a sword .
The original Virtua Fighter port that shipped with the Saturn looked rough -- really rough .
SEGA tried to make up for it with Virtua Fighter Remix , but the best apology was Virtua Fighter 2 -- a game you could shove in the face of any PlayStation owner with absolute glee .
This technical fighter is a perfect arcade port , save for the slightly downgraded graphics , but even those are a knockout on the Saturn .
VF2 sports high - res graphics ( 750x575 ) that made it the sharpest game of the entire generation .
Virtua Fighter 2 was flanked by a few other brawlers , such as Fighting Vipers and the kinda - silly Fighters MegaMix , but this stands head and shoulders above all 32 - bit fighters .
All of them .
You cannot possibly be surprised by this .
Panzer Dragoon Saga was the swan song to end all swan songs , an ultra-rare twilight release for the Saturn .
The game practically sent the system off like a Viking burial .
Spanning no fewer than four CDs , Saga tells the tale of the young Edge and his mystical dragon .
Whereas games like Final Fantasy VII rely on battle - tested turn - based combat , Panzer Dragoon Saga fuses the on- rails shooting action with RPG sensibilities , making this dark , solemn game wholly unique .
It is the gem of the generation and a very rare find since so few were manufactured in America .
But if you manage to snag a copy , covet it .
It is as good as they come for hardcore gamers .
These are just the top 10 SEGA Saturn games -- making an 11 - 20 list would be pretty easy , too , thanks to great titles like Manx TT Super Bike , Street Fighter Alpha 3 , Shining Force , Baku Baku , Virtual On , Darkstalkers , Clockwork Knight 2 , Burning Rangers , and Iron Storm .

The best short answer is that a ferocious belief that people have the power to transform their own lives gave Americans an unparalleled commitment to education , hard work and economic freedom .
Between 1870 and 1950 , the average American ’s level of education rose by 0.8 years per decade .
In 1890 , the average adult had completed about 8 years of schooling .
By 1900 , the average American had 8.8 years .
By 1910 , it was 9.6 years , and by 1960 , it was nearly 14 years .
As Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz describe in their book , “ The Race Between Education and Technology , ” America ’s educational progress was amazingly steady over those decades , and the U.S. opened up a gigantic global lead .
Educational levels were rising across the industrialized world , but the U.S. had at least a 35 - year advantage on most of Europe .
In 1950 , no European country enrolled 30 percent of its older teens in full - time secondary school .
In the U.S. , 70 percent of older teens were in school .
America ’s edge boosted productivity and growth .
But the happy era ended around 1970 when America ’s educational progress slowed to a crawl .
Between 1975 and 1990 , educational attainments stagnated completely .
Since then , progress has been modest .
America ’s lead over its economic rivals has been entirely forfeited , with many nations surging ahead in school attainment .
Most service professionals share a distinguishing characteristic : they over - rate content mastery and under -rate personal connection .
Professionals are less comfortable operating in the purely personal realm than they are in data - based , content - driven interactions .
I have observed these patterns consistently throughout my career in professional services .
Nothing is more likely to cause an accountant , lawyer , actuary or consultant to break out sweating than the need to interact improvisationally one on one with a client without a clear agenda , in an area outside their zone of competence , with a potential sale on the line .
It feels , above all else , risky .
Personally risky .
If you were to infer that professionals underrate personal skills because they are uncomfortable practicing them , I would n’t dissuade you .
Here ’s more evidence .
My online Trust Quotient self - assessment quiz has over 2500 entries so far .
The quiz rates your own assessment of your credibility , reliability , intimacy , and self - orientation — the key components of the Trust Equation .
For professionals so far , the highest scores are for reliability ; the lowest are for intimacy .
In other words : an under-rated and critical skill in professional services — the ability to form deep personal relationships — is , by participants ’ own self - ratings , their area of greatest weakness .
In the seminar work I do with professionals , this is always evident .
“ Oh we could n’t say that , that would be too direct .
That might offend them .
The client would be embarrassed if I did that .
They might feel that ’s unprofessional .
I would n’t want them to think I was too emotional .
That just is n’t done .
That ’s too risky . ”
These people are professionals at mitigating risk — financial risk , professional risk , business process risk , sales risk , legal risk .
Yet when it comes to mitigating emotional risk , they are often clueless .
There is no trust without risk .
But pointing that out just makes professionals burrow even further into the hole of denial , claiming that their clients are robots who do n’t really want their professionals to appear human .
What they need is a simple , formulaic tool for dealing with the perceived risk of increasing intimacy with other human beings .
Hey , we could all use a little of that , right ?
There is precisely such a tool , and I ’m going to write about it in the next blog post .
It ’s called Name It and Claim It .
It is a simple grammatical technique .
It is a meta - tool , meaning it can be applied to whatever is causing you fear .
It is easy to remember , and pretty easy to use .
There is no trust without risk .
This tool mitigates emotional risk .
Which means you can stop shutting down trust by no longer being excessively risk - averse .
Best of all , it works .
Very well .
Stay tuned for details , next post .
A " whopper " bank is going to " go under " , Mr Rogoff said
The global financial crisis is set to get worse , with a large US bank likely to collapse in the next few months , a former IMF chief economist has warned .
Kenneth Rogoff 's comments came as shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sank on a report that the home lenders would , in effect , be nationalised .
Despite hopes that the US economy had turned the corner , Mr Rogoff claimed it was " not out of the woods " .
" I would even go further to say ' the worst is to come ' , " he said .
" We 're not just going to see mid-sized banks go under in the next few months , " said Mr Rogoff , who held the IMF role between 2001 and 2004 .
" We 're going to see a whopper , we 're going to see a big one , one of the big investment banks or big banks . "
We have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
Kenneth Rogoff Speaking at a conference in Singapore , Mr Rogoff , now an economics professor at Harvard , forecast that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would " probably " not exist in their present form in a few years .
" We have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over . "
On Monday , shares of Fannie Mae fell more than 22 % , or $ 1.76 , to close at $ 6.15 .
Shares of Freddie Mac fell almost 25 % , or $ 1.46 , to $ 4.39 .
' Wrong move ' Shares in Freddie and Fannie first fell sharply last month on fears that they would run out of money to fund their business , forcing the US government to take radical steps to ease the panic .
The two firms are the backbone of the US mortgage market as almost all US lenders rely on them to buy their mortgages in order to access the funds to lend to consumers .
As mortgage guarantors , they must pay out when homeowners default on their loans .
With the housing market across the US crumbling , their finances have come under severe stress .
Problems in the US housing sector prompted the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to 2 % earlier this year .
But Mr Rogoff said the Fed was wrong to cut interest rates as " dramatically " as it did .
" Cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the United States , " he added .

UNITED NATIONS | Everyone complains about climate change , and the United Nations is finally doing something about it – on Friday , the temperature inside U.N. headquarters in New York will rise by 5 degrees .
Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations ’ self - professed environmental secretary - general , ordered the “ In - House Climate Change Initiative ” to save energy , cut carbon emissions and try to mitigate climate change .
Officials said the monthlong experiment – dubbed “ Cool U.N. ” – also will allow engineers to test energy consumption and utility costs in the notoriously antiquated building .
It also will stretch the comfort and good will of about 4,500 staffers , who work in the glass - walled Secretariat , a veritable 39 - story terrarium planted in full sun on the East River .

Dawn was just breaking over the Black Forest when Helga Schneider climbed out of bed , tugged on her overalls and thick brown galoshes , and trudged out to the cow pen .
She herded a dozen head into a tiled alcove strewn with straw and manure , and began fixing rubber hoses to swollen udders .
Within minutes , milk was snaking through a maze of tubes to a copper - plated box the size of a cinder block , where the warmth was siphoned off and stored for heating everything from the Schneider ’s bath water to their home .
Many residents of this farming village have also found creative ways to harvest energy , be it turning manure into biofuel or installing turbines in the local creek .
Thanks to their ingenuity , Freiamt is not only energy independent , but produces 17 percent more power than it uses .
It ’s a feat that defies conventional ideas about energy – that big companies are key to a secure supply , that renewable sources can only meet a fraction of society ’s needs , that green energy is the domain of liberals and idealists .
“ We ’re talking about a village of traditional farmers , and yet they ’re changing ideas about what is possible , ” says Josef Pesch , CEO of FESA , a firm that develops community renewable - energy projects .
“ When it comes to renewables , Freiamt is a model for communities far and wide . ”
Last year , the village generated 14.3 million kilowatt hours of electricity , or 2.1 million more than it used .
That ’s enough to power 600 additional German homes .
For locals , who make their living mainly from tourism and agriculture , the turn toward green energy was less about big ideals than finding new income streams that would n’t harm the soil and forests .
“ We ’re no eco-rebels , ” says Mayor Hannelore Reinbold - Mench .
“ We ’re simply a community making a living off the land and all it has to offer . ”
The idea first came in the late 1990s , when a group of investors from Hamburg started approaching farmers in Freiamt about leasing land for a wind farm .
Locals were n’t keen on outsiders harvesting their natural bounty .
But a small group led by Ernst Leimer , who now heads the town ’s wind energy association , began planting wind - measuring masts at promising sites .
They also started holding town hall meetings in the hopes of rallying locals to build the project themselves .
When word of the plan began filtering through the community , some residents protested , saying the windmills would blemish the landscape and hurt tourism .
But as data from the masts rolled in , people began to grasp the financial potential , and support for the project grew .
Eventually , as many as 1,000 of Freiamt ’s 4,300 residents were showing up for information sessions .
When the group began soliciting funds in mid-2001 , it took only eight weeks to round up the $ 2.3 million down payment on two 400 - foot - tall windmills .
All of the money came from local investors .
“ Lots of people know they can do something for the environment , but they don’t , ” says Mr. Leimer .
“ Our community took action .
We did something for the environment and something for the next generation .
At the same time , we did something for ourselves . ”
The turbines were finally built in fall 2001 .
The next year , they churned out enough electricity to power about 1,600 German homes .
Within two years , investors were getting a 10 percent annual return – thanks to Germany ’s feed - in tariff law , which requires electricity - grid operators to buy renewable energy at a premium rate .
The idea is to foster small - scale production of green energy .
By 2003 , Leimer ’s group was laying plans for a third wind turbine and eight photovoltaic solar - power generators .
But when they started hunting for roof space to lease for solar panels , something curious happened .
“ People said , ‘ It ’s my roof .
Why should I lease it to someone else rather than build my own solar - power system ? ’ ” recalls Ms. Reinbold - Mench .
Before long , solar panels began cropping up on crumbling barns and old farmhouses all over town .
Some residents also started venturing into other technologies .
Today , Freiamt has four windmills , around 250 rooftop solar systems generating heat and electricity , and a handful of biogas digesters , which turn animal dung and other organic waste into fuel .
Several residents have also ripped out ancient water wheels and installed modern hydro generators .
The Mellert bakery and gristmill , with its four stories of whirring machines and baking ovens , is powered by a water turbine .
So is the rustic saw mill owned by Gottlieb Reinbold , a white - haired former pig farmer in patched overalls .
During peak season , the turbine produces enough electricity to power both the mill and his home .
It also feeds enough power into the grid to earn him $ 880 a month , about half his total income .
“ It ’s not a lot of money , ” he says .
“ But it helps to keep me afloat . ”
Others villagers harvest energy from a mix of sources .
The Schneider family supplements the heat they generate from cow milk with a zero-emission wood - chip boiler they installed between the racks of dusty mason jars in their basement .
It ’s fueled by leftover scraps from wood they harvest in a backyard patch of forest .
The family has also sunk more than $ 15,000 into the community windmill project and installed a billboard - size array of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof over the scalloped wood balconies of their farmhouse .
The investment has paid off .
The panels alone produce about 30,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year – 50 percent more energy than the Schneiders use .
By feeding this into the grid , they earn roughly $ 24,000 annually .
The money helps fill the gap left by low wholesale milk prices and allows them to save for retirement .
“ We have to look toward the future , ” says Mrs. Schneider .
“ My mother spent her whole life working the land , and she ca n’t live off her pension . ”
The surge of renewable energy has also been a boon to Freiamt ’s growing tourism industry .
Many of the 42,000 - plus visitors to the town each year are ecotourists , some from as far away as India and South Korea .
Even some residents who initially opposed the project , are now leading hiking tours to the turbines – just one sign of the changes that have swept the village .
“ People used to laugh at us , ” says Reinbold - Mench “ They thought of us as simple country folk .
Now they ’re coming from all over just to see what we ’re doing , and that ’s a huge source of pride for little Freiamt . ”
This figure shows the total world oil demand and supply ( left scale ) and the oil price ( right scale ) from 2004 to the first quarter of 2008 .
Data from : International Energy Agency and US Energy Information Administration ( http://www.eia.doe.gov/ emeu/international / oilother.html ) .
Image credit : D. Sornette , et al .
Since 2003 , worldwide oil prices have quadrupled .
According to a new study , the price of oil is rising at a faster - than - exponential rate , and can not be sustained .
In other words , we ’re in the midst of an oil bubble , say researchers Didier Sornette and Ryan Woodard of ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Wei-Xing Zhou of the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai , China .
By analyzing oil prices over the past four years , the researchers have demonstrated more support for the hypothesis that the recent oil price run-up has less to do with supply - demand interplay and more to do with speculation .
In their analysis , the team gathered data on oil prices since 2005 in US dollars , euros , and other major currencies ( to confirm that the results are not a consequence of the weakening of the US dollar ) .
They also examined worldwide oil supply and demand data , specifically investigating the extent of increased demand from emerging markets such as China and India .
Then , the researchers analyzed this data using a method that Sornette ’s group started to develop in 1996 that identifies bubbles as “ transient superexponential regimes ” – basically , areas of rapid growth that occur due to a source of positive feedback within the system .
The scientists looked at the data in the context of three different models , and all three models revealed the existence of a “ log- periodic power law , ” in mathematical terms – in other words , a bubble .
In economic terms , the researchers explain , a bubble refers to a situation in which expectations of future price increases cause prices to temporarily rise without justification from fundamental valuation .
Further , the models showed that the bubble is close to a local peak , and we may have even reached the peak already .
On the other hand , the researchers noted , this critical peak may also be embedded in a larger - scale bubble , one that could develop in the coming months and years .
“ The most fundamental difficulties [ in trying to describe oil prices ] lie in the operational definition of a ‘ bubble , ’ ” Sornette told PhysOrg.com .
“ There is no consensus .
One standard definition is ‘ exponential growth of price . ’
But exponential growth of price is normal in economics , because it just corresponds to a constant growth rate .
Our definition is ‘ faster - than - exponential ' growth of the price , which is necessarily unsustainable . ”
The team also identified several particular characteristics of oil price dynamics that may help researchers understand the causes of the bubble .
First , in the years 2004 and 2005 , worldwide supply , demand , and price all increased together .
In early 2006 , supply started to drop , followed a few months later by a drop in demand , and six months later by a drop in price .
Around this time , from mid-2006 to early 2007 , supply and demand fluctuated .
Then , supply , demand , and price rose together , and have been continuing to rise through the most recent data point , which was taken in early 2008 .
A comparison of supply and demand showed that , most recently , supply has been exceeding demand by more than a half million barrels per day .
Meanwhile , the price continues to increase .
Since it appears that the supply - demand balance has only a small effect on the price of oil , the researchers suggest that a major effect lies elsewhere .
They point out several reasons why speculation , fed on rumors of rising oil scarcity , may be the positive feedback causing high oil prices .
As one motivating factor , investors could be searching for a new high - return investment following the collapse of three recent economic bubbles in the US ( communication technology , which peaked in 2000 , real - estate in 2006 , and sub - prime mortgage lending in 2007 ) .
Also , speculation may have increased due to the deregulation of oil futures in the US in early 2006 , corresponding to the fluctuations that occurred shortly after that time .
Investors may also be concerned about a weakening US dollar , which may encourage protective hedging against future oil price increases .
“ I expect rather soon some calming with a correction of the price , ” Sornette said when asked about his prediction of future oil prices .
“ But it seems that , for the medium term , one has to be bullish on oil . ”

Yahoo Music just announced that it 's pulling the plug on its DRM server — that means that as of September 30 , everyone who bought Yahoo Music will lose the ability to recover it from backup or transfer it to a new PC .
Like I said when MSN Music proposed to do the same thing : " All those years the music industry spent insisting that the only way they 'd sell music is with crippling DRM attached managed to totally discredit the idea of buying music at all . "
Once the Yahoo store goes down and the key servers go offline , existing tracks cannot be authorized to play on new computers .
Instead ,
Yahoo recommends the old , lame , and lossy workaround of burning the files to CD , then reripping them onto the computer .
Sure , you 'll lose a bunch of blank CDs , sound quality , and all the metadata , but that 's a small price to pay for the privilege of being able to listen to that music you lawfully acquired .
Good thing you did n't download it illegally or just buy it on CD !
No , you were one of the digital pioneers , and in this brave new frontier world , a few people are just going to get malaria .
Fact of life .
And someone will step in a bear trap , and then it 's time for the bite rag , the alcohol , and the saw .
Just the price of progress .
And yes , some poor group will get trapped in snowfall when crossing the pass , and cannibalism may or may not be involved by the time they stumble barefoot from the mountains next spring .
No one can prevent such tragedies .

A controversial breast cancer treatment consisting of a combination of high - dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant does not extend the lives of patients , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Texas ' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium .
" This report should absolutely , definitively and for all time close the door on this treatment , " said Dr. Larry Norton of the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
During the 1980s and 1990s , it became popular to treat women with a high dose of chemotherapy after surgery , in order to kill off any cancer cells that had not been removed by the initial procedure .
Before surgery , surgeons would extract stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow .
After the chemotherapy , these cells would be transplanted back into the body in order to restore the immune cells that had been killed by chemotherapy .
The procedure was controversial from the start , in part due to the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs .
Such drugs are particularly dangerous at high doses , and some women subjected to the treatment in the United States have died from toxicity .
Even in those who survive , such a high dose of chemotherapy drugs is incredibly hard on the body and leads to a high degree of suffering .
Finally , many health insurers were initially unwilling to pay for what they considered an experimental and non-proven treatment .
Researchers analyzed the results of 15 separate trials involving a total of 6,200 early stage breast cancer patients .
The lymph nodes of all the patients tested positive for cancer following surgery , but in no cases had the cancer spread to other organs .
The researchers found that women who underwent the high - dose chemotherapy did not relapse as quickly as women who underwent more conventional treatments , but they did not live any longer .
" I was surprised by the results , " said lead researcher Donald Berry .
" I was expecting some subsets of women to show some survival benefit . "
Tamar Snyder had an interesting article posted on the MSN site about a first year teacher , Dan Brown , who began teaching fourth grade at a Public School in the Bronx .
He quickly realized he was one of the few male teachers at the school .
The gender discrepancy worked to his advantage , he said .
" As a rookie , I was given my own classroom , in part because there were n't any male teachers for that grade . "
But his role came with an added responsibility not many female teachers face .
" Only two kids out of the 26 had parents who were married , " he said .
" Most of these kids had no father figure at home .
To come to school and have that male authority figure who was treating them respectfully made a huge difference . "
Brown recently published " The Great Expectations School : A Rookie Year in the New Blackboard Jungle " ( Arcade Publishing , 2007 ) , in which he recounts what he terms a " brutal " year as a Teaching Fellow .
He 's currently teaching at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and studying for a master 's degree at Columbia University 's Teachers College .
The press made a big deal about a presidential endorsement given by an NBA basketball player who has yet to play a day as a Pro .
I 'd be curious to know Dan 's opinion of the educational policies of the current candidates .
He 's actually " played " the game , and written a book about it !

The Department of Justice 's Antitrust Division has two words for all the network neutrality backers who believe that a bit of government regulation could go a long way towards keeping the Internet open : trust us .
In comments just filed with the Federal Communications Commission , the top lawyers from the Antitrust Division called preemptive network neutrality regulations a bad idea , instead arguing for a free market system in which the DoJ would step in to correct any antitrust violations after they occur .
The filing is the DoJ 's response to the FCC 's continuing inquiry into " broadband industry practices . "
The FCC is trying to determine if some kind of network neutrality regulations might be necessary , and if so , what form they should take .
The DoJ has no doubts , saying , " The FCC should be highly skeptical of calls to substitute special economic regulation of the Internet for free and open competition enforced by the antitrust laws . "
The arguments in the paper are surprisingly lacking in depth , though one assumes that the Antitrust Division has a least some expertise in this area after examining several major telecom mergers over the last few years .
Much of the filing is taken up with pointing out the incredible awesomeness of the free market , which makes possible " the kinds and quality of goods and services that consumers desire . ”
( How 's that working out , xMac true believers ? )
The basic arguments that relate directly to net neutrality are twofold .
One , the DoJ points out that there have so far been few real violations of the neutrality principle in the US .
When egregious examples have come to light ( rural telco Madison River was smacked down by the FCC when it began blocking VoIP calls ) , they have been handled quickly .
Rather than lay down a " prophylactic " system of regulations , the DoJ believes it would be better to leave the market unregulated and deal with problems as they come up .
The second major argument is that network operators need to massively expand their capacity and consumers will be stuck paying the bill if network neutrality is enacted .
" Several studies have noted , " says the DoJ , " that prohibiting broadband providers from charging content providers directly would lead consumers shouldering a disproportionate share of the costs necessary to upgrade network infrastructure . "
Left unexplained is exactly how a network infrastructure has been paid for over the last 15 years as Internet traffic as exploded .
Here 's a hint : it has n't been done by forcing every website to pay every major network operator if said website wants to reach customers a little faster .
It also has n't been done by sticking consumers with the bill in its entirety , as the DoJ filing appears to indicate .
Content providers do pay for access to the network ; they pay vast sums of cash for bandwidth , in fact , and that money filters out to the ISPs that carry their traffic through peering and carriage arrangements .
The US Post Office example also rears its ugly head .
" No one challenges the benefits to society of these differentiated products ; nor does anyone seriously propose that the United States Postal Service be banned from charging different fees for next - day delivery van for bulk mailers , " says the DoJ .
It 's not quite clear how this is supposed to apply to the network neutrality debate .
No one is seriously proposing that ISPs not be able to sell different speed and bandwidth tiers , either ( ISPs already do this , of course , without complaint from anyone ) .
The report does makes a solid point about the “ ambiguity of what conduct needs to be prohibited . "
With many different definitions of network neutrality , debaters sometimes sound like they 're talking right past one another .
The filing has already attracted scrutiny from groups like Public Knowledge , which attacked the DoJ in a statement today .
" The filing is filled with mischaracterizations of what Net Neutrality will preserve for consumers , " said Gigi Sohn , president of the group .
" Most blatantly , the DoJ failed to recognize that Net Neutrality is a protection for consumers and for Internet companies against discrimination by telephone and cable companies .
Net Neutrality would not restrict the types of services that telephone and cable companies could offer ; such a policy would make certain that those companies had to do so in a nondiscriminatory fashion as the law originally intended . "
Companies and consumers both currently pay to access the Internet ; the money comes from both ends of the connection .
And both groups are paying for complete access to the " cloud . "
If network operators attempt to go after extra revenues from web operators , it would create a huge group of people " inside the cloud " that want to be paid .
Instead of setting up a hot new web site , paying for plenty of bandwidth , and launching your business to the public , web site operators would need to pay not only their hosting provider but also Comcast , AT&T , Verizon , and a gazillion other networks that sit between them and their potential customers .
Getting on the information superhighway thus becomes only the first stop on a very long toll road .
And , of course , let ’s not forget that the most US consumers have only two choices ( if they 're lucky ) : cable and DSL .
" Voting with your dollar " can be tricky or even impossible in many areas .
Regulation may not be called for , but the DoJ report seems rather light on solid arguments to support that claim .
Apollo astronauts were heroes .
That is very clear to me and should be to everyone ; they took an incredible risk to explore and further the knowledge of mankind .
However , that does not give them a " get out of reality free " card .
Ed Mitchell walked on the Moon for the Apollo 14 mission .
OK , got that ?
He walked on the Moon .
I have no issue with that .
However , he also believes aliens exist .
That 's fine too ; in fact , while would n't use the word " believe " , I strongly suspect there are aliens elsewhere in the Universe as well .
Where Mitchell and I part ways is that he thinks that the aliens are and have been coming here , the government knows , and has been covering it up for decades .
Thing is , his feelings on this have been pretty clear for a while now .
But he recently stated them on the radio , which has led to wide reporting on the topic , like say here .
There are a zillion other sources if you care ( roughly the same number of emails I 've gotten on this topic ) .
OK , yes , an Apollo Moonwalker thinks greys are coming here and probing us or whatever .
Fine .
He can believe what he wants .
I think he 's wrong , but he has the right to believe that .
Two points on this .
First , of course , the UFO folks will go ballistic over this , because , after all , Mitchell was an astronaut and walked on the Moon .
But then , see my " get out of reality card " comment above .
Also , this is simply argument from authority , which is bad logic .
It does n't matter who believes in aliens .
What matters is -- hello ! -- evidence .
Show me the clear pictures .
Show me nonterrestrial - isotope - laden artifacts .
Show me a frakkin ' flying saucer sitting on the White House lawn .
Show me anything other than blurry pictures and videos , eyewitness testimony , and black - out government documents .
I want evidence .
The second point is Mitchell 's history .
He has long been an advocate for what can be called at best fringe science , starting with his tests of psychic powers on that same lunar flight .
That 's fine -- in fact I support things like that , if done rigorously -- but clearly in my opinion he goes way too far .
Government coverups of actual aliens ?
Really ?
Where 's the proof of that ?
The evidence is always circumstantial , and that makes me suspicious indeed .
We have governments that cannot coverup a simple break in , a tryst in the White House , or trade deals between Iran and the contras .
Those are cakewalks compared to the massive conspiracy theorized by the UFO crowd .
My point is not to make an ad hominem attack Mitchell 's credibility ; he is a nice man and a gentleman .
I met him and he was very kind to me , and he told me he literally kicked Bart Sibrel out of his house , which makes my heart sing .
No , my point is that I do n't really see why this is suddenly news .
He 's been talking fringe science for decades .
So I want to be very clear here : I have enormous , deep , and profound respect for all the men who walked on the Moon , and all the men and women who put them there .
But that does not give them a pass to ignore evidence and to draw drastically unrealistic conclusions without evidence to support them .
JALALABAD , Afghanistan -- U.S. Army Capt .
Brian Waters was rounding a bend in the Pech River Valley last month when insurgents opened fire on his convoy .
The Americans returned fire with machine guns and grenade launchers .
In the middle of the 75 - minute firefight , with insurgent rounds slapping the dirt road , a cluster of Afghan children jumped onto the hood of Capt .
Waters 's Humvee and snatched the empty brass shells pouring out of the machine gun .
" They 're really just fearless , " Capt .
Waters , a 30 - year - old from Bonney Lake , Wash . , said of the young scrap - metal collectors .
War upends society .
It also creates an economic logic of its own , from the tens of millions of aid dollars going to Afghan road - building companies to the pennies that children earn by collecting empty shell casings cast off by foreign soldiers and selling them to scrap dealers .

Preface
The act of program creation , using common compilers and assemblers , takes software from an information - rich source code format and transforms it into a difficult - to - read machine code format .
The reverse process , trying to convert machine code into a human - readable format , is significantly more difficult and requires high - level intuition and pattern matching skills .
This book is going to discuss the disassembly and decompilation of x86 machine code and x86 assembly code .
This book is new and could use your help .
We need help with proof - reading , content authoring , editing and more .

you : Latino , 5 ' 8 , in your twenties , sports jersey , short hair , mole on your face .
You might have been following me for a while , Mr. Perv , I do n't know - I was on the phone with my mother , venting about my roommate situation ( we had to find a new one ) and my job search ( like , I need a job ) , when you snuck up behind me , and gently squeezed my ass .
Not just the top of my ass , but kinda low , kinda close to my you - know - what , if you know what I mean .
You know , even my boyfriend needs permission to get that close , so having a perfect stranger attempt access so suddenly , so completely out of the blue , triggered my fight - or - flight response .
And I * fight *.
Did it hurt when I grabbed your collar and punched you in the head ?
I 'm a little worried that I did n't get enough momentum in my swing to make you feel it , seeing as I 'm kinda short ( 5 ' 2 " ) .
But you must have felt bad when you took off running and I chased you down so easily - it's not that you 're slow , dude , it 's just that I run fast , as you might have suspected from the well - muscled form of my posterior , had you been viewing it with its athletic potential in mind .
It was all worth it when you realized you could n't outrun me and so you stopped with your back to me in shame , and I kicked you in your hole .
You might not remember , but I said : " Are you sorry ?
Are you sorry ?
Say you 're sorry ! " , and you did .
That was great .
Then I said : " run on home , you asshole !
Run home ! " and you did that , too !
Ladies , these pervs are cowards who run in fear when confronted with any kind of resistance .
They are weak and pathetic .
To the two guys who came out of their houses when they heard me yelling - thank you for being so aware and willing to help out - especially - Chris , was it ?
- who walked me home .
It 's great to know the people here care about the safety of others .
Thanks so much .
My mom was really worried , because she heard me start swearing and then the phone went dead ( I closed it so I could chase the motherf * cker down ) and she thought I had been hit by a car .
When I told her what happened , she told me not to be so agro , and pointed out that he could of had a knife or something .
True .
You 're right , mom .
But you 're unlucky if you 're from this neighborhood , Mr. Perv. Cause I 'm here ALL THE TIME ( no job , remember ? ) and next time I 'll MACE YOUR FACE .
The UK government has decided to spend hundreds of millions of pounds ( gajillions of dollars in US currency ) on a huge central silo for all of the country 's communications data .
What 'll that entail ?
Well , apparently " the one - stop - shop database will retain details of all calls , texts , emails , instant messenger conversations and websites accessed in the UK for up to two years . "
Oh my .
This Orwellian nightmare center would obviously take a while to get put together , and it's not clear exactly what it 'll consist of or how it 'll be put together .
The folks behind it have , however , figured out a way to push it through without requiring approval by parliament .
Sources said secret briefings revealed the cost of the database would run to nine figures and has already been factored into government spending plans .
The IMP budget was part of the intelligence agencies ' undisclosed allocation in the Comprehensive Spending Review last year .
In an answer to a parliamentary question on 8 July , the Home Office refused to provide any budgetary details , citing national security concerns .
A Communications Data Bill mandating the database was expected to be proposed before the summer parliamentary recess , but did not appear .
It had been planned that the database would be bundled with the EU Data Retention Directive ( EUDRD ) , which must be enshrined in UK law by March 2009 .
However , last week the government released a consultation paper on transposing the Directive as a standalone statutory instrument .
Laws made by statutory instrument do not require a vote in Parliament .

Well , I guess the silver lining here is that all this garbage going on in the UK is making the US seem like a shining beacon of freedom and privacy .

[ The Register ]
The span of time between candidate George H. W. Bush 's " read my lips , no new taxes " pledge , and his subsequent decision as president to break his pledge by supporting new taxes , was approximately two years .
John McCain has now managed to violate that same pledge in just 20 days .
Here 's the straight - talker 's recent track record : Back on July 7 , he told an audience : " Barack Obama will raise your taxes .
I won't . "
More specifically , McCain economic adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin said on June 13 that the candidate would refuse to raise the Social Security payroll tax " under any imaginable circumstance . "
More generally , McCain told Fox News on March 16 that he would try to cut taxes whenever possible , and never raise them .
Host Sean Hannity pressed him on that pledge and asked , " None ? " And McCain replied , " None . "
More specifically again , when conservative commentator Ramesh Ponnuru asked McCain in March 2007 whether there were any circumstances , during negotiations over entitlement reform , that would compel him to accept a tax increase , he replied , " No , no . "
Ponnuru pressed him : " No circumstances ? " McCain replied , " No. None . None . "
And more generally again , McCain told ABC News on Feb. 17 of this year : " No new taxes ...
In fact , I could see an argument , if our economy continues to deteriorate , for lower interest rates , lower tax rates . "
Cut to McCain 's appearance ABC this past Sunday .
During a discussion about the future of the Social Security program , McCain was asked whether he'd consider a hike in payroll taxes .
His reply : " There is nothing I would take off the table . "
When host George Stephanopoulos asked , " So that means payroll tax increases are on the table as well ? , " the candidate again said : " Nothing 's off the table .
I do n't want tax increases ... But that does n't mean that anything is off the table . "
Democrats like to link McCain to President Bush ( often , for valid reasons ) , but , in one important sense , the two men differ greatly .
Bush was a famously disciplined candidate , resolutely on message .
But McCain ?
This guy is all over the place , stepping on his own alleged convictions , and - particularly in the instance cited above - infuriating his own conservative base .
The same base that , according to all the polls , is insufficiently galvanized by his candidacy with just 99 days remaining on the election clock .
And sure enough , one of the prominent ant - tax groups , the Club for Growth , fired off a letter to McCain yesterday ( while emailing it , naturally , to the press ) , complaining that his " shocking " Sunday statement on ABC has sent " a mixed message about where you stand on this issue . "
But by now the conservatives are probably aware that McCain will often flop - flop in their direction as well .
In that same Sunday interview , he blatantly reversed himself on another issue , leaving behind a " maverick " stance that he took a decade ago and moving rightward with nary a look back at where he stood before .
First , the history : Back in 1998 , there was a ballot initiative in his state of Arizona that was designed to end affirmative action .
McCain opposed it at the time , dismissing it as " divisive . "
But apparently he was against it before he was for it , because this year a similar initiative is on the Arizona ballot , and when he was asked on ABC whether he supports it this time , he replied : " Yes , I do .
I do not believe in quotas .
But I have not seen the details of some of these proposals .
But I 've always supported quotas . "
The biggest problem with this particular flip - flop is McCain 's ill - informed explanation .
The Arizona ballot initiative is not about quotas at all ( it simply states that public institutions should not " grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color ethnicity , or national origin ... " ) , and , indeed , quotas have generally been barred by the U.S. Supreme Court as far back as 1978 .
So McCain is raising a phony issue - which is not surprising , since he admits that " I have not seen the details " of the issue he is purporting to discuss .

The Italian government has defended its decision to use soldiers to patrol cities in an effort to curb crime , rejecting criticism that it will " militarise " the streets .
" There is a strong call from citizens for better control of the streets , for improved safety , " Defence Minister Ignazio La Russa told Sky Italia television .
" My hope is that particularly in the evening , in the cities , these troops can ensure greater safety . "
The government announced on Friday that up to 2,500 soldiers , some of whom have served in Afghanistan and Kosovo , would be made available for a trial period of six months to bolster the police in difficult urban areas .
Silvio Berlusconi's new conservative government won an April election on a law - and - order ticket , and crime and public safety have stayed on top of the political agenda since Mr Berlusconi took office .
The government 's decision was attacked by the centre - left opposition , with Roberta Pinotti , defence spokesman for the Democratic party , expressing " firm opposition to the militarisation of the streets " .
Italy 's main trade unions said rather than using soldiers the government should make better use of 25,000 police who are doing desk work , and the mayor of Turin said the move was " populist demagoguery " that would hurt tourism and Italy 's image abroad .
" I have only seen soldiers on the streets in Bogota , but there the situation is rather different , " Sergio Chiamparino told La Repubblica daily .
Mr La Russa said he did not understand the criticism but specified that the use of soldiers would not be permanent , with the initial six - month period being renewable " just once . "
" Very often just seeing a [ soldier 's ] uniform can be sufficient as prevention .
I do n't see what the problem is , " he said .

Iraqi civilians who were tortured by British soldiers say the government is treating them with ' contempt ' ahead of a potential multi-million - pound payout for the abuse they suffered .
The eight Iraqis arrived in London yesterday for this week 's long - awaited mediation into how much compensation the government is willing to pay to civilians who were tortured while held in British custody .
The eight accused the Ministry of Defence last night of trying to block them from attending the high - profile meeting .
The Iraqis will meet MoD lawyers on Wednesday inside the Treasury for negotiations presided over by the former Lord Chief Justice , Lord Woolf , to determine a settlement which will include compensation for the death of Baha Musa .
The 26 - year - old receptionist had suffered 93 identifiable injuries at the hands of British soldiers in Basra in September 2003 .
He had died after being subjected to 36 hours of beatings and abusive treatment , including being double - hooded with hessian sacks in stifling conditions .
Musa 's father , Dawood , a colonel in the Iraqi police force who had struggled for weeks to get a UK entry visa , was among the group that arrived in London yesterday .
He said that the behaviour of the government in the five years since his son was killed had convinced him that the MoD viewed Iraqi lives as ' cheap ' .
Maithem al - Waz , who had been abused alongside Musa , accused the government yesterday of not helping the group to obtain UK visas to attend the high - profile hearing .
' It took so long , from May until today , to get the visa , ' Waz said .
' Although the MoD agreed to the mediation they gave no co-operation - we have struggled for two months to get our visas .
I feel that they do n't want to co-operate .
We are so disappointed by the way they have acted . '
He also voiced serious concerns over the treatment of himself and other witnesses at the 2006 court martial of seven soldiers charged with the killing of Musa .
' At the court martial they put us in military camps , it felt as if we were in detention , they treated us very badly , the military shouted at us if we were just two minutes late .
They would n't allow us to leave the camp and said they would put us in prison if we left , ' he said .
' At the court martial itself , we did n't feel free to talk ; we were n't given enough time or freedom to express what we wanted to say .
When they asked us questions at the court martial - [ they ] were so vague and unclear we did n't always understand .
If we get the same treatment at the mediation as we did at the court martial we will be very disappointed . '
Despite admitting liability over Musa 's death and the abuse of other detainees , the MoD is understood to have not accepted the psychological assessments detailing the trauma of those abused .
It is also contesting elements of the beatings and hoodings British troops inflicted .
Leigh Day , the law firm acting for the Iraqis , said the claimants were seeking ' exemplary and aggravated damages ' from the MoD .
Following the court martial , only Corporal Donald Payne , of The Queen 's Lancashire Regiment ( now renamed Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment ) , was convicted of inhumane treatment of a prisoner .
However , The Observer has learnt that Payne has now been released from prison and is living with his family in the north of England after setting up his own business .
Legal sources said he is furious with his treatment by the army and feels he was made a ' scapegoat ' .
General Sir Richard Dannatt , the chief of the general staff , recently announced a public inquiry into the death of Musa .
Dannatt said that it was still possible that some soldiers or officers might face disciplinary punishment if their conduct proved below the required standard .
After a three - year investigation into the incident the MoD admitted last April that the Iraqis were ill - treated .
An MoD spokesman said they would not comment until the mediation had been concluded , most likely on Thursday .
SSL Certificates from RapidSSLonline.com at a Cheap Price
As the Internet keeps growing at a rapid pace , more and more emphasis is being placed on the growing questions surrounding web security .
What it boils down to is : are online transactions truly safe & secure ?
The short answer is YES !
Websites with a properly installed & trusted SSL certificate are extremely secure and should be trusted with regard to online transmissions of any type of sensitive data .
The technology behind SSL encryption is stronger than ever and if you are a business owner and you have a website that collects any type of sensitive information from users , SSL certificates are the one and only way to ensure your customers are safe and secure when making a transactions online .
How Does an SSL Certificate Signify a Secure Web Experience ?
SSL is an acronym for " Secure Socket Layer " and an SSL certificate includes algorithms for encryption and decryption of data behind the scenes to protect and secure transmissions over the Internet .
From a user 's perspective , a website session with an installed SSL certificate will protect any data on that page while it is transferred between the web browser and web server (s ) .
While transferring this confidential information during the secured session , the SSL encrypts the data prior to transmission and then sends the encrypted message through the web to prevent online hackers from being able to intercept and read the information .
The receiving web server has the only key to decrypt the message .
When it is all said and done , SSL - enabled websites create trust and increase confidence in web users while executing secure online data transmissions , such as online payments .
All SSL certificates include 256 - bit encryption levels , 99.99 % web browser compatibility , and a trust seal issued by a recognized Certificate Authority ( CA ) .
These key features of SSL security all add up to create a more trusted experience within a secure environment for online users .
Types of SSL Certificates
The web security industry has a broad range of SSL solutions to choose from that can get tricky at times .
The most trusted SSL solutions are all from major Certificate Authorities and ultimately need to be chosen by the website owner based on their specific business needs .
Here is a quick rundown of SSL types you should be aware of :
Domain Validated Domain Validated ( DV ) SSL Certificates are basic options that really only include encryption and standard trust indicators .
A DV certificate is the quickest and easiest SSL solution for a small business to enable a website with SSL security , however , it lacks many features that are designed to help a business succeed on the web .
Since it only requires the domain to be validated , this is a cheap SSL certificate solution to quickly secure a site .
Learn More
Organization Validated Organization Validated ( OV ) SSL Certificates are the next level security solution for a medium - size e-commerce business .
An OV SSL certificate requires basic company validation , where website users can actually see the company 's name on the certificate when clicking on it within the browser .
Learn More
Extended Validation Extended Validation SSL or better known as EV SSL , is the strongest and the most advanced level of a digital security certificate that you can get .
An Extended Validation ( EV ) SSL certificate requires a complete and thorough validation of the company and domain before it is issued , but once issued , it activates all of the SSL trust indicators within the browsers to showcase trust on your website .
The extended validation issuance process is a more thorough process , but it has a lot more benefits and rewards to reap in the end .
This process includes verifying company information and other documents before issuance , but the payoff is that it activates the globally trusted & recognized Green Address Bar feature within the browser , the padlock and your company name and location displaying directly on the cert itself to show the world you are a legitimate company .
Once you have an EV certificate , you now boast a high - assurance certificate that has proven to instill more trust in users and increase conversions .
Buying an EV certificate is not a cost – rather an investment in the trust , security , and viability of your business .

Wildcard SSL Wildcard SSL certificates are the convenient solution for securing an unlimited number of subdomains , such as , mail.domain.com .
A Wildcard SSL Certificate saves you time and money because it can protect multiple subdomain names on single server and single IP address with one certificate .
Our Wildcard SSLs are available as both Domain and Organization validated certificates .
Learn More
Multi-Domain Multi-Domain certificates are also called SAN certificates and they are another convenient and cost - effective solution when a website - owner has multiple domains that need to be protected .
If you purchase a low priced multi-domain SSL certificate , you can secure many different fully qualified domain names with one single certificate , like : domain.com , domain.net , domain.org , yoursite.com , etc. Learn More
Let 's Shoot the Speculators !
WASHINGTON --
Tired of high gasoline prices and rising foods costs ?
Well , here 's a solution .
Let 's shoot the speculators .
A chorus of politicians , including John McCain and Barack Obama , blames these financial slimeballs for piling into commodities markets and pushing prices to artificial and unconscionable levels .
Gosh , if only it were that simple .
Speculator - bashing is another exercise in scapegoating and grandstanding .
Leading politicians either do n't understand what 's happening or do n't want to acknowledge their own complicity .
Granted , raw material prices have exploded across the board .
From 2002 to 2007 , oil rose 177 percent , corn 70 percent , copper 360 percent and aluminum 95 percent .
But that 's just the point .
Did " speculators " really cause all those increases ?
If so , why did some prices go up more than others ?
And what about steel ?
It rose 117 percent -- and has increased further in 2008 -- even though it is n't traded on commodities futures markets .
A better explanation is basic supply and demand .
Despite the U.S. slowdown , the world economy has boomed .
Since 2002 , annual growth has averaged 4.6 percent , the highest sustained rate since the 1960s , says economist Michael Mussa of the Peterson Institute .
By their nature , raw materials ( food , energy , minerals ) sustain the broader economy .
They 're not just frills .
When unexpectedly high demand strains existing production , prices rise sharply as buyers scramble for scarce supplies .
That 's what happened .
" No one foresaw that China would grow at a 10 percent annual rate for over a decade .
Commodity producers just did n't invest enough , " says analyst Joel Crane of Deutsche Bank .
In industry after industry , global buying has bumped up against production limits .
In 1999 , surplus world oil capacity totaled 5 million barrels a day ( mbd ) on global consumption of 76 mbd , reckons the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Now , the surplus is about 2 mbd -- and much of that is high - sulfur oil not prized by refiners -- on consumption of 86 mbd .
Or take non-ferrous metals , such as copper and aluminum .
" You had a long period of underinvestment in these industries , " says economist John Mothersole of Global Insight .
For some metals , the collapse of the Soviet Union threw added production -- previously destined for tanks , planes and ships -- onto world markets .
Prices plunged as surpluses grew .
But Mothersole says " the accelerating growth in India and China eliminated the overhang . "
China now accounts for up to 80 percent of the world 's annual increased use of some metals .
Commodity price increases vary , because markets vary .
Rice is n't zinc .
No surprise .
But " speculators " played little role in these price run-ups .
Who are these offensive souls ?
Well , they often do n't fit the stereotype of sleazy high rollers :
Many manage pension funds or university and foundation endowments .
Their trading might drive up prices if they were investing in stocks or real estate .
But commodity investing is different .
Investors generally do n't buy the physical goods , whether oil or corn .
Instead , they trade " futures contracts , " which are bets on future prices in , say , six months .
For every trader betting on higher prices , another is betting on lower prices .
These trades are matched .
In the stock market , all investors ( buyers and sellers ) can profit in a rising market , and all can lose in a falling market .
In futures markets , one trader 's gain is another 's loss .
Futures contracts enable commercial consumers and producers of commodities to hedge .
Airlines can lock in fuel prices by buying oil futures ; farmers can lock in selling prices for their grain by selling grain futures .
The markets work because numerous financial players -- " speculators " in it for the money -- can take the other side of hedgers ' trades .
But the frantic trading does n't directly affect the physical supplies of raw materials .
In theory , high futures prices might reduce physical supplies by inspiring hoarding .
But that 's not happening now .
Inventories are modest .
World wheat stocks , compared with consumption , are near historic lows .
Recently , the giant mining company Rio Tinto disclosed an average 85 percent price increase in iron ore for its Chinese customers .
That affirmed that physical supply and demand -- not financial shenanigans -- is setting prices :
Iron ore is n't traded on futures markets .
The crucial question is whether these price increases will continue or ease as demand abates and investments in new capacity expand supply .
Prices for some commodities ( lead , nickel ) have receded .
Could oil be next ?
Politicians promise to tighten regulation of futures markets , but futures markets are n't the main problem .
Scarcities are .
Government subsidies for corn - based ethanol have increased food prices by diverting more grain into biofuels .
A third of this year 's U.S. corn crop could go to ethanol .
Restrictions on oil drilling in the United States have reduced global production and put upward pressure on prices .
If politicians wish to point fingers of blame , they should start with themselves .

From Khalid Amayreh in the West Bank
An Israeli occupation army soldier earlier this month shot from a close range and injured a handcuffed and blindfolded Palestinian detainee , an Israeli human rights group revealed Sunday .
According to B’tselem , the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , the incident took place on 7 July , in Nil’in , a village in the central West Bank .
Palestinians and foreign peace activists hold regular and mostly non-violent protests against the confiscation by Israel of private Palestinian land for the construction of the “ Separation Wall , ” the gigantic barrier Israel is building in the area .
Vast swaths of Palestinian farms , orchards and groves have been seized by Israel under the pretext of building the wall , most of which is built deep in the West Bank far away from the so - called Green Line , the former armistice line between Israel proper and the occupied Palestinian territory .
According to a B’tselem report , Israeli occupation soldiers stopped and detained Ashraf Abu Rahma , 27 , who was then blindfolded and handcuffed for about half an hour .
B’tselem quoted eyewitnesses as saying that Abu Rahma was beaten by soldiers who then dragged him to an army Jeep .
There , a video clip showed one soldier aiming his rifle at the Abu Rahma ’s legs from a distance of about 1.5 meters and firing a rubber - coated steel bullet at him .
Numerous Palestinians have been killed or maimed by Israeli army rubber bullets which can be quite deadly especially if fired from a short distance .
Abu Rahma told B’tselem that the bullet hit him in the left toe .
He reportedly received treatment by an army medic before he was set free .
The video clips of the incident were provided by a 14 - year - old Palestinian girl from Ni’ilin who filmed the incident from her house in the village .
The identity of the girl has not been disclosed .
Israeli soldiers and settlers have lately escalated their abuse of mostly unprotected Palestinians .
In June , a number of masked Israeli settlers , carrying clubs , savagely attacked elderly Palestinian peasants and shepherds near the town of Yatta in the southern West Bank causing them grievous injuries .
Similarly , Jewish settlers earlier this month assaulted a Palestinian from the village of Sammou , also in the southern West Bank .
The settlers tied up the 35 - year - old Palestinian teacher to a power pole and brutally beat him .
Human rights organizations operating in the West Bank have documented many cases of abuse by Israeli soldiers , especially by a notorious paramilitary brigade known as the Border Police .
Abuse cases included soldiers forcing Palestinian laborers to drink soldiers ’ urines , forcing Palestinians to curse their religion , and forcing them to sing songs praising Israel and the Border policeman .
A few weeks ago , the Israeli television channel - 10 revealed that Israeli soldiers manning a roadblock in the northern West Bank coerced a Palestinian worker to chant in Arabic the following refrain “ Wahad Hummas , wahad fool , Allah Iyhayee Mishmar Gvul ” ( one dish of Hummus , one dish of beans , Allah salutes the Border Police . ”
Normally , such abusive behavior on the part of Israeli soldiers goes unpunished which human rights groups contend only serves to encourage further abuse .
Mr Harvey added : " There was no tidal wave and we live about half a mile from the sea quite a bit above sea level at the top of Portland so it must have been dumped there . "
Over and over we read , or view TV , scenes of police beating citizens unmercifully - using tasers on them - breaking in the wrong apartment , with innocent citizens ending up dead etc .

This young boy is in Intensive Care - Missouri - he did n't respond fast enough after a FALL - due to a broken back - so police shot him with a taser 19 times .
IMAGINE that this boy was the nephew of President Bush - or the the son of the Missouri Governor - what do you think would be done with this rogue police ?
Once upon a time a police officer could be trusted to HELP you / now you have to FEAR for your life !!
This could be your son .
It was recently announced that a man in Louisiana was tasered 9 times by polilce - and DIED .
At 247lbs he could n't get up fast enough !
The taser was invented in a garage by two guys - the only TESTING done was on a PIG .
This weapon is very dangerous - in that it shocks the body with some 50,000 volts .
A person on certain medications - medical conditions - a heart condition etc , can DIE for a damn misdemeanor .
The Arizona Republic , is the one newspaper that has tracked these DEATHS - which are numerous -- and mostly POOR - mentally ill - or BLACK .
Here you have a young boy - who is badly injured having fallen some 30 ft / he was incoherent / could not respond to commands to get up etc , because he had a BROKEN BACK .
This just makes me ill .
I have worked in an institution , with extremely agitated - out of control residents .
We were trained in crisis control -- nobody gotten beaten up / we did n't have taser guns .
I also worked for years in a soup kitchen - homeless shelter - on the streets as the director of a homeless program .
In these situations we dealt with persons high on crack - having a psychotic break - drunk - violent etc .
One man had a machete for goodness sakes .
NOT once did the police in this CT - city beat anybody senseless - kick them - beat them senseless , with their night sticks , or TASER them .
No person EVER DIED ---THIS BARBARISM HAS GOT TO STOP .
Article of this young boy BELOW -- I will research Missouri newspapers - this police dept and send out contacts tomorrow - people have got to start speaking out on these killings .

Note - Taser deaths are PUBLIC EXECUTIONS ... is that the real message of tasers ?
There have been over 300 police exections of innocent civilians with tasers to date .

“ This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a neighbor , occupy a capital , overthrow a government , and get away with it . ”
– Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Aug. 14 , 2008
Condi Rice seems to think the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Georgia are quite comparable , except that this time the invaders are “ not going to get away with it . ”
But much has happened in the world since 1968 , and Rice , the quintessential intellectual lightweight , has failed to recognize another important way in which the invasions differ :
The Soviet Union , not Russia , invaded Czechoslovakia .
Back in 1968 the USSR was an ideologically driven empire convinced that its system of government and social organization , communism , was fated to defeat capitalism and rule the planet .
The Russia that emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union and the fall of communism is a nation geographically , militarily , and economically much smaller and weaker than the USSR .
While Russia has adopted the more traditional and pragmatic international strategy of trying to ensure neighboring states are either weak or friendly and has given up trying to convert the world to communism , the United States has now become a slave to ideology .
The U.S. seeks to spread and sustain democracy around the globe , by force if necessary , and has military bases in many nations to facilitate this goal .
Ironically enough , while using violence to effect radical social and political change may be new to U.S. foreign policy , it was an idea warmly embraced by Leon Trotsky , one of the creators of the Soviet state , back in 1917 .
It would not be far wrong to date the birth of the U.S. ’ new democracy policy to 2003 .
By late 2003 the Bush administration ’s rationale for the invasion of Iraq , that Saddam Hussein had extensive biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons programs and an active relationship with al - Qaeda , had proven to be entirely bogus .
But with Baghdad captured and the Iraqi government overthrown  the very actions Rice now tells us Russia ought not “ to get away with ” in Georgia  the Bush administration could hardly announce , “ Oh , sorry , it was a mistake to invade Iraq . ”
So the aggressive promotion of democracy became the new keystone of American foreign policy , vigorously advocated by the same pundits and talking heads who helped convince the U.S. that attacking Iraq would be a “ cakewalk . ”
How well has the new policy served the United States ?
It certainly has provided retroactive justification for the invasion of Iraq , but actually turning Iraqis into good little Democrats and Republicans has taken longer and has been rather more expensive than anticipated .
Using the democracy stick to bash countries like Syria and Iran has suited the administration well , although it might be said that Iran has a proto - democratic system , unlike traditional U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt , which have been somewhat discomforted by the administration ’s emphasis on the value of democracy .
Elsewhere in the Middle East , the U.S. has rejected the outcome of elections when the results ran counter to other important policy considerations , such as unswerving devotion to Israeli goals in the West Bank and Lebanon .
In the Balkans , the U.S. readily accepted the results of a plebiscite in the Serbian province of Kosovo in which the population voted nine to one for independence .
With American support , Kosovo became a sovereign state in February 2008 .
At the same time , the U.S. seemed to say that some separatist movements are more equal than others .
American support for the will of the people as registered on ballots did not extend to the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions , which had largely been beyond the control of the Georgian government since the fall of the Soviet Union .
Both regions had voted overwhelmingly for separation from Georgia and had welcomed Russia troops as protectors from the Georgian military .
Thus when Kosovo achieved statehood , the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi felt compelled to issue a press release to mollify its Georgian friends : “ The United States has long held that each separatist conflict anywhere in the world is unique .
Indeed , the situation in Kosovo is a special case and does not serve as a precedent for other regions , including the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia . ”
One might conclude that supporting the will of the people made sense to the Bush administration in the Balkans , but not in the Caucasus .
A cynic might suggest that the U.S. government supported statehood for Kosovo because Serbia is an ally of Russia and opposed it for South Ossetia because the president of Georgia , Mikheil Saakashvili , cast himself as America ’s friend and Russia ’s enemy .
Those who would automatically embrace any elected leader ought to beware .
An election does not guarantee that a country ’s leadership will act wisely or honestly .
After learning this hard lesson from the Bush administration ’s disastrous choice to invade Iraq and other policy failures at home and abroad , it is remarkable that no American politician of national standing has been willing to take a hard look at the situation in Georgia and publicly acknowledge that Saakashvili ’s decision to attack Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia is an error so egregious as to be almost without precedent in political and military history .
Custer ’s decision to attack 5,000 Sioux warriors at Little Big Horn leaps to mind , but Custer was only risking his life and his command , not a whole country .
What convinced Saakashvili that attacking South Ossetia made sense ?
That the United States had just completed joint maneuvers with the Georgian army and was paying 40 percent of Georgia ’s military budget ?
That Georgia had strong links to Israel , which had contractors in the country training Georgia ’s ground forces and upgrading its air force ?
That George Bush had come to Tbilisi in May of 2005 and said , “ And as you build a free and democratic Georgia , the American people will stand with you the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia must be respected by all nations ” ?
That Georgia had Sen. John McCain ’s principal foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann on its payroll ?
Before any American president goes abroad and promises grandly that “ the American people will stand with you , ” he ought to consider what military and political consequences might proceed from his pledge .
He ought to ask himself whether he is implicitly committing the United States to come to the aid of a nutjob like Saakashvili , whose attack on Russian forces will undoubtedly establish itself as the new gold standard of recklessness .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. government 's stimulus payments gave a lift to the May sales of discount retailers such as Wal - Mart and Costco , but it left other retailers like Gap and Stein Mart in the cold .
" The discount stores are taking share from the department stores , so clearly consumers are looking for value more than ever , " said Mark Miller , retail analyst for William Blair & Co .
Consumers are also looking for necessities , rather than trendy clothes or anything else that might be perceived as a luxury , said Ken Brown , retail analyst for Research Connect .
" If you felt like things were tight and you had an extra 600 bucks , what would you spend it on ? " he said Brown , referring to the rebate checks distributed by the U.S. government .
" You would spend it on things you need . "
Fed stimulus boosts discount giants
Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) reported on Thursday a 3.9 % same - store - sales gain for May , excluding the impact of fuel sales .
That was more than double the 1.6 % gain expected by Thomson Reuters analysts , and it 's more than triple last year 's gain of 1.1 % for the month .
Same - store sales are recorded from stores open at least a year .
Including gasoline , which soared in price over the past month , May same - store sales rose 4.4 % .
" We 're seeing some benefits from the stimulus checks , " Wal - Mart Chief Executive Eduardo Castro - Wright said in a press release .
The stimulus , he said , combined with other factors including " price leadership , " contributed to the sales increase .
" Customers continue to rely on Wal - Mart to stretch their dollars , " said Castro - Wright .
He reported that grocery sales were strong , as well as sales for flatscreen TVs , computers and digital electronics .
Wal - Mart Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a teleconference that $ 350 million worth of stimulus checks were cashed at Wal - Mart stores during the month of May , but it was unclear what that money was spent on .
Consumers also flocked to Costco Wholesale ( COST , Fortune 500 ) , a leading warehouse club that reported a 5 % jump in same - store sales excluding gasoline .
With fuel , same - store sales rose 9 % , trumping the 6.9 % rise projected by Thomson Reuters .
Another wholesale club , BJ's Wholesale ( BJ , Fortune 500 ) , reported a same - store sales gain of 13.4 % , one of the best results in the industry .
Thomson Reuters had expected a gain of 8.9 % ,
Under the stimulus program , passed by Congress with bipartisan support , 130 million Americans will get rebates this year .
Most single Americans paying taxes on earnings of $ 75,000 or less are eligible for up to $ 600 , while married couples making $ 150,000 or less could get up to $ 1,200 .
Miller said he expects to see a " more pronounced " impact from stimulus checks in June and July sales .
Largest clothing stores get left behind
But not all retailers enjoyed rising sales in May .
Wal - Mart 's top rival , Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) , reported a decline in same - store sales of 0.7 % on weak sales of apparel and seasonal merchandise ..
That was worse than the 0.2 % decrease projected by Thomson Reuters analysts .
" These are bigger categories for Target than for Wal - Mart , " said Miller .
Wal - Mart , said sales in seasonal merchandise were soft in May .
The largest clothing retailers were hard - hit during the month of May.
Gap Inc. ( GAP , Fortune 500 ) came in dead last among 27 retailers analyzed by Thomson Reuters .
The apparel giant reported a 14 % plunge in same store sales for May , which was lower than the 9.5 % drop projected by Thomson Reuters .
Among the retailer 's various franchises , sales at its Old Navy chain dropped 25 % .
Department store operator Stein Mart ( SMRT ) was the second - worst performer , with a 12.4 % decline in same - store sales for May , which is more than the 9.5 % decline projected by Thomson Reuters analysts .
Limited Brands ( LTD , Fortune 500 ) , which operates Victoria 's Secret , Bath & Body Works and other stores , reported a 6 % decline in same - store sales .
J.C. Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) reported a 4.4 % decrease in same - store sales for May , but managed to beat expectations from Thomson Reuters analysts , who had expected a decline of 5.8 % .
Not all clothing sellers did badly .
The Buckle ( BKE ) and Children 's Place ( PLCE ) , trumped analyst expectations by wide margins .
The Buckle , a trendy store for teenagers and young adults , reported a same - store sales gain of 34.7 % , compared to Thomson Reuters expectations of 13 % .
Kids ' apparel retailer Children 's Place reported a 10 % gain , compared with projections of 4.3 % .
In Thomson Reuters ' analysis of 27 retailers , 13 beat estimates from analysts and seven missed , while others either met expectations or were not applicable .
Brown of Research Connect said that consumers are nervous about weakness in the economy and will continue to spend their money on necessities , when they spend it at all .
" I think you 're going to see a move towards necessities , a move towards people making the decision about what they actually have to buy , about what they actually have to have , because of the mood in the country , " he said .
There 's no question that housing prices have everyone 's attention at a national level .
And given the latest Case - Schiller index numbers -- which found continued price declines in almost every major national market -- it 's hard to be too bullish on the state of the housing market nationally .
But can we be bullish on the Bull City ?
There 's mixed signals in the marketplace , but at least one local Realtor found the following intriguing data last week out of the Triangle Multiple Listing Service .
How is the sales volume , at least , matching up with the conventional wisdom that it typically takes six months to sell a house in Durham ?
In Durham County as of about an hour ago , 2,260 homer were listed for sale in the Triangle Multiple Listing Service [ MLS ] .
By comparison , 394 homes were sold in Durham County during May 2008 .
2,260 divided by 394 tells us that it would take 5.7 months to sell through the current inventory .
The Durham housing market as a whole is in balance .
In the 27713 zipcode , which is south Durham very loosely based around Southpoint Mall 435 homes were listed as of yesterday , June 7 . 135 homes sold in the area during May , which means there is currently only 3.2 months of inventory available ....
[ I ]t is just one more sign that the Durham housing market is relatively stable , especially when compared to the markets constantly mentioned in the media .

Recently I needed to parse a large ASCII flat file .
The files are generally about 230 MB large with about 1.1 million records each , but there are some that are as large as 1 GB .
To do the heavy lifting I decided to use C , something I ’ve not done in a very , very long time .
Before I go on , let me share with you a little bit of history .
In my recent professional life ( say , the past seven years or so ) I have mostly been writing C# code .
At Metreos and now at Cisco the product that I build is actually constructed of components written in C# , Java , and C++ , but the majority is C# .
C# is a nice language ; it ’s very productive and has a very clean syntax , and I enjoy using it to build software .
Unfortunately , deep down inside my nerdy heart there is something missing .
You see , I started programming by writing C code and it ’s always been something I enjoyed doing .
Many moons ago , when I got my first computer and wanted to program , I convinced my Dad to buy me a C book and compiler .
Unlike many other people I did n’t start with BASIC or other “ beginner ” languages .
Instead , I went straight into the dark woods of C - land , and I had a blast .
Of course , being a first class dork , one of the first things I programmed was a terribly lame adventure game :
> n
You go north .
You 're standing in a musty , underlit room with only one exit .
The only thing you see are other nerds .
I eventually migrated to C++ , then Java , and finally C# . As I ’ve said before , I like just about every programming language as long as my limited brain can grok what ’s required to use it .
Thus , I have very , very little religion when it comes to programming languages .
Some people deride anything that is n’t their favorite .
C , C# , Java , C++ , Ruby , and Python all have their fair share of bigots .
I have better things to do with my energy than to hate other perfectly good languages .
Yes , I ’m of the “ ca n’t the nerds of the world just get along ” camp .
Of course , there is only one true editor all others are simply inferior .
Anyway , I think our progression through programming languages is interesting .
Most of the folks that I work with have progressed similarly through languages .
Many of them stopped at Java , some went to C# , and others have found nirvana with Ruby or Python .
Something that I think is amazing is how many refuse to go back .
It ’s so common these days to talk to programmers who have found their last resting spot with C# or Ruby , and when asked , simply refuse to consider using a language they ’ve already “ moved on ” from , or at the very least , would only begrudgingly do so .
As software developers , and ultimately , engineers , why do we get religion so fast when we find a solution to a specific problem .
All problems are different , and thus should be subjectively evaluated based on their attributes within a specific business context .
“ Huh ? ” , you say ?
Here ’s what I mean , please follow along :
All problems are unique across multiple facets .
A typical set of facets might be : time to solve , required performance , resources available , and solution criticality .
A collection of these attributes make up the problem and it ’s container , the business context .
The tools ( read : programming language and related tool chain ) that we choose to solve given problems should be chosen within a decision making framework constructed from the problem ’s facets .
Ultimately you , the engineer and , potentially , your team , are asked to make technical decisions based on a critical review of the problem .
Your business leaders and teammates trust you to make these value judgements in an agnostic way .
Unfortunately , more times than not , engineers choose the tools they are most comfortable with to solve the problem , without critical examination of the others available to them .
Of course , comfort , or more specifically , familiarity , is a valid criteria to consider when making tool chain decisions , but it should be weighed appropriately within the business context at hand .
For example , consider the following two scenarios where you are asked to build a parser for an ASCII flat file :
You must do it by the end of the day .
The file needs to be parsed and its records placed into a database where they will be retrieved at will .
The program will only be rarely used , and the difference between a 1 hour run time and a 10 minute run time has little impact on the business .
You must do it as fast as you can , without sacrificing quality .
The file needs to be parsed and its records placed into a database where they will be retrieved at will .
The program will be used daily , and the difference between a 1 hour run time and a 10 minute run time has a measurable business impact .
Ask yourself , what language would you use ?
Why did you pick that language ?
Did you even consider programming languages you have n’t used in recent work ?
I ’ve worked with people in the past who will immediately say Java , or Python , or SomeOtherProgrammingLanguage without any discussion as to the alternatives .
Heck , I do n’t know about you , but I have to force myself to not provide implicit weighting to my personal biases .
So , anyway , like I said , recently I needed to parse an ASCII flat file .
The files are about 230 MB large with 1.1 million records each , but there are some that are as large as 1 GB and 5 million records .
To do the heavy lifting I chose C .
This is why :
This is a hobby , so the business context was simple : learning and fun .
I wanted the program to be as fast and efficient as possible .
Ideally , it should take no longer than 15 seconds to completely parse the largest of the available files .
I may have several thousand of these files , so the different in run time between one minute and 15 seconds has a direct impact on my personal hobby productivity .
The entire data set for a single file needs to be stored in memory .
This means I need to be careful about how I read the file .
My program uses memory mapped files .
I have n’t done a benchmark to know how fast I could have parsed these files using Java or C# , but I do know that I ’m generally going as fast as I can reasonably expect to go with my current implementation .
My business context did n’t provide time for micro-benchmarking .
Had it , I might have written a few benchmarks prior to picking my language .
The examples I provided here are simplistic .
The decisions we ’re asked to make as software developers in our professional lives are inherently more complex with significantly more ambiguity .
It ’s our duty as professional programmers to make these decisions with no technology religion to ensure our value judgements satisfy the needs of the business and not simply our desire as programmers to avoid the unknown .
Andrew Gelman writes , in response to my comments in this post :
Comments on comments on " Voting as a rational decision " , by Andrew Gelman : After reading our article , " Voting as a rational decision , " Mark Thoma asked ,
If helping other people makes me happy , why would caring about other people be contrary to my own self - interest ?
This is essentially a question about the meaning of the term selfish .
I [ Mark ] assume selfishness means maximizing my utility , which may or may not include the happiness of other people as an argument .
My reply :
The challenge in all such arguments is to avoid circularity .
If selfishness means maximizing utility , and we always maximize utility ( by definition , otherwise it is n't our utility , right ? ) , then we 're always selfish .
But then that 's like , if everything in the world is the color red , would we have a word for " red " at all ?
I 'm using selfish in the more usual sense of giving instrumental benefits .
For example , if I cut in front of someone in line , I 'm being selfish .
If I do n't do it ( because I get pleasure from being a nice guy and pain from being a jerk ) , then that 's other - directed .
I 'm sacrificing something ( my own time ) in order to help others .
Just because something is enjoyable it does n't have to be selfish , I think .
To put it another way , if " selfish " means utility - maximization , which by definition is always being done ( possibly to the extent of being second - order rational by rationally deciding not to spend the time to exactly optimize our utility function ) , then everything is selfish .
Then let 's define a new term , " selfish2 , " to represent behavior that benefits ourselves instrumentally without concern for the happiness of others .
Then our point is that rationality is not the same as selfish2 .
Also , some of his commenters questioned whether a single vote could be decisive , what with recounts etc .
The answer is , yes , it can , because there is ultimately some threshold ( even if unobservable ) as to whether the recount occurs .
And even if this threshold is itself probabilistic , the probabilities can be added .
We demonstrate this mathematically in the Appendix to the 2004 Gelman , Katz , and Bafumi article in the British Journal of Political Science ; see page 674 here .
Videogames are all fun and frolics until you get personally offended by one of them , then they become catalysts of societal downfall and the corruption of a nation 's youth so must be stopped at all costs .
I used to believe that people who lobbied for the restriction or outright censorship of videogames were idiots .
I used to mock and deride those who got upset over insignificant details and silly misunderstandings in games .
From those who accused Resident Evil 5 of racism , to the fat girls who thought Fat Princess was laughing at their expense , I considered them all moronic and misguided , reactionary self parodies .
Then I got personally offended by something .
Now I know that these videogames have got to be destroyed .
Hit the jump for a list of games that have personally offended me , and as such , need to be halted because I 've decided that a conflict in taste is enough to pose a threat to society .
Half - Life
Half - Life is an iconic first person shooter by the critically acclaimed Valve Corporation .
Held up as an example of exemplary storytelling in videogames , loved for its astute use of set pieces and unrivaled pacing , it cannot be denied that Half - Life is an incredible achievement in the history of gaming .
It also cannot be denied that the game , essentially , makes light of the speech - impaired .
We prefer not to use the term " muteness , " out of respect for the sensitivity of its many sufferers .
Now , it 's true that those afflicted by speech disorders are yet to voice their concerns , but that wo n't stop me being offended for them , because that 's what we strong believers in political correctness are all about .
Main character Gordon Freeman does , himself , suffer from a DSM - IV diagnosed handicapability called " selective muteness , " something which Valve exploits throughout the Half - Life saga with little respect or care for the needs and values of real - life sufferers of this ... not disability , because that would imply that being disabled is a disadvantage ... sufferers of this gift .
Half - Life may be a fantastic series , but I 'm afraid that until the character of Gordon Freeman is removed from the games and replaced by a floating crowbar , Valve can not be allowed to continue peddling such putrid garbage .
Alien Hominid
Alien Hominid , by The Behemoth , is a shooting game in which you play a little cute alien who blasts his way through FBI men and robots after crashing his flying saucer .
I do n't expect bigoted gamers to see the problem with this one , but let me point it out for you and maybe , just maybe , you 'll open your eyes and see the bloody problem .
The game is called Alien Hominid .
Alien Hominid .
That looks a little bit like Alien Homosexual .
What is The Behemoth trying to say ?
That homosexuals are from another planet , a different species that the rest of the world must eliminate at all costs ?
I do n't want to speak on behalf of the game 's sick and twisted homophobic creators , but I think it 's very obvious that the title -- which casts you as the Alien Homosexual , but is so difficult to complete that you will always be destroyed by the white , heteronormative males -- is saying that those who enjoy same - sex relationships are destined to die .
Would that be because they all have AIDS , The Behemoth ?
Oh , OH , I am sure that would be a simply perfect world for you , would n't it ?
One day , when I 'm lucky enough to have gay friends , I am going to feel so righteous for being upset by this .
Dynasty / Samurai Warriors
Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series are part of a franchise that I used to love dearly , until the day that I decided to be personally offended by it .
The problem I have , as any decent person could see , is the underlying racist sentiment promoted by the series .
In each play session , you can expect to slaughter hundreds , if not thousands , of Chinese and Japanese people who are cunningly represented by weak peons who do nothing but walk into your sword .
The subtle and clever stripping away of enemy AI clearly portrays Asians as stupid , and perpetuates the stereotype that they are suicidal ... if such a stereotype exists , I do n't know , I 'll Google it later .
This " Digital Nanking " has to be stamped out , because if there 's one thing we cannot tolerate , it 's intolerance .
Just like Hiroshima , it takes but one button press to wipe out thousands of innocent Japanese people , a grotesque message to send to America 's youth .
That 's not even mentioning the ridiculous stereotypical Asian names these characters are given , clearly as jokes .
Names like Cao Pi and Lu Bu and Oda Nobunaga ... names so utterly stupid that nobody could take them seriously in real life , and are used only to further mock an entire race of people .
Even the game 's developers have decided to insensitively give themselves silly sounding Japanese names .
Oh I 'm sure it 's hilarious to pretend your name is Ken Matsumoto , but WE'RE NOT LAUGHING , KEN !
Too Human
Silicon Knights '
Too Human is a game that has seen a fair share of controversy over its decade - long development cycle , from SK's Denis Dyack constantly defending the title , to the company 's surprising lawsuit against Epic Games , there has been plenty to talk about .
But of course , with gamers being as ignorant as they are , nobody thought to talk about the true controversy behind Too Human , and that 's the clearly antipersonitic tone that its disgusting title promotes .
I 'm not ashamed to admit it , I am a human , as are a few of my friends , and we 're morally disgusted that a game like Too Human has been allowed to perpetuate this idea that being too human is a bad thing , or indeed that you can even BE " too " human .
Non-humans have no idea what it 's like when you wake up one day and realize that you 're a human .
Not TOO human , but a bloody human being who has just as much right to live on this world as anyone else .
The shame I endured in school when they all found out , and the pain of coming out as human to my parents ... all of this means nothing to homosapienphobics like Denis Dyack and his hatemongering lynch mob .
First it was Bishop saying " not bad for a human " in Aliens , now it 's this .
When will the persecution end ?
Cooking Mama
Do I really need to go into why this is so distressing ?
This Wii and DS cooking game is clearly a piece of despicable sexist propaganda .
That 's right , it all becomes so obvious to you now , does n't it ?
The outdated and protogenderaligning theory that you have to be FEMALE to be a mama needs to be cleared away for the sake of male mothers everywhere .
The documentary Junior portrayed the suffering of modern day pregnant men in great detail , and it really looked like we were making progress .
Time and time again , however , videogames fail to give this under - represented demographic a fair shake and fail to acknowledge its existence .
Cooking Mamas need n't be female , and frankly , I think it 's about time the games industry stopped treating men so disrespectfully .
We 've seen the way men are paraded around as airheaded sex objects in titles like Gears of War and Devil May Cry , merely two - dimensional eye candy for the predominantly female gamer audience .
You know , men play games as well -- we 're a growing market who are almost as prevalent as women now , and we demand games that are n't all estrogen - fueled guns - and - glory mingefests .
Is equality too much to ask for ?
And that 's my list of games that have personally offended me , and thus should be banned in all civilized societies so that I feel better about myself and can pretend I made a significant difference to civilization .
Remember , if you disagree with me , you 're a self - loathing bigot and I hate you , you hateful cunt .

I 'm sure some candy designer -- now there 's a job I 'd like to have -- sat down , looked at a picture of a lighthouse , and did his or her best to render it in the form of a candy mold or whatever it is they use to make gummi shapes .
The candy company spends all this money , cranks up production , and when all is said and done , creates a shape that could be interpreted as suggestive , offensive , or both .

Georgia and Russia are careening towards war .
And the U.S. is n't exactly a detached observer in the fight .
The American military has been training and equipping Georgian troops for years .
The news thus far : Georgia , which has been locked in a drone war over the separatist enclave of Abkhazia , has launched an offensive to reclaim another breakaway territory , South Ossetia .
Latest reports indicate that Georgian forces are laying siege to Tskhinvali , the South
Ossetian capital .
And Russia , which has backed the separatists , is sending in the tanks .
So why should we care ?
Oh , just the prospect of a larger regional war that could drag in Russia – and involve the United States as well .
Since early 2002 , the U.S. government has given a healthy amount of military aid to Georgia .
When I last visited South Ossetia , Georgian troops manned a checkpoint outside Tskhinvali – decked out in surplus U.S. Army uniforms and new body armor .
The first U.S. aid came under the rubric of the Georgia
Train and Equip Program ( ostensibly to counter alleged Al Qaeda influence in the Pankisi Gorge ) ; then , under the Sustainment and Stability Operations Program .
Georgia returned the favor , committing thousands of troops to the multi-national coalition in Iraq .
Last fall , the
Georgians doubled their contingent , making them the third - largest contributor to the coalition .
Not bad for a nation of 4.6 million people .
Leaving aside the question of Russian interference ( see below ) , the larger concern has been that Georgia might be tempted to use its newfound military prowess to resolve domestic conflicts by force .
As Sergei Shamba , the foreign affairs minister of Abkhazia , told me in 2006 : “ The Georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped , trained , that they have gained military experience in Iraq .
It feeds this revanchist mood …
How can South Ossetia be demilitarized , when all of Georgia is bristling with weaponry , and it ’s only an hour ’s ride by tank from Tbilisi to Tskhinvali ? ”
One of the U.S. military trainers put it to me a bit more bluntly .
“ We ’re giving them the knife , ” he said .
“ Will they use it ? ”

DALLAS ( Reuters ) - More than 200,000 children were hit as punishment in U.S. schools last year and in the South more blacks than whites are struck , two human rights groups said in a report released on Wednesday .

Texas accounted for a quarter of the instances of corporal punishment in the 2006 - 2007 school year , according to the study compiled by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union .
The report , titled “ A Violent Education : Corporal Punishment of Children in U.S. Public Schools , ” plays into a debate in America about the effectiveness of corporal punishment and its role in the classroom and home .
Twenty - one U.S. states still permit the use of corporal punishment in schools .
In Texas and Mississippi children as young as 3 are struck for transgressions as minor as gum chewing , the report says .
The punishment often involves hitting a child on the buttocks with a long wooden board , or paddle .
In 13 states in the U.S. South where corporal punishment is the most prevalent , African - American girls are twice as likely to be hit as their white counterparts , according to the 125 - page report .
“ African - American students are punished at 1.4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population , ” the groups said in a statement .
Citing U.S. Department of Education data , the report said 223,190 students nationwide received corporal punishment at least once in the 2006 - 2007 school year .
This included 49,197 students in Texas , the largest number of any state .
Minority students already face several barriers to success , said Alice Farmer , the report ’s author .
“ By exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment , schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more , ” Farmer said .
Some U.S. conservatives view moves to ban corporal punishment in school and spanking at home as “ liberal permissiveness ” which can lead to bad behavior and wider social problems such as juvenile delinquency .
Many liberal groups regard corporal punishment as a barbaric relic of an unenlightened past that harms self - esteem and promotes violence .
“ Every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it does n’t stop bad behavior , ” Farmer said .
The report documented several cases in which children were seriously injured and said students with physical and mental disabilities were subjected to disproportionate rates of physical punishment .
The report includes witness accounts including one from the mother of a 3 - year - old in Texas who was bruised after being struck at school .
“ What made me so angry : he ’s 3 years old , he was petrified .
He did n’t want to go back to school and he did n’t want to start his new school , ” the mother , referred to as Rose T , was quoted as saying .
As the markets wind down for the week , oil is dropping once again and is sitting comfortably around $ 116 .
A stronger dollar as well as further confidence regarding weakened demand were the primary catalysts .
Interestingly , the increasingly volatile military conflict between the Republic of Georgia ( a major energy transit route ) and Russia over the breakaway province of South Ossetia in Georgia did not weigh that heavily on traders today ( CNBC ) :
" In other circumstances , you might have expected it to push oil up $ 5 , " said John Kemp , economist at RBS Sempra .
" I think it 's an indication of how bearish the underlying sentiment is right now ( that it has n't ) . "
While this potential war has not significantly impacted the oil markets , it 's an important reminder that $ 200 oil could only be one Middle Eastern war away .

The best story I ’ve heard this week by far was told today over lunch .
Â Apparently , a co-worker of mine named George listens to the Rush Limbaugh show in his car , and yesterday heard him discussing Barack Obama ’s comments about similarities between the recent housing crisis and the lead - up to the Great DepressionÂ ( link goes to transcript ) .
Â Â I imagine the comments were referring to the obvious similarities between those who obtained ridiculous sub - prime loans and those in the 1920s who bought stock they could n’t afford on margin .
Â However , Limbaugh decided that Obama ’s comments were the result of a crazy “ liberal education ” – and even remarks how “ lucky ” he is that he did n’t graduate from college , thus allowing him to escape the perils of actual knowledge .
To prove his point , Rush says he did some Google searches for “ Great Depression ” and then proceeds to attack each of the results as liberalÂ propaganda .
Â Because we all know that college professors teach straight off of Google results pages .
Â
So my friend is listening and hears something rather striking … the name of one of our mutual colleagues – Paul Alexander Gusmorino ( “ The Third ! ” – I loveÂ the way Limbaugh says that ) .
Â
Limbaugh found among the top results an essay written by Paul , entitled “ The Main Causes of the Great Depression , ” Â ( link goes to essay ) .
Â Â He quotes Paul ’s essay and refutes each of its claims , dissecting them as if they were part of a Harvard professor ’s lecture on the subject .
Â
He does n’t pull any punches either .
Â “ Mr. Gusmorino , you better check Karl Marx and see if you plagiarized him in putting this piece together . ”
Ouch .
Â
Those words would be harsh if they really were for a Harvard lecturer .
Â
But that ’s not who wrote this essay .
Â
It was my friend who works as a Program Manager at Microsoft .
When he was in 10th grade .

A Londoner was stopped by a London Transport Police officer under S.44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , and had the presence of mind to whip out his video camera and record the officers tearing through his stuff .
They officers admitted that they had no suspicion of him , no reason to search him and told him he'd be arrested if he refused .
They riffle through his books ( looking for terrorist words ? ) and go through his things .

From Rave Culture to Rx : Schedule 1 Drugs ' Therapeutic Potential
The history of psychoactive drugs in the United States is a complicated one .
LSD , for instance , was originally used in a medical context in the 1950s , and shortly thereafter in secret experiments on unwitting participants by the CIA .
In the 1960s psychedelics were used recreationally and even as a form of protest : Dr. Timothy Leary of Harvard advised people to take LSD and “ tune in , turn on , [ and ] drop out ” of mainstream culture .
In 1970 , the Nixon administration instituted the Controlled Substances Act , which made psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs illegal .
And , the 1980s war on drugs cemented the idea in the cultural consciousness that drugs which the government labeled Schedule 1 had little to redeem them .
But recently , a variety of Schedule 1 drugs have been granted “ breakthrough therapy ” status by the FDA .
That designation allows drugs to be fast - tracked for development after early clinical trials suggest significant therapeutic promise ....
( CNN ) -- A Maryland mayor is asking the federal government to investigate why SWAT team members burst into his home without knocking and shot his two dogs to death in an investigation into a drug smuggling scheme .
Berwyn Heights , Maryland , Mayor Cheye Calvo comforts wife Trinity Tomsic at a news conference Thursday .
" This has been a difficult week and a half for us , " Cheye Calvo , mayor of Berwyn Heights , Maryland , said Thursday .
" We lost our family dogs .
We did it at the hands of sheriff 's deputies who burst through our front door , rifles blazing . "
The raid last week was led by the Prince George 's County Police Department , with the sheriff 's special operations team assisting , after a package of marijuana was sent to Calvo 's home .
Authorities say the package was part of a scheme in which drugs are mailed to unknowing recipients and then intercepted .
Calvo said he had just returned home from walking his two Labrador retrievers , Chase and Payton , when his mother - in - law told him a package had arrived for his wife , Trinity Tomsic .
Moments later , Calvo was in his room changing for a meeting when he heard commotion downstairs .
" The door flew open , " he said .
" I heard gunfire shoot off .
There was a brief pause and more gunfire . "
Calvo said he was brought downstairs at gunpoint in his boxer shorts , handcuffed and forced onto the floor with his mother - in - law near the carcass of one of dead dogs .
Watch Calvo describe the raid »
" I noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood , " Calvo said .
Calvo said his mother - in - law is still recovering from the incident .
" She got the worst of it , " Calvo said .
" She was literally in the kitchen , cooking a lovely pasta dish , and they brought down the door and shot our dogs . "
While he was being held , Calvo said , he told police he is the town 's mayor , but they did n't believe him .
Berwyn Heights has its own police force , he said , but Prince George 's County police did not notify the municipal authorities of their interest in his home or the package .
" They did n't know my name .
All they knew was my wife 's name .
They matched that to the registration of the car , " Calvo said .
" It was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives . "
After the raid , arrests were made in the package interception scheme .
The incident has prompted the couple to call for a federal investigation because , they say , they do n't believe police are capable of conducting an internal investigation .
" They 've said they 've done nothing wrong , " Calvo said .
" I did n't sign up for this fight , but I think what we have to do now is make changes to how Prince George 's County police and Prince George 's County sheriff 's department operate . "
Calvo said authorities entered his home without knocking and refused to show him a warrant when he requested one .
But Prince George 's County Police Department spokeswoman Sharon Taylor said legal counsel had informed her that " no - knock " warrants do not exist in Maryland .
Watch authorities defend their actions »
Taylor said authorities were acting on a warrant issued based on information available to them at the time .
" This warrant was for permission to search the premises , " she said .
" The special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene . "
" No - knock " warrants have drawn criticism before .
In Atlanta , Georgia , Kathryn Johnston , 92 , was shot to death by police in a botched drug raid involving such a warrant in November .
Taylor , a self - described dog lover , expressed sympathy for the loss of Calvo 's dogs , but stopped short of apologizing for the incident .
" We 've done these similar kinds of operations over and over again , to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed , " she said .
" We do n't want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody , and certainly not animals . "
The deputies have said they killed the two animals because they felt threatened .
" I would say that the dogs presented a threat , I would imagine , to the special operations situation , " Taylor said .
Meanwhile , Calvo and his wife said members of the community have expressed sympathy and concern about the incident .
At a news conference Thursday , Tomsic tearfully recalled a recent encounter with a neighbor who used to wave at the couple as they walked Payton and Chase .
" She gave me a big hug , " Tomsic said .
" She said , ' If the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you , how can I trust them ? ' "

Patriots Possibly Getting Boost From Returning RBs
The Patriots ' run game has been a strength so far this season , and it might be on the verge of getting even stronger on Sunday vs. the Chiefs .
Justin Raimondo was on al Jazeera yesterday , with Christopher Hitchens and Nazar Janabi from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
Riz Khan was the host .
The show was about al - Qaeda : after 20 years of existence , what is itâ€™s future ?
Is it recruiting ?
Those were the questions we were supposed to address .
And yet the idea that Al Jazeera was actually having Hitchens on â€ “ a militant atheist , who wants to invade practically every country in the Middle East , and has nothing but disdain for the religious and cultural ethos of the region â€ “ answers the question of why al - Qaeda is still around , albeit unintentionally .
Here it is in two parts :
DIGG THIS
Many citizens react to their rulers like little kids who recognize that a stranger is acting suspiciously and may be up to no good — but then decide whether to trust the man depending on the type of candy he pulls from his pockets .
It is as if a Reese ’s Peanut Butter Cup trumps the beady eyes , sweaty forehead , and out - of - season trench coat .
Likewise , adults may be wary about a politician — but if the guy promises free prescription drugs or protection and safety , many take the bait .
The nave response to politicians triumphed in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks .
By the end of September 2001 , almost two - thirds of Americans said they trust the government in Washington to do what is right either  just about always  or most of the time .
Amazingly , the attacks even boosted Americans ’ confidence that government would protect them against terrorists .
Many of the most respected and prominent media commentators saw 9/11 as the great sanctifier of government power .
The New York Times ’s R.W. Apple announced ,  Government is back in style . 
Wall Street Journal columnist Al Hunt proclaimed ,  It ’s time to declare a moratorium on government - bashing . 
Los Angeles Times columnist Ronald Brownstein declared on September 19 ,  At the moment the first fireball seared the crystalline Manhattan sky last week , the entire impulse to distrust government that has become so central to U.S. politics seemed instantly anachronistic .
Harvard University political scientist Robert Putnam effused ,
I think there is the potential that September 11 will turn out to be a turning point for civic America … .
There could be some good coming from it if it causes us to become … more open - minded about the role of government .
The 9/11 attacks produced many such summonses to elevate and glorify government .
Yet it was U.S. government foreign policies that stirred up the hornets ’ nest , breeding hatred that led to the attacks themselves .
After two skyscrapers collapse and the Pentagon is in flames , the government is hailed for failing to protect Americans from the enemies its policies helped create .
The 9/11 attackers were mass murderers who had no right to kill Americans .
But to pretend that the attacks originated out of nowhere or out of hatred for freedom fraudulently exonerates the U.S. government .
The Bush administration did all it could to exploit 9/11 to promote presidential and governmental greatness .
However , a 2002 Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found a vast array of federal - intelligence and law - enforcement failures prior to the attack .
Because the Bush administration often stonewalled the Senate investigation , 9/11 widows and widowers pressured Congress to create an independent commission to investigate the attacks .
Bush and Republican and Democratic congressional leaders stacked the commission with former congressmen , high - ranking government officials , and others entwined in the Washington establishment .
Beverly Eckert , a 9/11 widow and activist , complained ,  We wanted journalists , we wanted academics … .
We did not want politicians .
Philip Zelikow was appointed executive director of the commission .
Zelikow , the co-editor of a Harvard study entitled Why People Do n’t Trust Government , had worked closely with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and had co-authored a book with her in 1999 .
He had also been in charge of the Bush White House transition team on national security matters , had been involved in numerous transition briefings on the subject of terrorism , and was called as a witness before the commission .
He recused himself from the commission hearing at which Rice testified .
She was the one government official who perhaps most deserved perjury charges from her testimony , yet there was not a single word of criticism of her in the commission ’s final report .
The 9/11 report
The 9/11 Commission became the Bush administration ’s most famous faith - based initiative .
The commission appeared far more concerned with restoring trust than in revealing truth .
Bush and Cheney were allowed to testify without a transcript and not under oath .
Americans never heard what they said .
Instead , the commission offered a synopsis of their comments — as if it would have been impious to quote them directly .
The White House was allowed to edit the final version of the commission ’s report before it was publicly released .
The commission ’s final 568 - page report quickly became a bestseller , widely praised in part because it assiduously avoided judgment .
There was no mention in the final report of how Bush and Cheney exploited falsehoods about 9/11 to lead the nation to war against Iraq .
But , as Amherst professor Benjamin DeMott noted in Harper ’s , the report was useless to historians because of a seeming terror of bias . 
He was especially appalled that the commission accepted without challenge Bush ’s assertion that the August 6 , 2001 , President ’s Daily Brief was historical in nature .
DeMott observed ,  There ’s little mystery about why the Commission is tongue - tied .
It ca n’t call a liar a liar . 
He noted ,
The ideal readers of The 9/11 Commission Report are those who resemble the Commission itself in believing that a strong inclination to trust the word of highly placed others is evidence of personal moral distinction .
The 9/11 Commission report provided a litany of government missteps while carefully avoiding raising any ire against the government .
The failures often appeared to be more acts of God than failings by specific identifiable individuals .
It strived for a balance of criticism between the current and prior administrations and between the two political parties .
Thus , there was nothing to be done except count our blessings , celebrate our two - party system , and go whip the terrorists .
The 9/11 Commission also compiled ample evidence of government lying .
Yet the commission effectively ignored or rose above all the falsehoods .
There was no sense that the lies of the most powerful officials in the land posed any threat to America .
Instead , there were communication problems  between government agencies .
The mainstream press
The establishment aided the government by heaping derision on nonbelievers .
The Washington Post , in an October 2004 article headlined  Conspiracy Theories Flourish on the Internet ,  examined the problems of those who had not accepted the government ’s latest version of 9/11 .
The Post noted sympathetically ,
The ready and growing audience for conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks has been particularly galling to those who worked on … the bipartisan panel known as the 9/11 commission .
In Washington , bipartisan is the ultimate test of credibility — as if there is no chance that the two parties would ever conspire against the truth .
Zelikow bemoaned ,
We discussed the theories .
When we wrote the report , we were also careful not to answer all the theories .
It ’s like playing Whack - A - Mole .
You ’re never going to whack them all .
They satisfy a deep need in the people who create them .
The Post turned to a Syracuse University political scientist , Michael Barkun , for psychological insights into nonbelievers :
Conspiracy theories are … usually wrong , but they ’re psychologically reassuring .
Because what they say is that everything is connected , nothing happens by accident , and that there is some kind of order in the world , even if it ’s produced by evil forces .
The Post never ran any articles on the psychological maladies of people who insisted on believing the government ’s statements on 9/11 despite the contradictions or who insisted on clinging to earlier government claims after the government revised the facts .
Zelikow , who was hired by Rice as her top counsel at the State Department a few months after the Post article appeared , commented ,
The hardcore conspiracy theorists are totally committed ….
That ’s not our worry .
Our worry is when things become infectious , as happened with the [ John F. Kennedy ] assassination .
Then this stuff can be deeply corrosive to public understanding .
You can get where the bacteria can sicken the larger body .
( If the government was so forthright in its investigation of the Kennedy assassination , why were the Warren Commission records sealed for 75 years ? )
Not a single one of the top 300 American newspapers or magazines archived on the LexisNexis database commented on Zelikow ’s bacteria and infectious  characterization of disbelief in the government ’s version of 9/11 .
Yet his comment sounded as if the 9/11 Commission saw itself as America ’s mental - health czar .
Private doubts are the bacteria , and government assertions are presumably the disinfectant .
As long as people believe what the government says , no one will get sick .
Some of the allegations regarding 9/11 — such as the charge that no plane had hit the Pentagon — were easily verifiable as false .
New American , the magazine of the John Birch Society , ran an article harshly criticizing some of the 9/11 conspiracy theories , though carefully avoiding embracing the government .
Yet , as with Waco , the Establishment invoked outlying loons in order to seek to undermine the credibility of all criticism of the government .
But the existence of conspiracy nuts does not make the government honest .
The Washington Post never portrayed government officials who put out false statements about 9/11 in the same light as it did the private conspiracy buffs .
Despite the fact that private citizens have no power over other Americans and that they have no authority to coerce them or drag them into an unnecessary war , their false statements are presented as a greater threat than those of government officials .
The obsession with private lies is misplaced , when the real danger is the government lie — a lie embraced and disseminated by a subservient media , vested with all the prestige and aura of the state , and protected by an iron curtain of government secrecy .
And regardless of how many times the government changes the official story , people who continue to distrust the government are delirious .
The government ’s appearing to be a necessary evil does not oblige people to trust it .
We face a choice of trusting government or trusting freedom — trusting overlords who have lied and abused their power or trusting individuals to make the most of their own lives .

After bumping into an attractive alternative , women tend to be even more committed to bolstering their present relationship with the love of their life .
But men are likely to view their girlfriend in a more negative light following an unintended , though likely not unwelcome , rendezvous with temptation .
Fortunately , a committed man can better withstand the enticement with a little planning ahead , by imagining in advance how to resist the temptation of another woman .
Psychologist John Lydon of McGill University in Montreal offers these results in a study from the July issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
One of Lydon 's seven experiments on the temptation topic found that , after meeting an attractive and available man , women were 18 percent more likely to forgive their " romantic partner " who hypothetically had either revealed an embarrassing trait or lied about why he recently cancelled a date .
Yet after meeting an attractive and available woman , men were 12 percent less likely to forgive their girlfriend 's comparable gaffe .
Men may seem unable to resist that extra helping of estrogen , possibly because they interpret their interactions with women differently than their female counterparts , Lydon said .
But if men adopted the feminine view of temptation , they could develop this more defensive mindset .
" We think that if men believed an attractive , available woman was a threat to their relationship , they might try to protect that relationship , " Lydon said .
Using virtual reality scenarios in another experiment , the researchers discovered that male commitment may not solve everything .
But if men imagine a buttoned - down reaction the next time they are confronted with an attractive " other " woman , they will be better prepared to overcome future temptations — assuming that 's what they truly desire .
" Even if a man is committed to his relationship , " Lydon says , " he may still need to formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available , attractive woman . "

In a major step in understanding how the nervous system and the immune system interact , scientists at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research have identified a new anatomical path through which the brain and the spleen communicate .
The spleen , once thought to be an unnecessary bit of tissue , is now regarded as an organ where important information from the nervous reaches the immune system .
Understanding this process could ultimately lead to treatments that target the spleen to send the right message when fighting human disease .
Mauricio Rosas - Ballina , MD , working with colleagues in the laboratory of Kevin J. Tracey , MD , figured out that macrophages in the spleen were making tumor necrosis factor , a powerful inflammation - producing molecule .
When they stimulated the vagus nerve , a long nerve that goes from the base of the brain into thoracic and abdominal organs , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) production in the spleen decreased .
This study complements previous research performed in Dr. Tracey ’s laboratory , which showed that stimulation of the vagus nerve increases survival in laboratory models of sepsis .
The findings were published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Many laboratories at The Feinstein Institute study the immune system in health and in disease .
Every year , about 500,000 people develop severe sepsis , a syndrome triggered when the body ’s immune system wages an attack on the body that is well beyond its normal response to an invader .
Sepsis kills about 225,000 deaths in the United States each year .
A hundred years ago , the spleen ( located in the upper quadrant of the abdomen ) was thought to be only reservoir for blood .
It has only been in recent years that scientists discovered that the spleen is a manufacturing plant for immune cells , and a site where immune cells and nerves interact .
The spleen defends the body against infection , particularly encapsulated bacteria that circulate through the blood .
The hope is to modulate other immune functions like antibody production through the spleen ( via vagus nerve stimulation ) as a way to modify the course of infections and possibly some autoimmune disorders .
Dr. Rosas - Ballina began following the winding path of the vagus nerve to establish the route it follows to reach the spleen .
He was trying , without much luck , to find fibers of the vagus nerve in this organ .
And then he went a little further south to the splenic nerve , the nerve that innervates the spleen .
Their results indicate that the vagus nerve inherently communicates with the splenic nerve to suppress TNF production by macrophages in the spleen .
According to the prevailing paradigm , the autonomic nervous system is anatomically and functionally divided in sympathetic and parasympathetic branches , which act in opposition to regulate organ function .
“ The division between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems is not clear cut , ” said Dr. Rosas - Ballina , explaining that the vagus nerve ( the major parasympathetic nerve ) acts through the splenic nerve to modulate immune function .
He said that results of this study suggest that there may be two separate ways the brain communicates with the spleen to regulate immune function .
This points the way to a possible solution for treating sepsis .
It may be more effective to take advantage of the central nervous system to control cells of the spleen .
This way , “ you know where the treatment is going , ” said Dr. Rosas - Ballina .
If you 're looking for a sign that we live in a digital world that cares not for the physical manifestations of our analog past , you need only look at Paul Mawhinney 's record collection .
At over 3 million records , it 's the largest in the world .
He 's trying to sell it due to his advancing age and health problems .
Unfortunately , as he puts it , " no one gives a damn . "

Paul 's been building his collection for most of his life .
He used to run a record store , and while running it he never sold the last copy of any album or single , instead keeping it for his archives .
Over the years , those really added up .
Now , at an advancing age , stricken with diabetes and legally blind , Paul wants to sell the collection .
It 's been appraised at about $ 50 million , but Paul is asking a mere $ 3 million .
He 's had no serious offers , and an eBay auction back in February fell through .
In a time when you can access pretty much whatever music you want online , hard copies of albums are declining in value , both monetary and sentimentally .
But to see such a mindblowing collection as this sitting in a basement , unwanted , is really heartbreaking .
This is historic , no matter that we live in the iPod era or not , and it belongs in a museum .
If only one cared enough to buy it .

The hedge - fund business -- among the most reliable fortune - producing machines in recent years -- is going through a brutal shakeout .
Just a few years ago , traders found it relatively easy to quit Wall Street jobs , hang out a hedge - fund shingle and cash in .
Investors beat down the doors with eagerness reminiscent of the late - 1990s dot - com ...
Before you start having a complete panic attack , let us inform you that this whole fiasco actually took place last year , but as these things have a way of going , it 's just now coming to light .
Reportedly , a 33 - year - old captain in the Ground Self - Defense Force ganked a USB flash drive ( along with ¥ 2,000 [ $ 19 ] and a ¥ 10,000 [ $ 94 ] airline coupon ) and proceeded to " dump it . "
Aside from the laughably small amount of cash and prizes this guy accepted , the unfortunate part of all this is what resided on the flash drive : troop deployment maps used in Japan - US military exercises .
Worse still , we get the idea that said USB key is still out there somewhere undiscovered ( or unrevealed ) , so if you happen upon one with all sorts of undecipherable schematics on there , now you know what 's up .

During the second moonwalk of the Apollo 14 mission , Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell were hoping to walk to the 300 meter ( 1,000 feet ) wide Cone Crater on the moon , not far from their landing site .
However , the two astronauts were not able to find the crater ’s rim amid the rolling , repetitive terrain .
Later analysis using pictures the two astronauts took determined they had come within 65 feet of the crater .
People are used to having certain visual cues to judge distances , such as the size of a building or another car on the horizon , said Ron Li , who has been awarded a $ 1.2 million grant to develop a navigation system to be used on the moon .
Since the moon has no landmarks or cues to help determine distance , getting lost , or misjudging a distant object ’s size and location would be easy , and extremely dangerous .
New technology like sensors , inertial navigation systems , cameras , computer processors , and image processors will make the next trip to the moon easier for astronauts .
Li , from The Ohio State University , developed software for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity , which has helped him learn a lot about navigation .
The navigation system to help future astronauts find their way around moon wo n’t use satellites ; instead the system will rely on signals from a set of sensors including lunar beacons , stereo cameras , and orbital imaging sensors .
Images taken from orbit will be combined with images from the surface to create maps of lunar terrain .
Motion sensors on lunar vehicles and on the astronauts themselves will allow computers to calculate their locations .
Signals from lunar beacons , the lunar lander , and base stations will give astronauts a picture of their surroundings similar to what drivers see when using a GPS device on Earth .
The researchers have named the entire system the Lunar Astronaut Spatial Orientation and Information System ( LASOIS ) .
Astronauts will have a keypad and screen , possibly right on their spacesuits , to view their location and search for new destinations .
Keeping astronauts safe will be a top priority for Li’s team , which includes experts in psychology and human - computer interaction as well as engineering .
“ We will help with navigation , but also with astronauts ’ health as well , ” Li said .
“ We want them to avoid the stress of getting lost , or getting frustrated with the equipment .
Lunar navigation is n’t just a technology problem , it ’s also biomedical . ”

The Clover coffee machine will be installed in 80 Starbucks by the end of 2008 .

It 's 10 am on a Thursday , and the line at Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco snakes out the door .
Inside , an espresso machine hisses like an angry tomcat as customers order their cappuccinos .
But the real action is taking place a few steps away , where a scruffy barista stands at a stainless steel contraption , introducing the coffee he 's about to serve to his rapt audience .
" The Honduran is sweet , " he says , " with a refined acidity and an excellent finish . "
He lets one perfectly measured scoop of fresh grounds shimmy deep into the machine , then goes to work , twiddling knobs , pushing buttons , and whirling a whisk in a chamber at the top of the silver box .
Forty - five seconds later , he sets down a single cup of custom - made coffee that 's Jessica Alba hot , Bill Gates rich , and as unique as a snowflake .
No foam .
No caramel .
No whip .
Just beans and water — pushed through a cool little machine called the Clover — for a pricey $ 4 a pop .
The Clover coffeemaker debuted in a handful of cafés in 2006 and was promptly hailed as the best thing to happen to coffee lovers since the car cup holder .
With an $ 11,000 asking price , the Clover has become a fetish object among the coffee - obsessed .
Long queues signal its arrival in new cities , and self - described " Cloveristas " post videos on YouTube demonstrating the machine 's flashy brewing process .
There are more photos on Flickr paying homage to this shiny gadget ( 700 and counting ) than actual Clovers in existence ( roughly 250 worldwide ) .
Writer Mathew Honan tries out the Clover machine at Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco .
For more , visit wired.com / video .
The Clover also wowed Howard Schultz , founder and CEO of Starbucks .
Last year , Schultz stumbled upon the machine in New York City when he had spotted a line of people standing outside a tiny joint called Café Grumpy .
He tried a sample and declared it " the best cup of brewed coffee I have ever tasted . "
In March 2008 , Starbucks announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Company — the Seattle - based startup that manufactures Clovers in a converted trolley shed .
His hope is that the Clover will bolster Starbucks ' bottom line .
Chalk up some of the excitement — and the equipment 's hefty price tag — to artisanal tech .
A robotic hybrid of a French press and a Dirt Devil , the Clover is the first coffeemaker that lets the user program three key variables : dose , water temperature , and brew time .
( Example : 37.5 grams of Brazilian Fazenda São João at 204 degrees for 43 seconds . )
After the coffee steeps , a piston mechanism extracts the liquid from spent beans , resulting in a fresh cuppa in less than a minute .
A filter platform pops a hockey puck of grounds out of the top , where it 's easily wiped away .
An Ethernet port connected to an online database is designed to let users save favorite recipes for specific beans .
Made of stainless steel and copper , a single Clover typically takes several hours to assemble by hand .
Fast , fancy , and idiot - proof ?
No surprise that Starbucks is all over the Clover — the company has been rolling them out since last summer .
Half - caf nonfat toffee - nut latte lovers , get ready for a real cup of coffee .
I 'm a coffee achiever , as that old ad campaign goes .
I own two French presses , a stainless steel Cuisinart grinder / drip , a retro De'Longhi espresso machine , an Italian Vev Vigano moka pot , and a Vietnamese drip that I purchased in old Hanoi for making ca phe sua nong .
My San Francisco neighborhood has five coffee shops within a five - block radius : four mom-and - pop operations and a Peet's .
But compared with David Latourell , CEC 's 42 - year - old resident coffee expert , I 'm a Sanka - slurping rube .
Latourell and I are standing in the middle of CEC 's cupping room , a tasting area next to the company 's small Seattle factory .
The Clover is specifically designed to bring out the nuances of high - end coffees like Los Delirios , which comes from a Portland , Oregon , company called Stumptown Coffee Roasters .
Los Delirios is a blend of Caturra , Typica , and Bourbon beans grown near Esteli , Nicaragua .
Actually , it's on a micro lot located at 13° 22'45.99 " N x 86° 28'50.45 " W , between 1,050 and 1,450 meters above sea level , according to a manila " origin " card that comes with each bag of beans .
Underneath the farm's GPS coordinates are flavor descriptions that read in part , " violets and black cherry , baking chocolate , and chocolate covered raisins . "
Latourell hands me a cup of Los Delirios coffee made in the Clover .
We both take slow , even sips .
" I 'm picking up a little chocolate , " he says with a toss of his shoulder - length hair .
I sip again , summoning every taste bud .
I just taste — well , coffee .
Delicious , sure , but coffee .
Like wine and , more recently , chocolate , a quality coffee bean must reflect a certain terroir — the climate , soil composition , and elevation of its place of origin .
At least in theory , this gives a bean its unique and desirable flavor .
Whether or not your average caffeine fiend can tell a Guatemalan Maragogype bean from a Honduran Catuai is debatable , but terroir explains how Stumptown can sell bags of beans for $ 40 a pound ( about 10 times the price of commercial - grade coffee ) and cafés can charge from $ 3 to $ 7 for a single cup of joe .
" For $ 7 , you can get a bad glass of wine , " says CEC cofounder Randy Hulett .
" Or you can get one of the best cups of coffee in the world . "

Clover looks like just another countertop coffee machine .
But peek under the hood and you 'll find an innovative brewing system .
Here 's how it works : 1 . A barista selects dose , water temperature , and steep time .
2 . A piston pulls down the filter platform while freshly ground coffee is poured into the chamber .
3 . Hot water flows into the chamber .
4 . The barista briskly stirs the grounds with a whisk , and the water and beans steep for several seconds .
__5 . __The piston rises , creating a vacuum that separates the brew from the grounds , then lowers , forcing the joe out of a nozzle below .
6 . The piston rises to the surface again , pushing up a disc of grounds , which are squeegeed away .
Then there 's the top - shelf stuff .
Stumptown sells beans from Nicaragua called Las Golondrinas for $ 80 a pound .
On the international market , Esmeralda Special , a rare kind of Panamanian bean , can go for $ 130 a pound wholesale .
And consider Kopi Luwak , also known as catshit coffee :
It 's an Indonesian bean that 's eaten by a civet cat , then " harvested " from the animal 's dung .
( The bean 's bitter flavor is apparently greatly improved by passing through a cat 's digestive tract . )
A single cup of Kopi Luwak at the Peter Jones espresso bar in London goes for $ 100 , and a pound of the beans can cost as much as $ 600 .
If you 're going to pay that much for beans , of course , you want to have the right machine .
Back in the cupping room , Latourell fires up the Clover and goes to work on a second cup of Los Delirios :
He measures out 46 grams of beans , grinds them , and then slides them into the recessed chamber on top .
Next , he programs a new brew time and temperature , raising the heat from 205 degrees to 207 and increasing the brewing time from 45 seconds to 50 .
As the hot water rushes into the chamber from a topside nozzle , Latourell stirs the blend with a metal whisk , being careful not to break the stream , which would cool the water .
" The temperature has a massive effect on the extraction of chemicals that affect flavor , " he explains .
I take a swig .
Bang , there it is : chocolate .
Scharffen Berger , eat your heart out !
A few tweaks and I have a new beverage .
And it 's not just the chocolate flavor ; the mouthfeel and acidity are completely different from the first cup .
All Latourell did was adjust the brew time and temperature and add 6 grams of beans .
Taste - testing it against the earlier brew , I would n't have guessed they were the same bean .
I 'm starting to become a Clover convert .
Photo : RJ Shaughnessy__Brewed coffee is awful .__That 's what Zander Nosler thought back in 2001 , when he was developing a commercial coffeemaker for — of all places — Starbucks .
The bespectacled , rail - thin product designer had previously spent 18 months at Ideo developing everything from sunglasses to medical supplies .
As he tinkered with a revolutionary single - serve , push - button brewing machine targeted for the workplace , he realized that most makers were as stale as the coffee .
" I got to see firsthand how coffee was better by the cup , " Nosler says .
" The coffee coming out of those glass office pots is wretched . "
( Starbucks later called the prototype the Interactive Cup . )
When the project was finished , Nosler kept thinking about the single - brew concept .
He soon decided he could do better , making a superior brewer that was n't one - size - fits - all .
By 2004 , Nosler had cooked up a business plan .
He recruited other Stanford alums , including Hulett , 34 .
Within a year , the team raised half a million dollars from friends and family and set up shop inside an old trolley shed a few minutes north of downtown Seattle .
The Coffee Equipment Company was born .
For months , the group reworked the design .
They abandoned the office market in favor of cafés , ditched the grinder , and shrunk the countertop footprint .
By spring 2005 they had the first Clover prototype .
Code name : Chalupa .
Made of particleboard , with its guts bolted crudely on the outside , it looked like Mr. Coffee designed by Dr. Frankenstein .
But to roasters wanting a high - end single - serve option , it was gorgeous .
CEC demo'd a final prototype that October at a local party and sold three units before they were even built .
When Clover debuted at the Specialty Coffee Association of America event in 2006 , Nosler was mobbed .
" People saw us walking in and began chanting , ' Clo-ver , Clo-ver ! ' " he says , his eyes wide at the memory .
To the little indie guys , Nosler was a god .
While interest in CEC was percolating , Starbucks was crashing .
Its share price had dipped from nearly $ 40 in 2006 to around $ 19 in January 2008 .
The company that brought macchiato to the masses had lost its way — and a chunk of its profit margin .
Was Starbucks in the market of selling coffee drinks or fancy milk shakes ?
Cappuccinos or compact discs ?
Was it competing with Peet 's or Mickey D's ?
After just three years , CEO Jim Donald was on his way out , and Schultz , Starbucks ' founder , retook the helm .
On Valentine 's Day 2007 , Schultz wrote an internal memo ( later leaked to the press ) lamenting the state of the company .
" I 'm not sure people today even know we are roasting coffee , " the missive read .
" You certainly can't get the message from being in our stores ...
At a minimum [ we ] should support the foundation of our coffee heritage . "
Schultz announced that Starbucks would return to its roots .
No more vacuum - sealed bags of beans or breakfast sandwiches ( the smell of bacon and eggs overwhelmed the coffee aroma ) .
Starbucks would once again grind beans in the store .
It would introduce new blends and better espresso machines .
But most important :
It was going to road - test a little machine that Schultz had discovered a few months before on a walk through New York 's Chelsea district .
" In my 25 years at Starbucks , the Clover machine unquestionably delivers the best cup of brewed coffee I have ever tasted , " Schultz later gushed to his stockholders .
" And we want to share this experience with our customers . "
Starting in summer 2007 , Starbucks discreetly purchased and installed a few Clovers at stores in Seattle and Boston .
It sold a cup of Clover - made coffee for as much as $ 3.05 , about a dollar more than Starbucks ' regular brew .
The early reviews were glowing .
As one Yelper put it , " If you 're a coffee snob who normally scorns Sbucks and its burnt offerings , you might try the Clover pressed coffee at this location and be pleasantly surprised . "
After roughly six months of successful trials , Schultz proposed buying Clover 's maker , the Coffee Equipment Company .
" We thought Starbucks wanted to take us out on a few dates , " Nosler says of the deal .
" But they wanted to go steady . "
Michelle Gass , a senior VP of global strategy for Starbucks , is slightly less romantic : " Frankly , we just do n't want anyone else to have it . "
Starbucks is willing to share custody , however , of the 250 machines already out there , plus maintain and repair them , but it wo n't sell any more Clovers to independent cafés .
The company has already pulled the plug on CloverNet , the online database that tracks sales , maintenance , and brewing preferences for Clover owners .
Clover 's early adopters are outraged to see their coffee machine become part of the Coffee Machine .
" We made the decision to purchase the Clover to support this small independent manufacturer , " says Stumptown owner Duane Sorenson , who bought the first Clover in the US .
" When we found out that CEC was sold to Starbucks , we made the decision to sell our Clovers . "
Nosler shrugs off the criticism : " Everyone has their favorite little band that they 've watched change as it signs with bigger labels , " he says .
" But I can defend to anyone that selling to Starbucks was absolutely the right thing for us to do .
Starbucks has a larger market than all the independent roasters and specialty shops combined .
I 'm a product designer first , a coffee guy second .
I love coffee ; I 'm passionate about it , but I want to make products , plural .
Having a gigantically hungry customer is appealing on a lot of levels .
It was the best of all possible paths for us — and the coffee industry as well . "
By the end of 2008 , there will be 80 machines installed in upscale urban markets across the country .
Next year , Starbucks plans to remodel those stores with the Clover as their centerpiece .
" Other than espresso , there 's been no innovation in brewed coffee to speak of , " Schultz says .
" Now we 're driving new traffic because of the Clover . "
Then there 's that other counter where the Clover is destined to end up — the one in your kitchen .
" The Clover is a commercial machine , " he says , " but there 's potential to create more consumer - based opportunities , specifically at home . "
Today , you buy a $ 10 bag of Starbucks French Roast to take home .
Soon , you might buy a $ 40 bag and use your very own Clover to brew it .
Photo : RJ ShaughnessyCoffee snobs are skeptical .
" Clover will differentiate them from the Dunkin ' Donuts , the McDonald's , " says Tony Konecny , an industry consultant who runs the coffee blog Tonx.org and was one of the first to see a Clover prototype .
" But it comes down to the coffee . "
The machine is only as good as the beans you put in it .
Which is a problem for Starbucks , a chain that purchases coffee in mass quantities and can't deliver fresh bags of beans as quickly as the indie cafés .
Then there 's quality control : " By the time the customer experiences it , the beans have been blended and have been sitting in a bag for six weeks .
Anything special about the coffee is lost . "
A few days after my cupping room challenge , I 'm standing in line at a hilltop Starbucks in Seattle 's Queen Anne neighborhood — one of Clover 's beta sites .
I do a taste test : a cup of Clover coffee versus brewed coffee .
A young barista tells me they 're out of the first two specialty coffees I request and suggests instead Starbucks ' everyday blend , called Pike Place .
During brewing , the barista stirs the grounds into the Clover with a clunky rubber spatula — not a metal whisk — and pours the concoction into a crummy paper cup .
I smell , I sip , I inhale .
I can't tell which cup of coffee is which — and neither is anything special .
Is it the beans ?
My palate ?
After a few minutes , I finally pick it out :
This coffee tastes a little bit like hype .

Migaloo has become something of a celebrity A new white humpback has been sighted off Byron Bay on the east coast of Australia .
The newcomer , which was filmed by a television news helicopter , has excited marine scientists who think it may be related to Migaloo - to date , the only known all - white humpback whale .
Migaloo is somewhat of a celebrity down under .
Why ?
" Because as far as we know , he is globally unique , " said Professor Peter Harrison from the Whale Research Centre , Southern Cross University .
It now seems that Migaloo , ( whose Aboriginal name means " white fellow " ) might have competition .
Although predominantly white , the new whale does have some black markings near its head and tail .
So who is the newcomer ?
A white calf was spotted with a normal humpback mother in Byron Bay two years ago .
Experts say the new whale could be the offspring of Migaloo but further tests need to be carried out .
A record number of humpbacks have been spotted off the Australian coast this year on their annual migration north to their breeding grounds .
One thing scientists do agree on is that this second white whale has never been seen in these waters before .

In the nation 's first such ruling , a federal judge on Wednesday said copyright owners must consider " fair use " of their works before sending takedown notices to online video - sharing sites .
The 10 - page decision ( .pdf ) came a month after Universal Music told a San Jose , California federal judge that copyright owners need not consider the " fair use " doctrine before issuing takedown notices requiring online video - sharing sites to remove content .
The doctrine , recognized by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , permits limited use of copyright materials without the owner 's permission .
" Even if Universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement , the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright , " U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled .
" Accordingly , in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with ' a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law , ' the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright . "
Fogel added that an " allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim . "
The legal dispute decided Wednesday centers on a rarely used clause in the DMCA – originally approved by Congress in 1998 – allowing victims of meritless takedown notices to seek damages , in a bid to deter false notices and breaches of First Amendment speech .
It is usually used when somebody issues a takedown notice and misrepresents ownership of the copyright .
The case considered a lawsuit brought by a Pennsylvania woman whose 29 - second garbled video of her toddler dancing to Prince 's " Let 's Go Crazy " was removed last year after Universal sent YouTube a takedown notice under the DMCA .
The DMCA requires removal of material a rights holder claims is infringing its copyrights .
If it is n't removed , legal liability can be placed on YouTube or other video - sharing sites .
But the act also allows the uploader – in this case , the Pennsylvania mother of the dancing toddler – to demand the video be reposted online .
Universal did not challenge Stephanie Lenz 's assertion that the video was a " fair use " of Prince 's song .
After being taken down for six weeks , the video went back online last year , having now generated about half a million hits .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is representing Lenz , has asked the judge to award attorneys ' fees and other unspecified monetary damages .
While there is no bright - line rule , the factors to consider whether a video uploaded to a file - sharing site is a fair use are : how much of the original work was used , whether the new use is commercial in nature , whether the market for the original work was harmed , and whether the new work is a parody .
Universal argued that copyright owners may lose the ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements if they are required to evaluate fair use prior to issuing takedown notices .
Universal also raised the question of whether a particular use of copyrighted material constitutes fair use is a " fact - intensive inquiry , " arguing that it is difficult for copyright owners to predict whether a court eventually may rule in their favor .
Fogel ruled that , " while these concerns are understandable , their actual impact likely is overstated .
Although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise , there are likely to be few in which a copyright owner 's determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation . "
Judge Fogel denied Universal 's motion to dismiss Lenz 's case – freeing her to continue with her lawsuit seeking damages .
Still , Judge Fogel said he had " considerable doubt that Lenz will be able to prove that Universal acted with subjective bad faith " when it sent YouTube the takedown notice .
Universal spokesman Peter Lofrumento seized on that language .
" While the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage , " Lofrumento said , " we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter . "
Corynne McSherry , an EFF attorney , said the digital rights group intends on convincing the judge that Universal acted in bad faith when it sent the takedown notice last year .
" We will overcome his doubts , " she said .

The note urges the finder to pass it to a " similar aged boy " A man who threw a message in a bottle into the sea when he was a child has been reunited with it 23 years on .
Donald Wylie , then aged 11 , tossed the bottle into the water at Sandside beach , Deerness , on Orkney in 1985 .
It was found during a summer beach clean - up on West Sands , St Andrews , Fife , and a search was launched to try to track down the sender .
He was eventually traced back to Orkney and was invited to St Andrews to see where the bottle ended up .
The clean - up was being carried out by a group of eco-volunteers who managed to fill 77 black bags with rubbish .
Students and staff from the University of St Andrews were among the clean - up crew and they have been involved in tracking Mr Wylie down .
Now aged 33 , Mr Wylie said his mother had encouraged him to throw bottles into the sea as a child - something which he continues to do with his own children .
Although she penned the letter , it was done in Mr Wylie 's name but with his mother writing his sister 's year of birth on the note rather than his own .
Finder Mary Stevens hands the bottle back to its owner
He said : " Over the years I have had a few replies , usually from Norway or Denmark .
" I have never had one from St Andrews and never one that has taken this long to wash up . "
The bottle was handed back by Mary Stevens , the beach clean volunteer who discovered it in the sand .
Roddy Yarr , from University of St Andrews , who organised the event , said : " The message in a bottle was really quite a find and surprised us all and we 're delighted to be able to reunite the owner with this piece of history .
" It really is quite remarkable that the bottle should be found after all this time - who knows where it has travelled to in the last quarter of a century . "

What are these ?
Almost everyone seems to agree : governments now face a choice between saving the planet and saving the economy .
As recession looms , the political pressure to abandon green policies intensifies .
A report published yesterday by Ernst & Young suggests that the EU 's puny carbon target will raise energy bills by 20 % over the next 12 years .
Last week the prime minister 's advisers admitted to the Guardian that his renewable energy plans were " on the margins " of what people will tolerate .
But these fears are based on a false assumption : that there is a cheap alternative to a green economy .
Last week New Scientist reported a survey of oil industry experts , which found that most of them believe global oil supplies will peak by 2010 .
If they are right , the game is up .
A report published by the US department of energy in 2005 argued that unless the world begins a crash programme of replacements 10 or 20 years before oil peaks , a crisis " unlike any yet faced by modern industrial society " is unavoidable .
If the world is sliding into recession , it 's partly because governments believed that they could choose between economy and ecology .
The price of oil is so high and it hurts so much because there has been no serious effort to reduce our dependency .
Yesterday in the Guardian , Rajendra Pachauri suggested that an impending recession could force us to confront the flaws in the global economy .
Sadly it seems so far to have had the opposite effect : a recent Ipsos Mori poll suggests that people are losing interest in climate change .
Opportunities for energy populism abound : it can not be long before one of the major parties abandons the pale green consensus and starts invoking an oil cornucopia it cannot possibly deliver .
The British government maintains both positions at once .
In his speech last week , Gordon Brown said he wanted " to facilitate a reduction in short - term global oil prices " while seeking " to reduce progressively our dependence on oil " .
He knows that the first objective makes the second one harder to achieve .
The government 's policy is to build more of everything - more coal plants , more nuclear power , more oil rigs , more renewables , more roads , more airports - and hope no one spots the contradictions .
Is there a way out ?
Could we abandon the fossil fuel economy without provoking a blistering backlash ?
Two things are obvious .
We need a global system , and the current one , the Kyoto protocol , is bust .
It sets no cap on global carbon pollution , its targets bear no relation to current science and are unenforceable anyway , it contains loopholes and get - out clauses wide enough to sail an oil tanker through .
Until recently I supported an alternative system called contraction and convergence .
Every country , this system proposes , should end up with the same quota of carbon dioxide per person .
The richest countries must produce much less than they do today ; the poorest ones could pollute more .
Another proposal flows logically from this one : carbon rationing .
Having been assigned its carbon quota , each nation would divide up part of it equally among its citizens , who could use it to buy energy or trade it among themselves .
These proposals have the merit of capping global pollution , of being fair , progressive and easy to understand and of encouraging us to think about our use of energy .
But , after reading the proofs of a book by the independent thinker Oliver Tickell , to be published next month , I have changed my view .
In Kyoto2 : How to Manage the Global Greenhouse , Tickell slaughters my favourite ideas .
He shows that there is no logical basis for dividing up the right to pollute among nation states .
It gives them too much power over this commodity , and there is no guarantee that they would pass the pollution rights on to their citizens , or use the money they raised to green the economy .
Carbon rationing , he argues , requires a level of economic literacy that 's far from universal in the most advanced economies , let alone in countries where most people do n't have bank accounts .
Instead Tickell proposes setting a global limit for carbon pollution then selling permits to pollute to companies extracting or refining fossil fuels .
This has the advantage of regulating a few thousand corporations - running oil refineries , coal washeries , gas pipelines and cement and fertiliser works for example - rather than a few billion citizens .
These firms would buy their permits in a global auction , run by a coalition of the world 's central banks .
There 's a reserve price , to ensure that the cost of carbon does n't fall too low , and a ceiling price , at which the banks promise to sell permits , to ensure that the cost does n't cripple the global economy .
In this case companies would be borrowing permits from the future .
But because the money raised would be invested in renewables , the demand for fossil fuels would fall , so fewer permits would need to be issued in later years .
Tickell calculates that if the cap were set low enough to ensure that the world became carbon neutral by 2050 , the total cost of permits would be about $ 1 trillion a year , or roughly 1.5 % of the global economy .
The money would be spent on helping the poor to adapt to climate change , paying countries to protect forests and other ecosystems , developing low - carbon farming , promoting energy efficiency and building renewable power plants .
But his figure seems too low .
Like many of the world 's climate scientists , Oliver Tickell proposes that the concentration of greenhouse gases should eventually be stabilised at 350 parts per million ( carbon dioxide equivalent ) in the atmosphere , and his calculations are based on this target .
Last week Lord Stern suggested that meeting a less stringent target ( 500 parts per million ) would cost 2 % of world gross domestic product .
If the price of the carbon permits sold at auction were much higher than Tickell suggests , the extra money could be used for massive tax rebates and social spending , aimed especially at the poor .
But could the world afford it ?
This money does n't disappear , it gets spent .
Tickell 's proposal could represent a classic Keynesian solution to economic crisis .
The $ 1 , $ 2 or even $ 5 trillion the system would cost is used to kick - start a green industrial revolution , a new New Deal not that different from the original one ( whose most successful component was Roosevelt 's Civilian Conservation Corps , which protected forests and farmland ) .
This would not be the first time that business was rescued by the measures it most stoutly resists : there 's a long history of corporate lobbying against the kind of government spending that eventually saves the corporate economy .
Do we want to save it , even if we can ?
It is hard to see how the current global growth rate of 3.7 % a year ( which means the global economy doubles every 19 years ) could be sustained , even if the whole thing were powered by the wind and the sun .
But that is a question for another column and perhaps another time , when the current economic panic has abated .
For now we have to find a means of saving us from ourselves .

MSNBC beats on Fox for its ' anti-aging fix ' for McCain David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 25 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC's Dan Abrams was all smiles on Thursday as he aired what he described as proof of Fox News going over the line in an attempt to make Republican presidential candidate John McCain look good .
" If you have any question whether Fox News is in the tank for McCain , " exclaimed Abrams , " this should wipe any doubt from your mind .
Fox is actually trying to make John McCain look younger . "
MSNBC and Fox have recently been at war over their respective coverage of the presidential campaign , with Fox being particularly critical of Keith Olbermann 's apparent partisanship .
Earlier this month , Fox anchor Chris Wallace accused MSNBC of being " in the tank " for Obama -- and Abrams was clearly thrilled at the chance to hit back .
Over a " Beat the Press : Fox Anti-Aging Fix " graphic , Abrams urged , " Take a good look at the senator and the video they use . "
He then showed a clip in which Fox ran video of a strangely youthful and vigorous - looking McCain at a campaign rally to accompany a story about McCain 's current campaign schedule .
However , the video also prominently features a sign reading " www.mccain2000.com, " which at one point is even waved in front of McCain 's face .
" Fox is actually using eight year old video to discuss today 's activities , " Abrams marveled .
He concluded cheerfully , " They report -- you decide . "
In addition to going after Fox , Abrams also aired a recent segment from CNN's Headline News , during which which host Glenn Beck and conservative commentator Ben Stein attempted to cast a negative light on Barack Obama 's announcement that he will make his speech accepting the Democratic nomination in a large sports stadium rather than inside the convention hall .
" 75,000 people in an outdoor sports palace , " began Stein , using carefully loaded language .
" Well , that 's something the Fuehrer would have done . "
" I 've been saying that we 're headed towards a Mussolini - style presidency , " Beck added .
" It 's crazy . "
" It 's scarily authoritarian , " Stein agreed .
" Are they kidding ? " wondered Abrams .
" A lot of people want to see Obama and that 's bad ? "

A milestone of sorts was reached earlier this year , when Barack Obama filed an electronic fundraising report so large it could not be processed by popular basic spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel 2003 and Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 .
FEC , media can't handle Obama jackpot
The record - shattering fundraising by Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has reshaped the financing of presidential elections and generated breathless coverage and analysis of the otherwise arcane area of campaign finance .
Yet it ’s had another consequence that has gone all but unnoticed .
The campaign finance reports filed by Obama and Clinton have grown so massive that they ’ve strained the capacity of the Federal Election Commission , good government groups , the media and even software applications to process and make sense of the data .

A milestone of sorts was reached earlier this year , when Obama , the Illinois senator whose revolutionary online fundraising has overwhelmed Clinton , filed an electronic fundraising report so large it could not be processed by popular basic spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel 2003 and Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 .
Those programs ca n’t download data files with more than 65,536 rows or 256 columns .
Obama ’s January fundraising report , detailing the $ 23 million he raised and $ 41 million he spent in the last three months of 2007 , far exceeded 65,536 rows listing contributions , refunds , expenditures , debts , reimbursements and other details .
It was the first report to confound basic database programs since 2001 , when the Federal Election Commission began directly posting candidates ’ fundraising reports online in an effort to make political money more accessible and transparent to voters .
By March , the reports filed by Clinton , a New York senator who attributes Obama ’s victories in several states to her own lack of money , also could no longer be downloaded into spreadsheets using basic applications .
If you want to comb through Obama or Clinton ’s cash , you either need to divide and import their reports section - by - section ( a time - consuming and mind - numbing process ) or purchase a more powerful database application , such as Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel 2007 , both of which retail for $ 229 .
Or , you can rely on the analysis done by specialized research groups like the Center for Responsive Politics , the Campaign Finance Institute or CQ Moneyline .
“ Our people are working harder than ever and faster than ever because the candidates are raising more money more quickly than ever and there ’s such intense interest in who ’s raising what from whom , ” said Massie Ritsch , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ We know that reporters , in particular , do n’t have a lot of time and are n’t always trained in how to manipulate spreadsheets so we ’re happy to do it for them . ”
In a revealing insight into the significant fundraising disparity between the two Democrats and presumptive Republican presidential nominee , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , it is still possible to download his reports with plain - old Excel .
Yet even those with access to higher - powered software capable of handling the Obama and Clinton data are n’t necessarily able to start crunching numbers on the 20th of each month , when the campaigns ’ monthly reports are due at the FEC .
That ’s partly because the agency ’s website , which automatically processes and posts electronic data filed by the campaigns , on at least one occasion was unable to quickly process and post Obama ’s report .
The site was updated by noon the next day , pointed out FEC spokesman George Smaragdis .
These developments have occurred despite the FEC ’s efforts to offer presidential campaign finance data to the public in user - friendly ways .
Though not directly related to the challenges of digesting and presenting the bulging presidential reports , longtime agency spokesman Bob Biersack – the go - to guy for reporters with questions about commission data , rules or history – recently alerted reporters in an email that he would be moving into a new position focused on improving the way the commission makes data available on the Web .
As the commission has added tools for sorting data , he wrote “ it has become increasingly hard to keep track of all of the material that 's available and how to navigate through it - getting exactly the answer you were looking for and also pointers to other relevant ( information ) .
So , my new job will be to fix all of that - pull everything together , make the navigation straightforward , provide historical context , take advantage of new Web applications . ”
Some things , however , are beyond the commission ’s control .
Both Obama and Clinton tend to file their reports just before the midnight deadline , which reduces the coverage and newsworthiness of potentially significant stories buried in the data .
That ’s sometimes left initial news stories dependent on basic summaries of the data provided by the campaigns themselves .
The summaries , which mirror those eventually posted on the FEC ’s website , contain only top - line numbers – how much the candidate raised , spent , borrowed and owed at the end of the month .
Many media outlets rely on such summaries and do n’t download or delve deeply into the data upon which they are based .
The result often is horse - race - style money coverage – who ’s raised more , how unprecedented the levels of money are and what it means for the campaigns– which can sometimes create incomplete or inaccurate reporting or cause more important stories to be overlooked .
For instance , multiple media outlets relied on the summary entry entitled “ Debts and Obligations Owed by the Committee ” in reporting that Clinton at the end of March owed $ 10 million , including $ 5 million she had loaned her own campaign .
A deeper look into the report would have revealed that she did not report her personal loan to the campaign as debt , meaning that her debt would have actually been $ 15 million including the loan .
And only by actually downloading the data file could you see that much of the debt was in the form of unpaid bills to vendors , some of which were more than one month old .
That type of analysis revealed the extent of the financial hardship of her campaign and presaged serious weaknesses that hindered her ability to compete with Obama in subsequent states .
Since then , Clinton has loaned her campaign at least another $ 6 million , but in more recent reports has included the personal loans under the debt section of the report .
When I visited Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen of Homegrown Evolution last week they showed me the rocket stove they made in their backyard .
Theirs is quite fancy because it is made of bricks .
They sometimes use their rocket stove to fry a meal in a skillet .
The rocket stove was invented about 10 years ago by Dr. Larry Winiarski at the Aprovecho Research Center in Oregon .
It consists of an elbow - shaped combustion chamber ( usually made from metal cans ) surrounded by insulating material ( often a large can filled with sand ) .
It uses twigs for fuel , so it 's ideal for areas where the trees have been depleted .
Here 's a video from the Aprovecho Research Center that shows how to make a rocket stove .
Here are the first 3 of 10 rocket stove principles , by Larry Winiarski .
1 . ) Insulate , particularly the combustion chamber , with low mass , heatresistant materials in order to keep the fire as hot as possible and not toheat the higher mass of the stove body .
2 . ) Within the stove body , above the combustion chamber , use an insulated , upright chimney of a height that is about two or three times the diameterbefore extracting heat to any surface ( griddle , pots , etc. ) .
3 . ) Heat only the fuel that is burning ( and not too much ) .
Burn the tips ofsticks as they enter the combustion chamber , for example .
The object is NOTto produce more gasses or charcoal than can be cleanly burned at the powerlevel desired .

Courtesy Dwight D. Eisenhower Library __1958 : __President Eisenhower signs the National Aeronautics and Space Act , creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
The plot had thickened months before .
Beep … beep … beep …
They were steady , almost metronomic , signals coming from a tiny radio beacon orbiting the Earth every 96 minutes aboard an aluminum sphere measuring a mere 22 inches across .
In an instant , everything changed .
It was Oct. 4 , 1957 , when the Soviet news agency Tass announced to a stunned world that the Soviet Union had successfully placed Elementary Satellite 1 , known by its diminutive " Sputnik , " into an elliptical orbit some 550 miles above a Cold War–wracked planet .
American scientists attending a reception at the Soviet embassy in Washington , D.C. , that day knew their Russian colleagues were close .
With luck , the thinking went , the USSR might launch a satellite sometime in 1958 .
But the Americans were close , too .
Their Vanguard program , run by the Naval Research Laboratory , was beset by cost overruns and various delays , but they were confident that they would be first into space .
That illusion was completely shattered Oct. 4 , which is remembered as " Sputnik Night . "
While getting Sputnik into orbit did n't suddenly confer technological supremacy upon the Russians , it was nevertheless a remarkable achievement – and an enormous propaganda coup .
For the moment , at least , communism had trumped capitalism on a major front , and the conceit that America stood unequaled in the technological sphere was shaken .
When , less than a month later , the Russians put the larger and much - heavier Sputnik 2 into orbit , with the dog Laika aboard , genuine alarm set in .
Now there was talk of a growing technology gap .
There were also fears in U.S. military circles that these satellites might be capable of pinpointing targets for a Soviet nuclear - missile attack .
The Space Age was dawning badly for the United States .
The pressure for a U.S. riposte grew .
It only intensified with a failed attempt to launch the Vanguard TV3 satellite in December 1957 .
It was the Army that finally got the United States off the schneid .
Wernher von Braun , a key scientist in Nazi Germany 's rocket program , was now working for the U.S. Army , along with a number of his former German colleagues brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip .
They convinced the Pentagon to set Vanguard aside and bet the ranch on the Army 's still - untested Project Explorer .
Explorer 1 , launched atop a Juno 1 rocket Jan. 31 , 1958 , was the first American satellite to achieve orbit .
Although it was much smaller than Sputnik 2 and only a few pounds heavier than the original Sputnik , Explorer 1 was a badly needed success .
It also marked the beginning of the space race in the national consciousness .
Explorer 1 and the subsequent launching of Vanguard 1 mitigated , but did not efface , the sting of Sputnik .
And it did nothing to stave off a comprehensive reorganization of the U.S. space program .
The Eisenhower administration , working with an often - fractious Congress , got nowhere , so Ike ( in between tee times , his detractors would say ) directed his science adviser , James Killian , to convene a committee and come up with a game plan .
The first step was to reinvigorate the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics , or NACA , a rather geeky and elitist civilian panel that had been around since 1915 , by handing it all nonmilitary responsibilities connected to space exploration .
As NACA 's charter grew , the decision was made to expand it into a full - fledged government agency taking direct responsibility for the nation 's space program .
President Eisenhower signed the legislation creating NASA on July 29 , and it officially became a functioning entity Oct. 1 , with T. Keith Glennan as its first administrator .
There were 8,000 employees ( inherited from NACA ) , three research laboratories – Langley Aeronautical Laboratory , Ames Aeronautical Laboratory and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory – and an annual budget of $ 100 million .
( That 's about $ 750 million in today 's money , compared to a 2008 budget of more than $ 17 billion . )
The agency 's mission statement will have faint echoes for Star Trek fans : " To improve life here , to extend life there , to find life beyond . "

Speculation is growing that President Bush may pardon those officials responsible for the unlawful programs under his Administration .
It will be the subject ( and possibly the Sunstein controversy ) of my discussion on Countdown tonight .
This far , Bush has been openly hostile to pardons , creating one of the worst records in history .
With the exception of Scooter Libby ( who received a pardon without applying and without spending a day in prison ) , Bush has allowed thousands of pardon petitions to languish in his office .
He has granted only 157 pardons in comparison to Ronald Reagan ’s 409 in eight years .
Clinton , who abused this power , granted 459 but half came in his final year .

Motorists on Canada 's biggest highway ended up with a bee in their bonnet after a truck transporting 12 m of the insects overturned .
The lorry was carrying 330 crates of honey bees when it tipped over on a ramp in St Leonard , New Brunswick .
Bee experts were called in to help deal with the accident on the Trans - Canada Highway .
Royal Canadian Mounted Police said a downpour of rain helped to contain the bees in and around the vehicle .
" Bees do n't like the rain ... thousands of bees are hanging on the back of this truck and on the pavement right behind , " said police spokesman Derek Strong .
' Disoriented and agitated '
The BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto says the bees had been used to pollinate a crop of blueberries , and were being transported home when the accident happened .
Afterwards , the highway was closed and beekeepers in white protective suits attempted to lure the insects back to their hives .
A Canadian journalist who tried to get too close to the overturned truck was stung several times , but no - one has been seriously injured , says our correspondent .
Experts said it was unlikely that the bees would survive very long without the care of experienced beekeepers .
Richard Duplain , vice president of the New Brunswick Beekeepers Association , told AP news agency the bees would quite likely be angered by their ordeal .
" You certainly do n't want to go walking through a field of disoriented , agitated and wet honey bees , " he said .
ACLU Announces Legal Challenge To Follow President ’s Signature
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 , media@dcaclu.org or
( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON – Today , in a blatant assault upon civil liberties and the right to privacy , the Senate passed an unconstitutional domestic spying bill that violates the Fourth Amendment and eliminates any meaningful role for judicial oversight of government surveillance .
The FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 was approved by a vote of 69 to 28 and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush shortly .
This bill essentially legalizes the president ’s unlawful warrantless wiretapping program revealed in December 2005 by the New York Times .
“ Once again , Congress blinked and succumbed to the president ’s fear - mongering .
With today ’s vote , the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on Americans and run roughshod over the Constitution , ” said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ This legislation will give the government unfettered and unchecked access to innocent Americans ’ international communications without a warrant .
This is not only unconstitutional , but absolutely un-American . ”
The FISA Amendments
Act nearly eviscerates oversight of government surveillance by allowing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) to review only general procedures for spying rather than individual warrants .
The FISC will not be told any specifics about who will actually be wiretapped , thereby undercutting any meaningful role for the court and violating the Fourth Amendment ’s protection against unreasonable search and seizure .
The bill further trivializes court review by authorizing the government to continue a surveillance program even after the government ’s general spying procedures are found insufficient or unconstitutional by the FISC .
The government has the authority to wiretap through the entire appeals process , and then keep and use whatever information was gathered in the meantime .
A provision touted as a major “ concession ” by proponents of the bill calls for investigations by the inspectors general of four agencies overseeing spying activities .
But members of Congress who do not sit on the Judiciary or Intelligence committees will not be guaranteed access to the agencies ’ reports .
The bill essentially grants absolute retroactive immunity to telecommunication companies that facilitated the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program over the last seven years by ensuring the dismissal of court cases pending against those companies .
The test for the companies ’ right to immunity is not whether the government certifications they acted on were actually legal – only whether they were issued .
Because it is public knowledge that certifications were issued , all of the pending cases will be summarily dismissed .
This means Americans may never learn the truth about what the companies and the government did with our private communications .
“ With one vote , Congress has strengthened the executive branch , weakened the judiciary and rendered itself irrelevant , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ This bill – soon to be law – is a constitutional nightmare .
Americans should know that if this legislation is enacted and upheld , what they say on international phone calls or emails is no longer private .
The government can listen in without having a specific reason to do so .
Our rights as Americans have been curtailed and our privacy can no longer be assumed . ”
In advance of the president ’s signature , the ACLU announced its plan to challenge the new law in court .
“ This fight is not over .
We intend to challenge this bill as soon as President Bush signs it into law , ” said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
“ The bill allows the warrantless and dragnet surveillance of Americans ’ international telephone and email communications .
It plainly violates the Fourth Amendment . ”

note :
The University 's flexibility regarding course syllabi and lecture acquisition :
The conservative approach of many Economic schools .
Now , this is a very wide generalization .
There are quite a few universities that are currently pushing the envelope in Ecological Economics Energy Economics and developing some very insightful research ( Dr. Hall 's EROEI paper is a good example of students and prof.
working together in these issues ) .
Every day , more and more faculty is ramping up on their knowledge of Peak Oil nationwide and passing on the news to students .
Still , if students are not fortunate enough to be near the handful of universities that offer Peak Oil - related syllabi ( including Duke Vanderbilt and others ) , chances are they will be stuck without any classroom education regarding declining energy and what to do about it .
Even in universities where one may find Peak Oil information , open conferences and non-official meetings are significantly more frequent than formal classes and structured courses .
Given that universities are the ideal spawning grounds for elaborating on and raisingof declining energy - related topics , it 's worth to analyze a bit more why such a weighty matter is not being fully discussed and integrated into university curricula all over the country .
Some of the links are kinda old .
You might do well contacting the university directly if you are interested in taking classes .
It might not seem that Peak Oil is taking a long time to propagate itself in academic circles , because the standard protocol for new theories dictates a hefty amount of time for discussion , peer review , and proven results ( in fact , some may say that this issue has been spreading out incredibly fast for academic standards ) .
There is no getting around this buffer , since it puts a barrier against unfounded knowledge and weak arguments ever getting into the classroom .
Nonetheless , the inherent urgency of Peak Oil and the disastrous consequences entailed command a higher priority in the list of newcomer theories to be tried and proven by academic circles in all disciplines .
One might dream as far away as to think that Peak Oil theory will be included in syllabi for children in elementary school in a near future , but even climate change being taught to kids is still receiving attacks nowadays .
It is a good bet to first tackle university settings .
Here is a tiny list describing some of the problems Peak Oil runs into while trying to get into the classrooms .
In this post I wish to remain focused on the academic , administrative barriers for Peak Oil in the classroom ; other elements that also affect the acceptance of Peak Oil in the media , politics and general public have been discussed far more skillfully in other posts ( and here , and here ) .
I will gladly accept contributions from readers .
For the time being , some of the most noticeable issues in my opinion are :
The location of the university , its funding ( state or private ) and the university 's internal regulations will all affect how much liberty a professor has while teaching his classes .
Different states will have unique requirements for university syllabi and these affect how much cutting - edge discussion ( Peak Oil included ) a lecturer will be able to inject into his class .
Many professors will use seminars and open discussions to discuss topics not neccesarily included in their syllabi , but we are interested in full - fledged , compulsory classes that will hopefully reach all of the students and let them know about Peak Oil .
Let us think of " conservative " as a broad , neo-classical economics perspective where growth is considered to be exponential and infinite without taking into account the geophysical limitations of planet Earth .
This stereotype only serves to help paint the typical situation in an Economics school of a " typical " university .
I am aware that the logical structure I am following has several flaws , but I intend to use it only for illustrating purposes .
This conservative approach we are talking about will busy itself more with the financial , socioeconomic , equity , and international aspects of economics , rather than the energy standpoints of sustainable economics .
We can stereotype this approach as what has been taught in Economic schools for the last decades : everything but sustainable , energy - measured economics with strong ties to Natural Sciences , Ecology and Geophysics .
Now , if " Peak Oil 101 " existed , it would more than likely first be housed in the School of Economics ( Maybe the school of Natural Sciences ? ) of the " typical " university .
If this is to be true , then that means that at least a group of lecturers and professors from that School have a good understanding of Peak Oil and consider Economics to be a wholesome , interconnected discipline that lacks many current " conservative " assumptions .
From point A of current conservative economics , to point B of energy econometrics - orientated Economics , a number of situations could take place .
One possibility is that the change in economic schools could take a great deal of time ( or never happen at all ) , regardless of the forthcoming consquenes of Peak Oil .
It 's all too easy to throw the blame around , especially with Peak Oil .
In this scenario , experts and academis would go back and forth , blaming the government , the society and Tuna fish for the eventual break - down of financial systems and conventional institutions .
Thus , the real cause of economic failure would never be subject to academic study .
Another more hopeful alternative is that Economic schools trace the symptoms of market failure and societal breakdown to their roots on their own , and eventually come to terms with Peak Oil knowledge .
The acceptance of Peak Oil would imply a change in many fundamental economic assumptions that would , in turn , take a great deal of time to take hold of classrooms .
Then again , the would not be the first time that academia lags behind on accepting evidently visible facts .
Only time will tell how Peak Oil knowledge will trickle down from the Sustainable Economics roots it is based upon to commonplace Economics , but in my personal opinion it is a bleak immediate future .
It will take fierce determination from both students and professors to put Peak Oil in the university map , at least in the Economic disciplines .
Note : This is a particular situation of the School of Economics .
I am personally inclined to think that other schools ( such as Geophysics ) would more easily understand Peak Oil , and embrace it faster .
I would like other ideas regarding this .
- The multidisciplinary nature of Peak Oil. Peak
Oil is multidisciplinary in nature : Geophysics , petrophysics , Economics , Forestry , Physics , Sociology , Chemistry ... the list goes on .
If it would take a determinate amount of time for a single School ( Economics , say ) to fully adopt Peak Oil as a reality , it is likely that the other disciplines would be more inclined towards following suit .
But the amount of time for multiple disciplines to take full swing would be deadly in the long run , as some predictions state .
Economists have been taking a liking to introducing Psychology , Sociology and other interdisciplinary elements into their work in the last years .
Let us hope that this trend continues into the Natural Sciences and the other disciplines that help Peak Oil make sense .
- Funding orientation and Trustee objectives .
Many universities do n't exactly have their focus placed upon promoting new ideas , such as Peak Oil .
While private universities have the most lax funding available , they also have diverse priorities : promotion , prestige , and grants all play a decisive factor as to how much incentive professors have to get entrepenurial .
State educational systems have the strong money leverage to play a big part in promoting Peak Oil , but policy decisions and politics also constrain that budget .
There is a multitude of other reasons why Peak Oil is n't quite taking off in many universities , and even the above points would each make for essays of their own .
But it seems as if we wo n't be able to expect classes like Peak Oil 1101 available throughout all universities to freshmen anytime soon .
This is no light topic , and requires deep , thorough analysis and discussion .
But I think this is a good start to put issue out there .
I would also like to open this up for discussions on how to get the ball rolling in many universities through the help of the excellent contributors we have here in TOD .
I know we already have some faculty here on board , so it would be great to hear from them !
Gail the Actuary 's University syllabus seems like a good start for any potential classes regarding Peak Oil .
I will try pushing harder in my own university to see if we can crank up some sort of seminar , at least .
With any luck at all , I 'll be able to register for some Peak Oil-ish class before I graduate .
Please leave your opinions !
Judge Kimball rules in SCO v. Novell !
Here it is [ PDF ] at last !
I have n't read it yet myself , just quickly skimmed it enough to see that SCO owes Novell some money ( $ 2,547,817 plus interest probably -- SCO can oppose -- from the Sun agreement ) and it had no right to enter into the Sun agreement , but it did have the right to enter into the Microsoft and other SCOsource agreements .
Requests for attorneys fees are separate , and that part comes next .
Then appeals .
I know you want to see it immediately , so let 's read it together , and after it 's clear , I 'll come back and explain some more .
OK .
I 've read it now once through , and the big picture is this : Judge Kimball did not change anything in his August 10th order , which I was afraid might happen .
He could have , had he heard anything that he did n't know when he made that order .
So , SCO breached its fiduciary duty to Novell , converted funds , and so it has to pay .
That is ironic , in that this case started with SCO accusing Novell of slander of title , and asking for millions in damages .
Instead it has to * pay * Novell millions .
However , Judge Kimball accepted SCO 's argument that UnixWare is the latest version of UNIX and that it was the foundation of all the other agreements , even though SYSV was also involved , or so SCO thought .
He accepted SCO 's argument that if SCO was wrong about owning the copyrights , and it was , then it 's too bad for the licensees -- they just got less than they thought they were paying for , and that is a matter for them to work through with SCO .
So if EV1 , for example , wanted its money back , or part of it , it would have to sue SCO .
I think this is an appealable issue for Novell , but I do n't know if they will bother .
This was all about money , this trial , and very narrowly about whether SCO owed Novell anything from the Sun and Microsoft and SCOsource licenses .
The rest was decided already on August 10th .
And SCO does n't have much money left , if any , so I would guess that if SCO appeals , Novell will raise issues it certainly can in this new order .
And it 's a bit hard to fit SCOsource into the APA , since it was just a strange and vague bird .
But if SCO does n't -- and to my mind the order seems designed to discourage it , since if they do appeal , they risk being found liable for even more money than now ordered -- Novell then has to figure out if it is worth it .
That decision , I 'd say , would depend on an analysis of what 's at stake if SCO begins suing Linux for UnixWare or OpenServer or whatever nonsense they can dream up next .
SCO won one other legal point , having to do with who had the burden of proof .
Here 's a bit of that finding : SCO 's argument , however , fails to acknowledge that its fiduciary responsibilities under the APA were based on accurately accounting for such third - party transactions and SCO was in an advantageous position with respect to accounting for its third - party transactions .
SCO is correct , however , that the APA contemplated that SCO would enter into agreements that commingle an SVRX License when it is incidental to a UnixWare license .
In such situations , however , the APA appears to still require SCO to account for those licenses and demonstrate that the SVRX portion is only incidental .
In those instances , SCO has advantageous information as to whether the SVRX license is incidental .
Because Novell was not in a position to make such determinations , SCO had a duty to properly fulfill its fiduciary accounting obligations under the APA .
The court has already found that SCO breached its fiduciary duty in not properly reporting SVRX revenues under the APA .
Because of such breach , the court concludes that SCO has the burden of differentiating royalties properly retained by SCO from SVRX Royalties that SCO improperly retained .
SCO has the burden of demonstrating the proper allocation of SVRX Royalties .
The court recognizes , however , that additional issues are asserted in this trial that were not raised or a part of the prior summary judgment motions or the court 's summary judgment order .
The court concludes that the issue of whether SCOsource licenses were SVRX Licenses under the APA is an issue on which Novell retains the burden of proof .
It is not an issue that involves a breach of a fiduciary duty and SCO is not in an advantageous position with respect to facts weighing on that determination .
If those licenses are determined to be SVRX Licenses under the APA , then SCO has the burden of establishing the proper allocation of SVRX Royalties under such licenses because it is a part of its fiduciary duty .
Similarly , Novell retains the burden of proof on the issue of whether SCO had the authority under the APA , as amended , to enter into additional or amended SVRX licenses .
Again , this declaratory judgment issue is not one in which SCO would have obtained any kind of advantageous position .
Having decided that Novell had the burden of proving that SCOsource licenses were SVRX Licenses under the APA , it made it easy to find for SCO that they were not .
Again , this is an appealable issue , if Novell wants to bother .
I hope they do , actually , so that SCO does n't crank up the litigation machine again .
But SCO seems determined to do so , no matter what happens here , so in that sense , it hardly matters .
Let 's just say that Judge Kimball , having decided the matter of burden of proof , then believed more of SCO 's testimony than I did .
But the judge has to rule based on what is said at trial ; it was Novell 's job to prove the testimony not true .
And with this judge , that did n't really happen , because Novell had made a strategic decision regarding its argument on burden of proof , and that is what we 'll see them argue to the appellate division , if there is an appeal .
I 'm not personally unduly worried about UnixWare or OpenServer , having researched the code updates , so it is hard to get worked up about the future and SCO .
And Judge Kimball accepts the position of Novell that there is no SCO assertion of infringed UnixWare code in the IBM case .
SCO would have to invent a new defendant , I guess , and it foreshadows the real The End to the IBM case .
And it 's confirmed now that SCO did not behave properly , and it converted funds due to Novell : SCO 's failure to pass through to Novell the SVRX Royalties due under the Sun Agreement was a wrongful act inconsistent with Novell 's rights .
The Court concludes that Novell has established SCO 's conversion of the revenues due under the 2003 Sun Agreement .
3 ) Unjust Enrichment SCO was unjustly enriched by retention of the revenue under the Sun Agreement and Novell is entitled to restitution .
That part of things has to go back to bankruptcy court , though , which so far has bent over backwards for SCO .
I 'm guessing SCO is very relieved .
It certainly could have been much worse from a financial perspective .
Of course , they still have to face IBM , and Novell can now ask for attorneys fees and interest , so it 's likely to get worse , too .
Update : SCO has the following statement , reported by Grace Leong in the Daily Herald in Utah :
In an e-mailed statement today , SCO described the ruling as " an important step in ( its ) ability to pursue the appeals to try to get all of ( its ) claims heard by a jury as soon as possible .
We are pleased , however , that the court agreed that Novell is not entitled to anywhere near the more than $ 20 million dollars it was seeking . "
" Importantly , the court ruled that Novell has no right to any royalties from UnixWare or OpenServer sales by SCO , which is where the bulk of SCO 's revenue is earned , " SCO said in the statement .
" This is also an important step forward in the capitalization and reorganization plan for SCO that will allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 .
We continue to disagree with the premise of this trial and believe that Novell is not owed anything , but that they have interfered with SCO 's UNIX rights . "
The company is reviewing the ruling by Judge Kimball with its attorneys and will be assessing the next steps over the coming days and weeks .
Remember I told you that I thought the appeal , if there is one , would be about getting a jury trial instead of a bench trial ?
This confirms it .
So , if SCO appeals , I think Novell certainly will too .
No statement from Novell yet , though , so we 'll have to wait and see .

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH
CENTRAL DIVISION THE SCO GROUP , INC . ,
Plaintiff ,
vs .
NOVELL , INC . ,
Defendant .
NOVELL , INC . ,
Counterclaimant ,
vs .
THE SCO GROUP , INC . ,
Counterdefendant .
FINDINGS OF FACT , CONCLUSIONS OF LAW , AND ORDER Case No. 2:04CV139DAK
The parties tried this matter to the court on April 29 and 30 , and May 1 and 2 , 2008 .
Plaintiff and Counterdefendant The SCO Group Inc. was represented by Stuart Singer , Edward Norman , Jason Cyrulnik , Mauricio Gonzales , and Brent O. Hatch .
Defendant and Counterclaimant Novell , Inc. was represented by Michael Jacobs , Eric Acker , and David Melaugh .
Having heard the testimony of witnesses , reviewed the evidence , considered the arguments of counsel at trial , and considered prior submissions of the parties as well as 1 undisputed facts as set forth in the Court 's August 10 , 2007 Summary Judgment Order ( Docket No. 377 , " Order " ) , the Court enters the following Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order .
BACKGROUND
This action began as a slander of title action against Novell .
Novell , however , asserted counterclaims against SCO for slander of title , breach of contract , and unjust enrichment .
The parties then both amended their pleadings to assert additional claims and counterclaims .
On August 10 , 2007 , the court issued a Memorandum Decision and Order on several summary judgment motions .
The court dismissed SCO 's slander of title claim , concluding that SVRX copyrights did not transfer to Santa Cruz , SCO 's predecessor , under the 1995 Asset Purchase Agreement between Novell and Santa Cruz .1
The court further ruled that ( 1 ) Novell retained rights to royalties under the SVRX Licenses , whether or not the SVRX Licenses were in existence at the time of the APA ; ( 2 ) SCO 's 2003 agreements with Microsoft and Sun contained SVRX Licenses because they license SVRX at least in part ; ( 3 ) SCO was Novell 's agent and fiduciary for purposes of collection of SVRX Royalties ; ( 4 ) SCO breached its fiduciary duties to Novell by failing to account for and remit the appropriate SVRX Royalty payments to Novell for 2 the SVRX portions of the 2003 Sun and Microsoft Agreements ; ( 5 ) SCO was liable for conversion of such SVRX Royalty payments ; and ( 6 ) under the APA , an " incidental " SVRX license is considered an SVRX License .
The court , however , did not determine the value of the SVRX Licenses contained in the 2003 Sun or Microsoft agreements on summary judgment .
Rather , the court determined that there were issues of fact with respect to the SVRX Royalties to be paid to Novell under the Sun and Microsoft Agreements .
The court set for trial the issue of apportionment of value in the Sun and Microsoft Agreements between the SVRX components and the other components of the agreements .
The court 's prior summary judgment order did not address other SCOsource license agreements that SCO entered into with Linux end -users .
Therefore , the court was presented at trial with the issue of whether the other SCOsource license agreements were SVRX Licenses and , if so , what portion of the license fee should be attributed to those SVRX Licenses as SVRX Royalties .
In addition , the court set for trial the question of whether SCO was authorized to execute the SVRX Licenses in the Sun and Microsoft Agreements under a provision of the APA permitting SCO to amend or execute new SVRX Licenses " incidentally " with the licensing of UnixWare .
Novell 's motion for partial summary judgment was based on this issue , and the court heard argument on that motion on the second day of trial .
Accordingly , the bench trial addressed the following issues : ( 1 ) whether the additional SCOsource licenses were SVRX Licenses triggering SCO 's fiduciary duty to account for and 3 remit the appropriate SVRX Royalties to Novell ; ( 2 ) the appropriate apportionment of SVRX Royalties from the SCOsource licenses ; ( 3 ) the amount by which SCO was unjustly enriched as a result of SCO 's retention of SVRX Royalties ; ( 4 ) whether SCO had the authority to enter into the SCOsource licenses , including the Sun and Microsoft Agreements , under the APA ; and ( 5 ) whether SCO had the authority under the APA to amend Sun 's existing 1994 Buy - out Agreement with Novell .
Prior to the bench trial , the parties briefed Novell 's partial motion for summary judgment on its fourth claim for relief and SCO 's motion for judgment on the pleadings on Novell 's claims for money or claim for declaratory relief .
Because these motions were not heard until trial , the court will address these motions in its conclusions of law .
FINDINGS OF FACT A . The Governing Contracts Between Novell and SCO SCO 's predecessor , Santa Cruz , and Novell entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ( " APA " ) dated September 19 , 1995 .
On December 6 , 1995 , a few months after the APA was signed and the date the transaction closed , Novell and Santa Cruz signed Amendment No. 1 to the APA .
Approximately one year after the APA was signed , on October 16 , 1996 , Novell and Santa Cruz executed Amendment No. 2 to the APA .
B. SCO 's Duties Under the APA When Santa Cruz and Novell negotiated the APA , Santa Cruz did not have sufficient resources to purchase the entirety of Novell 's UNIX business .
To bridge the gap , the parties agreed , under section 1.2 ( b ) of the APA , that Novell would continue to receive one hundred 4 percent of the SVRX Royalties .
Santa Cruz was to collect and pass through these royalties to Novell , and Novell , in turn , would pay Santa Cruz an administrative fee of five percent of the SVRX Royalties .
Section 1.2 ( b ) of the APA states that SVRX Royalties are " defined and described in Section 4.16 . "
Section 4.16 ( a ) of the APA provides that Santa Cruz was to " administer the collection of all royalties , fees and other amounts due under all SVRX Licenses ( as listed in detail under Item VI of Schedule 1.1 . ( a ) hereof and referred to as ' SVRX Royalties ' ) . "
Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , in turn , refers to " [ a ]ll contracts relating to SVRX Licenses listed below . "
Instead of providing a list of license agreements with other parties , however , Schedule 1.1 ( a ) provides a list of Unix System V software releases up to and including Unix System V Release No. 4.2MP .
Novell retained " all rights to the SVRX Royalties notwithstanding the transfer of the SVRX Licenses to [ Santa Cruz ] . "
The APA further specifies that Santa Cruz " only has legal title and not equitable interest in such royalties within the meaning of Section 541 ( d ) of the Bankruptcy Code . "
As this court has previously determined , the APA created an agency relationship between the parties with respect to SVRX Royalties .
Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA provides that Santa Cruz " shall not , and shall not have the authority to , amend , modify , or waive any right under or assign any SVRX License without the prior written consent " of Novell .
Under this section , Novell retained the sole discretion to direct Santa Cruz to amend , supplement , modify , waive , or add rights under or to any SVRX Licenses .
Novell 's rights and SCO 's obligations under section 4.16 ( b ) , as amended , apply to " any SVRX 5 License . "
Amendment No. 1 to the APA modifies section 4.16 ( b ) to create two exceptions whereby Santa Cruz has " the right to enter into amendments of the SVRX Licenses . "
Santa Cruz can enter into amendments of SVRX Licenses ( 1 ) as may be incidentally involved through its rights to sell and license SCO UnixWare software or the Merged Product or ( 2 ) to allow a licensee under a particular SVRX License to use the source code of the relevant SVRX products on additional CPUs or to receive additional distribution from Santa Cruz of such source code .
Amendment No. 1 further provides that Santa Cruz can enter into new SVRX Licenses only as may be incidentally involved through its rights to sell and license SCO UnixWare .
Amendment No. 2 to the APA included an additional amendment to Section 4.16 ( b ) .
Under Section B of Amendment No. 2 , Novell and Santa Cruz agreed to a procedure that would govern " any potential transaction with an SVRX licensee which concerns a buy - out of any such licensee 's royalty obligations . "
The parties agreed to provide written notification to each other upon becoming aware of any potential transaction concerning a buy - out , to both attend any meetings or negotiations with the licensee unless agreed otherwise , to jointly consent to any written proposals to be presented to licensees , and to meet to discuss any potential buy - out transaction .
The parties further agreed that a transaction concerning a buy - out should not occur without the prior written consent of both Novell and Santa Cruz .
Under the Amended APA , SCO is entitled to keep " source code right to use fees " under existing SVRX Licenses from the licensing of additional CPUs and from the distribution by SCO of additional source code copies .
Under the Amended APA , SCO is also entitled to keep source 6 code right to use fees attributable to new SVRX Licenses approved by Novell .
The court 's prior August 10 , 2007 Order acknowledged SCO 's right to keep 100 % of the source code right to use fees identified in Section 1.2(e ) of the amended APA .
SCO has the right to enter into amendments of an SVRX License and new SVRX Licenses " as may be incidentally involved through its rights to sell and license UnixWare software . "
The word incidentally is not defined in either the APA or its Amendments .
Several witnesses , however , testified that the word incorporates the practice whereby the owner of Unix or UnixWare technology granted rights to the System V prior products .
C. UNIX and UnixWare UnixWare is the brand name for the more recent releases of the UNIX System V , Release 4 operating system developed and licensed in the early 1990s by Novell and its predecessors to the technology .
The product was called UnixWare because it was to be a combination of the latest releases of System V source code and some components of Novell 's NetWare source code .
The first releases of UnixWare contain all or virtually all of the technology included in the immediately prior System V releases , SVR4.2 and SVR4.2MP .
Novell sold the UnixWare business to Santa Cruz in the 1995 APA between Novell and Santa Cruz .
The core members of Novell 's UNIX licensing group became employees of Santa Cruz .
After the APA , Santa Cruz and then SCO developed and licensed SCO UnixWare .
Under the 2001 transfer of assets from Santa Cruz to SCO , the core members of Santa Cruz 's UNIX licensing group became SCO employees .
SCO released several subsequent releases of UnixWare , including multiple versions of 7 each UnixWare 2 and UnixWare 7 , which are the latest implementation of System V and the latest generation of UNIX SVR 4.2 with SVR 4.2MP .
All of the releases of UnixWare subsequent to Novell 's transfer of the business are releases of System V. Witnesses testified that the commercially valuable technology from the prior versions is included in UnixWare , and UnixWare would not operate without its System V components .
The current version of UnixWare supports the newest industry - standard hardware .
For the most part , older versions of UNIX are not marketable to consumers because those earlier versions do not take advantage of hardware enhancements to new processors and peripherals adopted by computer manufacturers .
As a practical matter , purchasers would not have the option to purchase the hardware on which the older versions of UNIX had run because computer manufacturers have adopted the newer hardware .
D. Royalties from UnixWare Licenses
With respect to the payment of royalties to Novell , the APA distinguishes between SVRX Licenses and UnixWare licenses .
The APA 's requirements for the payment of SVRX Royalties has been discussed above .
Section 1.2 ( b ) of the APA specifies the circumstances in which any royalties would be paid to Novell for Santa Cruz 's distribution of UnixWare products : ( b ) ( i ) Royalties on UnixWare , Eiger , MXU and derivatives ( a) No royalties shall be payable in connection with any of the UW Products until Buyer shall have shipped or licensed , in any year , 40 % of the units contemplated by the Plan for such year ;
( b) Buyer shall pay royalties equal to $ 30.00 net per unit in connection with each and every net unit of 8 UW Products shipped or licensed by Buyer over an above 40 % and less than 70 % of the total units contemplated by the Plan for such year ;
( c) Buyer shall pay royalties equal to $ 60.00 per net unit in connection with each and every net unit of UW Products shipped or licensed by Buyer over and above 70 % of the total units contemplated by the Plan for such year .
. . . .
( c) Termination of Royalty Obligation .
The royalty obligations set forth in subsection [ b ] above will terminate ( i ) after Buyer shall have made an aggregate cumulative payments to Seller equal to such amount which has a total net present value of $ 84,000,000 ( determined as of the Closing ) or ( ii ) December 31 , 2002 , whichever is sooner .
The parties agree that the requirements for subsection ( b ) ( i ) to apply were never met .
Pursuant to these terms , any royalty obligation that Santa Cruz could have had to Novell with respect to UnixWare products terminated on December 31 , 2002 .
Novell acknowledges that it is not entitled to royalties from any UnixWare licenses .
For example , at trial , Novell did not seek any payments with respect to the stand - alone UnixWare license in Section 3 of the Microsoft Agreement .
Novell did not ask or suggest to Santa Cruz that it should remit any portion of the fees or royalties that Santa Cruz received under any UnixWare license even where System V prior products were listed as part of those licenses .
Novell never asked or suggested to Santa Cruz that it should undertake to allocate to the System V prior products any value of the fees or royalties that Santa Cruz received under any UnixWare license granting rights to such older versions of System V. 9
In 1998 , Novell conducted an audit of Santa Cruz to ensure that Santa Cruz was remitting to Novell all of the royalties to which Novell was entitled under the APA .
Novell knew at that time that SCO was licensing UnixWare with System V prior products listed , just as Novell had done , because that practice was discussed and agreed upon as part of implementing Santa Cruz 's licensing procedures at the time of the asset transfer .
In the 1998 audit , Novell did not ask Santa Cruz to produce any information regarding the fees and royalties that Santa Cruz received under its UnixWare licensing business .
In the 1998 audit , Novell did not ask or suggest to Santa Cruz that it should undertake to allocate to the older versions of System V any value of the fees and royalties that Santa Cruz received under any UnixWare license granting rights to such older versions .
Santa Cruz did not believe that it was under any obligations to remit to Novell any portion of the fees or royalties from any UnixWare licenses because the thresholds for such payments under Schedule 1.2 of the APA had not been satisfied and , after 2002 , the term under which the thresholds applied had expired .
SCO did not remit to Novell any of the royalties that SCO received from any of the UnixWare licenses that Santa Cruz had acquired from Novell in 1995 or into which Santa Cruz or SCO entered after 1995 , whether or not those licenses included a list of System V prior products .
Novell conducted another audit of SCO in 2003 .
Novell never asked or suggested to SCO that it should undertake to allocate to the older versions of System V any value of the fees or royalties that Santa Cruz received under any UnixWare license granting rights to such older versions .
10 E. OpenServer OpenServer is the brand name for the release of UNIX System V , Release 3 that Santa Cruz developed in the 1980s .
Novell never owned , or had any license to , Openserver .
OpenServer was Santa Cruz 's flagship product through the 1990s .
OpenServer produces two - thirds of SCO 's UNIX revenue and has thousands of customers , including small to mid-sized businesses and large corporations , such as McDonald's .
F. Licensing Practices UNIX licensees often distributed and used binary products that included code from multiple releases of System V. Novell and its successors required and allowed such licensees to pay only one set of royalties for the use or distribution of such a product .
To identify the proper license under which such a product could be used or distributed and to calculate the appropriate royalty payments required for using or distributing such a product , Novell and its successors employed the " one line of code " rule .
Under the " one line of code " rule , Novell and then SCO determined whether there was as little as one line of code from the latest release of System V ( including UnixWare ) contained in a binary product and then calculated royalty payments for the entire product under that latest license .
Novell and then SCO prohibited licensees from parsing out the relative amounts of code from different releases of System V and paying portions of the requisite royalties under multiple System V licenses .
For example , licensees who distributed a UNIX binary product that contained code from SVR3.0 , SVR4.0 , and SVR4.2 did not pay any SVR 3.0 or SVR4.0 royalties for distributing that 11 product , but instead paid only SVR4.2 royalties under the terms and prices of an SVR4.2 license .
Similarly , licensees that used a product that contained SVR3.0 , SVR4.0 , and UnixWare 2.0 did not pay any SVR3.0 or SVR4.0 royalties for distributing that product , but instead paid only UnixWare royalties .
In licensing UnixWare , SCO also licensed each of the prior products upon which the newest version was built .
This practice began with AT&T , was continued by Novell , and then adopted by Santa Cruz and SCO .
For example , a licensee who executed a license for SVR4.2 , had the same rights to the earlier versions of UNIX on which 4.2 was built , and the list of prior products reflected that right .
Santa Cruz and SCO regularly listed the older releases of UNIX , including numerous releases of System V , with the current license .
Customers paid no additional fees for the rights to the prior products regardless of whether they had a previous license to the prior products .
In 1995 and 1996 , for example , Santa Cruz licensed UnixWare 2.0 and 2.1 to various licensees .
A standard UnixWare 2.0 license included a one - time fee of $ 375,000 for the right to use the UnixWare 2.0 source code .
As Novell had done , Santa Cruz included for many UnixWare 2.0 licensees a listing of System V prior products at no additional cost .
The $ 375,000 price for a UnixWare 2.0 license with Unysis , whose license listed SVRX prior products , was the same as a contemporaneous UnixWare license with Alps , whose license did not include SVRX prior products .
The practice of including rights to prior products recognized that licensees developed their own versions of UNIX based on the most recent product and as an assurance to the licensee 12 that they had rights to any of the technology included in that licensed product .
At this time , SCO was primarily contracting with computer manufacturers , or OEMs .
By the late 1990s , Santa Cruz began to license UnixWare to distributors as a " packaged product , " or product in binary format that was ready for distribution to end - users without further development .
The UnixWare licenses with such distributors did not list prior System V prior products because distributors , unlike OEMs , merely replicated and distributed the packaged product in the same form .
G. The SCOsource Initiative
In late 2002 , SCO formally created a new division known as SCOsource .
In approximately January 2003 , SCO launched its SCOsource program .
The terms of the specific licenses SCO executed as part of the SCOsource program are addressed below .
As a general matter , the SCOsource program was an effort to obtain license fees from Linux users based on SCO 's claims to UNIX intellectual property allegedly contained in Linux .
The parties disputed at trial whether the SCOsource program was primarily concerned with SVRX or with SCO UnixWare .
In litigating its claims against IBM , Novell , and a variety of other parties , the only infringing code SCO has identified is SVRX code .
SCO 's expert witness in the IBM litigation identified only UNIX SVR4 code in Linux .
And SCO sued Novell for slander of title because Novell claimed ownership of the SVRX copyrights , not because it claimed ownership to the copyrights in SCO UnixWare .
Many contemporaneous press releases , correspondence , and other material introduced at trial describe SCOsource as focused on SVRX infringement in Linux .
SCO 's internal memoranda and presentations also describe SVRX as the 13 " trunk " from which SCOsource took its value , distinguishing SVRX from " branches " such as SCO UnixWare .
Nonetheless , there was also testimony and evidence at trial demonstrating that SCOsource was not solely focused on SVRX .
In January 2003 , when SCO formally announced the SCOsource program , SCO was still focused on licensing both SCO UnixWare and Openserver technology .
In February 2003 , SCO created a " SCO V for Linux Sales Guide . "
The guide repeatedly refers to SCO 's concern that " UnixWare " and " OpenServer " technology had been improperly used in Linux .
The guide refers generally to " SCO System V , " it did not specifically identify which technology comprised SCO System V. Also , in a December 2002 slide presentation , in describing the proposed " SCO System V for Linux " deliverable , SCO identified " SCO 's shared UNIX Libraries from Open Server and UnixWare for use with Linux . "
There is competing evidence as to whether in the SCOsource program SCO was attempting to increase revenue based on the SVRX technology or to protect its latest releases of UnixWare and OpenServer from competition with Linux .
The court can only conclude that both factors played a role in SCO 's determination to pursue the SCOsource licenses .
H. Novell and SCOsource Program
In late 2002 , SCO and Novell engaged in several telephone conversations concerning SCO 's plan to protect its alleged intellectual property in Linux through agreements with Linux users .
SCO asked Novell to perform " due diligence on UNIX intellectual property before it launched the SCOsource program . "
SCO also asked for documents " to understand its IP rights " for purposes of " IP tracking " and for " documents that help give the history of SCO 's rights to 14 UNIX . "
Novell said it was not interested in providing the requested information to SCO and that it was not interested in participating with SCO 's proposed program .
Darl McBride , SCO 's CEO , testified that during his conversations with Greg Jones at Novell he pointed out that SCO 's efforts to enforce the intellectual property in Linux would indirectly help the sale of the various UNIX flavors that compete with Linux in the market place and that such a boost would potentially increase the declining SVRX Royalty stream that SCO remitted to Novell from contracts that licensed out the older products .
Novell , however , at that time , viewed the SVRX Royalty stream as a less significant stream of income than its potential revenue interest in becoming directly involved in Linux .
I . The 2003 Microsoft Agreement On April 30 , 2003 , SCO and Microsoft entered into a " Release , License and Option Agreement " ( " Microsoft Agreement " ) .
Microsoft was not a UNIX licensee at the time of entering the Microsoft Agreement with SCO .
SCO described its license with Microsoft as part of its SCOsource campaign .
SCO received a total of $ 16,680,000 under the Microsoft Agreement .
SCO did not pass through any of this revenue to Novell .
The Microsoft Agreement had several components , each contained in separate sections of the Agreement .
The Microsoft Agreement also contained an apportionment of the amounts Microsoft paid for each section of the Microsoft Agreement .
Section 2 of the Microsoft Agreement is entitled " Release and Licenses . "
Microsoft paid $ 1.5 million for the release and license in that section .
Section 2.1 is a " Release of existing 15 general claims " that releases any claims " known or unknown , suspected or unsuspected , or contingent or fixed " that SCO might have against Microsoft .
The release does not mention any particular technology .
Section 2.2 is an " IP license to current SCO intellectual property in any of Microsoft 's products . "
Section 3 of the Microsoft Agreement is an " Option to Purchase UnixWare License . "
Microsoft paid $ 2 million for the option granted in Section 3.5 and , thereafter , paid $ 5 million for the license .
Novell recognizes Section 3 as a UnixWare license and does not claim entitlement to any of Microsoft 's payments to SCO under Section 3 .
Section 4 of the Microsoft Agreement is an " Option to Purchase License to Other SCO Assets . "
Microsoft paid $ 250,000 for the option granted in Section 4.1 .
Microsoft could exercise the option only if it had exercised the option of obtaining the UnixWare license set forth in Section 3 .
After exercising its option under Section 3 , Microsoft paid SCO $ 8 million for the license in Section 4 .
Section 4 of the Microsoft SCOsource License lists at least 34 versions of UNIX .
At least 28 of those versions are identified in the APA as SVRX .
Section 4.1 and 4.2 state that the License is for the Assets in Exhibits A , B , and C to the Agreement .
Exhibit A lists components and features of UnixWare 7 , Release 7.1.3 .
Exhibit B pertains to components for use with UnixWare .
Exhibit C is a list of several operating systems : Open UNIX 8 Release 8.x ; UnixWare Release 7.0.x and prior versions of UnixWare ; OpenServer Release 5.x and all prior versions and releases ; and older versions of UNIX .
The license under Section 4 provided Microsoft with broader rights to distribute the 16 UnixWare source code than Section 3 granted .
Section 4 conveys a broad set of rights , including the right to license , sublicense , and sell the identified UNIX versions .
The only substantive limitation imposed is that Microsoft can only distribute the source code of these UNIX versions " in connection with a Microsoft platform product or related offering . "
The licenses to UnixWare and OpenServer that SCO granted to Microsoft under Section 4 of the Microsoft Agreement allowed Microsoft to ensure that the company 's software was compatible with the latest releases of UnixWare and OpenServer that hardware manufacturers were using at the time .
Under Section 4.4 of the Microsoft Agreement , the parties agreed that SCO may not be able to deliver to Microsoft the assets " identified as non-deliverable in Exhibit C. "
Exhibit C provides : " Items in italics are not readily available and may not be recoverable . "
The items in italics include SVR 4.0 and all prior SVR preceding SVR 2.0 .
J. The 2003 Sun Agreement In 1994 , Sun entered into an SVRX License with Novell .
In that agreement , Sun bought out its continuing royalty obligations regarding certain versions of SVRX .
On February 25 , 2003 , SCO executed an agreement with Sun that purports . to amend and restate .
the 1994 SVRX License .
SCO described its license with Sun as part of its SCOsource campaign .
Under the 2003 Sun Agreement , Sun paid SCO $ 9,143,451 .
SCO did not pass through any of the Sun revenue to Novell .
The 2003 Sun Agreement does not ascribe any particular prices to any of the specified rights granted in the Agreement .
At trial , SCO did not establish distinct values for any of the various intellectual property rights conveyed in the 2003 Sun Agreement .
17 Section 4 grants a license to all of SCO 's intellectual property rights in the technology listed in Attachment 1 of the Agreement .
Attachment 1 is a chronological list of UnixWare Releases 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.1.1 , 2.0 , 2.1 , 2.1.2 , 7.01 , 7.1 , 7.1.1 , 7.1.1+LKP , MP2 , MP3 , and 7.1.3 ; the same prior UNIX products to which Sun already had a license ; and new device drivers for UnixWare and OpenServer .
Attachment 1 comprises three specified categories of technology .
The first category , " Description of Technology , " lists over two dozen releases of System V to which Sun already had rights under the 1994 Agreement .
The second category , " Description of Technology  Additional Technology , " contains the list of UnixWare Releases , further prior UNIX products to which Sun already had a license , and five releases of System V to which Sun did not already have a license .
The third category , entitled " Description of Technology  Device Drivers , " lists the device drivers .
Of the five releases of System V to which Sun did not already have a license , three are not listed in the APA , which contains the list of products considered " SVRX Licenses . "
Accordingly , under Section 4 , in addition to new SCO products , Sun received a license to two older System V versions and two versions of UnixWare that are considered SVRX in the APA .
In addition to UnixWare source code , Sun purchased drivers that would enable it to enhance the functionality of its Intel - based UNIX offering .
A driver , also known as a device driver , is a file that contains information needed by a program to operate a device such as a hard disk or internet connection .
Without the drivers that work with a particular operating system , a person or company in effect cannot use the operating system for any conventional tasks .
Without 18 the drivers for a hard disk or internet connection , for example , the operating system cannot be used for any task that requires a hard disk or an internet connection .
The drivers are thus a prerequisite for an operating system to have any utility for conventional business purposes .
SCO understood during the negotiations that Sun was particularly interested in having access to SCO 's UnixWare and OpenServer drivers .
Sun did not obtain any right to the delivery of any drivers for any of the old System V products .
Instead ,
Sun obtained the right to the delivery by SCO of all of the " drivers for UnixWare products and OpenServer products for which SCO has the right to license such drivers to third parties . "
Approximately two months after entering into the Agreement , SCO and Sun executed a Clarification of License Grant to UnixWare and OpenServer Drivers ( " Clarification Agreement " ) that detailed the specific drivers that Sun had received under the Agreement .
The Clarification Agreement and its four attachments identify more than five hundred individual source and object code drivers , exclusively relating to UnixWare and OpenServer .
Sun produces and markets a proprietary operating system known as " Solaris . "
Solaris is based on UNIX code versions listed in APA Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , Item VI  i.e. , SVRX .
Sun distributes Solaris without additional royalty obligations to Novell based on Sun 's rights under the 1994 Sun Agreement .
The 1994 Sun Agreement had a 20 - year confidentiality restriction prohibiting Sun from publicly disclosing the licensed source code .
These confidentiality restrictions prevented Sun from publicly releasing or " opensourcing " the Solaris source code .
19 Section 8.1 of the 2003 Sun Agreement provides that " use , reproduction , distribution or disclosure of the Technology or Derivative Matter thereof under any licensing model now known or developed hereafter in Sun 's sole discretion , pursuant to the license granted by SCO herein , shall mean such Technology or Derivative Matter thereof is not Confidential Information to the extent that such Technology is licensed by Sun to a third party without a confidentiality obligation . "
In other words , Section 8.1 permits Sun to unilaterally remove any confidentiality restrictions governing the licensed UNIX code if " such Technology is licensed by Sun to a third party without a confidentiality obligation . "
Section 4 of the Agreement permits
Sun to " use , reproduce , prepare Derivative Matters of , compile , publicly perform , publicly display , demonstrate , market , disclose , make , sell , offer to sell , import and distribute " SCO 's intellectual property in the licensed technology at Sun 's sole discretion , including the licensing of Solaris .
This provision further allows
Sun to sublicense those rights to third parties " through multiple tiers of sublicensees . "
In addition , any license " will be subject to SCO 's copyright interest in the Technology , " provided that Sun has the license grant in Section 4.1 ( a ) and " Sun agrees that Sun will not transfer ownership in any Technology to which Sun does not have an ownership interest . "
After entering into the 2003 Sun Agreement , Sun released an opensource version of its UNIX - based Solaris product , called " OpenSolaris . "
As its name suggests , OpenSolaris is based on Sun 's Solaris operating system , which is in turn based on Novell 's SVRX intellectual property .
Absent the removal of the 1994 Sun Agreement 's confidentiality restrictions , Sun would not have been licensed to publicly release the OpenSolaris source code .
20
The evidence presented at trial established that the 2003 Sun Agreement conveyed substantial rights to the SVRX intellectual property retained by Novell because of Sun 's ability to open source Solaris .
Section 10 of the 2003 Sun Agreement also sets forth SCO 's obligation to indemnify Sun for any claim brought against Sun asserting that the Section 4 licensed technology infringes the rights of any third parties .
Section 10 further provides that if the intellectual property rights in the technology become the subject of a claim of infringement , SCO shall ensure that Sun has the right to continue to use the technology or replace the technology to make it non-infringing .
The provision has not been implicated or applied .
Section 12 of the 2003 Sun Agreement is a release of any claims that either party may have with respect to the licensed technology or any derivative thereof .
Sco also waived claims " with respect to any ' moral ' or equivalent rights " regarding the licensed technology in Section 5.3 .
K. Other SCOsource Licenses SCO entered into SCOsource Licenses with twenty - two companies or individuals ( " Other SCOsource Licenses " ) , for a total revenue of $ 1,156,110 .
These additional SCOsource licenses include : ( 1 ) Written SCOsource licenses with Computer Associates Int'l ; Everyone 's Internet , Ltd. ; HEB ; Questar Corp. ; CDM ; Leggett & Platt Inc. ; Parkhead Systems ; and Siemens AG ( Océ Printing Sys. ) ; ( 2 ) Electronic SCOsource licenses with Denise Evans ; Gotley Nix Evans Pty Ltd. ; John 21 Curtis ; Jose Garcia Rodriguez ; Kellogg Corporation ; Robert Twigg ; Sphinx CST Ltd. ; and Stephen McManus ; and ( 3 ) SCOsource licenses Symphonix ; DTR Business Systems , Inc. ; IMCORP Inc. ; MPA Systems Pty Ltd. ; Synnex Canada Ltd. ; and Seneca Data Distributors Inc. each of whom were acting as distributors of SCOsource licenses .
SCO obtained $ 1,156,110 from the Other SCOsource Licenses , but SCO did not pass through any of the revenue from the Other SCOsource Licenses to Novell .
Though the Other SCOsource License terms differ in certain respects , for the purpose of analyzing the issues before the court , the terms of the SCOsource license with Everyone 's Internet , Ltd. ( " EI " ) are representative of the terms of the agreements entered with each of the entities .
The EI SCOsource license grants , with certain limitations , the " right and license to use . . . SCO IP . " " SCO IP " is then defined as follows : " SCO IP " means the SCO UNIX® - based Code alleged by SCO to be included , embodied , or otherwise utilized in the Operating System .
. . . .
" UNIX - based Code " means any Code or Method that : ( i ) in its literal or non-literal expression , structure , format , use , functionality or adaptation ( ii ) is based on , developed in , derived from or is similar to ( iii ) any Code contained in or Method devised or developed in ( iv ) UNIX System V or UnixWare® , or ( v ) any modification or derivative work based on or licensed under UNIX System V or UnixWare .
SCO acknowledges that the central feature of the other SCOsource Agreements is the 22 covenant not to sue and the waiver of claims by SCO for the companies ' internal Linux usage .
There was testimony at trial that the SCOsource license agreements differed from traditional licenses because they did not involve product .
As noted above , SCO 's complaint about " companies ' internal Linux usage " was in fact a complaint that those companies were using the UNIX code that SCO claims is in Linux .
SCO has not identified any unique SCO UnixWare code in Linux supposedly released or waived by the Other SCOsource Licenses .
However , there was testimony at trial that SCO was concerned with infringement of UnixWare and OpenServer .
L. Novell 's Communications to SCO
Novell sent several letters to SCO in an attempt to gain information regarding the licenses SCO was entering into during 2003 .
On June 24 , 2003 , Novell 's General Counsel wrote to SCO requesting information regarding two license agreements SCO had identified in securities filings .
The letter asserted Novell 's rights under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA and Amendment No. 2 to the APA and stated that SCO 's actions regarding the licenses referenced in the securities filings could not be reconciled with Novell 's rights under those APA provisions .
In July 2003 , Novell also notified SCO that it intended to conduct an audit in August of 2003 .
In November of 2003 , Novell sought documents from SCO relating to amendments and modifications of SVRX Licenses , specifically copies of the Sun and Microsoft Agreements , as well as any new SVRX Licenses .
SCO did not provide Novell with the requested documentation , and Novell was required to again request the information in December of 2003 .
Novell did not receive a response from SCO with respect to its June 24 , 2003 letter until 23 February 5 , 2004 .
SCO asserted in its letter that the 2003 Sun Agreement did not fall under the APA or its amendments and that the Microsoft Agreement was a new agreement not covered by the APA .
SCO , however , did not provide Novell with copies of the agreements .
Novell responded on March 1 , 2004 , stating that from its review of the " Intellectual Property License " on SCO 's website , the licenses appeared to be SVRX Licenses .
Novell again requested a response from SCO in April of 2004 , but still did not receive a response from SCO .
At that time , this litigation had commenced .
Novell did not receive copies of the Sun or Microsoft Agreements until they were produced in discovery during this litigation .
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW A. Burden of Proof
The parties disagree as to the appropriate burden of proof in this trial of the remaining claims in the case .
The remaining claims heard at trial consist of Novell 's counterclaims for declaratory judgment , unjust enrichment , breach of fiduciary duty , and conversion .
SCO asserts that Novell has the burden of proof because Novell is the party asserting the counterclaims .
Novell , however , contends that SCO has the burden to establish the amounts it owes Novell because this court has already determined that SCO has breached its fiduciary duties to Novell .
Under California law , the general rule is that a counterclaim plaintiff bears the burden of proving the elements of its counterclaims .
Section 500 of the California Evidence Code states : " Except as otherwise provided by law , a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting . "
Cal. Evid .
Code § 500 . 24
In general , a plaintiff has the burden of proving the amount of unjust enrichment , Foerstel v. Jeffrey , No. B154638 , 2003 WL 170418 , at * 2 n.2 ( Cal. App. Jan. 27 , 2003 ) , the fact and amount of damages on a breach of fiduciary duty or conversion , In re Marriage of Kapczynski , No. H025433 , 2004 WL 1119735 , at * 7 ( Cal. App. May 20 , 2004 ) ( breach of fiduciary duty ) , In re Cruz , 198 B.R. 330 ( Bkrtcy .
S.D. Cal. 1996 ) ( conversion ) , and the propriety of a requested declaratory judgment , Benitec Australia , Ltd. v. Nucleonics , Inc. , 2007 WL 2069646 , at * 2 ( Fed. Cir. July 20 , 2007 ) .
" On rare occasions , the courts have altered the normal allocation of the burden of proof . . . .
But the exceptions are few and narrow . "
Sargent Fletcher Inc. v. Able Corp. , 110 Cal App. 4th 1658 , 1670 ( 2003 ) .
Under California law , " where a fiduciary has a legal duty to allocate receipts between those in which its beneficiary has some interest and those in which the beneficiary has none , and is fully and singularly capable of making that allocation but fails to do so , a court is justified in calling upon the fiduciary to bear the burden of differentiation at trial . "
Rosenfeld , Meyer & Susman v. Cohen , 191 Cal. App. 3d 1035 , 1051 - 52 ( 1987 ) ; Kennard v. Glick , 183 Cal. App. 2d 246 , 250-51 ( 1960 )
( " An agent who fails to keep an account raises thereby a suspicion of infidelity or neglect , creates a presumption against himself , and brings upon himself the burden of accounting to the utmost for all that has come into his hands ; and in such case every doubt will be resolved against the agent , and in favor of the principal . . . . " ) .
This rule is well established when it comes to accounting for copyright royalties and in other contexts as well : [ T ] he defendants must be content to accept much of 25 the embarrassment resulting from mingling the plaintiff 's property with their own .
. . .
[ W ]e must make an award which by no possibility shall be too small .
It is not our best guess that must prevail , but a figure which will favor the plaintiffs in every reasonable chance of error .
Sheldon v. Metro- Goldwyn Pictures Corp. , 106 F.2d 45 , 51 ( 2d Cir. 1939 ) ; see also Kim v. Fujikawa , 871 F.2d 1427 , 1430-31 ( 9th Cir. 1989 ) ( " In determining the amount that a breaching fiduciary must restore to the Funds as a result of a prohibited transaction , the court should resolve doubts in favor of the plaintiffs " ( internal quotation and citation omitted ) ) ; Donovan v. Bierwirth , 754 F.2d 1049 , 1056 ( 2d Cir. 1985 ) ( " The burden of proving that the funds would have earned less than that amount is on the fiduciaries found to be in breach of their duty .
Any doubt or ambiguity should be resolved against them .
. . .
This is nothing more than application of the principle that , once a breach of trust is established , uncertainties in fixing damages will be resolved against the wrongdoer . " ) ; Leigh v. Engle , 727 F.2d 113 , 138-39 ( 7th Cir. 1984 ) ( " [ T ] he burden is on the defendants who are found to have breached their fiduciary duties to show which profits are attributable to their own investments apart from their control of the Reliable Trust assets . . . .
[ W ] hile the district court may be able to make only a rough approximation , it should resolve doubts in favor of the plaintiffs . " ) .
In this case , the APA required SCO to account for SVRX Royalties , even in the circumstances where SCO was entitled to keep 100 % of those Royalties .
The APA also required SCO to obtain Novell 's prior written approval before amending , modifying , or waiving any right under any SVRX License .
These provisions were intended , among other things , to further 26 SCO 's duties as Novell 's agent to account for and remit SVRX Royalties .
SCO takes issue with Novell 's reliance on breach of fiduciary cases because these cases are based on the premise that a trustee has gained some advantage over its beneficiary in a transaction between them .
Whereas , in this case , the transactions at issue are not ones between SCO and Novell .
SCO 's argument , however , fails to acknowledge that its fiduciary responsibilities under the APA were based on accurately accounting for such third - party transactions and SCO was in an advantageous position with respect to accounting for its third - party transactions .
SCO is correct , however , that the APA contemplated that SCO would enter into agreements that commingle an SVRX License when it is incidental to a UnixWare license .
In such situations , however , the APA appears to still require SCO to account for those licenses and demonstrate that the SVRX portion is only incidental .
In those instances , SCO has advantageous information as to whether the SVRX license is incidental .
Because Novell was not in a position to make such determinations , SCO had a duty to properly fulfill its fiduciary accounting obligations under the APA .
The court has already found that SCO breached its fiduciary duty in not properly reporting SVRX revenues under the APA .
Because of such breach , the court concludes that SCO has the burden of differentiating royalties properly retained by SCO from SVRX Royalties that SCO improperly retained .
SCO has the burden of demonstrating the proper allocation of SVRX Royalties .
The court recognizes , however , that additional issues are asserted in this trial that were 27 not raised or a part of the prior summary judgment motions or the court 's summary judgment order .
The court concludes that the issue of whether SCOsource licenses were SVRX Licenses under the APA is an issue on which Novell retains the burden of proof .
It is not an issue that involves a breach of a fiduciary duty and SCO is not in an advantageous position with respect to facts weighing on that determination .
If those licenses are determined to be SVRX Licenses under the APA , then SCO has the burden of establishing the proper allocation of SVRX Royalties under such licenses because it is a part of its fiduciary duty .
Similarly , Novell retains the burden of proof on the issue of whether SCO had the authority under the APA , as amended , to enter into additional or amended SVRX licenses .
Again , this declaratory judgment issue is not one in which SCO would have obtained any kind of advantageous position .
B. SCOsource Licensing Agreements
Separate from its licensing of products , SCO began entering into SCOsource licensing agreements that were unique in that they did not involve product .
Instead , these license agreements were waivers and releases of conduct based on the buyer 's use of Linux .
Provisions of the 2003 Sun and Microsoft Agreements are such SCOsource licenses .
SCO also entered into twenty - two other SCOsource licenses .
In determining whether the SCOsource Agreements constitute SVRX Licenses , the court must look to the terms of the agreements and the provisions of the APA .
The central features of the SCOsource agreements are a covenant not to sue and a waiver of claims by SCO for the buyer 's internal Linux usage .
The agreements grant rights and a license to use SCO IP .
" SCO IP " is defined as SCO UNIX - based code , and " UNIX - based Code " is 28 defined to mean " UNIX System V or UnixWare , or ( v ) any modification or derivative work based on or licensed under UNIX System V or UnixWare . "
The purpose of these licenses was to excuse the licensee 's purported infringement of SCO's IP .
SCO IP is defined in the agreements to include UNIX System V , which would appear to include SVRX .
But given the terms of the amended APA between Novell and SCO , as this court has previously ruled , the SVRX copyrights did not transfer to SCO .
Therefore , SCO IP cannot include SVRX and can only mean SCO UnixWare .
Although Novell asserts that these provisions should be viewed as a license because a license insulates a party from liability , the release terms of the SCOsource agreements , including Section 2 of the Microsoft Agreement and Section 12 of the 2003 Sun Agreement , are not licenses to product .
Unlike the licenses to products included under the APA , these releases are not royalty - bearing SVRX Licenses .
SVRX Licenses involved in the APA gave licensees rights to use and modify SVRX code to create royalty - bearing UNIX derivatives .
SCOsource licenses did not grant a right to use or modify any UNIX source code to create such derivatives .
SCOsource agreements did not give any licensee the right to use any UNIX IP apart from binary code in Linux .
The agreements are only releases of claims that SCO was entitled to bring .
Under the APA , SCO received all of Novell 's " claims arising after the Closing Date against any parties relating to any right , property or asset included in the Business . "
The " Business " is defined as " the business of developing a line of software products currently known as Unix and UnixWare , the sale of binary and source code licenses to various versions of Unix and UnixWare , the support of such products and the sale of other products which are directly 29 related to Unix and UnixWare . "
Based on this court 's ruling that SVRX copyrights were not included in the assets comprising the Business that was transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz , SCO could not enter into any release for copyright infringement of SVRX technologies .
But SCO did receive some ownership rights and it was authorized to release whatever claims its was to entitled bring concerning those ownership rights .
There was evidence presented at trial that SCO was concerned with whether technology from its releases of UnixWare and OpenServer was improperly in Linux .
UnixWare and OpenServer are both UNIX System V operating systems .
SCO 's July 2003 press release regarding SCOsource agreements states SCOsource Agreements are UnixWare licenses and the hold harmless clauses are incidental to a UnixWare license .
In the SCOsource program , the pricing of a SCOsource license was set as the same as SCO 's pricing for a UnixWare binary license .
This pricing is consistent with SCO 's use of the " one line of code " rule and practice of not charging additional amounts for the prior products listed in a license for the latest release .
It also demonstrates that SCO believed that the SCOsource license had a value equivalent to a binary license to its most recent release of UnixWare .
Therefore , there was evidence that the SCOsource program was not solely focused on older System V technology .
The court agrees with what SCO 's counsel stated in his opening arguments :
If SCO had less to release , it just means that the buyer got less for its money .
The claims SCO released in its SCOsource licenses were only those claims SCO was entitled to bring .
The Agreements do not encompass claims Novell would be entitled to bring based on its ownership of the SVRX 30 copyrights .
The court , however , does not agree that there was evidence at trial that established either way whether the buyer of a SCOsource license was completely protected because all of the old technology was part of UnixWare .
There was no definitive evidence on this point and the issue of whether a buyer would be fully protected by a SCOsource license is not before the court .
Because the SCOsource licenses cannot be construed to include a release of SVRX copyright infringement , the court does not find the licenses to be SVRX Licenses that generated SVRX Royalties to Novell under the APA .
SCO could not release Novell 's rights to claims based on its ownership of the SVRX copyrights .
Even if the releases contained in the SCOsource Agreements were considered SVRX Licenses , there is no value in the agreements with respect to Novell 's SVRX interests .
As such , Novell has no entitlement to monies SCO received with respect to a release of only SCO 's rights .
The value of those SCOsource releases is a matter between SCO and the parties who entered into such releases .
In addition , because the court concludes that the releases in the SCOsource Licenses were not SVRX Licenses , SCO had authority to execute the agreements .
C. 2003 Microsoft Agreement
As discussed above in connection with the Other SCOsource Licenses , the court determines that the release of claims and license in Section 2 of the Microsoft Agreement was not an SVRX License that generated SVRX Royalties .
The release in Section 2 does not specify any technology and the license in Section 2 refers only to SCO Intellectual Property .
Therefore , as discussed above , the court concludes that this provision did not waive claims or grant a license to SVRX because SCO could not release or waive Novell 's claims or rights in the SVRX 31 copyrights .
The Microsoft Agreement , however , contained other provisions involving SVRX technology .
Therefore , the agreement is an SVRX License because it involves SVRX at least in part .
Section 4 of Microsoft Agreement is an option to license UnixWare , OpenServer , and other SVRX for $ 8.25 million .
This amount is half the price of the whole agreement .
The Microsoft Agreement was a new SVRX License which § 4.16 of the amended APA prohibits SCO from entering into unless it is " incidentally involved through its rights to sell and license Unixware . "
The question , therefore , is whether the SVRX rights under Section 4 of the Microsoft Agreement are granted incidental to UnixWare .
Neither the APA nor its Amendments define the word incidentally .
The term , however , is generally defined to mean a minor accompaniment or something of a subordinate nature .
The parties agree as to the general definition of incidental .
Novell contends that in applying the term incidental to the agreement at hand , the court should not look to the parties ' historical practice with respect to licensing because extrinsic evidence is unnecessary .
The court , however , must consider all relevant facts to determine whether the license to SVRX technology was incidental to UnixWare .
In addition , to the extent that the extrinsic evidence supports the general definition of the term incidental , the evidence is admissible under California contract interpretation law .
In licensing products , SCO adopted Novell 's practice of including all prior products in the license .
After the APA , SCO entered into new UnixWare licenses but had very limited rights with respect to SVRX licenses .
The testimony at trial established that SCO included SVRX 32 products as prior products in SCO UnixWare licenses .
When such prior products were listed in the UnixWare license , it did not change the price paid for the most recent version of UnixWare .
SCO presented evidence of specific licenses entered at relatively the same time between two different companies .
One company received all of the prior products listed in the license and the other company had no prior products listed .
The parties , however , paid the same amount for their licenses .
Novell had also licensed UNIX and UnixWare using this procedure .
UNIX licensees often distributed and used products based on code from multiple releases of System V , including UnixWare .
Novell and its successors required such licensees to pay only one set of royalties for the use or distribution of such a product .
Under the " one line of code " rule , Novell and its successors required licensees to identify code from the latest release of System V contained in a product -- even if there was as little as one line of code contained in that license  and calculate royalty payments for that entire product under only that latest license .
SCO 's witnesses further testified that there was not a market for a license to prior SVRX products because those prior products no longer utilized the most current hardware .
SCO witnesses testified that they did not market or sell any prior SVRX product in a stand alone license .
The court finds that the term incidental as used in the APA is referring to the practice of Novell and SCO to list prior products in licenses for the newest release and charge only for the license to the newest release .
Under the APA , SCO had the authority to enter into SVRX licenses that were incidental to UnixWare , and the court finds that the SVRX licensing in Section 33 4 of the Microsoft Agreement was incidental to a UnixWare license .
Accordingly , the court concludes that Novell is not entitled to any of the revenue SCO received under the 2003 Microsoft Agreement .
D. 2003 Sun Agreement
The 2003 Sun Agreement increases
Sun 's rights to at least 30 versions of SVRX products provided in Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) of the APA and gives Sun broad rights to several versions of SVRX .
The 2003 Sun Agreement is an SVRX License .
Section 12 of the Sun Agreement is a release and waiver provision similar to the Other SCOsource Licenses .
As with those licenses , the court finds that the provision does not release Novell 's claims based on its ownership of the SVRX copyrights , and thus does not implicate SVRX technology and cannot be the basis for SVRX Royalties .
Section 4 of the Sun Agreement is a license to UnixWare and prior SVRX products .
Although this section provides a license to prior SVRX products to which Sun did not previously have a right to under its 1994 Agreement with Novell , the court concludes that this section 's inclusion of SVRX as prior products is only incidental to a license to the most recent version of SCO 's UnixWare .
Accordingly , Novell is not entitled to revenue attributable to this section of the Sun Agreement .
Section 8.1 of the Sun Agreement , however , lifts the confidentiality provisions with respect to 30 versions of SVRX technology granted to Sun under its 1994 Buy - out Agreement with Novell .
Under Section 4.16 of the amended APA , SCO can only amend an SVRX license if it is 34 done incidentally to its licensing of UnixWare .
Also , Section B of Amendment No. 2 to the APA provides that before entering into any potential transaction with an SVRX licensee which " concerns " a buy - out of any such licensee 's royalty obligations , SCO must obtain Novell 's consent .
This provision requires either party who even " become[s ] aware of any such potential transaction " to immediately notify the other in writing .
The provision further requires that any negotiations with the licensee be attended by both parties , and that both parties consent to any such transaction .
There are no exceptions to this provision .
The 2003 Sun Agreement specifically states that it " amends and restates " Sun 's 1994 SVRX buy - out agreement with Novell .
SCO has no authority to enter such an agreement unless it is incidentally involved in the licensing of UnixWare .
The court concludes that the release of confidentiality requirements in Section 8.1 of the 2003 Sun Agreement is not merely incidental to a UnixWare license .
The provision had significant independent value to Sun as it allowed Sun to opensource its Solaris UNIX - based product .
While several of the provisions in the Agreement focus on UnixWare and specific device drivers , the amendment with respect to confidentiality relates to the same technology licensed in the 1994 Buy - out Agreement and had significant independent value to Sun apart from a license to the newest versions of UnixWare .
SCO argues that Section B of Amendment No. 2 to the APA relates only to future buyout transactions , but the language of the provision broadly states that it relates to any potential transaction that " concerns a buy - out of any such licensee 's royalty obligations . "
This provision refers to any transaction that " concerns " a buyout , not just buy - outs .
SCO 's interpretation would 35 allow SCO to unilaterally amend any buy - out agreement negotiated by all the parties if it wanted to re-negotiate more favorable terms to itself .
Even if there is testimony about the parties focusing on future buy - outs , it does not change the fact that Amendment No. 2 was drafted more broadly .
In the 2003 Sun Agreement , SCO renegotiated a contract and expanded Sun 's rights to technology still owned by Novell .
And , SCO improperly received the money for granting such rights even though those rights remained with Novell .
There is no dispute that Sun 's 1994 Agreement with Novell was a " buy - out " of Sun 's SVRX royalty obligations as that term is used in Amendment No. 2 . Sun 's 2003
Agreement explicitly acknowledges that it is intended to " amend and restate " the 1994 buy - out agreement , including expansion of Sun 's existing license rights to permit opensource licensing of SVRX code .
The Court concludes that Sun 's 2003 Agreement License , therefore , " concerns " a buy - out , and SCO was required to follow the additional restrictions imposed by Amendment No. 2 on transactions that concern buy - outs .
SCO did not comply with these terms .
The Court thus concludes and declares that SCO was without authority to enter into the 2003 Sun Agreement under Amendment 2 , Section B , of the APA .
SCO cites to agency law to argue that if an agreement was executed without authority and Novell has not approved it , then the contract must be set aside and Novell is not entitled to any revenues .
Agency law precludes a principal from accepting benefits of an agent 's actions while simultaneously disclaiming the agent 's authority to act .
In addition , SCO argues that in the case of an invalid contract , a counterparty who made payments is entitled to the restitution of those payments .
36 This case law , however , does not apply to the 2003 Sun Agreement .
The cases cited by SCO involve situations where the agent already properly remitted the fruits to its principal and the dispute was whether the principal was required to return the fruits to the third party .
None of the cases hold that , where an agent improperly takes money from third parties in the principal 's name , the agent is entitled to keep that money if the principal disclaims the agent 's authority .
In this case , Sun obtained the rights to opensource Solaris , and SCO received the revenue for granting such rights even though such rights remained with Novell .
If the court were to declare that the contract was void and should be set aside , the court could not return the parties to the same position they were in prior to the 2003 Agreement .
Sun has already received the benefits of the agreement and developed and marketed a product based on those benefits .
There was also evidence at trial that OpenSolaris directly competed with Novell 's interest .
The court , therefore , cannot merely void the contract .
Had SCO sought Novell 's involvement in the amendment of the 1994 Agreement , Novell and SCO would have negotiated a suitable division of the royalties .
1 ) Breach of Fiduciary Duty Because California law governs actions arising from the APA , and Novell 's claims arise from the agency relationship created by the APA , California law governs .
Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Super. Ct. , 3 Cal. 4th 459 , 468 , 470 ( 1992 ) .
To establish a breach of fiduciary duty under California law , Novell must show " the existence of a fiduciary relationship , its breach , and damages proximately caused by that breach . "
Roberts v. Lomanto , 112 Cal. App. 4th 1553 , 1562 ( 2003 ) ( internal quotation and citation omitted ) .
As Novell 's agent for purposes of the SVRX 37 Royalties , SCO owed Novell a fiduciary duty .
The Court concludes that SCO breached its fiduciary duties to Novell by failing to notify Novell and account for and remit the revenue it received from Sun as a result of modifying the confidentiality provisions of Sun's SVRX buy - out agreement with Novell .
2 ) Conversion
A conversion claim is based on " the wrongful exercise of dominion over another 's personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights in the property . "
Kasdan , Simonds , McIntyre , Epstein & Martin v. World Sav. & Loan Ass.n , 317 F.3d 1064 , 1069 ( 9th Cir. 2003 ) .
To establish conversion , therefore , Novell must establish : ( 1 ) its " ownership or right to possession of the property " ; ( 2 ) SCO 's " conversion by wrongful act inconsistent with the property rights of the plaintiff ; and ( 3 ) damages . "
Id .
Novell held equitable title to the SVRX Royalties under the APA .
SCO 's failure to pass through to Novell the SVRX Royalties due under the Sun Agreement was a wrongful act inconsistent with Novell 's rights .
The Court concludes that Novell has established SCO 's conversion of the revenues due under the 2003 Sun Agreement .
3 ) Unjust Enrichment SCO was unjustly enriched by retention of the revenue under the Sun Agreement and Novell is entitled to restitution .
Unjust enrichment is measured as the benefit the defendant wrongfully received at the expense of the plaintiff .
First Nationwide Sav. v. Perry , 11 Cal. App. 4th 1657 , 1662 ( 1992 ) ; Morlife , Inc. v. Perry , 56 Cal. App. 4th 1514 , 1528 -29 ( 1997 ) .
Here , SCO was unjustly enriched by retaining the revenues Sun agreed to pay to relax and 38 amend the confidentiality provisions of the 1994 Agreement .
4 ) SCO 's Affirmative Equitable Defenses
The Court has considered SCO 's equitable defenses and finds them without merit .
SCO raised estoppel as an affirmative defense .
Estoppel arises out of the rule that " [ w ] henever a party has , by his own statement or conduct , intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief , he is not , in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct , permitted to contradict it . "
Cal. Evid .
Code § 623 .
To make out estoppel , " four elements must be present . . . ( 1 ) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts ; ( 2 ) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon , or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended ; ( 3 ) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts ; and ( 4 ) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury . "
Lentz v. McMahon , 49 Cal. 3d 393 , 399 ( 1989 ) .
To prevail on its estoppel claim , therefore , SCO would have to have shown that Novell knew whether and to what extent SCO collected but did not remit SVRX Royalties , that Novell failed to seek such Royalties and intended for that failure to be taken by SCO as indication it could keep the money , and that SCO relied on Novell to SCO 's injury .
The Court concludes that SCO cannot make out any element of its estoppel defense .
SCO had an obligation to keep Novell apprised of the facts concerning SVRX Licenses and failed to do so .
Novell repeatedly demanded audits and accounting of the 2003 Sun and Microsoft Agreements .
SCO introduced evidence it claims shows that Novell was silent when SCO withheld 39 SVRX Royalties in connection with a 1996 audit .
At best , this evidence showed that Novell said nothing when SCO licensed SVRX incidentally .
That is not sufficient to estop Novell from contesting an SVRX License that conveys greater - than - incidental rights .
Even were the evidence otherwise , courts typically require a duty to speak before imparting preclusive effect to silence .
See , e.g. , Feduniak v. Cal. Coastal Comm'n , 148 Cal. App. 4th 1346 , 1362 ( 2007 )
( " It is settled that when the party to be estopped does not say or do anything , its silence and inaction may support estoppel only if it had a duty to speak or act under the particular circumstances . " ) .
In fiduciary relationships , where the presumption is that the principal need not investigate the activities of its agent and can instead rely on the agent to fulfill its duties faithfully , there is no such duty .
Hobbs v. Bateman Eichler , Hill Richards , Inc. , 164 Cal. App. 3d 174 , 201-02 ( 1985 ) ( " Where there is a fiduciary relationship , the usual duty of diligence to discover facts does not exist . " ) .
The Court concludes that Novell is not estopped to pursue its claims to SVRX Royalties .
SCO also raised " unclean hands " as an affirmative defense .
The doctrine of unclean hands , as partially codified in California Civil Code Section 3517 , provides that " [ n] o one can take advantage of his own wrong . "
See , e.g. , Rosenfeld v. Zimmer , 116 Cal. App. 2d 719 , 722 ( 1953 ) ( " A court of equity will not assist a party to a fraudulent scheme to secure the objective of such plan . " ) ;
Reynolds v. Roll , 122 Cal. App. 2d 826 , 836 ( 1954 ) ( " courts will not lend assistance to persons whose claim for relief rests on an illegal transaction " ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) ) .
Even where such conduct is shown , it must be part of the same transaction at issue , and 40 the nature of the plaintiff 's conduct must be worse than that of the defendant .
See , e.g. , Watson v. Poore , 18 Cal. 2d 302 , 313 ( 1941 ) ( " [ I ] mproper conduct not necessarily connected with the transaction particularly involved . . . is not a reason for denying equitable relief on the ground of unclean hands . " ) ;
Belling v. Croter , 57 Cal. App. 2d 296 , 304 ( 1943 ) ( unclean hands does not apply " if it be shown that [ the plaintiff ] is the one ' least at fault , ' and that the party against whom relief is sought was guilty of wrongdoing in respect to the same matters and is ' most in fault ' " ) .
SCO has not shown any conduct by Novell that was in bad faith or wrongful .
The Court thus concludes that these affirmative equitable defenses do not preclude Novell from receiving equitable relief .
5 ) Allocation of Revenues to Novell
The court , therefore , concludes that Novell is entitled to the revenues paid by Sun under the 2003 Sun Agreement attributable to the release of the SVRX confidentiality provision in the 1994 Agreement .
While the parties debated the value of this provision at trial , neither established a specific value for this particular provision .
Nonetheless , the court believes it is appropriate and equitable to grant monetary relief in favor of Novell .
SCO contended that , for a variety of reasons , Novell is not entitled to both monetary and declaratory relief .
The Court was not persuaded by any of these arguments with respect to the 2003 Sun Agreement .
Under the 2003 Sun Agreement , SCO received from Sun a total amount of $ 9,143,451 .
The court concludes that the release provision in Section 12 of the Sun Agreement is worth an equivalent amount to the similar release provision in the Microsoft Agreement , or $ 1.5 million .
41 The remaining portions of the Agreement is divided between the UnixWare license , the associated UnixWare and OpenServer drivers , and the release of the confidentiality provisions contained in the 1994 Agreement .
Because SCO bears the burden of allocation on this issue and the law recognizes that the court is to resolve every doubt against the agent and in favor of the principal , the court divides the remaining portions of the Agreement equally .
Therefore , Novell is entitled to one - third of $ 7,643,451 , or $ 2,547,817 as revenues paid by Sun under the 2003 Sun Agreement attributable to the release of the SVRX confidentiality provision in the 1994 Agreement .
6 ) Prejudgment Interest Novell is directed to file a brief within 15 days of this Order describing what , if any , prejudgment interest Novell seeks based on the amount awarded in this Order .
At its option , SCO may then file within 10 days a brief opposing Novell 's request for prejudgment interest .
Novell may file a reply within 7 days in further support of its claim for prejudgment interest .
This briefing shall not affect the deadlines to file requests for costs or attorneys ' fees , which , pursuant to District of Utah Local Rule 54 - 2 , shall run from the entry of final judgment .
ORDER
After considering all of the evidence and the law as it applies to this case , the court awards Defendant and Counterclaimant Novell $ 2,547,817 on its Sixth , Seventh , and Eighth Claims for Unjust Enrichment , Breach of Fiduciary Duty , and Conversion .
On Novell 's Fourth Claim for Relief , for the reasons stated above , the court concludes that SCO was entitled to enter into the 2003 Microsoft Agreement and the Other SCOsource Licenses , but was not authorized to 42 enter into the 2003 Sun Agreement based on its amendment of the provisions concerning Sun 's SVRX confidentiality requirements under the 1994 Agreement .
Novell is directed to file within ten days from the date of this order a Final Judgment consistent with these Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order , the court 's August 10 , 2007 Memorandum Decision and Order , and the parties ' stipulations with respect to the disposition of certain causes of action .
See Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 58 ( " Every judgment and amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document " ) ; United States v. Clearfield State Bank , 497 F.2d 356 , 359 ( 10th Cir. 1974 ) ( interpreting Rule 58 to " require that there be a judgment set out on a separate document  distinct from any opinion or memorandum  which provides the basis for the entry of judgment " ) .
DATED this 16th day of July , 2008 .
BY THE COURT :
( signature )
DALE A. KIMBALL
United States District Judge 1
The parties have , both in motion papers and at trial , disputed the precise contours of the terms " SVRX , " " System V , " " UnixWare , " and other , related terms .
Without passing on how those terms may have been used in any particular document , in this Order , the court will use the term " SVRX " to refer to the versions of UNIX listed in the APA ( Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , Item VI ) , as to which SCO is under a fiduciary obligation to remit royalties to Novell .
The Court will use the term " SCO UnixWare " to refer to the versions of UNIX developed by SCO subsequent to the APA , as to which SCO is entitled to retain revenue subject to certain limitations not at issue here .
The Court uses the term " UNIX " broadly to apply to all versions of that operating system .

The inhabitants of the Danish island of Samsø have achieved their target of self - sufficiency in renewable power in only 10 years .
Eleven wind turbines now tower over green fields and 10 rise from the North Sea .
Rye , wheat and straw are used to heat the one - story buildings .
Solar panels have sprouted on roof tiles , reports Planet Ark .
Samsø is home to just 4,000 people .
Yet without any construction subsidies , the islanders have invested $ 84 million of their own money .
That ’s $ 20,000 per person on average .
It ’s a challenge their government set for the island in 1997 , funded largely through local taxes and individual investments .
Outside magazine calls it a muscular combination of new technologies , capitalist smarts , and old - school stewardship .
Some residents homes have opted to stay with oil furnaces for heating .
Cars are still common .
Yet the island has become carbon neutral because the wind turbines offset emissions from cars and oil furnaces .
From the Reuters report :
The islanders ’ efforts dovetail with European Union policy but have gone much further than official targets .
The European Union has committed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a fifth by 2020 from 1990 levels , and to get one - fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources such as wind , solar and biomass .
Some islanders say the renewables project has been helped by developing as a grassroots venture rather than having targets and regulations imposed by a bureaucracy .
“ First of all you need determination and can - do spirit , and then you need an economic foundation to make it possible , ” Tranberg told Reuters in the cockpit of his wind turbine .
Many islanders own shares in the onshore wind turbines , an investment that they originally hoped would pay back after eight to 10 years .
A stronger - than - expected wind — blowing 10 - 15 percent more force than expected into the blades — cut the payback time and now Samsø Energy Academy says a share in a wind turbine generates about $ 100 a year in income .
Proof we do n’t face the labors of Hercules to retool our energy economy .
And we do n’t need to go broke doing it .
But , seriously , can the people of Samsø come here and run our world for a while ?

A federal district judge appointed by President George W. Bush to
the bench has done the right thing , ruling definitively this morning
that the President ’s claim of absolute immunity for his advisors from
Congressional oversight and subpoena is “ entirely unsupported by
existing case law . ”
The ruling , by Judge John Bates , is as important as much because of
who issued it as it is for its impact upon Congressional investigations
into presidential wrongdoing .
Certainly the ruling will open the way for Democrats in Congress to
move harder to investigate the abuses of the current administration ,
which have been stymied by administration refusal to provide witnesses ,
even to come in and plead the Fifth Amendment protection against
self - incrimination .
In the specific case under consideration here , the House Judiciary
Committee had been attempting to force the appearance of Josh Bolton ,
the president ’s former chief of staff , and Harriet Miers , former White
House legal counsel , to testify about the White House role in the
firing of a number of federal prosecutors around the country who were
reportedly deemed insufficiently political in their unwillingness to
“ go after ” Democratic elected officials , or to interfere with the
election process .
Bush had asserted that all such aides have blanket immunity from
Congressional inquiry under the concept of “ executive privilege . ”
But Judge Bates disagreed , saying that the White House had failed
to show a single case in which the courts had held White House aides to
be immune from Congressional subpoenas .
In a strongly - worded 93 - page
ruling , he not only said that no such blanket immunity existed , and
that aides had to respond to congressional subpoenaes .
He also ordered
that the White House must hand over requested documents — something that
the White House for both of the president ’s two terms , has been
unwilling to do .
Of course , it is a certainty that the Bush administration will
appeal Judge Bates ’ ruling to a higher court , and the process could end
up dragging on beyond the end of Bush ’s term of office , which ends on
Jan. 20 .
But with this ruling , Congress should feel much more confident
about going after those , like Miers , Bolton , Karl Rove ( recently cited
for contempt of Congress himself ) and others , who refuse orders to
appear and testify .
Congress should also be more willing to consider
using its own power of inherent contempt to go after such witnesses by
having their own officers arrest and jail recalcitrants .
The other important thing about Judge Bates ’ ruling is that it
suggests , happily , that there are principled Republicans , even among
the slew of so - called conservative “ constructionist ” judges that Bush
has been larding the federal bench with , from the district level to the
Supreme Court .
At least some of these judges , apparently , once
confirmed in their lifetime offices , do take their oaths of office to
uphold the Constitution seriously .
Judge Bates ( who , though I did n’t
know him personally , attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut at the
same time I did , graduating in 1968 ) worked as a deputy independent
counsel in the Whitewater Investigation of President Bill Clinton ,
which was an obvious political plus in his gaining a federal judgeship
nomination by the Bush White House .
In 2006 he was also appointed by
Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the secret Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court that is supposed to oversee domestic spying
activities of the National Security Agency .
I am assuming the best of Judge Bates , i.e. that he ruled based on
his reading of the Constitution and court precedent .
But of course it
could also be that this ruling is a sign that Bush judicial appointees
are reading the political handwriting on the wall : that the Bush era of
seeking to aggrandize absolute executive power is coming to an end .
With the president ’s public support dwindling to just 21 percent , and
with all signs pointing to a big Democratic win in upcoming
Congressional elections , not to mention a possible Democratic president
in the White House this November , we may start to see at least some
Bush - appointed judges concluding that supinely acceding to the wishes
of the Bush / Cheney White House may not be the wisest career move for
anyone hoping to move up to a higher court .
Whatever the reasons for this important decision , I commend Judge
Bates for upholding the Constitution , and its all - important
establishment of three separate , co-equal branches of government .
Now if only Democrats in Congress would do the same thing .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures climbed to unprecedented levels Thursday , as weakness in the U.S. dollar , influenced by the U.S. Federal Reserve 's decision to stand pat on interest rates , sent prices to a peak above $ 140 a barrel .
Comments from OPEC 's president warning of higher oil prices because of the dollar 's decline as well as reports that Libya threatened to cut crude output , helped bolster energy prices .
Crude oil for August delivery reached a high of $ 140.39 a barrel in electronic trading on Globex as of 3 p.m. Eastern .
The contract closed at a record $ 139.64 on the New York Mercantile Exchange , up $ 5.09 , or 3.8 % , for the session after trading as high as $ 140 .
The Fed is driving weakness in the dollar and that 's driving oil prices higher , said Kevin Kerr , president of Kerr Trading International .
" $ 150 is now very likely , " said Kerr , who 's also editor of MarketWatch 's Global Resources Trader .
“ ' Crude oil is unlikely to face a major correction without a major bottom in the dollar or large cut in global demand . ' ” — Thomas Hartmann , Altavest Worldwide Trading
" Crude oil is unlikely to face a major correction without a major bottom in the dollar or large cut in global demand , " said Thomas Hartmann , an analyst at Altavest Worldwide Trading .
" Inflation appears on track to get ' out of control ' before the situation improves . "
On the currency markets Thursday , the U.S. dollar fell against most of its major rivals .
The dollar index DXY , +0.05 % , which tracks the greenback against other major currencies , was at 72.484 , compared with 72.90 in late North American trading Wednesday , following the Fed 's announcement .
See Currencies .
Dollar - denominated commodities such as crude oil and gold typically benefit from dollar weakness , since that makes them more attractive for holders of other currencies .
Fed , OPEC talk
On Wednesday , in a statement released after the Fed held its target for short - term interest rates steady at 2 % , the central bank sharpened its focus on inflation , saying that the risks posed to the economy by upward pressure on prices have increased .
See full story .
But " the Fed 's decision to not fight inflation is having a direct impact on crude - oil prices , along with many other commodities , " said Hartmann in emailed comments .
Hartmann wonders if the Fed is unaware that the falling dollar is a major contributor to price increases around the globe .
" If so , then the outlook for crude - oil prices is higher , " he said .
U.S. stocks fell sharply Thursday with the blue - chip index marking its worst close since September 2006 after Goldman Sachs Group downgraded U.S. brokers and advised selling shares of General Motors Corp .
See Market Snapshot .
" I can't remember the last time Dow futures in freefall the way they 've been today , " said Dale Doelling , chief market technician at Trends In Commodities .
It 's " an absolute boycott by buyers in stocks and the dollar . "
But " the exact opposite happened in the commodity markets .
You name it , oil corn , gold bonds -- everything up , up and away , " he said in emailed comments .
Also providing support for oil Thursday , Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil , who serves as president of OPEC , said oil prices could jump as high as $ 150 to $ 170 dollars a barrel this summer , according to reports .
However , he thinks crude will fall short of $ 200 a barrel .
At a meeting in Paris , Khelil said a further fall of 1 % to 2 % of the dollar vs. the euro could add another $ 8 a barrel to oil prices .
He cited the weakness of the greenback as a major cause of spiking oil prices .
Also Thursday , Libya threatened to cut oil output because of a U.S. threat to its assets and an assumption that the oil market is oversupplied , according to a report from Bloomberg .
A U.S. law allows terror victims to seize assets of foreign governments as compensation , the report said .
An output cut from Libya , or any other member of OPEC , could offset Saudi Arabia 's planned increases in production , Bloomberg reported .
The Saudis has said it would boost its production to 9.7 million barrels per day beginning in July .

Supply and demand mix
On Wednesday , crude ended lower , but pared its earlier steep losses after the Fed announcement .
Crude prices posted a fall of $ 2.45 , or 1.8 % , on Wednesday after a government report showed that supplies of crude rose unexpectedly for the first time in six weeks and demand for petroleum products had fallen more than 2 % in the past month .
See full story .
On Thursday , prices for petroleum products followed crude prices higher .
July reformulated gasoline rose 11.7 cents to close at $ 3.5113 a gallon and July heating oil gained 13.4 cents to end at $ 3.8834 a gallon .
The average U.S. price for a gallon of regular gasoline was unchanged at $ 4.067
Thursday from a day earlier , but it 's up 36.7 % from a year ago , according to AAA 's Daily Fuel Gauge Report .
In a report released Thursday , AAA said it estimates a decline in the number of Americans traveling during the July 4 holiday travel period -- that 'll be the first time in a decade .
It expects 40.45 million Americans will travel that weekend , down 1.3 % from a year ago .

Natural - gas prices turn up
Prices for natural gas recovered from their earlier lows to close around 3 % higher after the Energy Department reported that natural - gas inventories rose by 90 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 20 .
Global Insight expected the data to show an increase of 89 billion , but analysts at Strategic Energy & Economic Research were looking for a larger 97 billion gain .
July natural gas futures rose 35.2 cents to close at $ 13.105 per million British thermal units , recovering from a low of $ 12.55 .
The contract expired at the close of the day 's trading , likely adding to market volatility .
August natural gas closed at $ 13.248 , up 38.2 cents .
" Unless there is substantial improvement in the inventory situation or oil prices fall dramatically , natural - gas prices will stay near their current levels over the next few weeks , " said Patrick Armstrong , an assistant economist at Moody 's Economy.com , in a weekly report .
Total stocks now stand at 2.033 trillion cubic feet , down 382 billion cubic feet from the year - ago level and 56 billion cubic feet below the five - year average , the government data said .
Meanwhile , energy equities finished lower .
The Philadelphia Oil Service Index OSX , - 2.83 % closed down 0.4 % .

I had a very introspective , mildly depressive Independence Day Weekend .
That 's not to say thatand her roommate did n't do a wonderful job of hosting a barbecue and evening of shooting off fireworks to celebrate my upcoming birthday , and I appreciate it , and I had a good time .
I just was n't really in the mood .
I noticed that this has been the biggest year since St. Louis County outlawed fireworks for illegal home displays in my neighborhood .
No , really , the amount of illegal class - C ordinance that people in St. John fired off this year was absolutely unprecedented , easily three or more times as much stuff going off as in any of the previous seven years I 've lived here .
My first , bitterly satisfactory thought was that maybe they were doing what I was doing , namely celebrating the timely ( if insufficiently unpleasant ) death of one of the most bitter , vicious , hateful , murderous and destructive racist bigots in the history of American elective office , Jesse Helms .
But that 's probably wishful thinking on my part .
My practical thought is that more people stayed home and spent $ 100 or $ 200 on fireworks because it was cheaper than the gas to drive to and from wherever they usually go for the Fourth , down to the lake or to some out of town relative 's house or whatever .
But along about 11 pm on the 4th , a chill voice in the back of my head said in the sepulchral voice of a ( faux ) premonition , one so improbable that I hesitate to even write it down : " They 're celebrating all - out because they , too , sense that this will have been The Last Fourth of July .
" Other people have irrational fears of spiders , or of germs , or of knives .
I have irrational fears about the end of the democracy .
And I know that they 're irrational fears .
This nation has survived worse than George Bush and come back better than ever afterwards ; cripes , if this country survived Calvin Coolidge , it can survive anything .
I could give a hundred reasons to believe that my fear is irrational .
The electionbe held in November , George Bush will not win it , someone other than George Bush will be sworn in in 197 days , and no matter who wins , the country can begin to heal .
I 'm even reasonably optimistic that the margin will be so wide that even the Republicans can't steal it .
But knowing all the reasons that my fear is irrational has not helped me shake this sense of impending doom , a dread so palpable I can only compare it to my early childhood years at the peak of the Cold War , when we came home after a week of duck - and - cover drills to set off fireworks wondering if we'd be able to spot Russian bombers through the fireworks smoke in time to make a futile dash for cover if we had to .
This burning need to do something , anything , to somehow prepare for the day that the forces of tyranny move to end the democracy , to cancel all future elections , to cancel all future Fourths of July .
Crazy , huh ?
But having thought about it way too much this weekend , I think I know why I can't make this fear go entirely away .
There is no doubt in my mind that the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections were stolen .
To quote the late George Carlin , " George W. Bush will always be Governor Bush , to me .
Because that 's the highest office to which he 's ever been elected . "
But it takes more than a stolen election to rattle me , especially a stolen close election .
After all , there 's even less doubt that the 1960 election was stolen , that JFK was never actually elected President , either , that he was appointed president by Chicago mafiosi who had failed to notice how tightly his brother had converted over to the Reform ( anti-mafia ) Democrats .
But here 's the difference between 1960 and 2000 , between 1960 and 2004 :
And Bobby Kennedy wielded that outrage like a hammer to crack open the mafia in every city they ruled , to dig them out of their holes , and to crush them like itty bitty bugs .
It took decades to finish the project .
But still , to this day , people talk about the stolen election of 1960 and there 's real anger , real outrage , at least among some of them .
Why has n't even one low - level person involved in any of the dozens of clearly documented voter suppression drives in both of those races been indicted ?
Remember , we do n't require proof beyond a reasonable doubt to indict ; why has no prosecutor even offered to look at the reams and reams of evidence that Robert Kennedy , Jr. , and Greg Palast have accumulated ?
The 2000 " white collar riot " occurred on national television , with the faces of the paid professional Republican staffers who were assaulting police and besieging an election board clearly visible on video ; why has n't even one of them been charged with something , anything ?
Politics ?
Well , d'uh , of course .
But why are the voters okay with this ?
Look at your polls , man ; it sure as heck is n't out of love for George Bush or the Republican Party .
So if no prosecutor will indict , and the people hate the party that stole the elections , then why can people like Antonin Scalia , Karl Rove , Kathleen Harris , Ken Strickland , and so forth walk our streets without a security cordon six blocks wide ?
Why are n't they If they were afraid , I 'd be less afraid .
If the people who conspired to steal the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections were showing even the slightest nervousness about possible consequences of their past treasons , it'd be easier for me to calm my irrational fear , the little voice in my head that says , " Brad , if that was what they did to change the outcome of a close election , one that they could easily steal ?
What will they do if it turns out not to be close enough to steal inconspicuously ?
What will they do when they 'reAnd with so much of our Army and National Guard overseas , and with so much new power granted to the Department of Homeland Security , and with the American people showing so little outrage over the last two stolen elections in a row , if they do try something truly monstrous , I do n't quote a lot of song lyrics , but I feel a powerful urge to quote songwriter Stephen Stills , " For What It 's Worth :" " Paranoia strikes deep : / Into your life it will creep .
/
It starts when you 're always afraid .
/
You step out of line , the man come , and take you away . "
Which friend of mine was it who said that the thing she hates the most about the Bush administration is how much they make her feel like a paranoid , or something like that ?
But it 's not the Bush administration that 's got me feeling so nervous , so depressed , so paranoid ; it 's the voters themselves .
I always thought that they valued their freedom , their franchise , enough to be outraged when both were taken away from them , and I 'm ever so deeply nervous that they do n't look nearly angry enough .
Colonies of tens of billions of microorganisms create their own artwork as they adapt to stresses in a petri dish .
Scientists add the colors and shading .
Big ideas come in small packages .
In the case of Shewanella bacteria , the parcel is microscopic .
But this tiny microbe could hold the keys to alternative energy production , toxic waste cleanup and , most surprising of all , how human bodies work .
One of the most versatile types of bacteria around , Shewanella can live on land , deep inside the Earth , or underwater .
As their habitat changes , Shewanella change with it , finding new ways to breathe .
Daniel Bond , a University of Minnesota microbiologist , said that all living organisms bring in electrons with the food they eat .
Cells use these electrons to generate energy , but must eventually get rid of the electrons .
Humans do this by breathing in oxygen .
The electrons hitchhike on the molecules of oxygen , cling on as those molecules change into carbon dioxide , and then leave the body when the person breathes out .
Shewanella can do this as well , but not underground , where oxygen is scarce .
Instead , in that environment , the bacteria get rid of electrons by attaching them to nearby metals .
Therein lies the link to alternative energy .
In the lab , scientists have long known that they could subtitute an electrode for these natural metals , effectively turning bacteria into teeny , tiny electric generators .
The problem was , nobody knew how the bacteria moved electrons from place to place .
In fact , Bond said , such a feat should n't , technically , be possible .
Like all cells , bacteria are surrounded by a fatty membrane .
" It 's supposed to be a perfect insulator , preventing electrons from getting in or out , " Bond said , " but we knew it was happening anyway .
We just did n't know how . "
Bond and his team changed that .
In the March 3 , 2008 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , they announced they 'd found a chemical compound that allowed electrons to pass through the fatty membrane and helped them travel to nearby metals .
Turns out , the miracle that made Shewanella electron transfer possible was simple riboflavin , otherwise known as Vitamin B - 2 .
The research was funded by the Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment , National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health and Cargill .
Putting information to use
There are two big reasons why Bond 's discovery is important .
First , understanding how Shewanella bacteria move electrons around can help scientists create better electrodes , designed with the transfer process in mind , which could make it easier to collect more electrons more efficiently .
That 's still a small amount of electricity ; bacteria are never going to power a house or a car .
But that does n't mean the electricity they produce is n't useful .
For instance , Bond pointed out that cities already use many different kinds of bacteria to break down the bad stuff in wastewater treatment plants .
If those plants could capture the electricity produced by Shewanella and other bacteria as they eat up the toxins , it could be enough to power the plant .
" We spend millions a year buying electricity so we can power the pumps and pump air into these wastewater plants , " he said .
" If you could collect that energy back , you could at least break even . "
Dan Drell , biologist and program manager at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science in Washington , D.C. , brought up another intriguing use for Shewanella .
He said it , and other electricity producing bacteria , may be able to help clean up toxic waste sites , and Bond 's research might help that .
Bacteria can break down many organic toxins .
Bacteria can change other pollutants , such as heavy metals , into less dangerous forms by attaching electrons to them .
Drell said riboflavin could be used to attract more bacteria and more electrons to the places they were needed most .
" You could n't break down these metals , but you could change their chemical state , " he said .
" So instead of , say , flowing through the groundwater into the Columbia River , they stayed put . "
Body of work
Bond 's research is most important , Drell said , because of what it tells scientists about how cells work .
Shewanella 's genes had been previously sequenced , he said , and riboflavin was one of the many puzzle pieces that showed up in that sequencing .
By figuring out what the riboflavin does , Bond has put a piece of that puzzle into the right place .
" Genome sequence data is just data , " Drell said .
" Data that means something to somebody becomes information and that has greater value . "
How great of value ?
Drell said this information is the first stepping stone toward understanding how simple , microbial cells work , which could , in turn , be a launch pad to understanding the infinitely more complex cells in the human body .
" The more we learn about what Shewanella cells do and how they work together to account for observed behaviors , the more we can get to the fundamental unit of life on this planet , which is the cell , " he said .
" If you solve one cell you 'd be a long ways toward solving the others .
Ultimately this could someday help us understand how our own bodies work . "
Plasma rockets are the rockets of the future .
They use the same stuff that makes up the sun and stars , and follow the same principles that scientists believe govern black holes .
And now , NASA is ready to harness that energy for their own devices .
They 're planning to test a plasma rocket at the International Space Station .

So what , exactly , is a plasma rocket ?
Rather than heating chemicals and directing the resulting gases through high - temperature metal nozzles , VASIMR uses radio waves to create and speed up free - flying , electrically charged particles known as plasma .
The concoction is then herded through nozzles made of magnetic fields , not metals like traditional rocket engines .
Advertisement
Designed by a former astronaut who 's flown in the shuttle seven times , the plasma rocket will use solar power to produce energy to convert into radio waves .
This makes it reusable , and the plan is to have it haul things from low - Earth orbit to low - Lunar orbit , a trip that would take about six months to haul one ton of equipment , and it could be reused six or more times .
They hope to launch the engine up to space in 2011 or 2012 .
And while this engine is n't going to be suitable for transporting people , NASA is already thinking about the next generation of this design : one powered by a nuclear reactor , cutting the trip time down from nine months to 39 days .
Awesome .

I have always admired individuals that are fluent in American Sign Language ( or other versions ) .
By the use of their hands , they are able to carry ongoing conversations and interpret feelings , messages , and stories .
This kind of skill takes a lot of practice , and you must continue to learn new signs in order to be updated .
Many times , it is very difficult to keep up with the growing vocabulary , due the low number of valuable resources and / or video tools available .
Many of the different signs are similar to one another , and the visual pronunciation is usually determined by the actual hand sign , arm movements , and even facial expressions .
A new ASL video tool is being developed by the Boston University using a 3 - year $ 900,000 grant and some enthusiastic interpreters .
The process for this tool has began with words being spoken to an interpreter , and four cameras recording the sign and movements for each specific word .
One camera takes a side angle , two are close ups from the front , and the fourth provides a wide front view .
The new Sign Language tool is determined to convert a sign to its meaning .
This in fact means that if an individual does not understand a certain sign , it may be replicated in front of a camera to find the actual meaning .
Since the deaf community has a significant size in the U.S and worldwide , such a tool could assist many who are in touch with deaf individuals , such as parents , students , interpreters , spouses and much more .

A little while ago we wrote about the exchange of emails between artist Indiana Gregg and The Pirate Bay .
Indiana wanted The Pirate Bay to remove torrents linking to her work , which they refused to do .
Now Indiana has a response for The Pirate Bay and file - sharers in general .
It does n't pull many punches .
Recently we wrote about the exchange of emails between vocalist Indiana Gregg and Peter Sunde at The Pirate Bay .
Indiana and her label asked Peter to remove some torrents but he refused , instead publishing the details of their correspondence in the site ’s ‘ legal ’ section .
The exchange caused quite a stir on the web and the news today is that the debate is not over – at least as far as Indiana is concerned , turns out she has a lot to say – as well as sing .
TorrentFreak heard that Indiana had a message for The Pirate Bay , the BitTorrent community and file - sharers in general , so we caught up with her to find out exactly what .
She told us that although she agrees with the concept of file sharing , she believes that musicians and writers need to make a living or at least enough money to enable them to re-invest into their creation .
She also gave us her opinions about how file - sharing will be ‘ policed ’ in the future and notes that the methods may not be 100 % fair .
“ With all forms of change , there are always the up - sides and down - sides , ” she told us .
It ’s not very often an artist will speak as openly or at such length on this subject as Indiana has .
Some people are going to like what she has to say .
Thousands , maybe millions are going to hate it , but there is n’t a debate when only one side speaks – so here it is – uncensored , controversial , outrageous and thought provoking .
Something tells us this debate is far from over …..
I felt misrepresented in the first article and obviously , my attempt at humor by stating I ’m a ‘ millionaire ’ was n’t appropriately quantified .
Am I a millionaire because I have millions of ants in my garden ?
Is it because I have had millions of people listen to my music on sites like MySpace or YouTube ?
Is it because I ’m grateful to be healthy ?
How people quantify ‘ richness ’ in their lives depends on how people perceive value .
And , yes , I ’m guilty of fueling Peter Sunde ’s fire and animosity .
I can image it ’s not easy in his position just now considering the amount of angry artistic people who are fronting against his cause .
I ’m sure he has his core values that he wants to defend …
I have mine … and I ’m not afraid to speak about them … for the sake of music .. and the common good .
The Pirate Bay : The Sinking Ship ….. My Response
The Wild West of the Internet seems to be getting seriously out of hand and i’ve been wondering if and when the Internet Police will come and sort it all out .
I meanâ€¦ this is the new Wild Westâ€ ¦
We ’ve all heard and read every form of complaint about the Internet .
From cyber - bullying , to child pornography sites , to copyright theft in the form of ‘ file - sharing ’ .
Imagineâ€¦ .
What if the Internet had ‘ frontiers ’ .
Why can we go all over the world on the Internet without a passport ?
Why are cybernauts allowed to steal goods from the store ‘ shelves ’ and ‘ shop windows ’ and justify it as ‘ sharing ’ ?
Since the birth of the Internet , people have been hacking software , stealing music , books , films , television shows , credit card numbers , eBay accounts , IP addresses … you name it , if it ’s out there and can be downloaded , it ’s being virtually stolen from under your nose .
So , why is this Wild West so hard to monitor ?
Why are people up in arms and waiving their guns wildlyâ€¦ â€ ¦
Are these new pirate ships sharing other people ’s goods for gold ?
Of course they areâ€¦ yes , I ’m speaking about the torrent sitesâ€ ¦ and all the other sites who are making money on other people ’s backâ€ ¦
Is the Internet really that much ‘ bigger ’ than the ‘ real ’ world ?
I think not .
I believe that in the near future , we will all be using our Internet passports .
If the government can do it in the real world , what ’s stopping them from monitoring this new ‘ Wild West ’ phenomenon of the Internet in every town , city , state and country .
I meanâ€ ¦
Do n’t we have just as much right as citizens to be protected on the Internet as we would be anywhere else ?
And really , the only people who would disagree with this idea are people who either are engaging in illegal activity or people who claim ‘ civil liberty and freedom of speech ’ on the Internet , but remember guys , those freedoms are only good until you begin to harm other people .
You do n’t have freedom to shout from the rooftops at 3 am outside your neighbor ’s house ….
and it ’s certainly not your civil right to steal from your local baker and share his cream puffs outside his shop windowâ€ ¦either , is it ?
Allow me to explain .
Let ’s take one of the major forces on the Internet for example .
Let ’s look at all of the big music content sites ( such as MySpace , Yahoo Music , etc ) who seem to be huge driving swarms of traffic on the Internet .
When you see the amount of advertisements per page and click , you know you can almost hear the ‘ kerching ’ .
These sites are like interstate junctions at rush hour ( 24 hours a day ) so to speak .
Torrents are no differentâ€¦ .
Kerching kerchingâ€ ¦
They are giving away things like films , music , tv programs , softwareâ€¦ .
If it can be downloaded , it can be foundâ€¦ for freeâ€ ¦
Thousands upon thousands of websites , sharing sites , and torrent sites exist .
These websites are making a constant steady flow of income by using other people ’s goods … they are pointing people to the goods ( music ) for free and selling masses of advertisement because people come to ‘ leech ’ the goods … these sites are basically allowing people to steal and destroy the music industry ( which is in fact like shooting themselves in their own foot ) .
The sites themselves claim to be ‘ legal ’ .
It is the user ’s responsibility not to share copyrighted files .
So , you ’d be silly to think that the Internet police are not planning on coming .
How easy would it be to simply find all these people who are illegally ‘ sharing ’ and slap a lawsuit on them .
They can do that with a virtual push of a button .
How hard do you think it will be for the ISP ’s to hand over your Internet passport over to the new frontier police ?
They can see how much you ’ve ‘ shared ’ and potentially fine every single torrent user .
I bet the torrent sites would n’t like that very much .
Suddenly all their users would disappear .
Last year , in an article on Sky News , I read that a woman received a massive fine for file sharing on the KaZaA network .
I thought , great !
The police are coming .
Then my husband sent me a link to another article titled “ Should You Pay For Music ? ” I instantly thought ….eh ?
Has the world gone mad ?
It ’s like saying “ Should you pay for petrol ? ” or “ Should you pay for bread ? ”
Hey , maybe I was being too ‘ traditional ’ ?
I guess you could compare it to you , yourself , working all week long .
You go to the bank and cash your check , and the banker takes your money without putting it into your account .
But , it ’s much deeper than this .
Whether or not the public is offered music for free or at a cost is not the real issue .
The real problem lies in the fact that ‘ share ’ sites are making money by pointing to other people ’s copyrighted content …
The end user gets it for freeâ€¦ the torrents make moneyâ€¦ .
And the musicians and artists ??
Well , they get to live off of ‘ fresh air ’ .
Put simply , musicians will not be able to exist financially in order to create music if income streams are cut off ( whether or not a record label comes to play ) .
And this is exactly what is happening .
As a musician and an independent record - label , I see my livelihood being sucked away every day through file - sharing and torrent sites which are allowing copyright material to flow in and out of their sites .
All they have to do is claim that it ’s the responsibility of the user to make sure the content they are sharing is not copyright protected material .
Last year , in a period of two weeks , we tracked and found over 100,000 leechers of my album alone .
Since then , we ’ve found about 150,000 more , of which I , the artist , who put my heart and soul , time and sweat into an album and raising money to market that album , have n’t received a dime , not one red cent .
Full torrent files of a complete album !
Since it ’s so easy to ‘ share ’ the music … .
In the real world , if everyone walked into HMV and took as many albums as they like … and said they were ‘ sharing ’ … errr … shoplifting ?
I really do n’t see how people think they can give music or any other form of media for ‘ free ’ without it hurting the livelihoods of musicians .
Sharing of copyright protected material is 100 % illegal .
However , since it ’s not being regulated , it ’s as if all of us musicians have just left the shop door open so that anybody can lift our guitars and gear out on the street and drive off with it .
Is n’t that what ’s happening ?
If you ca n’t make a dime from that album you just spent all your money , time and effort on because everyone is ‘ sharing ’ it , then how are you going to buy your guitar strings , pay your landlord , or eat ?
You ’ll be selling your gear soon and asking the boss for overtime .
Right ?
Torrent sites are claiming that they are creating ‘ free promotion ’ for musicians ….
that ’s right .. they claim that by giving all these people the opportunity to “ share ” the music , they are doing all of us musicians a big huge favor .
In fact , they think that musician ’s , songwriters , sound engineers , mastering companies , etc … should all live on ‘ pure fresh air ’ .
They blatantly state that they think it should be enough for a musician to make music out of their ‘ passion ’ for musicâ€ ¦ and well , since it ’s ‘ art ’ it should n’t have a price ….. er , okâ€¦ .. maybe we should go and see if Fender will start giving away free guitars ?
Free gear for everybody !!!
Yipppeee … .
Free strings , free amplifiers , free microphones and drum kits …… awwwâ€¦ how novel .
Here ’s another funny oneâ€ ¦the torrent site ’s answer to how musicians are supposed to earn a living is : .. well , musician ’s will just need to go out and gig some more in order to make a living .
Maybe the band can sell a few more T - shirts , etc. etc .
They rationalize stealing by stating that they go to gigs and buy ticketsâ€ ¦( or that they plan to do so if ever their favorite band can finally afford to come and do a tour in their country ) .
They claim that by allowing sharing , they are ‘ leveling the playing field ’ .
Well , torrent sites are absolutely NOT leveling the playing field .
They are just moving the field and reaping the benefits due to a temporary loophole in the law .
I ’ll bet that when all their users get slapped a fine for ‘ sharing ’ in their respective countries the torrent sites wo n’t be there to support them .
I doubt that they are planning to send all their users a bunch of ‘ gold ’ off of their pirate ship .
So far , there have only been a few ‘ examples ’ made with users being slapped heavy fines .
I have a hunch that this will CHANGE .
Aww , now there ’s a word “ CHANGE ” .
Well , let ’s talk about CHANGE for a moment .
The torrent people even go as far as to quote Charles Darwin in an effort to justify theft :
“ In nature , it ’s not the strongest nor the most intelligent who survives .
It ’s the most adaptable to change . ” ( a quote from a torrent fanatic referring to Darwins theory ) .
Hmmmâ€¦â€¦â€ ¦.. well , I assume that the torrent sites are planning to be adaptable pretty soon then , considering the number of pending lawsuits from pretty strong and intelligent companies who have not only proven their adaptability to change , but have changed the world as we know it ( companies like Microsoft , for example ) .
Please .. spare us this kind of rhetoric guys .
With the likes of Microsoft , Prince , and the IFPI going after you , any outsider might begin to wonder when YOU plan to adapt to ‘ change ’ .
It ’s becoming evident that your business model is a sinking ship .
Pretty soon , your users will be slapped with fines and more big companies will be slapping on lawsuits .
Why not just sink your ship yourselves ..eh ?
That ’s really what you ’re doing ..
Your resistance to ‘ change ’ is in complete conflict with your very survivalâ€ ¦
Oh the irony .
“ Let ’s have all our users quote Darwin ” .
“ Sharing is caring ” , so they say .
Torrent sites are promoting the idea that if people are taking the time to ‘ share ’ other peoples copyright material it means they care .
So , what ’s stopping the torrent pirates from ‘ sharing ’ the revenue from the advertising on their sites ?
Funny how it ’s ok for musicians to live off of ‘ fresh air ’ but these pirates are meanwhile filling their boat with loot on the backs of other people ’s hard work .
Let ’s see how adaptable to ‘ change ’ they decide to becomeâ€ ¦ and put their Darwin theory where their mouth isâ€¦ .
Free promotion ?
Basically , torrents are promoting music that has ‘ already been promoted ’ , so it ’s not ‘ free promotion ’ .
There will be a small percentage of people who go through the millions of songs that are being seeded and perhaps discover something new because they searched for something they had already heard about .
So , torrents are not only ‘ moving ’ the playing field , they are , in reality , making the playing field so un-even that bands are going to be the new “ Sysiphus ’s ” trying to roll a ball uphill for eternity – although the sites would like to fool us all into believing otherwise .
Men dressed as police commandos Wednesday killed eight employees of an electronics import company in an upscale neighborhood of Baghdad , the latest in a wave of strikes against businesses in the Iraqi capital .
Interior Ministry officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media , said that witnesses who survived the attack on the Ibtikar trading company provided this account :
The assailants drove up in two Mercedeses and a third car about 11 a.m. and stormed the building .
The gunmen gathered the employees in one room and shot them with automatic rifles .
Three young women and five men were killed .
Six wounded workers were taken from the company ’s office in a large house to Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad .
The attack stood out among the many acts of violence here because it occurred in the Dawoodi neighborhood , a modestly wealthy area of town where embassies and other international missions are located .
The district has seen kidnappings , but not attacks of this scale .

The officials said the assailants were wearing the familiar green camouflage uniforms of the Interior Ministry ’s Majhaweer , an elite force that has taken the lead in a number of operations against insurgents in and around Baghdad .
The attack by uniformed gunmen underscored one of the major issues here -- violence that appears linked to the security services .
The question of who will control Iraq ’s security forces is a major point of contention in talks aimed at forming a new government .
Those negotiations were put on hold Wednesday as Shiite Muslim and Sunni Arab blocs tried to work out their differences .
Since the Feb. 22 bombing of the Shiite Golden Mosque in Samarra , Iraq has been convulsed by a wave of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites .
The bloodshed has brought the nation to the brink of all - out civil war .

Sunni leaders have accused the Shiite - dominated Interior Ministry of operating death squads that have been involved in many of those attacks .
But police and army uniforms have been stolen and used by insurgents and by criminal gangs to bluff their way past guards in a number of attacks , officials said .
Sunni parties , mistrustful of the Shiite - dominated police , want the police and armed forces to be under the control of a Sunni deputy prime minister , who would report to a Shiite prime minister .
But Shiites , who are a majority and now have political power after decades of Sunni domination , do n’t want to yield any authority .
Mahmoud Othman , a Kurdish negotiator , said the government talks had not broken down over that issue .

Sounding less optimistic , Shiite spokesman Haider Abadi said the Sunni proposal was unconstitutional .
“ The prime minister is the head of the armed forces , and the security issues ca n’t be handed over to someone else , ” he said .
Othman and Abadi said the parties would probably return today to the negotiating table .
In other incidents across Iraq , two policemen and two commandos were killed in the Jihad neighborhood of Baghdad when gunmen opened fire on their vehicles .
A roadside bomb near Abu Ghraib , on the old highway between Fallouja and Baghdad , struck an Iraqi army convoy , killing one soldier .

A policeman died in another roadside bomb attack , this one targeting a police convoy patrolling between Mashtal and Baladiyat , east of Baghdad .
Two other policemen and three civilians were injured .
And three people were killed in Nasiriya by a roadside bomb placed outside the home of a reporter for Radio Sawa , hospital officials said .
The reporter , Mohammed Noor , was not injured , officials said .

Times staff writers Zainab Hussein and Shamil Aziz and special correspondent Asmaa Waguih contributed to this report .
Almost lost in the chaos of the collapse of the World Trade Center is a mystery that under normal circumstances would probably have captured the attention of the city and the world .
That mystery is the collapse of a nearby 47 - story , two - million - square - foot building seven hours after flaming debris from the towers rained down on it , igniting what became an out - of - control fire .
Engineers and other experts , who quickly came to understand how hurtling airplanes and burning jet fuel had helped bring down the main towers , were for weeks still stunned by what had happened to 7 World Trade Center .
That building had housed , among other things , the mayor 's emergency command bunker .
It tumbled to its knees shortly after 5:20 on the ugly evening of Sept. 11 .
The building had suffered mightily from the fire that raged in it , and it had been wounded by the flying beams falling off the towers .
But experts said no building like it , a modern , steel - reinforced high - rise , had ever collapsed because of an uncontrolled fire , and engineers have been trying to figure out exactly what happened and whether they should be worried about other buildings like it around the country .
As engineers and scientists struggle to explain the collapse of 7 World Trade Center , they have begun considering whether a type of fuel that was inside the building all along created intensely hot fires like those in the towers : diesel fuel , thousands of gallons of it , intended to run electricity generators in a power failure .
Global warming is forcing 30 species of reptiles and amphibians to move uphill as habitats shift upward , but they may soon run out of room to run .
The shift could cause at least two toad species and one species of gecko in Madagascar to go extinct by the end of this century , a biologist says .
Uphill movement is a predicted response to increased temperatures , researcher Christopher Raxworthy of the American Museum of Natural History says .
Earlier studies in Costa Rica have provided evidence of how tropical animals respond to climate change .
The new research — based on surveys of Madagascar 's amphibians and reptiles conducted in 1993 and 2003 and announced this week — extends that work , expanding the number and diversity of species that the trend affects , making a stronger link with meteorological changes , dealing with relatively large shifts in elevation , and assessing the extinction vulnerability for tropical communities in the mountains .
Nowhere to run
The animals that could go extinct are two species of narrow - mouth toads ( Plethodontohyla tsarartananensis and Plethodontohyla sp. Z ) and one species of gecko ( Phelsuma l. punctulata ) found in Madagascar ’s mountainous north , Raxworthy said .
Two of these species were not found again during the most recent 2003 survey .
( And for the 30 species that were re-sampled between 1993 and 2003 , the majority are already moving upslope to compensate for habitat loss at lower and warmer altitudes . )
Extinction is expected to occur between 2050 and 2100 if current trends persist , because there will eventually be no higher ground , predict Raxworthy and his colleagues from the Université d’Antananarivo in Madagascar , National Chung - Hsing University in Taiwan , University of Michigan and University of Oxford .
The prediction is based on a conservative scenario in which warming remains below 2 degrees C ( 3 degrees F ) .
Warming above 2 degrees C is considered to be dangerous in terms of impacts on biodiversity .
" Obviously , more warming will put more species at risk , " Raxworthy told LiveScience .
The results are detailed in a recent online issue of the journal Global Change Biology .
" Two things together — highly localized distribution close to the very highest summits , and the magnitude of these upslope shifts in response to ongoing warming — make a poisonous cocktail for extinction , " Raxworthy said .
Almost - by - chance discovery Raxworthy discovered the uphill migration almost by chance while in the field .
On repeated surveys of northern Madagascar ’s mountains , the Tsaratanana Massif , he noticed that some species were missing from camps where they ’d been previously observed .
Moreover , some of these " missing " species popped up at the next higher elevation surveyed .
" I noted this in the field as strange , but when I later sat down and looked at the data , the trend persisted , " Raxworthy said .
He culled elevation records and was able to compare surveys of animals over a 10 - year period .
The results were dramatic .
Among 30 species of geckos , skinks , chameleons and frogs , an average shift uphill of 62 to 167 feet ( 19 to 51 meters ) was observed over the decade .
When these results were compared with meteorological records and climate change simulations , the movement of animals could be linked to temperature increases of 0.18 °F to 0.67 °F ( 0.1 °C to 0.37 °C ) over the same decade , which corresponds to an expected upslope movement of 59 to 243 feet ( 17 to 74 meters ) .
The results are strong because of the diversity of species included in the analyses , Raxworthy said .
The surveyed animals come from five different families of amphibians and reptiles — narrow - mouthed toads , mantelline frogs , chameleons , geckos and skinks ( a large , diverse group of lizards ) .
" When you see a general trend across all these groups of organisms , it is likely to be related to a broad explanation like general temperature warming , not something more subtle such as seasonal variation , " Raxworthy said .
Planning ahead
The direct link between observed movement up mountains , possible extinction and climate change has consequences for Madagascar ’s network of national parks .
The government of Madagascar currently plans to set aside 10 percent of its landmass for conservation purposes , and earlier research this year by Raxworthy and colleagues used the distribution of 2,300 species of animals to map the areas of this island nation that provide adequate habitat for all species .
" The Malagasy government is creating important new reserves and protecting forests .
Sadly , however , with a phenomenon like global warming , species will move upslope , and so eventually may still lose all their habitat and go extinct , " Raxworthy said .
" This conservation problem thus requires a global solution . "
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation .
As you probably know , using anabolic steroids can come with a lot of different side - effects . …
Given the opportunity to riff on his cookie - making strategies , Mr. Rubin revealed two crucial elements home cooks can immediately add to their arsenal of baking tricks .
First , he said , he lets the dough rest for 36 hours before baking .
Asked why , he shrugged .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
“ They just taste better . ”
“ Oh , that Maury ’s a sly one , ” said Shirley O. Corriher , author of “ CookWise ” ( William Morrow , 1997 ) , a book about science in the kitchen .
“ What he ’s doing is brilliant .
He ’s allowing the dough and other ingredients to fully soak up the liquid — in this case , the eggs — in order to get a drier and firmer dough , which bakes to a better consistency . ”
A long hydration time is important because eggs , unlike , say , water , are gelatinous and slow - moving , she said .
Making matters worse , the butter coats the flour , acting , she said , “ like border patrol guards , ” preventing the liquid from getting through to the dry ingredients .
The extra time in the fridge dispatches that problem .
Like the Warm Rule , hydration — from overnight , in Mr. Poussot ’s case , to up to a few days for Mr. Torres — was a tactic shared by nearly every baker interviewed .
And by Ruth Wakefield , it turns out .
“ At Toll House , we chill this dough overnight , ” she wrote in her “ Toll House Cook Book ” ( Little , Brown , 1953 ) .
This crucial bit of information is left out of the version of her recipe that Nestlé printed on the back of its baking bars and , since in 1939 , on bags of its chocolate morsels .
To put the technique to the test , one batch of the cookie dough recipe given here was allowed to rest in the refrigerator .
After 12 , 24 , and 36 hours , a portion was baked , each time on the same sheet pan , lined with the same nonstick sheet in the same oven at the same temperature .
At 12 hours , the dough had become drier and the baked cookies had a pleasant , if not slightly pale , complexion .
The 24 - hour mark is where things started getting interesting .
The cookies browned more evenly and looked like handsomer , more tanned older brothers of the younger batch .
The biggest difference , though , was flavor .
The second batch was richer , with more bass notes of caramel and hints of toffee .
Going the full distance seemed to have the greatest impact .
At 36 hours , the dough was significantly drier than the 12 - hour batch ; it crumbled a bit when poked but held together well when shaped .
These cookies baked up the most evenly and were a deeper shade of brown than their predecessors .
Surprisingly , they had an even richer , more sophisticated taste , with stronger toffee hints and a definite brown sugar presence .
At an informal tasting , made up of a panel of self - described chipper fanatics , these mature cookies won , hands down .
A research team from Rochester University in New York lead by Steven Goldman has successfully injected human brain stem cells into mice suffering from lack of myelin and cured them .
The mice , showing symptoms like shivering and early death , had their myelin reconstructed , stopped shivering , and lived longer than expected after the injection .
Applying this treatment on humans suffering from Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) or other neuronal diseases might be feasible in the near future .

Myelin is a protein that acts as an insulator in the brain ’s electrical system .
A neuronal cell communicates with other neurons through long arms called axons .
The electrical flow inside the axon is insulated with the help of other type of cells called glial cells that produce the insulating protein myelin .
In the lack of myelin the electrical signals could not be transmitted between two neurons and neuronal disorders such as MS appear .
The research showed that myelin can be generated from stem cells injected to the brain , restoring the brain ’s normal behavior .
The research team used transgenic mice named “ shiverer mice ” that do n’t produce myelin at all and as their name suggests suffer from shivering and seizures , and usually die at the age of 18 - 21 weeks .
The cells used to restore the myelin were human glial progenitor cells , a certain type of stem cells that can be differentiated into glial cells able to produce myelin .
The treatment included injection of those cells through five different spots to the brain .
The results were encouraging .
Some of the treated mice overcame the “ shivering ” symptoms and lived much longer than untreated mice .
In the first 130 days after the treatment the treated mice showed no special behavior , but at the age of 150 days , some of the treated mice survived whereas all of the untreated mice died .
The surviving mice had decreased their “ shivering ” symptoms and it was further showed that normal myelin had been formed in their brain .
This is the first time a normal layer of myelin was built inside a living brain .
Some human related neuronal diseases are due to lack of myelin and the treatment described can help cure those disorders .
Multiple Sclerosis is an example of a disease caused by loss of myelin in a certain part of the brain .
Some rare neuronal disorders that infants are born with also result from a lack of myelin , and most of the children suffering from these conditions die at a young age .
Although the research shows only a proof of concept and the treatment ’s success rate was n’t high , it does hint at a possible cure for those diseases .
The researchers hope that clinical trials in humans are only a few years away .
TFOT has recently reported a treatment in which human stem cells were used to cure a rat ’s heart .
Some other uses of stem cells covered by TFOT include a recent research study at MIT which showed the potential of artificial stem cells used to cure Parkinson ’s disease as well as a Hadassah University research study which aims to use stem cells to cure MS and ALS .

The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that it would reopen bidding on a $ 35 billion contract for midair refueling tankers , allowing Boeing to continue its effort to wrest the business from a partnership of Northrop Grumman and the European parent of its rival Airbus .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the tanker contract , which was won by the partners Northrop and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company in February , would not be awarded until the Pentagon reviewed the rival bids again .
The companies have battled fiercely to land the Air Force ’s largest contract , with a potential value of $ 100 billion .
The struggle has been caught in issues of national pride , trans -Atlantic relations and even presidential politics .
Mr. Gates ’s action was a public rebuke to the Air Force , which had selected the offering of Northrop and EADS , the parent of Airbus .
Shortly after the Air Force made its selection , the Government Accountability Office , acting on a protest from Boeing , said that the Air Force ’s decision - making process was flawed and that the tanker contract should be reopened .

WASHINGTON  The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Friday that it had improperly obtained the phone records of reporters for The New York Times and The Washington Post in the newspapers ’ Indonesia bureaus in 2004 .
Robert S. Mueller III , director of the F.B.I. , disclosed the episode in a phone call to Bill Keller , the executive editor of The Times , and apologized for it .
He also spoke with Leonard Downie Jr. , the executive editor of The Washington Post , to apologize .
F.B.I. officials said the incident came to light as part of the continuing review by the Justice Department inspector general ’s office into the bureau ’s improper collection of telephone records through “ emergency ” records demands issued to phone providers .
The records were apparently sought as part of a terrorism investigation , but the F.B.I. did not explain what was being investigated or why the reporters ’ phone records were considered relevant .
Nevada ACLU supports an individual ’s right to bear arms State affiliate bucks national stance , supporting the right to bear arms
Reader poll
Do you think the ACLU of Nevada made the right decision recognizing the constitutional right of an individual to bear arms ?
No .
Yes .
Heck yes , this is Nevada !
View results
Everyone loves guns in Nevada .
Ducks Unlimited , the National Rifle Association , Republicans , the American Civil Liberties Union , the ...
Wait .
The ACLU ?
The Nevada ACLU has declared its support for an individual ’s right to bear arms , apparently making it the first state affiliate in the nation to buck the national organization ’s position on the Second Amendment .
The state board of directors reached the decision this month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to own handguns .
“ The Nevada ACLU respects the individual ’s right to bear arms subject to constitutionally permissible regulations , ” a statement on the organization ’s Web site said .
“ The ACLU of Nevada will defend this right as it defends other constitutional rights . ”
“ This was the consensus , ” said Allen Lichtenstein , general counsel for ACLU of Nevada .
“ There really was n’t a lot of dissent . ”
But the state affiliate ’s position puts it at odds with the national organization .
The New York City - based ACLU disagrees with the Supreme Court ruling , saying in a statement that it interprets the Second Amendment as a collective right to own guns and not an individual one .
“ In our view , neither the possession of guns nor the regulation of guns raises a civil liberties issue , ” according to the position on its Web page .
It ’s that position that has long infuriated gun rights advocates .
Larry Rhodes , president of the Stillwater Firearms Association , a Northern Nevada advocacy group , said the state ACLU ’s position “ is a wonderful thing . ”
“ I ’m thrilled the Nevada ACLU , which seems to support the other nine Bill of Rights , has decided to do this , ” Rhodes said .
John Cahill , chairman of the Nevada Outdoor Democrats , said he had not been a member of the ACLU because of its position .
“ I resented their position on the Second Amendment , ” Cahill said .
“ I ’d be happy to be a card - carrying member of the Nevada ACLU . ”
The phrase “ card - carrying member of the ACLU ” has long been used by conservatives as a liberal curse , perhaps most famously against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis .
Gary Peck , executive director of the ACLU of Nevada , said the decision was not political , nor a slap at the national organization .
He said the ACLU of Nevada often defends both conservative and liberal groups when , in its view , a constitutional right is being violated .
“ This was a legal , constitutional decision for us , ” he said .
“ Right now , it ’s an issue percolating in the ACLU universe .
It should be no surprise that an issue that has sparked a lot of issues and debate outside the ACLU has sparked debate inside the ACLU . ”
The national ACLU , in a statement by a spokeswoman , said , “ ACLU affiliates are free to take positions that differ from those of the national office . ”
The spokeswoman said she was unaware of any other ACLU affiliate that had taken a differing position on the Second Amendment .
Peck said the state has a history of opposing government involvement in people ’s lives .
“ Nevada has a long , proud tradition of libertarian skepticism of government overreach , ” Peck said .
“ An individual ’s right to bear arms , not surprisingly , is in the Nevada constitution . ”
Even when gun control was a major national issue during the 1990s , Nevada ’s strong gun culture knew no party lines .
State Sen. John Lee , a North Las Vegas Democrat , has sponsored a number of bills on people ’s right to carry guns .
He pointed to the gun park being built north of Las Vegas , the first phase of which will cost $ 64 million .
“ We ’re a hunting state , ” Lee said .
“ Here in Nevada , we ’re a real pragmatic group of Democrats . ” ( Democratic state Sen . Dina Titus , during her run for governor in 2006 , liked to point out that she owned a gun . )
Attempts to find a Nevada group or affiliate in favor of stricter gun control were unsuccessful .
Bob Fulkerson , the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada , said he did not know of any such organizations in the state .
The gun control issue “ has never really come up , ” he said .
“ It ’s ironic because we are one of the leaders in handgun - related deaths . ”
Ladd Everitt , spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence , said he recognizes different parts of cultures have different experiences with guns .
“ Certain areas of the country have very strong traditions and take great pride in them , ” he said .
“ I think the real shame is we could have better firearm laws without preventing law - abiding citizens from owning guns . ”
Peck said he anticipates Nevadans will come to his group to protect their gun rights .
“ I have no doubt people will be making inquiries on their rights , ” he said .
“ I have no doubt we ’ll be stepping to the plate on Second Amendment rights , if they come under assault by governments .
In this state , of course , I do n’t see any big rush by lawmakers . ”
( Editor 's Note : This story has been corrected .
The original version had a headline that incorrectly stated the organization ’s position on gun control .
The ACLU of Nevada supports gun control within constitutional limits .
The state affiliate has recognized an individual ’s right to bear arms , a break from the national organization ’s position . )
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc is considering harnessing the sun to power its iPod music players .
California ’s Ironwood prison is installing more than 6,000 solar panels , and Boston ’s Fenway Park is tapping solar power for Red Sox baseball games .
After decades on the fringe , solar power is closing in on America ’s mainstream as surging fossil fuel prices and mounting concern over climate change spur states , businesses and homeowners into a quickening embrace with alternative energy .
Panels bolted to roofs to convert sunlight into electricity are still too expensive in most regions to compete with cheaper , less environmentally friendly fuels like coal without generous subsidies .
Solar ’s high costs have kept the resource out of reach for many residences and businesses , .
But not for long , industry analysts and scientists say .
The tipping point at which the world ’s cleanest , most renewable resource is cost - competitive with other sources of energy on electricity grids could happen within two to five years in some U.S. regions and countries if the price of fossil fuels continues to rise at its current pace , they add .
“ In the long run -- as in two to three years -- you should see competitiveness especially with the grid in a number of regions in the world , ” said Vishal Shah , an analyst who tracks the industry at U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers .
Tom Werner , chief executive of SunPower Corp , the largest North American solar company by sales , sees such “ grid parity ” for solar power in the United States and elsewhere happening in about five years , or possibly as soon as 2010 .
“ That ’s actually more aggressive than what we would say previously , and that ’s because the cost of electricity is going up faster than we had ever modeled , ” Werner said an interview at the Reuters Global Energy Summit on June 3 .
“ It is becoming more and more clear it is a real possibility , and we believe , a reality , ” he said .
Richard Feldt , chief executive of U.S. solar panel maker Evergreen Solar Inc , calls grid parity the industry ’s “ Holy Grail ” and sees it happening in about five years .
“ It ’s not far away , ” he said in an interview .
Suntech Power Holdings
Co Ltd , one of the largest of a growing number of Chinese solar companies , sees the same five - year timeline , thanks to increasing supplies of silicon that will help drive down costs .

In the United States , much depends on November ’s U.S. presidential and congressional elections .
A Democratic win of the White House , and possibly greater Democratic control of Congress , could spur aggressive U.S. measures to limit climate - warming emissions of carbon dioxide -- including legislation opposed by President George W. Bush that would cap emissions from 86 percent of U.S. facilities .
If passed , such cap - and - trade provisions would make it costlier to emit carbon into the atmosphere and discourage the burning of fossil fuels .
The economics of solar and other cleaner energy sources would be more competitive .
Democrat Barack Obama wants to require U.S. utilities to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources like solar by 2025 .
Republican John McCain has campaigned on his support for alternative energy sources but Democrats have questioned his voting record on those issues in Congress .
“ Obama or McCain would be better than Bush , ” said Feldt .
BOOM TO BUST ?
Although solar power is easily installed , building solar panels is expensive because of tight supplies of silicon , their costliest element .
Most industry analysts expect a constraint on silicon supplies to end within two years .
But they are divided on whether this would help or harm the industry .
Some say a drop in silicon prices would tip the scales from boom to bust by dramatically boosting supply of photovoltaic panels that make up 90 percent of sales in the industry .
Such panels use refined crystalline silicon .
But rival technologies are emerging such as thin - film panels that require almost no silicon , raising the possibility of a costly battle in the industry over which type of solar power will dominate .
“ The solar industry will look very different just two years from now , ” said Ted Sullivan , a senior analyst at Lux Research , a New York market consultancy .
Slideshow ( 12 images )
He said he expects “ a shake - out among companies that are n’t prepared to thrive in this new environment -- particularly crystalline silicon players that have n’t invested in new thin - film technologies . ”
Those concerns have helped to cool red - hot solar panel stocks , a volatile sector that also faces uncertainty over whether the U.S. Congress will renew tax incentives that expire at the end of the year .
Shares in California - based SunPower Corp are down nearly 60 percent this year , Colorado - based Ascent Solar Technologies Inc has shed 50 percent and Evergreen has lost about 40 percent of its value this year .
That compares to a heady 2007 when industry leader SunPower rose 253 percent from the start of last year to the end , Ascent surged 785 percent and Evergreen shot up 134 percent .
Some analysts urge investors to look beyond volatility in the near term to a promising future for solar in energy - thirsty nations such as the United States , which could overtake Germany as the world ’s top solar market within four years , according to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association , a lobby body .
“ While silicon oversupply in mid-2009 is likely to pressure companies ’ margins , we believe investors at some point will become comfortable with solar ’s improving costs , ” said Ronan Wolfsdorf , a solar and renewable energy analyst at consultants Macroenergy Monitor in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
“ The solar market needs to cross this great divide , and a lot of that has to do with cost .
But one thing to remember is that tougher regulations on emissions of carbon into the atmosphere are going to translate into higher prices for electricity produced by conventional sources , ” he said .
“ That will make solar more competitive in the long run . ”
Under laws in 25 U.S. states and Washington D.C. , solar and other clean energy sources such as wind must constitute up to 30 percent of a utility ’s energy portfolio in five to 15 years .
Just 10 states had such requirements in 2003 .
And some businesses are bringing solar to the masses .
Engineers at computer maker Apple applied for a patent for solar panels that would power mobile devices like its popular iPod digital media player without plugging them in .
The 2007 World Series - winning Red Sox baseball club last month became the first professional sports team to go solar , installing solar hot water panels that will replace a third of the gas used to heat water at Boston ’s historic Fenway Park .
The United States -- the world ’s fourth - largest solar power market after Germany , Japan and Spain -- saw nearly 150 megawatts of solar capacity come online in 2007 , up 45 percent from 2006 , for a total of 750 megawatts , according to the Solar Energy Industries Association , a U.S. trade group .
That is about enough to power about 550,000 homes .
If its subsidies continue , the United States could generate as much power from solar panels as two - and - a - half typical nuclear reactors in four years -- or about 2.55 gigawatts , according to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association ’s data .
That association sees global nuclear capacity reaching 44 gigawatts in four years -- the equivalent to the power capacity of 44 nuclear reactors .
15 Career Mistakes
I ’ve written other newsletter articles about careers ( see the links throughout this article as well as at the end of the article ) , but until now I ’ve never specifically written an article about career mistakes .
I think the subject has been too personal – I ’ve made a lot of these career mistakes myself , and it ’s hard for me to admit my failures .
But in the interest of helping others avoid some of the mistakes I ’ve made , I ’ve decided to go ahead and create a list of the major career mistakes that I ’ve made or that I ’ve seen other people in IT make .
Let me know if you think of other mistakes that should also be on the list .
1. Focusing too much of your time on things you ’re not good at
I wrote an entire newsletter article on why you need to specialize , so I wo n’t repeat myself .
Read the article .
2 . Talking to non-technical people using technical language
I wrote a newsletter article on this one too .
Read the article .
3 . When you ’re trying to sell , focusing on features rather than benefits
This is a variation on Number 2 , and it ’s a major pitfall for IT people .
As I said in my book , the most common IT mistakes are doing the wrong things – not doing things wrong .
We tend to focus on how things are done , and so it ’s very common for presentations made by IT people to the business to list a lot of features of our solution .
We talk about things like the hardware , operating system , network and software we ’re going to use , together with the features of all that stuff : high MTBF , low latency , and other technical terms that drive business people batty .
Forget all that descriptive information !
Tell the business people what ’s important to them , things like “ customers will be able to access our web site 24 hours a day , ” “ the time for salespeople to enter an order will be cut in half , ” or “ our inventory requirements will be reduced by 30 % . ”
These are benefits of our IT systems , and the benefits are much more important than features .
4 . Thinking that being good technically is enough
It is enough if you want to stay in your same job for the rest of your career , and if you ’re lucky enough to be in a job that wo n’t be outsourced , offshored , or made obsolete by changing technology .
For everyone else , it ’s important to understand that jobs require people skills , and you need to develop some of those skills even if you do n’t want to move into management or become a CIO .
See my newsletter article , “ 10 Rules for IT Job Success ” for more information .
5 . Not networking outside your company
I realize how difficult it is to take the time to get outside the day - to - day needs of your own organization .
Notice that I said “ take the time ” – some people say “ find the time ” and I can guarantee that the time to do this will never be “ found . ”
This is one of those things that you have to force yourself to do .
But please force yourself , because it ’s important .
It ’s important to your career because you need to maintain contacts with people in other companies in case you need to make a job change .
And it ’s important to your success in your current job because you need the perspective that comes from seeing similar problems from the point of view of people in other companies .
Some networking can be achieved by attending national conferences or training programs .
But I also recommend regular networking with people in similar jobs in your city .
Join local chapters of organizations like the Society for Information Management ; they do a wonderful job of getting people together to discuss shared issues .
6 . Not getting everything you can out of every training opportunity
It ’s easy to go through the motions when you ’re sent to a training class that does n’t interest you .
But think of every training class as an opportunity – no matter what the subject .
Open your mind to new ideas , and try to figure out ways to use the things you learn in your day - to - day life .
And do n’t ignore the networking opportunities in training classes .
Many classes include a mix of people from different locations , different jobs , and different companies .
Take the opportunity to compare jobs , talk to people with other backgrounds , and get a different perspective on your career and your life .
7 . Not having a mentor
I ’ve had various mentors throughout my career .
Sometimes it ’s easy to find one ; there ’s a friendly experienced person nearby .
In other environments it ’s difficult , and you feel like you ’re all alone .
But whatever your situation , make the effort to find a mentor .
If you ’re in a technical job , then the mentor might be a more experienced technical person .
As you climb the career ladder , you ’ll find that a better mentor can be found outside of your department – someone who can advise you on the people issues rather than the technical challenges .
You can formalize a mentoring relationship , but even an informal mentor – someone you can go to for advice and counsel – is a big help .
8. Forgetting who you work for
I do n’t mean your immediate boss .
I mean your company and its stockholders , or if you work for a nonprofit then the people who derive benefit from your nonprofit .
There are a couple of reasons why it ’s important to remember that these “ stakeholders ” are who you really work for .
First , you ’ll find that the lower you are in the organization chart , the more likely it is that people will ask you to do things that do n’t make sense from the stakeholders ’ viewpoint .
Sometimes these instructions will have been garbled in their translation through the organizational hierarchy , much like a message is garbled when relaying it from person to person in the telephone game .
Sometimes the instructions are the result of a misunderstanding of alternatives , maybe because someone with a non-technical background made a technical decision .
In either case , it ’s your duty to bring the problem to the attention of your boss ( do it diplomatically , please ) , and to try to reconcile the intent of the stakeholders with the instructions that you ’ve been given .
And although a few bosses may resent your questioning their instructions , most will appreciate your focus on what ’s really important .
Ethics are the second reason to remember that you really work for your stakeholders .
Newspapers from the last few years are full of stories about companies where individuals acted in their own best interests instead of the best interests of the stakeholders .
Many of these individuals have gone to jail , but even if they did n’t , it ’s a sure bet that their careers hit a major stumbling block .
It ’s important that you do n’t follow in their footsteps .
9 . Not delegating
It ’s difficult to give up things that you ’re good at .
Yet one of the rites of passage when being promoted from a lower - level job to a higher - level job is to give up detailed responsibility for doing some of the things that you ’ve been doing in the lower - level job .
A higher - level job requires you to focus on different issues , and you ca n’t focus on these new issues in addition to your previous responsibilities .
There ’s not enough time , and so you ’ll have to delegate responsibility for the lower - level issues to someone else .
People who do n’t understand this are like a person with one foot on a dock and one foot on a boat that ’s moving away from the dock .
You have to choose which foot to move , or you ’ll fall in the water .
10 .
Punishing people who make mistakes , instead of teaching them
Along with the responsibility for delegation is the responsibility for teaching .
One of the basic truths underlying teaching is that the student will make mistakes .
It ’s the teacher ’s job to help the student learn from the mistakes – not just punish the student .
As you move up in an organization , you ’ll be responsible for more and more teaching .
Your role likely wo n’t be called a teacher , but the goals are the same : help people learn to do better .
11 . Not blowing your own horn
People who get little recognition often wonder why .
It ’s usually because they do n’t make enough of an effort to bring their accomplishments to the attention of others .
I ’m not talking about bragging here ; but it ’s important that others know of your successes .
When you accomplish something , make sure others know .
Put the accomplishment in terms of benefits ( see Number 3 ) , and make it clear that you were responsible for achieving those benefits .
If others were involved , credit them as well .
In fact , a great strategy to get attention for your own accomplishments is to highlight the accomplishments of others who worked with you or for you .
You may be calling attention to others , but it will be obvious to everyone that you deserve recognition as well .
12 . Not changing jobs when the time is right
It ’s tempting to stay in your rut , doing the same thing day after day because it ’s comfortable .
Yes , there ’s risk involved when you change jobs , but there are incredible benefits to be gained .
Look at a change with hope – not with dread .
13 .
Thinking of your job as something you do rather than as a process to be improved
Even if you stay in the same job for a while , there ’s no reason that you have to keep things the way they are .
Take a good look at what you do from other perspectives .
Is there something that could be eliminated ?
Something that could be automated ?
Some part of your job that should be outsourced ?
Try to find ways to help your company ( see Number 8 above ) accomplish the results of your job better , and you ’ll often find that you ’ll be rewarded with an even better job .
14 . Equating your career with your life
Life is about more than your career .
So no matter what happens at work , do n’t let it affect your real life : your family , your friends , your community .
You have to keep your career in perspective .

Not learning from your mistakes
After you finish each project , or periodically – maybe at the end of each month or so – ask yourself two questions : 1 . What did I do well that I need to do again ?
2 . What could I have done better ?
Learn from your answers .
Conclusion
Life is a series of mistakes , from our first attempt at walking , through school , and throughout our career .
Making mistakes – and seeing the mistakes that others make – is the way we learn , and through learning we make our lives better .
Learn from the mistakes I ’ve listed here , and have a better career and a better life .

We 've been curious to know how the Fox News formula applied to business news would work out .
Now we have an answer : not well .
Nine - month - old Fox Business Network is averaging 8,000 viewers during the day and 20,000 in primetime over the first three weeks of July , according to Nielsen numbers relayed by the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz .
The good news is that 's a 26 % leap over the 6,300 daily viewers the network was getting last fall .
The bad news is that it 's still a tiny fraction of CNBC 's 284,000 .
The prime time jump is little bigger -- it 's a 33 % increase over last fall 's average of 15,000 -- but not that meaningful .
That 's because like CNBC , Fox Biz is focused on daytime programing , when its target audience is supposedly watching for markets news .
CNBC averages 191,000 viewers in primetime .
What can Fox Biz do to improve ?
Get its channel into more homes :
So far , even with Rupert Murdoch 's leverage , the channel is in just 40 million homes , while CNBC in 96 million .
That 's 140 % more reach .
But something else is going to have to change , too : Even if you bumped up Fox 's ratings 140 % it still would n't be playing in CNBC 's league .
Fox is looking at the bright side .
" It 's a slow - growing business , but it 's a growing business , " says network EVP Kevin Magee .
He has a little reason for optimism : after its first nine months on the air in 1997 , Fox News was averaging just 14,000 viewers during the day and 25,000 viewers in primetime .
But so far , Fox Business Network is giving CNBC nothing to worry about .

JERUSALEM , May 29 ( Reuters ) – U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday he will seek to adopt novel Israeli methods , like behaviour - detection technologies , to better secure America ’s airports .
“ That ’s a scenario where Israel has a lot of experience , ” Chertoff said in an interview with Reuters .
“ I think that it is of interest to us to see if there is any adaptation there . ”
Israel ’s Ben-Gurion International Airport , known for its strict security measures , relies heavily on techniques that detect suspicious behaviour among travellers .
Chertoff said such methods , as well as Israeli technologies that detect explosives , are some of the things that may help protect U.S. airports and other public places against attacks .
Chertoff , at a conference in Jerusalem for public and homeland security ministers from around the world , signed an agreement with Israel to share technology and information on methods to improve homeland security .

" The driver sees this in the roadway , and they think that it ’s some protrusion up out of the roadway , and not a perfectly flat surface .
So they slow down before they drive over it . "
My editorial work keeps me hopping , so I ’m a bit late getting started on reporting about my trip last week to Bentonville , Arkansas , for Wal - Mart ’s annual Media Day and Shareholders ’ Meeting .
As always , it was a whirlwind of activity combining trips to company stores in the area , press meetings with company executives , and a little entertainment thrown in .
I skipped the Carrie Underwood / Keith Urban concert Thursday night , but did see Joss Stone , Jennifer Hudson and David Cook perform early Friday morning … with Queen Latifah handling the MC duties .
Yes , Wal - Mart does a fantastic job entertaining the troops , but my real interest was in further news on company sustainability initiatives .
Over the next week or so , I ’ll be reporting on those .
Today , I just wanted to provide some initial thoughts , and perhaps get the conversation going .
In case you have n’t noticed , the economy ’s in a bit of slump … and that means more people are turning to discount retailers for their basic needs and luxuries .
Sales figures are up for the company , and all of the executives that spoke at various portions of the media conference noted the company ’s founding value of saving people money .
At some points , I began to wonder just a bit if the much - heralded sustainability initiatives of the past few years were taking a back seat to it ’s ability to provide goods ( and services ) at low prices .
Is “ Save Money .
Live Better ” just a marketing slogan , or is it , as company executives claimed , a restatement of the company ’s mission ?
That ’s a question I want to explore as I look back on last week ’s event .
Over the past few years , I ’ve become more and more impressed by Wal - Mart ’s transformation .
As I note in the headline , though , an influx of customers because of tighter pocketbooks really does mean it ’s crunch time for the company .
It might be easy to forsake some of the promises made about doing business more sustainably .
Yet , the message was definitely there : executives from around the world almost always included sustainability initiatives in their presentations ( and our press packages came in Wal - Mart reusable shopping bags … with a bottle of concentrated laundry detergent ! ) .
Were these just words ?
I ’ll let you judge for yourself as a I present some of the stories I heard .
Obviously , at the Shareholders Meeting , executives had a friendly audience .
Still , when I talked to an associate walking into the meeting , and asked her if she ’d undertaken a “ personal sustainability project , ” she not only told me about her efforts to switch to CFLS and recycle , but also her pride in the company ’s movement in this direction .
It ’s the ripple effect that still gets me : Wal - Mart can make greener consumer choices the norm by setting standards for suppliers ; it can also educate consumers and shareholders at a massive level .
It ’s easy to focus on what the company ’s done wrong …
I still think we ’ve got reasons to be hopeful that they ’re moving in some really positive directions .
Stay tuned …

Nearly a year ago , we looked at the status of SystemTap in the context of Sun 's much - hyped DTrace tool .
Since that time there has been progress , but the basic problem still remains :
Linux does not have a good , ready - to - run answer to those wanting the equivalent functionality of DTrace .
Due to an apparent disconnect between the developers of SystemTap and the kernel hackers , tracing for the Linux kernel — never mind user space programs — is not up to the competition .
Both SystemTap and DTrace are tools meant to help administrators track down performance and other problems on production systems by instrumenting the kernel .
Because SystemTap has not matured to the point of easy usability , DTrace is often seen as a prime differentiator between Linux and Solaris .
In a posting to the ksummit - 2008 - discuss mailing list — where Kernel Summit topics are considered — Matthew Wilcox brought up the subject based on his experience at a recent PostgreSQL conference :
There was a lot of buzz around DTrace .
Sun and a couple of other companies have put DTrace hooks into postgres , so they now have some really useful canned queries .
If you 're running Solaris or MacOS , of course .
So there was a lot of talk about switching away from Linux .
This can't possibly be a good thing for us .
I do n't personally know what the state of our competing projects are , but clearly they have n't got their hooks into postgres ... at least not upstream .
Typically Linux has been in the forefront of interesting new technologies for free operating systems .
When Sun opened up Solaris , though , a few features jumped ahead of their Linux counterparts , in particular the ZFS filesystem and DTrace .
SystemTap is supposed to provide the tracing functionality while Btrfs is the leading candidate for a " next generation " filesystem .
But , so far , SystemTap has not lived up to its potential .
There are a few reasons for disappointment with SystemTap , some of which were pointed out by James Bottomley :
When I go around end users , I find people in two camps :
The ones who 've drunk the sun coolaid and wo n't take anything on linux that is n't a fully replicated dtrace ( sort of like windows people who demand the availability of outlook on linux ) and people who are migrating to Linux and trying to use systemtap for tracing .
These latter seem to have a number of genuine concerns including latency , the time it takes to actually go from command executing to functional trace , the inability to trace user programs ( dtrace can ) and concerns about the amount of perturbation the probes actually place inside the kernel .
Those are all valid concerns , but the biggest problem for users is that , unless they are knowledgeable about kernel internals , it is difficult to know how to use SystemTap .
A more simplified interface , one that is less reliant on kernel internals , needs to be created ; the way to do that is through the placement of static trace points in the kernel and the creation of " tapsets " to make them easily usable .
The SystemTap developers think the kernel hackers are in the best position to do that work .
Ted Ts'o agrees but sees some barriers :
The big thing that are missing are the tapsets — the macro libraries that allow a system administrator to use it to find and solve performance problems without being a kernel developer , and more importantly , the documentation for said macro libraries so a system administrator can actually use it . [ ... ] the real problem is n't as much kernel developers , it 's that ( a ) it 's too hard for many kernel developers to use ( and so many kernel developers are [ not ] using it ) , and ( b ) there are n't enough tapsets .
The latter is something that kernel developers can help solve , but unfortunately I 'm not sure discussing it at the Kernel Summit will necessarily lead to making forward progress .
If the kernel developers have trouble using SystemTap , they are unlikely to add the tapsets that would make it more usable for system administrators and others who have some general kernel knowledge but not enough to sensibly instrument it .
For people using distribution kernels — at least for the enterprise distributions and Fedora — it is only somewhat painful to get SystemTap up and running .
But kernel hackers tend to run their own kernels , often many different versions in a short period of time , so they need to be able to be easily build one that works with SystemTap and includes all of the debugging information that it requires .
SystemTap developer Frank Ch. Eigler has a long reply to many of the complaints in the thread .
It seems clear that the SystemTap folks and the kernel hackers have not been communicating — there are solutions to many of the problems that were cited .
They are in various states of readiness , but are mostly working .
So SystemTap is most of the way there for kernel tracing as long as you are well - versed in kernel internals , but that has been true for some time .
In order to get SystemTap to where it needs to be , the kernel hackers need to be involved .
Building the infrastructure and waiting for tapsets to magically appear is not a recipe for success .
The SystemTap hackers need to be engaging the kernel community , as well as distributions , to make the tool into something that gets used .
SystemTap can use static probe points , kernel markers — merged into 2.6.24 — but it is notable that no one has , as yet , made use of them .
A concerted effort needs to be made to make the tool more usable for the kernel developers who can , in turn , help make it more usable for others .
There is a clear problem when folks like Ts'o regularly try , but find it too difficult to be useful :
But maybe as more people try using it , they 'll discover some of these rough edges , and will start trying to fix it .
Every couple of months , I 've tried using it , and because it [ h ] as so many rough edges , I 've normally found it less work to debug the kernel using manual methods rather trying to make Systemtap work on my system and with my kernel development workflow .
It is a commonly heard complaint that while SystemTap is difficult to use , DTrace " just works " for Solaris ; Eigler responds :
Yeah , so I hear , but think about how different their target environment is .
Their kernel hardly changes ( several fixed APIs , ABIs ) : this has huge implications .
Their kernel was willing to insert probes ( ~ markers ) , a bunch of build system changes ( debug info subset transcribing ) .
Here in linux land , we suffer multifaceted tensions and it is hard to go toward a goal without obstructions ( well - meaning as they may be ) .
A bunch of third - party scripts are often conflated with " dtrace " , which is just a matter of growing the user community enough , and giving them a good tool to build on top of .
A growing set of runnable end - user scripts is already packaged with systemtap , intended for use by nonexperts , more help ( e.g. concise problem statements about what you 'd like to measure / see ) would be welcome .
Many administrators and other users of tracing facilities are not necessarily interested in kernel - level tracing , but would really like to be able to use the instrumented versions of things like PostgreSQL .
That is in the plan according to Eigler : " We aim to piggyback on these efforts by reusing the dtrace instrumentation calls embedded into postgres etc. , if at all possible . "
Until the rough edges can be smoothed on the kernel side , Bottomley wonders if it even makes sense to start considering user space :
Although there are differing opinions about what systemtap could and should do , it 's clear that it 's not working incredibly well for its design space : the kernel , so talking about extending it to userspace is a premature .
DTrace sounds like a nice working solution that has many uses and many happy users .
If one can ignore the self - congratulatory postings from its lead developer , it might be worth having in Linux , but that simply is not going to happen .
Paul
Fox is working on a port of DTrace to Linux , but that ignores the licensing realities that would never allow it to become part of Linux .
It also ignores the difficult path a DTrace port would face getting merged into the mainline .
( We hope to have an article from Mr. Fox on his DTrace porting work soon , stay tuned ) .
For all of the talk out of Sun about how they would love to make DTrace a part of Linux , they clearly made a choice to ensure that could not happen .
Even if any technical barriers were lifted , the CDDL is not compatible with the GPL .
It is perfectly fine as a free software license , but if you wish to get things into Linux , they must be licensed in a GPL - compatible way .
This was well understood at the time Sun freed Solaris , so this must have been a conscious decision .
Given how much their marketing organization likes to tout DTrace , it would seem to be a choice that Sun is quite happy with .
Linux will eventually get the tracing support it needs , in a way that is easily accessible to users , but it may take some time .
Conversations like the recent one on ksummit - 2008 - discuss are an important part of getting there .
It would appear that better support for the use cases of kernel developers will be forthcoming .
It is mostly a matter of documentation along with simplifying some of the building and installation issues .
Once the kernel hackers actually start using it , progress is likely to be fairly swift .
This is the way free software development works ; it generally does not track a straight path to a solution , but often wanders about in the solution space for a while .
It is highly unlikely that a development like DTrace could have come about in the way that it did in a true community - developed operating system .
For that you need everyone pulling in the same exact direction , which may be why Sun is reluctant to turn over much of the governance of Solaris to the community .
That may help them develop things more quickly , because there will be fewer barriers , but it wo n't help them to foster the kind of development community that characterizes Linux .
PUERTO MONTT , Chile , May 9 ( Reuters ) - A towering plume of ash from an erupting volcano in Chile 's remote Patagonia could collapse back down to devastate the surrounding area , a leading expert warned on Friday .
Luis Lara , a geologist and volcano expert with the government 's geology and mining agency Sernageomin , says his models show the vast column of ash , which has soared 7.5 miles ( 12 km ) into the air , at a critical stage .
A sudden collapse would shroud vast areas with hot gas , ash and molten rock , killing anything in its way .
Authorities have evacuated thousands of people from the immediate vicinity of Chaiten volcano , 760 miles ( 1,220 km ) south of the capital Santiago , and are forcibly removing people within a 30 mile ( 50 km ) radius .
Chaiten began erupting eight days ago for the first time in thousands of years .
" We are at a critical point of this phase given the characteristics ( of the eruption ) have remained the same for several days , " Lara said .
" The volcano is now at its limit and one possibility is that the column could collapse quickly , generating flows of pyroclastic material down its ravines , " he added .
" But there are also other scenarios , such as the energy of the eruption being released more gradually . "
In a worst case scenario , the flows of ash and fiery material could reach the fjord Chaiten sits on , sending a series of small waves fanning out toward settlements up to 125 miles ( 200 km ) away across the water .
Lara says the volcano could rumble on for years .
He suggested the town of Chaiten , 6 miles ( 10 km ) from the volcano and now deserted , should be moved .
" In an ideal world , I would move the town somewhere else more protected , " Lara said .
He would not risk living there .
The cloud has also caked towns on the Argentine side of the border with ash .
Satellite images show a white stripe smeared across the continent .
However ash that had drifted as far as Buenos Aires dissipated on Friday , and some airlines which canceled flights overnight resumed service .
Chile is home to 2,000 volcanoes , 500 of which experts say are potentially active .
Around 60 have erupted over the past 450 years .

I am truly reluctant to be so presumptuous as to tell Obama some ideas on how to improve his campaign .
This is a guy who only 4 years ago gave a rousing speech at the Democratic Convention , starting at that point to turn the Democratic party on its ear , kind of reminiscent to a student of history like me of the way Gandhi turned the British Empire on it is ear , and back in touch with the real people , its traditional base .
Money raising is far from my interests in Presidential Politics , but hey , this is still America , so therefore , I must note that Obama has raised more money than any candidate in American History .
So it might seem like arm chair politics or Monday morning football for anyone to offer any advice or to suggest changing the course or changing the tack might be in order , so that above all he does n't lose the idealistic and ideological base of his appeal and his power .
[ The AP reports that Barack Obama reversed a two - month downward trend by raising more and spending less .
He took in $ 52 million in June , more than twice the nearly $ 21.5 million raised by John McCain .
Obama had $ 72 million cash on hand to McCain 's $ 27 million .
The Politico points out that Obama raised $ 25 million on the last day of June alone ; his one - day haul represents nearly half of his monthly total and more than Republican rival John McCain generated for the entire month .
During the month , McCain did not have a single day in which he raised a million dollars .

num_n_113991.html ]
-------------------
Having said all of that , let me offer some strong advice , and I hope the 300 foreign affairs policy advisors , the pundits , and the professional political arm chairs and Monday morning quarterbarcks do n't leap to any conclusions beyond the obvious , which is that I want Obama to win , and then I want to see him overhaul the USA 's Foreign Policy and its entire image at the core of 7 billion peoples ' thinking .
This is decades over due , and really a dire situation internationally .
I try to make this major point as humbly as possible :
OBAMA REALLY NEEDS TO HAMMER WHAT BUSH AND CHENEY HAVE DONE TO THE U.S. ECONOMY FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS , BY DUMPING SO MANY BILLIONS IN WAR .
ONE LEVEL OF GOOD GOVERNMENT IS HOW YOU CHANNEL THE MONEY , AND THEY HAVE FAILLED REALLY BADLY .
WE MAY BE TOO LATE AND TOO FAR INTO THE LAST STAGES OF IMPERIALISM .
If that sounds too Marxist , too bad .
Marxian economic analysis is at the very core of the most successful historians and politicians , as a historical tool in determining what we are doing wrong , the downward spiral we are on in terms of the collapse of most of post World War II society .
In Hegel and Marx 's theories , this is simply called DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM .
And our brave military firing US missiles into not one , but a series of Afghanistan wedding parties , and within two more weeks , breaking into a home in Iraq a few days ago , and WHILE HE SLEPT : this is a disaster , not just " collateral damage . "
These kinds of things are happening repeatedly , and they make all Americans very ugly indeed , as Ugly as we have actually become , or as ugly as Halliburton , Brown and Root , and Blackwater have made us in the eyes of billions of people , for their ghastly excesses in Iraq and for the many mistakes by the military in Afghanistan .
The support for Obama 's Timetable in Iraq from the Iraqi President Maliki , even if he is kind of US Puppet , rather than for Bush 's vagueness : that is real progress , make no mistake .
Seeing Obama walking with Afghani President Karzai : he proved one obvious point : he has Presidential carriage , demeanor , and style .
This is urgent .
This is long overdue .
This is mandatory , not only for Americans , but for the rest of the entire world to further realize that Obama is a straightshooter , honest , and solutionary .
To not do so is to miss both the greatest opportunity and the most serious challenge any USA President has ever had .
The speech in Berlin might be the best place to start doing this , but even after : it will never be too late to take this course of action I am here proscribing !

By Tim Waggoner
SALEM , Oregon , June 4 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) - Lung cancer patient , Barbara Wagner , was recently notified that her oncologist - prescribed medication that would slow the growth of cancer would not be covered by the Oregon Health Plan ; the plan , however , she was informed , would cover doctor - assisted suicide should she wish to kill herself .
" Treatment of advanced cancer that is meant to prolong life , or change the course of this disease , is not a covered benefit of the Oregon Health Plan , " read the letter notifying Wagner of the health plan ’s decision .
Wagner says she was shocked by the decision .
" To say to someone , we ’ll pay for you to die , but not pay for you to live , it ’s cruel , " she told the Register - Guard .
" I get angry .
Who do they think they are ? "
This past Monday morning , however , Wagner had reason to rejoice .
A representative from the company that manufactures the treatment called the cancer patient to say they would give her the medication for free .
" I am just so thrilled , " she said .
" I am so relieved and so happy . "
Dr. Walter Shaffer , medical director of the state Division of Medical Assistance Programs , which administers the Oregon Health Plan , attempted to defend the health plan ’s decision .
" We ca n’t cover everything for everyone , " he said .
" We try to come up with polices that provide the most good for the most people . "
Shaffer then addressed a priority list that had been developed to ration health care .
" There ’s some desire on the part of the framers of this list to not cover treatments that are futile , " he said , " or where the potential benefit to the patient is minimal in relation to the expense of providing the care . "
According to an AP story on Wagner ’s case , local oncologists in Oregon have said that , despite the Health Services Commission ’s assertion that they were just clarifying policies already in place , healthcare practitioners have observed a sizable shift in policy in the way recurrent cancer is treated in the state .
Increasingly , say local oncologists , sufferers of recurrent cancer are not receiving coverage for chemotherapy .
They are always , however , eligible for state - funded assisted suicide .
Wesley J. Smith , a prominent conservative bioethicist , says that he was not surprised by the events .
" We have been warning for years that this was a possibility in Oregon .
Medicaid is rationed , meaning that some treatments are not covered .
But assisted suicide is always covered .
And now , Barbara Wagner was faced with that very scenario . "
Smith also mentioned a similar circumstance that had occurred in the past : " This is n’t the first time this has happened either .
A few years ago a patient who needed a double organ transplant was denied the treatment but would have been eligible for state - financed assisted suicide . "
Accessibility
If you 're blind or visually - impaired , let us know how we can make the game more accessible to you .
Figure 1 shows that the differential between the retail price of gasoline and the per-gallon cost of crude oil has recently dropped dramatically , leaving a much smaller margin to cover expenses and profit .
It is this shift that I am discussing in this article .
I see several possible explanations , including a long term shift in prices valuing diesel ( or " distillate " ) more highly than gasoline ; political pressure to keep gasoline prices low ; and integrated oil companies not really needing a high gasoline pricing margin to keep overall profits at an acceptable level .
I do not see ethanol as playing a significant role at this time .
Regardless of the explanation , refineries and gasoline stations that are not part of oil conglomerates may find this a difficult storm to weather .
In this post , I divide my observations into four sections :
1. General observations and background
2. Changes in world product demand and recent US consumption
3 . Who are the market players , and why this matters
4 . What might be ahead ?
In this post , I have not tried to address the question of how the futures market fits in with this situation .
If prices in the futures market align with what buyers and sellers of the physical products would pay , futures markets should n't be an issue .
If the futures market is tending to raise the price of some products and leave others artificially low , this could be contributing to unusual differentials that seem to be occurring now .
For example , if speculation is playing a role in the high price of crude oil , but is having a lesser impact on gasoline ( " RBOB " ) , it would seem like this could be causing dislocations of the type we are seeing .
Section 1 . General Observations and Background
There are several problems with trying to analyze very precisely how much margin refineries need to be profitable .
One problem is that refineries make a mixture of products .
Another is that one really needs to break out costs more finely than I am doing in this analysis , to analyze very precisely what is happening .
A third problem is that many of the costs , including refinery operation costs and some taxes , will vary with the price of crude oil .
Thus , one would expect an upward drift in pricing margins over time , as we are seeing for diesel and jet fuel in Figure 1 .
Clearly , the particular comparison figures make a difference also .
In Figure 1 , I am using average retail prices for regular gasoline , for diesel ( all types combined ) and spot prices for kerosine - type jet fuel at New York Harbor .
Gasoline , distillate ( which includes both diesel and home heating oil ) , and jet fuel are the three biggest categories of US petroleum products .
If we look at the output of all US refineries ( Figure 2 ) , we find that recent years , the distribution of the production of the various petroleum products has remained relatively constant .
Figure 2 . Breakdown of Production from US Refineries , 1993 - 2008
Figure 2 shows that gasoline production has remained in a tight band at 42 % to 44 % of US refinery output .
Distillate , which is used for both diesel fuel and heating oil , has gradually climbed from about 21 % of output in 1993 to 25 % of output in 2008 .
Jet fuel has been fairly constant at about 9 % of total production .
The " all other " category has declined from 24 % to 21 % , as distillate production has grown .
It seems to me that there are several reasons why shifts in production do n't happen very quickly .
For one , the mix of oil fields feeding our refineries changes only very slowly over time , and the particular oil going into a refinery is a significant determining factor of the mix of products coming out of the refinery .
For another , even if a refinery has " cracking " or " coking " capability so that it can change the mixture of products it produces , it is expensive to use , and only a part of the refinery output will use it .
Also , our built infrastructure uses a particular mix of products .
This mixture can change over time , but only fairly slowly .
What does this pricing shift mean for refineries ?
I think there are really two issues .
One is that margin for gasoline refining is dropping .
In fact , since we are looking at the difference between the retail price and the cost of crude , it is the whole top - to - bottom margin that is dropping , so there is less available not only for refineries , but for other operations such as gasoline stations .
There have been many reports in the news recently about gasoline stations closing because of financial problems .
The second issue is that margins for diesel and jet fuel do not seem to be rising enough to make up for the drop in the gasoline margin .
It is difficult to tell for certain , without knowing how much of the costs are fixed costs and how much are variable costs .
I would expect that costs of refining would be quite closely tied to the price of crude , because refining is very energy intensive .
If companies are looking at only the dollar spread , they may be underestimating how much their costs really will rise with higher crude prices , and think that the pricing margins for distillate and jet fuel are more adequate than they really are .
Because of the differences in margins by product , refineries may be able to improve their financial results if they can change their mix to generate more distillate and jet fuel , and less gasoline .
Overall , they may still come out behind in terms of profitability , if pricing margins for distillate and jet fuel have not risen enough to offset the decline in the gasoline margin .
Refineries that are producing a lot of gasoline now and lack the capability to change their mix will almost certainly suffer a loss of profitability with the current pricing margins .
Section 2 : Changes in world product demand and recent US consumption
Recent US consumption trends
If we compare US consumption of various oil products in the first four months of 2008 with the corresponding amounts for the first four months of 2007 , we find that US gasoline consumption dropped less than any other product .
Figure 3 . Decreases in US consumption by product , January - April 2008 compared to January - April 2007 .
Figure 3 indicates that consumption during the first four months of the year dropped by - 1.3 % for gasoline , - 3.9 % for distillate , and - 3.8 % for jet fuels .
Other products , not shown on Figure 3 include residual fuel oil , - 21.6 % ; asphalt , - 13.1 % ; and natural gas liquids , - 5.8 % .
Overall consumption of petroleum products decreased - 4.2 % , which is a huge change .
These amounts are calculated on an average daily basis , and reflect the fact that 2008 is a leap year .
Thus , what we are seeing is that gasoline , with a disproportionately low price increase , is holding up better in consumption than other products , with larger price increases .
Part of this is the fact that with the lower price increase , Americans have had less need to cut back on their demand .
Part of it , too , is that it has been possible to continue to get imports , even with this relatively low price increase , indicating that overseas demand for gasoline is not high , compared to other products .
Part of what is happening is that US exports of petroleum products are increasing .
In the case of distillate , we have shifted from being a net importer to a net exporter ( Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 . US Distillate Products Supplied ( Consumed ) , US Produced and Imports .
Years 1997 to 2007 are full years ; 2008 represents January - April 2008 average .
Four months is a fairly short time period , and I am not certain that shifts in consumption among the various petroleum products during this period are necessarily indicative of longer - term trends .
There is considerable seasonality in American 's automobile driving and in the use of heating oil , and this may be affecting the numbers .
It is interesting that gasoline prices have continued to stay disproportionately low , even after the summer driving season would normally have begun .
The world market is perhaps beginning to value distillate more highly , relative to gasoline , because of its greater energy content .
I think part of what may be happening , on a worldwide basis , is a change in the relative value of distillate and gasoline .
Gasoline started as the higher valued fuel , but is now becoming the lower valued fuel .
As I understand it , when the United States first began refining petroleum , gasoline was viewed as the premier product .
It was cleaner burning than diesel , and cars that ran on petroleum had quieter engines .
The majority of petroleum produced in the US was light sweet crude oil .
With such crude oil , it was easy to produce a high proportion of gasoline , with little refining effort .
With these considerations in mind , the US auto fleet was built using gasoline as its primary fuel .
Refineries were optimized for producing the maximum amount of gasoline .
The price of gasoline was set as high , or higher , than that for diesel .
Diesel was viewed as almost as a byproduct that could be sold at a lower price to support gasoline sales .
When petroleum was cheap and plentiful , this approach may have made sense .
The catch is that diesel is really the better value , in terms of the number of miles per gallon that vehicles are able to drive .
Part of this difference is because of the higher energy content of diesel relative to gasoline , and part of this is because diesel engines tend to be more efficient .
Another problem of the past -- the bad odor of diesel emissions -- has also been eliminated by removal sulphur from the diesel during the refining process .
Now that the price of petroleum is increasing , the consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the value of distillate fuel .
We see this in several areas :
• European countries many years ago recognized the greater inherent value of diesel compared to gasoline , and taxed the use of gasoline so as to discourage its use .
In recent years , there has been more and more shift toward diesel powered cars , as the lower cost and higher mileage of diesel cars becomes more important to consumers .
• India and China have also have adopted tax structures that favor the use of diesel cars over gasoline vehicles .
• Diesel is becoming the fuel of choice in a wide variety of applications around the world .
These include electric power generation ; backup power where power interruptions are a problem , and many industrial applications .
Recent cold weather also increased the demand for heating oil around the world , further adding to demand of distillates .
With these shifts , world demand for distillate is rising more rapidly than demand for gasoline .
Europe in particular tends to have left - over gasoline to export .
I would expect the amount of left - over gasoline from around the world to grow , or decline less , as it continues to be the less - favored product .
At his point , biofuels are not really an issue for distillates .
Costs are proving to be very high using palm oil or rape seed .
Thus , there is no possibility of increasing distillate availability using biofuels , unless there is a scientific breakthrough .
Ethanol impact
Other authors assume ethanol production is increasing gasoline supply , and that this may be helping to hold down gasoline prices .
While this is theoretically possible in the future , to date ethanol added to the gasoline mostly offsets MTBE taken out of the gasoline supply .
Figure 5 . US Gasoline Consumption ( Product Supplied ) , divided into US produced excluding Ethanol / MTBE , Ethanol / MTBE , and net imports .
Years 1997 to 2007 are full years ; 2008 represents January - April 2008 average .
When ethanol production was ramped up in the 2004 to 2006 period , one of the major purposes of ethanol was to act as a replacement for MTBE .
MTBE is an oxygenate that many states banned because it contributes to groundwater pollution .
MTBE is made from natural gas and had the side - benefit of extending the oil supply fairly cheaply .
The EIA provides data showing the total amount of oxygenates ( MTBE + ethanol ) added to the gasoline supply .
Between 2003 and 2007 these increased from 343,000 barrels a day to 374,000 barrels a day , an increase of 31,000 barrels a day .
This is hardly significant .
Of course , if one ignores the prior MTBE use , ethanol is adding to the fuel supply today .
In the future , ethanol is expected to further increase the gasoline supply .
Even if the amount is small , the higher supply may help hold down gasoline prices , and further exaggerate the shift in prices between gasoline and distillate that we are seeing .
Longer term , the effect of this will be to encourage refiners to produce more distillates and less gasoline .
Section 3 : Who are the market players , and why this matters
Refiners are the real buyers of crude oil
If one stops to think about it , the most direct factor determining crude oil demand is the number of refineries bidding for the crude .
In general , refineries would prefer to be at full production , except when they are off - line for maintenance .
If refineries believe that they cannot sell all of the product they are making at a satisfactory price , they might also choose to limit production .
One example of this would be refineries in China , where retail prices have been capped , but refineries must still buy crude oil at the market price .
China recently raised retail prices .
One might expect this to increase crude oil demand from refineries there , since they will now be able to sell their products at a better price .
Another example of refineries that would choose to limit their purchases is refineries that expect to lose money on the product mix that their refinery can produce , given current pricing margins .
An example of this would be almost any US refinery that makes mostly gasoline using sweet light crude such as WTI , and is not set up to change its product mix significantly .
If a refinery is part of a vertically integrated oil company , it may be willing to live with very low refining margins , because even with these low refining margins , the profitability of the company as a whole is adequate compared to non-petroleum companies .
In fact , vertically integrated petroleum companies may actually prefer these low refining margins , because with " normal " refining margins , there would be great hue and cry for excess profits taxes on these companies .
If margins are low , vertically integrated companies may be using refining losses to offset part of the profits generated by , say , producing oil at $ 50 a barrel and selling the refined products at current prices .
I doubt that any politician would challenge artificially low refining margins for gasoline , since it means lower gas prices for constituents .
In fact , pressure from politicians may contribute to the relatively low gasoline prices we see .
When it comes to buying gasoline overseas , these lower prices may not a huge problem , because the gasoline that is on the market is surplus gasoline , produced as part of the refining mix .
Producers of the gasoline may be willing to take any reasonable price , if other buyers are not available .
The problem , of course , is that if gasoline prices are depressed for any reason , non-vertically integrated refineries are at a huge disadvantage .
They are forced to buy crude oil at a high price and sell gasoline at a low price , because they have no other choice , and have no other companies in the group to share the poor results with .
Some non-integrated refiners can change their product mix to optimize profitability .
These refiners may do better , although there is no guarantee that they will be profitable .
If integrated petroleum companies are able to live with low enough margins , it is possible that it will be virtually impossible for non-integrated companies to produce a product mix that will provide an acceptable profit level .
Local service stations are intermediate buyers of gasoline .
It seems to me that the situation with service stations is not all that different from the situation with refiners .
The gasoline produced by various refineries is placed in the pipeline , and service stations purchase it .
The service stations that are owned as part of vertically integrated operations may be willing to live with a very low margin between the retail price of gasoline and the wholesale price of gasoline , because the loss can be offset against profits elsewhere .
Non-vertically integrated gas stations are put in a difficult spot , because they have to compete for customers with the vertically integrated gasoline stations .
Quite often , there are two gas stations on a single corner .
If one station sells regular gasoline for $ 4.09 a gallon , it is difficult for a nearby station to sell gas at $ 4.29 a gallon .
Even $ 4.19 is a stretch .
Section 4 : What might be ahead ?
It is not clear how long the very low refining margin for gasoline might last .
If underlying issue is a shift to greater demand for distillate and jet fuel , relative to gasoline , it could take years to completely resolve .
If political influences are involved , it is possible that the situation could resolve after the next election .
If refining margins continue at their current levels , I would expect many bankruptcies among refiners that are not integrated with companies that also produce crude oil .
This could happen around the world , since the issue is not particularly a US only issue .
The refiners at greatest risk of financial difficult are those that currently make primarily gasoline and lack the capability of switching to other products .
EIA data indicates that utilization rates in the United States have been drifting downward , as shown in Figure 6 .
This might indicated overcapacity of certain types of refineries .
Figure 6 . US Refinery Utilization
It is possible that the failure of a few refineries making primarily gasoline ( and lack the capability of switching their product mix ) would help get refinery supply back in line demand , at least with respect to refinery capacity for light crude .
The smaller number of refineries for light crude would reduce the number of companies bidding for light crude , and would therefore cause its price to drift lower .
Profit margins for remaining refineries would tend to rebound if there is less competition , and would help get the situation back to more normal pricing margins .
A problem might occur if there are too many refinery failures .
It is theoretically possible that the world could be left with inadequate refining capacity if an excessive number of refineries fail .
I expect that at least some governments would step in before they allowed a local refinery to fail , since output of a local refinery is often the source of local petroleum products .
If governments get involved , pricing margins could remain distorted for a long period .
I expect that quite a few service stations are likely to fail also , especially ones that are not part of integrated companies .
The failure of a few service stations is likely to have little impact , except in rural areas where service stations are rare .
In these rural areas , some people may find it necessary to drive long distances to find a service station .
If diesel is gaining in demand relative to gasoline , I would expect the price for sweet medium grades of crude to rise closer to the price of sweet light crude oils , since medium crude yields a higher proportion of distillates and jet fuel .
This shift in crude oil prices will tend to help get refining margins back to a more normal level .
If there are failures of non-integrated refiners and service stations , these are likely to start fairly soon , if refining margins remain low .
Refineries and service stations are likely to find it difficult to maintain adequate credit facilities to borrow the funds they need to buy crude or gasoline .
Once they lose their lines of credit , they are likely to go out of business quickly .
These are ideas of mine .
I would be interested in hearing readers ' ideas as well .
Some of you have a lot more hands on knowledge of the situation than I do .
I ’ve started a new Python project called Py65 .
It aims to provide building blocks for modeling 65 xx microcomputer systems in software , with a focus on homebuilt hardware .
Using simulation , embedded systems software can be developed and tested much faster .
In its current form , Py65 supports the original NMOS 6502 microprocessor from MOS Technology .
The venerable 6502 and variants of it powered such famous microcomputers as the Commodore 64 , game systems like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) , as well as thousands of consumer and embedded devices today .
I have n’t released a package for Py65 yet but I ’ll be doing this after some organizational changes are complete .
For now , you can get it from its Subversion repository linked from the Py65 page on Ohloh .
The Python interactive interpreter itself can be used as a monitor :
>>> from py65.mpu6502 import MPU >>> mpu = MPU ( ) >>> mpu < 6502 : A=00 , X=00 , Y=00 , Flags=20 , SP=ff , PC=0000 > >>> mpu.memory [0x0000:0x0001 ] = ( 0x69 , 0x16 ) # => $ 0000 ADC # $ 16 >>> mpu.step ( ) < 6502 : A=16 , X=00 , Y=00 , Flags=20 , SP=ff , PC=0002 > >>> from py65.mpu6502 import MPU >>> mpu = MPU ( ) >>> mpu < 6502 : A=00 , X=00 , Y=00 , Flags=20 , SP=ff , PC=0000 > >>> mpu.memory [0x0000:0x0001 ] = ( 0x69 , 0x16 ) # => $ 0000 ADC # $ 16 >>> mpu.step ( ) < 6502 : A=16 , X=00 , Y=00 , Flags=20 , SP=ff , PC=0002 >
The simulator currently supports all legal NMOS 6502 opcodes and I have written a large unit test suite to verify its core .
Most of its tests look like this one :
def test_bne_zero_set_does_not_branch(self ) : mpu = MPU ( ) mpu.flags |= cpu.ZERO mpu.memory[0x0000:0x0001 ] = ( 0xD0 , 0x06 ) #=> BNE +6 mpu.step ( ) self.assertEquals(0x0002 , mpu.pc ) def test_bne_zero_set_does_not_branch(self ) : mpu = MPU ( ) mpu.flags |= cpu.ZERO mpu.memory[0x0000:0x0001 ] = ( 0xD0 , 0x06 ) #=> BNE +6 mpu.step ( ) self.assertEquals(0x0002 , mpu.pc )
Py65 ’s own unit tests hint at what tests for your own assembly language programs could look like .
I am especially interested in unit testing my own embedded software and I will be working on an assertion vocabulary and test helpers for this .
There are a lot of possibilities for what could be done with Py65 .
For now , I plan to include a system for mapping virtual devices into the microprocessor ’s address space , add more hooks into the simulator , and include support for additional 65 xx family hardware .
Py65 does not include an assembler .
If you need one , I recommend André Fachat ‘s excellent xa assembler which is currently maintained by Cameron Kaiser .
This is an outrage and must be stopped !
The robot barman , called Mr Asahi , debuted at Selfridges in London , serving up Asahi beer to the locals .
I am totally serious .
The 1st problem with the robot barman :
He serves shitty beer .
Asahi is bad Budweiser on a good day .
Calling it " warm piss " is a compliment .
2nd problem :
It 's freaking weird looking .
Those eyes make me want to reach over and steal all the pints it 's pouring without leaving a tip .
Wait , that 's good thing .
3rd problem : No boobs .
4th problem : ( see 3rd problem . )
5th problem : Waste of human talent .
Would n't society have been better off if these scientist spent their time on more noble pursuits ?
Like inventing a robot that helps wheel chair bound people , perfecting robotic prosthetic devices or by making a giant laser that could blow up Earth from the Moon ?
Eviilll !
In short , the day robots replace humans , is the day I quit drinking .

Fifteen Georgian soldiers were exchanged for five Russian soldiers Nato foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels for emergency talks to discuss how the alliance should respond to Russia 's military action in Georgia .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband has said Nato ministers agreed Russia had broken international law in its conflict with Georgia .
The OSCE says both Russia and Georgia have now agreed to let 20 military observers in Georgia .
A column of Russian tanks has been seen pulling out of the town of Gori .
Mr Miliband , who left the Nato meeting early to fly to Tbilisi , said the outcome showed real Nato unity : " The Nato membership was clear that Russia had violated international laws as well as the rules of the international game . "
Russia had to abide by the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops from Georgian soil , he said .
The alliance was set to offer new practical and political support for the government in Tbilisi , and Georgia would be given a clear route map to Nato membership , he said .
Russia 's refusal to withdraw its forces ahead of this meeting had been a big unifying force within the alliance , he added .
See map of the region Earlier , officials in Tbilisi said there was no evidence that Russian troops were leaving Georgian territory .
But Moscow has said that while it has started to pull back its troops in line with the ceasefire deal , Georgia has not .
A Russian military spokesman did not confirm that Russian forces had taken control of the commercial port at Poti on Georgia 's Black Sea coast - as alleged by Georgian authorities earlier on Tuesday - but said that at least 20 armed men in Georgian uniforms had been detained there .
In Brussels , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said 20 observers would supplement the current nine observers already based in South Ossetia , according to the organisation 's chairman , Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb , who was speaking on the sidelines of the Nato talks .
Prisoner swap Earlier in an apparent gesture of goodwill , Russian and Georgian troops exchanged prisoners at a checkpoint near the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about security in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Nato 's Russia dilemma Day - by - day : Georgia - Russia crisis Georgia left reeling Fifteen Georgian soldiers for five Russian soldiers took place at a Russian checkpoint in Igoeti , about 30 km ( 18 miles ) away from Tbilisi , the Georgian capital .
The BBC's Helen Fawkes , at the scene , saw two injured Russians , brought to the checkpoint by ambulance , carried on stretchers by Russian soldiers before being put onto waiting helicopters and taken away .
Two of the Russians were pilots who had been shot down , Georgian officials told the BBC .
A few minutes ' walk from the site of the exchange , a noisy protest was held by several hundred Georgians demanding that Russia withdraw its forces , our correspondent adds .
The conflict broke out on 7 August when Georgia launched an assault to wrest back control of the Moscow - backed breakaway region of South Ossetia , triggering a counter - offensive by Russian troops who advanced beyond South Ossetia into Georgia 's heartland .
A ceasefire was signed at the weekend , with Moscow pledging to begin pulling back its troops on Monday , but correspondents say there has so far been little sign of any large - scale force withdrawal .
Nato rift
As Nato's 26 foreign ministers meet in Brussels , the BBC's Jonathan Marcus says there is disagreement among the alliance as to how to respond , so the focus will be on where members can agree .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The sight of GWB [ US President George Bush ] complaining about Russia 's " disproportionate use of force " is hilarious Max , London
It is thought that in one camp , the UK , Canada , the US and most Eastern European member states will seek a tough stance on Russia , but most of Western Europe , led by France and Germany , is expected to be more cautious of harming ties with Moscow .
Flying to the Nato meeting , Ms Rice told reporters on Monday : " We have to deny Russian strategic objectives , which are clearly to undermine Georgia 's democracy , to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy Georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the Georgian state . "
Nato is also expected to offer more humanitarian aid and proposals on how to rebuild Georgian infrastructure damaged in the conflict .
Washington has denied claims from Moscow that it is out to wreck the Nato - Russia Council - a consultative panel set up in 2002 to improve ties between the former Cold War enemies .

What are these ?
Vice President Cheney will speak at the Republican National Convention next month in St. Paul on the same night as President Bush , according to representaives for the vice president and John McCain 's campaign .
" The vice president looks forward to participating in the Republican National Convention and continuing to work for the election of Sen. McCain and other Republican candidates in the coming months , " Cheney spokeswoman Megan Mitchell said in a statement .
McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker told Politico that Cheney would speak on Monday , Sept. 1 , the first day of the GOP convention , prior to the president 's remarks .
The decision to extend an invitation to Cheney comes days after reports that the deeply unpopular vice president would not appear at the convention .
McCain and Cheney have clashed in recent years , particularly over the treatment of terrorist detainees , and the GOP nominee has repeatedly sought to tie Barack Obama to the energy bill fathered by the vice president .
The two veteran politicians , colleagues in the House of Representatives decades ago , have not appeared together a single time during the campaign .
Asked earlier this year what role Cheney would play in McCain 's campaign , Hazelbaker only said : “ John McCain will always treat the vice president with respect . ”

By the age of 18 years , two in every five South African schoolboys report being forced to have sex , mostly by female perpetrators .
A new study , reported in BioMed Central 's open access journal International Journal for Equity in Health , reveals the shocking truth about endemic sexual abuse of male children that has been suspected but until now only poorly documented .
Neil Andersson and Ari Ho-Foster , of the CIET trust in Johannesburg , carried out the research in 1,200 schools across the country at the end of 2002 .
According to Andersson " This study sought to document the prevalence of sexual violence among school - going males .
We found a marked difference between the provinces of South Africa , with the least economically developed province , Limpopo , suffering the highest rates and the most developed area , Western Cape , the lowest " .
There were also systematic differences between rural and urban areas in frequency and type of perpetrator .
Some 28 % of victims said a non-family member or teacher was the perpetrator .
Another 28 % had been forced by a fellow student , while 20 % had been abused by a teacher and 18 % by an adult family member .
The authors warn that " the likely consequence of all this for South African society is the multiplication of sexual abuse , since it is well established that people who have been sexually abused are more likely to become abusers themselves .
One in ten schoolboys who took part in the study admitted they had forced sex on someone else " .
The authors pointed out that until to 2007 , forced sex with male children in South Africa did not count as rape , but as ' indecent assault ' , a much less serious offence .
They welcomed the change in legislation as a very necessary first step , but they said that " this is far more than a legal issue " , and suggested bringing it to the open and raising awareness among South Africans .
" Most of all , " says Andersson , " the rape of children calls for decisive investment in prevention .
Reducing overall sexual violence will likely also pay dividends in reduction of HIV / AIDS . "
The authors also observed that , " as it becomes more acceptable for male children to report sexual abuse , we have to expect a massive increase in workload for help services like Childline .
They will need support to meet this demand " .
TWO weeks before leaving to compete in the Olympics , American archer Brady Ellison waded into a pool not far from the Olympic Training Centre in Chula Vista , California , and was baptised as a Christian .
In the water with him was Kisik Lee , the US archery team 's head coach and a Christian who has become a spiritual guide for Ellison , 19 , and the larger group of athletes who train and live full - time at the centre .
During the Olympics , Lee and at least three of the five US archers competing in Beijing have met each day to sing hymns and read from the Bible , and to attend church in the chapel at the Olympic Village .
A few weeks ago , a friend of mine told me about his wonky laptop .
It was a familiar story .
His newish Vista box had , without much warning , begun collapsing into a blue - screen funk on almost a daily basis .
He went on to explain that he'd spent countless hours on the phone with Dell support techs , all of whom were kind , polite , and intent on being helpful .
The problem , of course , was that none of them had actually helped at all .
We were near my friend 's office , so we stopped in so he could show me the laptop .
I was startled by how new it was .
" When did you get this ? " I asked .
" April , " he replied .
It was early June .
The PC was not even three months old .
The blue screens had begun within a few weeks of owning the one of PCMag 's favorites ( Cisco Cheng gave it four out of five stars ) .
I asked my friend the usual questions :
Had he installed any unusual apps , visited any odd sites , or opened an e-mail attachment that he probably should n't have ?
His response : " No .
It happens when I use the browser . "
That seemed somewhat specific .
In my experience , it 's usually pretty hard to recreate a blue - screen experience .
But my friend walked me through a simple series of steps
" I start it up , open the browser , visit this site [ one chosen from his favorites in IE7 ] , and then . "
He trailed off as the system lapsed into a blue - screen coma .
I was stunned .
Rarely had I seen a consumer so expertly recreate a PC malfunction .
Holding a sheaf of papers in his hand , my friend pointed out notes from six different multi- hour support calls .
He 'd recorded the names of the support techs , as well as the time , date , and duration of each call .
Each support tech had tried something different .
For example , even though the PC came with security software , one had him install new protection from Trend Micro .
In fact , there was a lot of utility installing and uninstalling .
None of it worked .
At no time did the techs offer to take the PC back .
That 's not too surprising since no manufacturer wants to get back every PC with a problem .
Typically , system issues arise from user ignorance or a simple setting change that 's easily reversed or altered .
For my friend , though , this was not the case .
I spent 45 minutes looking through the systems ' processes in the Task Manager to see if I could find anything that could be hijacking his system or causing what I assumed was a driver collision leading to the blue screens .
I found nothing . 
In the end , the PC was returned to Dell , and my friend got a new laptop that works .
This brings me back to my original question :
Are some PCs born bad ?
Are they , like bad cars fresh off the assembly line , lemons ?
Some of the results from our recent Service and Reliability survey support this notion .
Nearly 20,000 PC
Magazine readers responded to our questions about their experiences with new laptops and desktops ( as well as a host of other product categories ) .
In the case of one manufacturer , HP , 2.3 percent of desktops and 3 percent of laptops needed to be replaced entirely .
My friend falls into the 2.8 percent of Dell laptop owners whose equipment needed to be .
I 've heard other stories about new PCs that have gone awry , and with so many systems sold each year , this is probably to be expected .
Honestly , my own still relatively new PC has certain issues that persist to this day .
For example , the wireless mouse and keyboard have a heck of a time communicating with the wireless USB dongle , despite being just 5 feet away from one another .
Here 's a second example :
The multiformat media card reader regularly acts as if it does n't exist .
I plug in an SD or compact flash card and nothing happens .
If I had more time , I guess I 'd contact HP tech support , but I usually forget about these issues until I 'm once again sitting down in front of the PC ( which , at home , is not nearly as often as it is for my wife ) .
Then I grumble and remind myself that I have to contact HP .
Still , why does n't the damn thing work ?
But I digress .
If we accept the fact that some of the PCs that come off the assembly line are duds , should Acer , Dell , HP , Lenovo , and other PC manufacturers ' support techs also be able to recognize this ?
If so , then they'd know by the second 2 - hour call that this is a problem that can't be solved and they should simply take back the PC .
A new system can go to the frustrated customer and then Dell , for example , could take the lemon , tear it apart , and see exactly where those malfunctioning parts reside .
In the end , the PC manufacturer gains some valuable information for future system builds , and they satisfy someone who is now more likely to remain a customer and buy another Dell system in the future .
I doubt this will happen .
Most PC makers seem to believe it's more cost - effective to have some guy in India try gamely to coax you into believing the problem is with you and not your PC .
The problem wo n't be solved , but the PC company may be willing to replace a part or two to see if that helps .
Eventually , the system will be too old to return and the consumer will either figure out workarounds or give up in disgust .
" Politics stops at the water ’s edge " is an old aphorism that aptly describes the history and current trend of American politics .
The period marking the run-up to World War II was the last time we saw any meaningful discussion of America ’s role in the world .
Ever since that famous victory , the interventionist consensus has been bipartisan and broad , at least in elite circles .
All the newspaper editors , the TV anchors , the policy wonks , and the bloggers - of - note agree : we must go global .
The only other choice is a debilitating " isolationism , " economic as well as diplomatic - military , that would consign us to an autarkic well of loneliness .
This narrative has dominated the foreign policy discourse lo these many years and given rise to what other writers have referred to as " the imperial presidency , " the extra-constitutional bloating of the executive authority .
This tendency has been taken to its ultimate extreme by the Bush administration , whose legal theorists impart to the president near - dictatorial powers in wartime .
Given what ought to be the GOP ’s signature slogan  wartime all the time  the implications for the survival of the republic are ominous .
However , it was a Democrat  Harry Truman  who set the fatal precedent when he called American troops to defend South Korea without bothering to go to Congress for permission .
Ever since then the precedent has not only held , it has gone largely unchallenged .
Politics may indeed stop at the water ’s edge , but a president ’s authority really begins there : he is the supreme arbiter of our foreign policy , a virtual dictator in that vital realm , whereas his authority over domestic policy is not even remotely comparable .
This brazen Bonapartism is merely the logical outgrowth of a foreign policy initially taken up with alacrity by the Democrats : first , with Woodrow Wilson at their head , and later on with FDR leading the charge .
Both dragged us into easily avoidable foreign wars .
Both cracked down on internal opposition , jailing antiwar protesters , instituting censorship via U.S. government control of the mails , and utilizing British and other undercover agents to neutralize the opposition .
This latter factor  the role of foreign agents  played a much greater part than is usually credited to the Brits , whose underground operation in the U.S. was detailed in Thomas E. Mahl ’s classic study , Desperate Deception : British Covert Operations in the U.S. , 1939 - 44 .
( Gore Vidal wrote a wonderful novel with this subject as background ) .
Setting up an extensive network among the Anglophile elites who dominated the U.S. ruling class , especially in the Northeast , British agents organized a broad array of pro-interventionist front groups , infiltrated and disrupted antiwar organizations , and were instrumental in launching a smear campaign against prominent war opponents .
Today , the Anglophiles who once governed us have given way to new elites , who are even less constrained by the traditional limits imposed on foreign lobbyists by law , custom , and propriety .
In the old days , all of this was done covertly , as the subtitle of Mahl ’s book puts it , while today American politicians think nothing of taking foreign money and becoming militant advocates of their paymasters ’ cause .
Look at John McCain ’s relationship with Randy Scheunemann , the paid lobbyist for Georgia , who has so many intimate connections to the military - industrial complex and its various front groups that he is a kind of one - man War Party all by himself .
Scheunemann is McCain ’s chief foreign policy adviser , and , given the candidate ’s full - throated fulminations against the allegedly revived Russian " threat , " the Georgia lobby is certainly getting its money ’s worth .
This lobby ’s power and influence is not limited to the GOP .
Although the Republicans have certainly taken up their cause with inordinate vehemence , the Democrats are far from immune .
Joe Biden , before being elevated to co-Messiah status alongside Barack Obama , had just returned from a quick trip to Tbilisi , where , with other Democratic leaders , including Rep. Howard Berman of California , he pledged " solidarity " with the Georgian invaders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , egging Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on to further provocations .
Both Biden and Berman support Georgia ’s proposed membership in NATO , a move that would pledge us  and the Europeans  to ensuring and maintaining Georgia ’s " territorial integrity . "
What this means , in reality , is that we are going to go to war with the nuclear - armed Russkies over the issue of maintaining national boundaries set by Joseph Stalin , Georgia ’s own homeboy  with us defending Stalin ’s legacy and the Russians eager to break with it .
It was Stalin , after all , who embedded Ossetia and Abkhazia in what he called " Georgia "  all the better to keep them from getting too uppity for their own ( and the Kremlin ’s ) good .
The Georgia lobby and the Israel lobby have much in common , including key supporters and personnel , as well as geopolitical and economic links .
Israeli defense companies , which are virtually part of the Israeli state , armed the Georgians , and the IDF trained Georgian troops in preparation for the day they would  as the mainstream media puts it  " retake " ( i.e. , invade and crush ) the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Aside from the close relationship between these two U.S. puppets , both Georgia and Israel have an interest in stoking the fires of militant interventionism in American politics , as the crusading impulse helps their respective causes .
Once the Americans begin to wonder where all this military and diplomatic support to troublesome and quarrelsome allies is getting them , the jig is up  which is why , for example , the Georgians are hard at work in Denver , as the New York Times reports , meeting with Democratic Party honchos and making their case with a fair amount of success .
The Russians are in Denver , too , but have limited their goals to damage control , and they are n’t likely to make much progress .
In one of the most successful inversions of reality ever attempted , the Western media has convinced its audience  and even itself  that Russia invaded Georgia , instead of Georgia invading South Ossetia .
The bombing and devastation of Tskhinvali , the South Ossetian capital , never happened , according to our media .
The dead are denied or disdained by Western " observers . "
In any case , the Georgia lobby and its allies do n’t want us to watch what is going on in the region very closely .
They ’d rather we stuck to the simplistic narrative of Big Bad Russia versus Poor Little Democratic Georgia .
That is how the War Party operates , and they are quite good at it .
Their success is due , in large part , to the ignorance of the American public when it comes to complex issues centered on the internal struggles of obscure overseas nations , which naturally very few of us understand .
So we invent a convenient narrative , one that rationalizes a policy decided in advance , which is then sold to the American people under false pretenses .
The pygmies who rule us would have us forget or discount George Washington ’s famous warning , in his " Farewell Address "  which they deride as archaic  that " nothing is more essential than that permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others , should be excluded ; and that , in place of them , just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated .
The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave .
It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection , either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest .
Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury , to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage , and to be haughty and intractable , when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur .
Hence , frequent collisions , obstinate , envenomed , and bloody contests . "
By encouraging Saakashvili in his invasion of South Ossetia , and now indulging in the spectacle of no less than three major American political figures traveling to Tbilisi to pledge their " solidarity "  Cindy McCain and Dick Cheney , as well as Biden  this rule against " passionate attachments " is being thrown by the wayside .
Our politicians are utterly heedless that this " gives to ambitious , corrupted , or deluded citizens ( who devote themselves to the favorite nation ) , facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country , without odium , sometimes even with popularity ; gilding , with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation , a commendable deference for public opinion , or a laudable zeal for public good , the base or foolish compliances of ambition , corruption , or infatuation . "
Washington towers so far above the likes of Biden , Cheney , and their colleagues in both parties that the distance can only be measured in light years .
As America stumbles into the next Cold War , waxing rhapsodic about the alleged virtues of Georgian " democracy " and provoking the Russians needlessly , the words of the Founding Father have special relevance for today .
The problem with our foreign policy and the making of it is that the most vocal , the most motivated , and the most well - funded groups make a lot of noise  and provoking a war requires maximum noise - making , 24/ 7 .
That ’s what the War Party is up to these days , and that ’s why Antiwar.com is around , standing guard on the battlements of truth .
Too many Americans get their " news " filtered through the distorting lens of a bipartisan " consensus " that rationalizes a foreign policy of perpetual war and enables an endlessly preachy arrogance .
Antiwar.com reports the real news , and does so without fear or favor .
We are the necessary antidote to a media concoction of half war propaganda , half unverified rumor  but our continued existence is by no means guaranteed .
You must have noticed that we ’ve been conducting our summer fundraising drive for the past two weeks  and that we have yet to make our goal of $ 70,000 .
Now , that figure is not some arbitrary number , arrived at by consulting the stars .
We ’re consulting with our accountant , and , given the parlous state of our finances , the outlook does n’t look all that bright .
$ 70,000 is just what we require to make it through the next few months or so , with not much to spare .
So , unless you come through and give us the support we need , you ’ll begin to see cutbacks  big cutbacks  in our coverage .
This is something we can ill afford to do at this juncture  not with fresh war clouds darkening the horizon and a crucial presidential election this November .
Yes , we ’ve been around since 1995 , but that ’s no guarantee we ’ll continue to be around for much longer  because , unlike the War Party , we do n’t have the big foundations supporting us with grants , nor do we have any corporate sponsors .
We just have you : your tax - deductible donations are all that stand between Antiwar.com and oblivion .
I appeal to our readers and supporters : the need is urgent .
So give today , as much as you can , as soon as you can  because you know that a world without Antiwar.com would be a strange , confusing , and doubly dangerous place .
Contribute today .
In a stunning development which fell with the silence of a feather yesterday , 9 Republicans broke with their iron - fisted party to put country first , and voted to send Rep.
Dennis Kucinich ’s article of impeachment HR 1345 to the Judiciary , where Chairman John Conyers will hold hearings on abuses of power by the Bush administration , according to the Congressional Quarterly ’s CQToday .
Ten Republicans abstained in this critical moment , while only 5 Dems did .
The vote was neck and neck at many moments , with “ Nays ” pulling ahead twice .
Those Republicans are ( Yea 238 – Nay 180 ) :
Congressman Kevin Brady ( TX )
Congressman Wayne Gilchrest ( MD )
Congressman Walter B. Jones ( NC )
Representative Don Manzullo ( IL )
U.S. Congressman Tim Murphy ( PA )
Congressman Ron Paul ( TX )
Congressman Dave Reichert ( WA )
Congressman Christopher Shays ( CT )
Representative Mike Turner ( OH )
One of the Republicans , Walter Jones , represents Camp LeJeune in North Carolina , one of the largest Marine bases in the country , and one which has borne heavily the sacrifice of the Iraq War .
Sixteen years after his father was denied a speaking part at a Democratic convention because his anti-abortion views led him to oppose Bill Clinton ’s candidacy , Senator Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania told the convention Tuesday night that Senator Barack Obama could bring together supporters and opponents of abortion rights .
Mr. Casey is , like his father , former Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania , a Roman Catholic who opposes abortion .
He was invited to speak as part of a broad effort by the Obama campaign to reach out to religious voters and anti-abortion Democrats and independents .
Mr. Casey spent most of his seven minutes at the podium praising Mr. Obama and saying that his Republican opponent , Senator John McCain , would extend the Bush - Cheney record .
But he also addressed the abortion question head on .
“ Barack Obama and I have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion , ” Mr. Casey said .
“ But the fact that I ’m speaking here tonight is testament to Barack ’s ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him . ”
For eight years , Arnold Kim has been trading gossip , rumor and facts about Apple , the notoriously secretive computer company , on his Web site , MacRumors.com .

Dr. Kim’s
Web site now attracts more than 4.4 million people and 40 million page views a month , according to Quantcast , making it one of the most popular technology Web sites .
It is enough to make Dr. Kim hang up his stethoscope .
This month he stopped practicing medicine and started blogging full time .
“ In some ways I ’ve neglected the site for so long , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ Now that I actually have a chance to work on it full time , there ’s a good chance it can grow more . ”
On June 20 , 2008 , an unusual , early summer lightning storm sparked over 1400 fires in California .
According to state wildfire maps , currently 489 fires are burning .
The reduction in the number of fires is not because they have been put out , but because these blazes have merged .
For example , the Hell ’s Half Complex , which threatens my home and has prompted the sheriff to issue a mandatory evacuation , originated as 17 fires that have now grown together into one fire over 10,000 acres with 35 % containment .
11 California counties have received disaster declaration from President Bush , who will be touring Northern California today .
These fires started naturally and are probably the kind of fires that occurred naturally before massive fire suppression efforts began in the west a hundred years ago .
After a nice Memorial day soaking , the foliage here was pretty green when the lightning struck .
These fires have been smoldering and cleaning up the forest , except where they are threatening homes .
Klamath - Siskiyou
Wild explains it best :
Fire has been an integral component to the function of biodiversity for millennia .
Fires burn in a diversity of patterns and intensities , and are influenced by numerous factors such as fuels , temperature , terrain and moisture .
Many of these fires are close to communities and firefighters are doing their best to protect lives and property .
Once the smoke has cleared , we may find that many of these fires in back country forests were ecologically beneficial as fire clears out understory vegetation , burns a natural mosaic pattern and leaves behind a healthier forest .
Four weeks later , things are changing with hot , drier air expected in the region ; these fires wo n’t be out until rain comes in October .
Slow burning , healthy fires are turning into uncontrollable nightmares .
Decades of old - growth logging and a 100 years of fire suppression have created highly flammable forests that are not natural at all .
Authentic fuel reduction prevents hot , mega fires .
This does not equate to logging ; however , it means that small fuels are reduced , especially near communities .
Ecologically destructive logging projects are often disguised as fuels reduction , but they leave the forest more prone to high intensity fires .
What needs to happen to deal with the increase in western wildfires , as predicted by climate change reports , as well as the lack of resources currently available to fight these fires , is small diameter tree removal and brush reduction in our forests .
Reducing ladder fuels is crucial to preserving our forests during naturally occurring fire events .
Older trees are more resilient to fire if over - crowded forests are cared for with sound fuel reduction projects .
Future posts in this series will be written on firefighting techniques and salvage logging versus natural regeneration after a burn .

A TSA inspector decided to get a closer look at some American Eagle jets at O'Hare , so he climbed up on them , using a fragile , vital instrument ( the Total Air Temperature probes ) as handholds .
He damaged the craft so badly that the regular maintenance crew grounded them — and if they had n't noticed , the lives of everyone on - board could have been endangered .
Remember , folks , the " S " in TSA stands for " Security . "
Citing sources within the aviation industry , ABC News reports an overzealous TSA employee attempted to gain access to the parked aircraft by climbing up the fuselage … reportedly using the Total Air Temperature ( TAT ) probes mounted to the planes ' noses as handholds .
" The brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers , " one pilot wrote on an American Eagle internet forum .
" They decided this instrument , the TAT probe , would be adequate to use as a ladder . "

They 're clunky , dirty and can't access the internet , yet every year thousands of people buy typewriters when they could probably afford a computer .
Why ?
When asked how he writes , Frederick Forsyth has a simple answer .
" With a typewriter . "
He admits this is to avoid the more difficult business of describing his creative process , but it also means he can celebrate old friends .
There was the steel - cased portable he used as a foreign correspondent in the 1960s .
" It had a crease across the lid which was done by a bullet in Biafra .
It just kept tapping away .
It did n't need power , it did n't need batteries , it did n't need recharging .
One ribbon went back and forward and back until it was a rag , almost , and out came the dispatches . "
Then the blooming thing blew up and they told me that it was my fault , and it was n't , it just burnt out
Maureen Huggins
And after 50 years and a dozen novels including The Day of the Jackal , why change now , he asks .
" I have never had an accident where I have pressed a button and accidentally sent seven chapters into cyberspace , never to be seen again .
And have you ever tried to hack into my typewriter ?
It is very secure . "
Although he laughs as he says it , Mr Forsyth identifies the continuing attraction of a typewriter for thousands of people .
They find a computer distracting , unreliable or just plain terrifying , and they have a love for the tangible .
As he puts it , " I like to see black words on white paper rolling up in front of my gaze " .
Mr Forsyth 's novels are so popular that he could write them in the sand and publishers would still queue up for his business .
But who else is still pounding rather than pressing their keyboard ?
Just as quick The Japanese multinational Brother sold 12,000 electronic typewriters last year in the UK , which is its biggest market in Europe .
Unruffled by the threat of disk defragmentation errors Brother UK sales director Phil Jones says customers are generally older people , although his company also sells a number to students .
He says typewriters remain a cheap way to develop keyboard skills .
The most basic model costs around £ 80 .
" Typewriters are much more straightforward to use than computers as they only have one function - typing , " says Mr Jones .
And typing is the only thing that Maureen Huggins wants her machinery to do .
A reporter for 52 years , she uses a manual typewriter for her work at the Norfolk Courts Press Agency .
Stories are then faxed to newspapers and broadcasters .
Mrs Huggins tried using a computer about 15 years ago and the memory is still raw .
" I had four pages of instructions I had to learn , to send [ my previous employers ] the stories .
Then the blooming thing blew up and they told me that it was my fault , and it was n't , it just burnt out . "
She says she can produce her stories at least as quickly as her rivals , because the risk of technical failure is virtually nil - she keeps a spare typewriter at hand - and because the typewriter encourages her to get the story right first time .
This may sound like an impossibly Spartan ideal , where cut and paste is done with scissors and glue , and deleted words remain on the page as angry little blobs .
But for some left jaded and distracted by their smarty - pants computers , it is tempting .
The writer Will Self is a convert .
He went back to using a manual typewriter several years ago .
" I think the computer user does their thinking on the screen , and the non-computer user is compelled , because he or she has to retype a whole text , to do a lot more thinking in the head , " he said in a recent interview .
That does n't necessarily mean that Royals and Underwoods are elbowing PCs and Macs off the desk with their jabby little carriage return levers .
But even for the technologically savvy , they have their uses .
Green screen style Richard Polt , a philosophy professor at Xavier University in Cincinnati , Ohio , collects old typewriters but is sufficiently computer literate to run an attractive website devoted to them .
He remembers struggling over a book he was writing .
The green screen look - almost as retro , and available to download " There are so many distractions with the internet , it is also so easy to change and delete what you have written .
It is too easy to dither . "
So he turned to one of his 175 old typewriters .
" I did n't compose most of the book on a typewriter , but every once in a while I would put out a few pages on a typewriter , a first draft , and it was kind of refreshing . "
He knows of others , especially in the early stages of creative writing , who have benefited in a similar way .
This can be achieved without a typewriter .

Car boot sales
If there really is a move back to typewriters , it probably wo n't come in time to save what is left of the market .
Brother UK's Mr Jones admits he is " surprised " that people are still buying typewriters , and " amazed " his company sells a handful for more than £ 500 , which would buy a laptop .
Typewriter sales are falling 10 % a year at the company , which is better known for its printers , faxes and sewing equipment .
Often overlooked - the typewriter 's place in women 's liberation Perhaps more surprisingly , demand in developing countries is also falling sharply .
Godrej Industries , an engineering and consumer products conglomerate , owns the last manual typewriter factory in India .
Senior general manager Sorab Barekh says two - thirds are exported , with various typefaces , to Africa and South East Asia .
They tend to be used by remote government outposts which have a poor electricity supply .
Sales are falling so fast that more than half a century of production might cease within three years , he says .
But for a long time yet , anyone who wants a typewriter will be able to pick one up at a car boot sale for roughly the price of a replacement ribbon .
And even when the last carriage return rings , their legacy will go on .
The " qwerty " keyboard was devised as a means of keeping commonly recurring sequences of letters like " th " and " an " apart so typewriter keys did not stick .
There is argument about whether a different configuration of letters would enable faster typing , but an educationalist who tried to change it in the last century likened the challenge to reversing the Ten Commandments .
The biggest inheritance from the typewriter , however , is the fact that lots of people reading this at work will be women .
Typing classes mushroomed at the end of the 19th Century , and this helped many women to enter paid work for the first time .
By 1901 , Britain had 166,000 female clerks , up from 2,000 half a century before .
It was a limited emancipation .
The new employees ( often called " type- writers " themselves ) were accused of stealing jobs from men , depressing wages and sexually tempting the boss , and their chance of career progression was often nil .
But for women to have any job outside the home was revolutionary .
So while the pen may be mightier than the sword , the typewriter was once mightier than both .

I fell in love with the typewriters when I started learning to type .
The challenge was to get an even print on the white paper without mistakes .

Ah , this international conversation would not take place but for the plentiful amount of computers connected to the world wide web .
And as interesting as these chats can be , the volume of them is overwhelming .
So much information and many opinions are public , but how much of it can we process , and how much time do we waste filtering through it ?
There is no going backwards , but it is almost too easy to communicate .
Even here I can fire off a bit of an opinion that otherwise I would 've kept to myself or reserved for dinner conversation tonight .
I wonder if it was better when it actually took considerable effort it took to publish our opinions .
We were certainly better self - editors then .

What are these ?
The National Ass. of Broadcasters continues to fight tooth and nail against opening up the " whitespace " in the broadcast spectrum .
Broadcasters get to use America 's spectrum for free .
To keep interference to a minimum , the majority of the nation 's broadcast - ready spectrum is left intentionally blank , so that broadcast signals face a minimum of interference — for example , if channel 2 is allocated in San Francisco , it will be left blank in San Jose , so that people halfway between in Palo Alto wo n't get half of each signal .
However , there 's plenty of room for use of that whitespace in WiFi - style devices that are smart enough to know where they are and adjust their use of spectrum accordingly .
The tiny sliver of spectrum given over to WiFi ( and other unlicensed uses ) at 2.4GHz has generated untold billions in economic activity and public good .
Nevertheless , the broadcasters — who are squatting on all this beachfront spectrum that actually belongs to the public — are pulling out all the stops to prevent anyone from lighting up this unused spectrum and doing anything useful with it .
For example , rural communities could use their local whitespace frequencies to provide " fixed wireless " links to homes and businesses where no DSL or cable - modems reach .
The broadcasters argue that we dirty unlicensed users of spectrum will surely spoil their lovely groomed golf - course of sitcom reruns , sporting events , and reality TV , and the mere possibility of a single bit of interference is too much to countenance , no matter how great the potential rewards .
And who are we to disagree ?
After all , we only own this spectrum that we 've loaned to them .
White spaces are blank spots in the TV lineup where no stations transmit ; they vary in number and location around the country , but even major markets have open slots .
Tech companies and digital rights groups have been pushing hard at the FCC to make these white spaces available for broadband access .
While the FCC has already approved the idea of fixed transmitters , the more contentious issue is whether millions of consumers should be allowed to install mobile , unlicensed transmitters in homes and businesses .
The WIA represents companies like Google , Philips , and Microsoft that are trying to build the devices in question , so it's no surprise that Corbett is bullish on the possibilities , dismissive of interference complaints , and given to talking of white spaces as a crucial battleground .
But she 's not the only one .

The next maintenance release of JRuby is scheduled for release later this month .
Among the changes is an overhaul of the Java Integration , which defines how Ruby code interacts with Java libraries .
Java Integration concerns basics , such as type coercion or overloading , but also streamlining the interaction between Ruby and Java , eg. making it possible to pass a Ruby Block to a method when it makes sense .
Charles
Nutter shows some of the recent improvements in JRuby 's Java Integration Another improvement is the use of JSR - 45 features to improve debugging ( Note : link seems to be broken at the time of publication ) .
JSR - 45 allows to map source files and source lines to class files .
JSR - 45 defines class attributes ( SourceDebugExtension ) that contain metadata in the SMAP format defined in the JSR to define which input source file a class file comes from .
A look at the compiler code shows that line number information is already being added to the generated class files .
ASM , used for generating the class files , allows to set line numbers via the visitLineNumber method .
With the addition of SMAP files , regular Java debuggers , eg jdb , can step through Ruby code compiled to bytecode ( sample pastie showing how to step through a Ruby file using jdb ) .
The new capabilities are another step towards a fast debugger for JRuby - however it 's important to note that this method only works for code that gets compiled to bytecode .
Code that is interpreted still needs to be handled by the existing trace or hook based debuggers .
How much of an applications code is turned into bytecode depends on a couple of factors .
For instance , there 's the risk of running out of PermGen space , which usually ends in a JVM crash / termination .
To solve that , the JRuby JIT limits the amount of compiled methods ( the limit can be configured ) .

The ultimate naval weapon might be the hyper-velocity railgun .
It could propel projectiles up to 230 miles with killer accuracy at speeds close to Mach 7 .
The Navy holds a world record for " highest electromagnetic muzzle energy launch of a projectile " using such a weapon .
I have no idea what that means , but I know I would n't want to get hit by one .
These megaguns are n't without their flaws , though .
That kind of muzzle velocity tends to destroy the barrel of the gun , and each firing draws something like three million amps .

IFP Received the following email early this morning from Dan Monte of the Impeach Coalition of Sonoma County , California :
Tonight , July 9 , under an ash reddened sun and moon , the Cotati City Council of Sonoma County California passed a resolution calling on Congress to begin impeachment of Bush and Cheney 3 to 2 .
California is burning with more than 1,700 wildfires burning over the last three weeks , and no National Guard to help put out the fires .
Our county and much of the state has been suffering under a heat wave and ash from two wild land fires for each mile of its length .
The main message from the three Council members that voted for the resolution was that they wanted to know what are the truths of this administration ’s actions .
They wanted to speak for their citizens in a manner as they can not individually be heard .
Recent supplies of fuel from Israel have been sporadic The United Nations says it has had to halt food distribution in the Gaza Strip because it has run out of fuel .
Distributions to 15,000 refugees took place on Thursday , but were then halted .
Officials said deliveries due on Saturday will also not take place .
Israeli sanctions imposed in an attempt to curtail rocket fired by Palestinian group Hamas have caused shortages .
Reports say no fuel was pumped from Israel to Gaza on Thursday .
Israel says Hamas is preventing fuel distribution .
It says there are a million litres of fuel at a border terminal which Gaza fuel distributors , with the backing of Hamas , have refused to collect in protest at the Israeli restrictions .
But the UN says fuel distributors who agreed to collect fuel not earmarked for the UN to help with distributions to refugees were stopped by protesters from the farming and fishing sectors - who have also been hit by the shortages .
Supplies ' exhausted '
In a briefing to the Security Council , Assistant Secretary General Angela Kane said Gaza had suffered " heightened humanitarian distress " caused by closed border crossings with Israel and Egypt , the shortage of basic food and commodities , poor water supplies and sanitation .
The terrorist regime in Gaza is deliberately attacking the crossings that supply the Gaza people with these important supplies
Mark Regev
Israeli government spokesman
More than 80 % of Gaza 's population rely on humanitarian assistance , with UN food aid going to about 1.1 million people .
A high proportion of them are children .
But Ms Kane warned that such assistance was now at risk of suspension because of the restrictions on vehicle fuel deliveries , which were tightened by Israel earlier this month after Palestinian militants attacked the Nahal Oz fuel terminal , killing two Israelis .
There have been no deliveries of petrol by Israel since 18 March and no deliveries of ordinary diesel since 2 April , according to UN officials .
" In an effort to save fuel , Unrwa has prioritised food distribution , solid waste removal , and sewage projects , " she told the Security Council on Wednesday .
UN food aid goes to about 1.1 million people in the Gaza Strip " Unless petrol is allowed in , Unrwa will discontinue its food assistance to 650,000 refugees , as well as its garbage collection services , which benefit half a million Gazans , " she added .
" Another 500,000 Gazans are already living in 12 municipalities without any solid waste management capacity - largely due to the lack of fuel . "
Hospitals and clinics will also run out of fuel within a week , she warned .
Public transport has been severely curtailed by the shortage of vehicle fuel , meaning that children cannot get to school and adults to work .
Some car owners have converted their engines to run on cooking oil .
Strike
The fuel shortages have been compounded since 7 April by a strike by Gaza 's fuel distributors and petrol station owners , who have been refusing to pick up about one million litres that Israel has pumped into the Nahal Oz fuel terminal , saying the quantity is insufficient .
The boycott has not affected industrial diesel supplies to Gaza 's main power station , which was within hours of shutting down on Wednesday morning until Israel agreed to allow delivery of one million litres - enough to generate electricity for three days .
Talks fail to hearten Gazans Gaza 's humanitarian crisis A spokesman for the Israeli government , Mark Regev , told the BBC that it was Hamas , and not Israel , that was causing the fuel and humanitarian problems .
" You have a situation where the Hamas regime in Gaza is deliberately holding up supplies for its own political reasons , which are difficult to understand , " he said .
" But the truth is there 's a very consistent pattern here .
The oil terminal itself was deliberately targeted by Hamas just a few days ago , that was the second attack in that vicinity in a very short period of time , " he added .
" The terrorist regime in Gaza is deliberately attacking the crossings that supply the Gaza people with these important supplies . "
On a visit to Gaza on Wednesday , the UN special envoy Robert Serry , condemned the militant attacks , but also described Israel 's policies as " collective punishment " .
At the UN Security Council meeting , Ms Kane also criticised Israel for failing to fully implement a recent pledge to remove 50 roadblocks in the occupied West Bank - only 44 of the roadblocks were removed , of which five were significant , she said .
She added that Israel continued to violate Lebanese airspace - sorties by Israeli aircraft over Lebanon increased from 282 in February to 692 in March and 476 in the first half of April alone , she said .
The Security Council session ended shortly after her statement , however , when Western representatives walked out in protest at comments made by the Libyan representative , Giadalla Ettalhi , who likened Gaza to a Nazi death camp .
" A number of Council members were dismayed by the approach taken by Libya and do not believe that such language helps advance the peace process , " British official Karen Pierce said afterwards .

What are these ?
This is embrassing !
Sorry you do not have access to this paper .
Cars in a parking lot could soon keep track of each other and , like sheep , complain if one of their numbers is stolen or meets a bad end .
At least , that 's the intention of the Sensor Vehicle Anti-Theft System ( SVATS ) proposed by Sencun Zhu , an assistant professor at Penn State University .
As he explained to LiveScience.com , each car would be given a sensor — smaller than a coin — that would wirelessly call roll with other , similarly equipped cars in the parking lot within range , and pass on the results .
If any car stopped responding to the roll call without issuing a goodbye signal when it was unlocked , the car herd would decide that the non-responsive car had been stolen and alert the lot 's base station .
Parking lot monitoring could be accomplished without inter-car networking , but the use of networking allows for short - range , low - power transmitters , with longer battery life , Zhu said .
The range of the sensor signal between cars will be about TK to TK feet ( 2 to 10 meters .
He anticipates that each car would have a master sensor drawing power from the car , and battery - powered slave sensors hidden through the vehicle .
The slave sensors would take over if the master is defeated by hot - wiring .
Mass - produced , the sensors should cost less than a dollar , and Zhu anticipates they could be handed out by commercial parking lots as a competitive measure .
Prevention , anyone ?
The not - so - subtle drawback with all such theft - alert devices is that when the alert arrives the car has already been stolen .
Experts on car theft avoidance , on the other hand , preach prevention , which , by Ben Franklin 's calculations , is 16 times better than anything you can do after the fact .
Rather than rely on technology , pundits ( such as Auto - Theft.info ) urge the use of something called common sense .
For instance : Lock the car door .
Take the keys .
Park in well - lit areas with a lot of foot traffic .
Keep valuables out of sight .
Do not hide spare keys in the car .
Do not leave registration or insurance documents in the car .
If further measures seem warranted , get a steering wheel lock of some kind .
The simple , visible presence of such a device will likely deter a potential thief .
Owners of particularly vulnerable or valuable vehicles might then want to escalate to an electronic immobilizing device that would prevent thieves from bypassing the ignition and hot - wiring the car .
After that , there 's theft - alert and tracking devices , like Zhu's .
Grim fate
But deciding how much protection is merited is dicey .
While expensive luxury cars would logically seem to be prime targets for thieves , the bad guys are actually more likely to grab the junker in the next parking space .
That 's because their prime targets are ordinary models of a certain age whose owners are getting desperate for parts — which the thieves supply by stripping stolen cars of the same model .
In 2006 , the most commonly stolen vehicles were the 1995 Honda Civic , the 1991 Honda Accord , and the 1989 Toyota Camry , according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau .
There were no luxury cars in the top 10 .
Since the cars are stolen to be stripped , the recovery rate is only 63 percent , reports the NICB .

I find the idea of an “ Agile shop ” or an “ Agile team ” is a little misleading and misses the point .
What we want is an “ Agile organization . ”
The main feature of Agility , to me , is the ability to respond to change : to follow new business opportunities or address challenges .
This feature has nothing to do with software development .
It just so happens that software might be required to exploit business potential .
No doubt you can employ development practices such as TDD / BDD , DDD , continuous integration , etc. ( after quite a steep learning curve and dues paying process ) to create an Agile codebase , but we should not convince ourselves that this is what it means to work in an Agile shop .
Good practices simply indicate we ’re striving for quality and maintainability and collective code ownership and a good team .
There are more important limiting factors .
Let ’s look at our backlog ( or in lean terms , investment ) :
Is it prepared ?
Do stories have acceptance language ?
Is there an expression of business value ?
Is software being released or demonstrated regularly .
Is there involvement ?
Are there clear and evolving priorities ?
Are your stories speculative things written by the development team or a lead or an architect ?
And have you been developing infrastructure code in an “ Agile way ” for the last two months ?
Do customers / users refuse to meet with you ?
Is work constantly being expedited ?
Are you in a cube farm ?
Do you work a ton of voluntary overtime and is there a turnover problem in your team ?
In the realm of continuous improvement certifications and labels do n’t count for a whole heck of a lot .
Even the most deadly clan of XP ninja will create a local optima rule that is likely to damage the entire system ( i.e. company ) .
Businesses need to consider larger issues of throughput ( sales ) and constraints .
Which shareholders care if the team ’s rocking when there ’s a mountain of work in progress piling up at deployment preventing new revenue ?
Which line manager ’s responsibility is it to make sure the right things are being worked on ?
How are decisions being made in the larger context ?
Not to get super preachy on you all , but sometimes I think we ’re full bore on the wrong mission .
Moon Photography
Although it is by far the biggest and brightest object in the night sky the moon is not an easy subject to photograph .
Using a standard 50 mm lens , an image projected onto a slide or negative is only about 1/50 of an inch .
Also consider such issues as exposure times , film types , and lenses and you begin to understand what is needed to take photographs of the moon .
With the recent introduction of inexpensive digital cameras a whole new area of lunar photography is now available to the amateur .
I 've included a few things to consider when trying to photograph the moon .
Equipment , techniques and even a few formulas are presented .
The Moon As A Source Of Light
The moon appears full when it's in a position where the side of the moon facing earth is fully lit by the sun .
Photographing a full moon is n't much different than photographing any other sun-lit object - except that it 's pretty far away .
Due to this fact it 's recommended that you use either a SLR ( single lens reflex ) camera with a long lens or a semi- professional digital camera rather than a point - and - shoot or a single - use " disposable " camera .
In fact , with a point - and - shoot you can get an image of the moon but it will be a tiny white point rather than anything that like the moon .
Un sistema con le sue storture , ma che ha avuto più successo di qualsiasi altro nella storia .
E che , malgrado in molti lo annuncino trionfanti , non è affatto morto
Il capitalismo e’ quindi , per la sua propria natura , una forma o un sistema di cambiamento dell ’ economia e non solo non è mai statico , ma nemmeno puo’ esserlo . [… ]
Un processo di mutazione dell ’industria – se posso mutuare un termine dalla biologia – che rivoluziona incessantemente la struttura economica dall ’interno , distruggendo incessantemente il vecchio , creando incessantemente il nuovo .
Questo processo di Distruzione Creatrice e’ il fondamento essenziale del capitalismo .
E ’ in questo che consiste il capitalismo …
Questo arcinoto passaggio del 1975 di Joseph Schumpeter dovrebbe essere fatto leggere a tutti quelli che dall ’ inizio dell ’ ultima crisi si stanno dedicando a celebrare il funerale del sistema economico piu’ di successo della storia dell ’umanita ’ .
I colpevoli , cosi ’ affermano i becchini , sono gli eccessi del capitalismo , della strutturale inefficienza del mercato , delle storture neoliberiste : se Vincent de Gournay o Adam Smith fossero vivi , insomma , vedrebbero nel mondo di oggi la perfetta realizzazione delle loro idee .
Sarà .
Se potessimo tornare indietro nel tempo di un secolo , all ’apice del capitalismo industriale , noteremmo immediatamente quanto e’ instabile il sistemaeconomia .
Un’occhiata veloce al sito del NBER mostra come – tra il 1854 ed il 1919 – si contino 16 cicli economici ( uno ogni 4 anni ) mentre tra il 1945 ed il 2001 se ne siano susseguiti solo 10 ( uno ogni 5.5 anni ) , con addirittura gli ultimi due che sono durati rispettivamente 8 anni scarsi ( 1982-1990 ) e 10 anni tondi ( 1991-2001 ) !
IL SISTEMA NELLA STORIA – Le cosiddette “ storture ” del capitalismo sembrerebbero quindi diminuite ; magari con l’eta ’ il capitalismo e’ diventato piu’ maturo , piu’ riflessivo .
O magari quello che abbiamo visto negli ultimi decenni e’ qualcosa di profondamente diverso dal capitalismo industriale di fine ‘ 800 .
Fino agli anni ‘ 30 , infatti , i pro del sistema avevano reso del tutto accettabili i contro ; la crescita in media era elevata , al punto che lo stesso Buffet ha definito il XIX secolo “ un secolo meraviglioso ” per un investitore .
Non erano comunque mancate le crisi : la Lunga Depressione arresto ’ la crescita mondiale tra il 1870 e il 1890 ; il panico del 1907 vide un crollo del 50 % del mercato azionario e il fallimento di numerose banche ; nei primi anni ’ 20 ci fu una forte crisi del settore agricolo .
Cio ’ che rende queste crisi meno famose , e’ che non furono in grado di cambiare l’attitudine della societa ’ nei confronti del mercato : potevano dare luogo a modifiche regolamentari che permettessero ai mercati di funzionare meglio ( come le leggi antitrust approvate negli USA nel primo decennio del ‘ 900 ) , ma il principio fondamentale per cui in un sistema capitalistico il mercato si organizzava bene da solo non venne meno .
Nel 1929 , tuttavia , una delle peggiori recessioni della storia sconvolse il mondo intero , e anche il modo di guardare al mercato cambio’ .
In fondo , vicino agli Urali , un paese con un’organizzazione che era l’esatto contrario del mercato autonomo e decentralizzato prosperava nonostante la crisi globale , quindi valeva la pena quanto meno ibridare il modello .
STORTURE E CORREZIONI – Si e’ cercato allora di introdurre una serie di strumenti per “ correggere ” gli effetti negativi del sistema , per due motivi fondamentali : gli effetti negativi del ciclo economico sono piu ’ difficili da sopportare all ’aumentare del livello di benessere ; in un sistema democratico , un momento di ciclo negativo si traduce spesso e volentieri in una sconfitta per il governo in carica .
Facendo finta di ignorare l’insegnamento di Schumpeter , secondo cui la distruzione e’ il prerequisito per l’innovazione , e quindi per una crescita di lungo periodo , ignorando altresi ’ gli effetti di lungo periodo degli interventi diretti dello Stato nell ’economia – molti degli stessi provvedimenti adottati da Coolidge prima e da Roosevelt poi in risposta alla crisi del ’ 29 sono un interessante antologia di “ rovinosi eccessi di zelo ” .
Il punto , persino banale ma che ad un anno dalle prime avvisaglie di crisi non fa male ribadire , e ’ il seguente : alla base del sistema capitalistico c’e ’ la distruzione .
Si puo’ scegliere legittimamente di pregiudicare un po ’ di crescita per ridurre gli effetti negativi nei periodi di crisi , e spetta ai governi farlo .
Ma pretendere di avere la creazione senza la distruzione …

Atomic Energy Renaissance ' The American Public Is Ready for Nuclear '
David Crane is CEO of NRG Energy , Inc , based in New Jersey .
His company is planning to build two new nuclear reactors in Texas , the first such project in almost 30 years in the US .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke to him about the worldwide nuclear renaissance .
In Should Bad Boys Win , the question arose of whether the legendary " nice guys " who finish last , are actually nice .
Several commenters proposed that " nice guys " feel entitled to sex , and are liars .
It does appear to me that many older and more bitter nerds do feel entitled to something .
This sounds like a turn - off ; but according to the seduction community and other repositories of male wisdom such as Richard Feynman , one of the main effective strategies for attracting women is learning to project entitlement :
To convey that you expect a woman to wish to have sex with you .
I normally have fairly low regard for evolutionary psychology , especially post -hoc .
But here it seems to fit the bill really nicely ; so I ’m going to speculate a bit on what entitlement might signify in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness .
Displaying feelings of sexual entitlement would have been , in a tribal setting , a strong signal of dominance and actual access to sex .
These traits would be associated with genes valuable in male offspring provided that either the father could be convinced to provide resources or the environment was such that they did not need to .
It might also indicate that it was physically dangerous to refuse him sexually , and relatively socially safe to accede .
In contrast , displaying feelings of thwarted entitlement would be a huge neon warning sign of low fitness .
Not only does this guy not have high status , his systems for judging his own status are broken .
This is a hugely costly defect .
Association with him may be dangerous both physically and socially , prior to his impending demise .
Big red letters are flashing KEEP AWAY .
But how did nerds originally become bitter ?
By being ignored by women ?
Then why would women ignore them before they became bitter ?
Suppose that middle - class American men are told , at an age too immature to examine parental commands critically : " In dealing with women , be X , Y , and Z " where X , Y , and Z are instructions like " Only express sexual interest in those women who you are confident are interested in you , prior to that , always be polite . "
And middle class American women are told , in a similar fashion , " In choosing a man , look for politeness and respectful non-sexual behavior . "
So far , so good .
The message is consistent .
But when women grow up , they find that they are n’t attracted to the men they were told to look for .
Maybe they believe , with reason even , that such men are ‘ boys ’ , not ‘ men ’ , and find this unattractive ( ultimately because it was and still is evolutionarily unfit ) .
Instead , most women spurn the timid advances made by the ‘ nice guys ’ they think they should prefer .
But since they believe they should be choosing such men , they also decide that the men they reject cannot be the type they were told to prefer .
This may explain why ‘ nice guys ’ might end up labeled ‘ liars ’ .
In this model , the nerd ’s sense of thwarted entitlement comes from recognizing that he has the traits X , Y , and Z that authority figures told him to display and that women claim to want – which does nothing to change the fact that feelings of thwarted entitlement for ANY reason are extremely unattractive .
In this model , masculine attractiveness requires recognizing that :
A ) The rules that one is taught as a boy are simplified rules for boys , and some of them must eventually be discarded once you figure out better rules .
B ) The real rules require you to give lip - service , when in mixed company , to the rules for boys .
Nerds tend to be literal , to lie infrequently , to greatly resent being lied to , and to not adjust their behavior based on information their brains have not yet verbalized .
Nerds are also reluctant to behave hypocritically , e.g. by verbally condemning a behavior while engaging in said behavior .
If this is what is socially demanded of them , they will be unhappy with the situation .
As a result , they may never become men in the relevant sense .
The situation with ‘ nice guys ’ seems to parallel that with ‘ atheists ’ perhaps half a century ago , when almost everyone in polite society acknowledged God , but did n’t live like they believed in God .
Today , almost everyone claims that certain behaviors are proper in men , but most do n’t live like they believe this .
It was primarily emotionally inept nerds who found it necessary to vocally advocate atheism in the past ; and today it is mostly emotionally inept nerds who find it necessary to vocally advocate realistic methods for attracting women .
People who are general outliers in the relationship of anticipation to verbalized belief , that is , people who actually believe in things that other people only believe in believing , may critically need a more sympathetic ( and less arrogant ) view of the relationship between verbal symbols and real behavior .
Just as we do n’t want to see men or women as defective women or men , we also may not want to see non-nerds as defective nerds .
Their success in achieving their goals would suggest that they are not .

Finally given a chance to address Sen. John McCain , Mary Houghtaling choked up Thursday and began to cry .
Wiping away her tears , she told the presumptive Republican presidential nominee how a controversial corporate deal he backed in 2003 as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee -- the sale of Airborne Express cargo service to a German conglomerate that owns DHL and the subsequent expansion of the air freight hub here -- had gone horribly wrong .
Now , its business in a tailspin , DHL wants to combine operations with rival United Parcel Service and close its huge hub here .
If the merger goes through , community officials and union leaders warn , staggering job losses will eviscerate the economy and the social fabric of nine struggling counties in southeast Ohio .
“ Never before have so many people been abandoned at once , ” said Houghtaling , who runs a local hospice .
“ It is inconceivable to think about losing 10,000 jobs in the first wave , and the estimates run in the 30,000 range as the wave continues . ”

Houghtaling first warned McCain of the pending catastrophe July 9 when he campaigned nearby .
The candidate vowed to return and bring help .
But on Wednesday , the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that McCain ’s campaign manager , Rick Davis , previously worked as a lobbyist for the German group , Deutsche Post World Net , and was paid $ 185,000 to help engineer the 2003 deal , plus another $ 405,000 for other work .
Davis helped Deutsche Post overcome objections in the Senate when the German company was negotiating the purchase , the paper reported .
As head of the commerce committee , McCain fought back proposed amendments in a defense spending bill that would have barred a foreign - owned company from flying U.S. military equipment or troops .
McCain said he objected to restricting the Pentagon ’s options , and to using a spending bill to set military policy .
But his position angered some lawmakers and DHL competitors that sought to keep the U.S. air freight business in American hands .
Advertisement
McCain ’s campaign said Thursday that Davis has not lobbied for DHL since 2005 and had no role in the current controversy .
He took a leave of absence from his lobbying practice to run McCain ’s campaign .
But the politically sensitive case has embarrassed McCain , who has railed against the role of special interest groups in Washington , and it threatens to undermine his efforts to capture this crucial state in November .
In news releases , conference calls and local street protests , Democrats and union groups have blamed McCain and Davis for backing the original deal , and accused McCain of ignoring the workers ’ plight .
During a campaign visit last month , Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , met with Wilmington ’s mayor , David Raizk , and pledged his help if elected .
McCain moved quickly to demonstrate his own concern Thursday , his second straight day of campaigning in a state he has called vital to his White House bid .
McCain pledged to call for a congressional hearing “ as quickly as possible ” and said he would urge the Justice Department to launch a “ thorough and complete ” antitrust investigation of the proposed merger .

He also vowed to help provide federal emergency grants and other aid to the displaced workers and devastated communities if DHL ends local operations .
“ I ca n’t assure you that this train wreck is n’t going to happen , but I will do everything in my power to avert it , ” McCain told two dozen elected officials and community leaders during a 45 - minute meeting on the campus of Wilmington College .
McCain listened as Houghtaling declared that many people believed he was there only because he faced political pressure to attend .
“ Empty rhetoric is not what we need , ” she said emotionally .
“ Sir , promises and trusts are things that have been sadly suspect ” since plans to close the air hub were announced on Memorial Day .

“ My straight talk would be , please do n’t let this foreign company ruin our part of the world , ” she pleaded , her voice choked up .
“ Please give us a reason to once again believe in promises and trust . ”
After learning that the chairman of DHL , Frank Appel , had not agreed to meet local residents , McCain promised to write to the head of parent company Deutsche Post and invite him .
He then added what he called some “ straight talk , ” his trademark phrase .
“ I do n’t know if any of this will work , ” he admitted .
He then turned to Houghtaling .
“ I ca n’t look you in the eye and say we ’re going to avert this . ”
Earlier Thursday , McCain used a town hall in Lima , Ohio , to step up his attacks on Obama .

“ Sen . Obama says he ’s going to change Washington , ” McCain said , reading from prepared remarks .
“ But his plan is to raise your taxes and spend more of your money .
It ’s not my idea of a solution to what troubles Washington .
In fact , it sounds a lot like the problem . ”
Obama ’s words , he said , “ for all their eloquence and passion , do n’t mean all that much . ”
“ And that ’s the problem in our nation ’s capital .
It ’s not just the Bush administration , and it ’s not just the Democratic Congress .
It ’s that everyone in Washington says whatever it takes to get elected or to score the political point of the day , ” said McCain , who has served 26 years in Congress .
For his part , Obama predicted Thursday that the Democratic convention this month would come off smoothly , though he seemed to take issue with the assertion of his erstwhile opponent Hillary Clinton that her supporters were looking for a “ catharsis ” at the event .

In a YouTube video that surfaced recently , Clinton was seen telling a gathering of her supporters in Palo Alto that those who backed her in the primary fight should have their voices heard .
“ It ’s as old as Greek drama , ” Clinton said at the event last month .
“ There ’s a catharsis .
Everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity , and I think that ’s all to the good . ”
Talking to reporters on his campaign plane , Obama said the convention ’s purpose is not catharsis .
“ I am letting our respective teams work out the details , ” he said , according to a transcript provided by his campaign .
“ I do n’t think that we are looking for catharsis .
I think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country . ”
Obama had a light day on the campaign trail , one day before he leaves for a weeklong vacation in his native Hawaii .
He spent about half an hour greeting diners at the Copper Dome Restaurant in St. Paul , Minn .
He ordered buttermilk pancakes to go , dropping $ 3 at the cash register .

When a couple asked him about the Twins and White Sox baseball teams , Obama said : “ If you think I ’m going to throw my White Sox under the bus because I ’m here in Minnesota , that ’s not going to happen . ”

President Bush has headlined a fund - raising event to help John McCain finance his campaign to succeed him , but most of the big - money backers who helped reelect Bush in 2004 have n't pulled out their checkbooks for McCain - or asked their friends to chip in either .
Of the 548 leaders of Bush 's vaunted money - raising machine , about 43 percent have contributed to McCain , a Globe review of finance reports covering the period through May 31 shows .
Even fewer of them solicited and bundled donations from others for McCain , as they did for Bush four years ago .
About 25 percent of the elite Bush money team gave to another Republican or , in several cases , to a Democrat , but not to McCain .
Nearly a third remained on the sidelines , not contributing to any presidential candidate .
McCain 's struggle to mobilize the Bush fund - raisers is in part a sign of the disaffection among some GOP stalwarts for McCain , who positions himself as a party rebel on some issues .
But it 's also a sign of the obstacles that any Republican nominee would face in exciting elite GOP donors at a time of discouraging poll numbers driven by economic turmoil and frustration over the Iraq war .
The McCain campaign is trying to make a virtue out of its modest success in recruiting the Bush fund - raisers .
In response to the Globe 's analysis , McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said : " It appears you 've proved that John McCain is n't Bush 's third term after all , " referring to a characterization the Obama campaign has made and McCain has rejected .
Bush 's major fund - raisers were dubbed Rangers if they raised more than $ 200,000 in 2004 , or Pioneers if they brought in more than $ 100,000 .
In heavily Democratic Massachusetts , some Bush fund - raisers remain loyal to one of McCain 's chief GOP rivals , Mitt Romney , the favorite son and former governor who suspended his candidacy in February .
" I would probably support John McCain if he chooses Mitt Romney as his running mate ; other than that , I will not support John McCain , " said venture capital fund manager and Staples founder Thomas G. Stemberg , a Bush pioneer who raised large amounts for Romney but also contributed the individual maximum , $ 2,300 , to Senator Barack Obama in March 2007 .
Concessions magnate Joseph J. O'Donnell of the Boston Culinary Group was a Bush Ranger who raised substantial sums in this race for his fellow Belmont resident , Romney .
A registered independent who often contributes to Democrats , O'Donnell donated $ 1,000 to McCain in late March , after Romney dropped out , and said he will support McCain over the less experienced Obama , but has not raised funds on McCain 's behalf .
Like Stemberg , O'Donnell said he hopes McCain " is smart enough to choose Mitt " as his running mate .
Bush Pioneer Kenneth J. Kies , managing director of a Washington - based tax consulting and lobbying firm , was a late giver to McCain , donating the maximum in May .
Kies said his contribution was unsolicited after he sat out the nominating contest , which he termed " a scrum . "
See that robot there ?
It 's burned by a laser - etch machine .
On genyoowine human skin .
Ohoho yes : that sent an icky feeling up your spine did n't it ?
If it did n't , then it should have .
Try looking through the gallery , and then watch the video of a skin - etch in action , and that should do the trick ...

The Dalai Lama sits on his throne during a tea ceremony in the Lerab Ling Buddhist temple Aug. 22 in Roqueredonde , southern France .
DHARMSALA , India ( AP ) 
The Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , was suffering from exhaustion and has canceled two planned international trips to undergo medical tests , his office said Wednesday .
The 73 - year - old Nobel Peace Prize winner had been " experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days , " a statement from his office said , adding that his doctors had diagnosed " exhaustion . "
The Dalai Lama just returned from an 11 - day visit to France , capping an intense few months since the violent uprising against Chinese rule in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , in March and the subsequent harsh Chinese crackdown .
The Dalai Lama spends several months a year traveling the globe to highlight the struggle of Tibetans for greater freedom from China and to teach Buddhism .
He canceled two upcoming trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic and would rest over the next three weeks , said Thupten Samphel , the spokesman of the self - declared Tibetan government - in - exile .
Samphel said the Dalai Lama would travel to Mumbai for medical tests Thursday before returning to recuperate in the north Indian hill town of Dharmsala , where he has had his headquarters since fleeing Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising against China .
" He has been going to Mumbai for regular health checkups on advice from his doctors for quite a long time , " said Samphel .
He said all appointments and visits would be canceled for three weeks .
While the Dalai Lama is generally thought to be in good health , this is not the first time exhaustion has laid him low .
In 2006 , the globe - trotting Buddhist leader was grounded by his doctors because of exhaustion and canceled all his engagements for a month .
Since the outbreak of violence in Tibet , China has stepped up its campaign to vilify him , blaming him for recent unrest which Beijing says was part of a campaign to split the Himalayan region from the rest of China .
He has denied the allegations and says he only wants greater autonomy for the Himalayan region to protect its Buddhist culture .

Simpler Multithreading in C++0x
The new standard will support multithreading , with a new thread library .
Find out how this will improve porting code , and reduce the number of APIs and syntaxes you use .
by Anthony Williams Aug 18 , 2008 Page 1 of 5 ne major new feature in the C++0 x standard is multi- threading support .
Prior to C++0x , any multi- threading support in your C++ compiler has been provided as an extension to the C++ standard , which has meant that the details of that support varies between compilers and platforms .
However , with the new standard , all compilers will have to conform to the same memory model and provide the same facilities for multi- threading ( though implementors are still free to provide additional extensions ) .
What does this mean for you ?
It means you 'll be able to port multi- threaded code between compilers and platforms with much reduced cost .
This will also reduce the number of different APIs and syntaxes you ’ll have to know when writing for multiple platforms .

It means you 'll be able to port multi- threaded code between compilers and platforms with much reduced cost .
This will also reduce the number of different APIs and syntaxes you ’ll have to know when writing for multiple platforms .
The core of the new thread library is the std :: thread class , which manages a thread of execution , so let 's start by looking at that .
Launching Threads
You start a new thread by constructing an instance of std :: thread with a function .
This function is then used as the entry point for the new thread , and once that function returns , the thread is finished : void do_work ( ) ; std :: thread t( do_work ) ;
This is just like the thread - creation APIs we 're all used to but there 's a crucial difference :
This is C++ , so we 're not restricted to functions .
Just like many of the algorithms in the Standard C++
Library , std :: thread will accept an object of a type that implements the function call operator ( operator ( ) ) , as well as ordinary functions : class do_work { public : void operator ( ) ( ) ; } ; do_work dw ; std : : thread t( dw ) ;
It 's important to note that this actually copies the supplied object into the thread .
If you really want to use the object you supplied ( in which case , you 'd better make sure that it does n't get destroyed before the thread finishes ) , you can do so by wrapping it in std::ref : do_work dw ; std :: thread t( std::ref(dw ) ) ;
Most thread creation APIs allow you to pass a single parameter to your newly created thread , typically a long or a void* .
std:: thread allows arguments too , but you can pass any number , of ( almost ) any type .
Yes , you read that right : any number of arguments .
The constructor uses C++0 x 's new This is just like the thread - creation APIs we 're all used to but there 's a crucial difference :

Yes , you read that right : any number of arguments .
The constructor uses C++0 x's new variadic template facility to allow a variable number of arguments like the old ... varargs syntax , but in a type - safe manner .
You can now pass objects of any copyable type as arguments to the thread function : void do_more_work ( int i , std:: string s, std::vector < double > v ) ; std:: thread t( do_more_work,42 , " hello " , std::vector < double > ( 23,3.141 ) ) ; Just as with the function object itself , the arguments are copied into the thread before the function is invoked , so if you want to pass a reference you need to wrap the argument in std : :ref : void foo ( std : : string& ) ; std:: string s ; std :: thread t( foo , std::ref(s ) ) ;
OK , that 's enough about launching threads .
What about waiting for the thread to finish ?
The C++ Standard calls that " joining " with the thread ( after the POSIX terminology ) , and you do that with the join ( ) member function : void do_work ( ) ; std :: thread t( do_work ) ; t.join ( ) ;
If you 're not planning on joining with your thread , just destroy the thread object or call detach ( ) : void do_work ( ) ; std :: thread t( do_work ) ; t.detach ( ) ;
Now , it 's very well launching all these threads , but if you 're going to share data you 'd better protect it .
The new C++ Standard Library provides facilities for that , too .

Take this one with plenty of salt , but CrunchGear has it that not one , not three , but exactly two new Kindle models are destined to go on sale to the indifferent public within the next 6 to 12 months .
Reportedly , the first model is simply a revamped version of the existing Kindle with a smaller form factor , the same sized screen and an " improved interface . "
The second new version will purportedly be shaped like a 8.5- x 11 - inch sheet of paper and should land early next year .
Both Kindles will be available in a variety of hues , though pricing information remains a mystery .
Hang tight bookworms , we 've still got awhile yet before figuring out just how legitimate this is .

Bandwidth caps are almost universally loathed , except by the companies that implement them .
Consumers hate them because they have to treat the Internet not as an inexhaustable resource , but as something that 's doled out to them .
Each page they view , video they watch , or song they stream moves the needle closer to zero with the resultant overage charges .
Tech companies do n't like them either .
Video services such as Joost and Vuze rely on P2P to deliver their goods , and that , too is going to keep the bandwidth meter spinning , as will an HD rental from your Apple TV .
Even sites like Hulu and YouTube may see less traffic from metered households .
How did we get into this position ?
It 's a result of cable ISPs essentially doing the equivalent of an airline overbooking a flight .
But instead of getting bumped to the next available flight and being given a free roundtrip ticket anywhere in the lower 48 , like airline passengers , cable customers get lower speeds and bandwidth caps .
Although there 's plenty of fine print about actual speed and performance from cable ISPs , they 've historically marketed their services as fast and unlimited in scope .
Comcast 's admission of throttling BitTorrent traffic has led to , among other things , class - action lawsuits accusing them of false advertising .
To their credit , some cable ISPs are working on modernizing their networks and infrastructure to handle increased demand .
But others are relying on traffic shaping , throttling , and bandwidth caps to keep traffic at manageable levels .
Some people find little to object to when it comes to bandwidth caps .
Proponents of caps argue that they offer a fair option for those whose Internet use is truly minimal , and require those who plan to run their connections full throttle 24/7 to pay for the privilege .
Profiting from piracy ?
What about those customers who want to treat their connections as an all - you - can - eat buffet ?
It 's that group of customers that have the potential to rake in the most revenue for bandwidth - capping ISPs .
Like it or not , a lot of the traffic from heavy users comes from P2P and other forms of file - sharing .
Sure , some of that is legit , consisting of content from legitimate P2P companies and things like Linux distros .
But much of it is illicit content : movies , TV shows , and music .
P2P devotees who are forced to live under caps may still choose to exceed their allotments , or pay for a higher cap to satisfy their bandwidth jones .
The illicit traffic will still be flowing through the ISP 's tubes , but with one important distinction : the ISP will now be profiting from their subscribers ' use of P2P .
Want to download the crappy camcorder cap of Kung - Fu Panda ?
You can still do it , and you 'll now be paying your ISP extra for the privilege should you be exceeding the cap .
With all of the attention that Big Content has been throwing ISPs ' way this year ( filtering , anyone ? ) , it 's a sure bet that the possibility of ISPs making still more money from their users ' nefarious activities will draw their attention .
" We understand why ISPs might want to experiment with tiered pricing models , given the rapid growth of legitimate high - bandwidth content online , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
" But it would be troubling if ISPs were to profit from piracy , by charging more for bandwidth used for illegal downloading . "
If anything , the possibility of this happening is likely to turn up the pressure on ISPs to begin filtering out all infringing content from their networks , and neither the ISPs ( with the exception of AT&T ) nor their customers are anxious to see copyright filters deployed .
In the meantime , bandwidth caps appear to be here to stay .
It 's a fact of life in Canada and many other parts of the world , the second - largest cable ISP in the US is experimenting with them , and the largest one is watching it with interest .
We have many freedoms to reflect on in the US on this Independence Day .
Hopefully , independence from filtering wo n't prove too fleeting .
Russia has accused America of starting a new arms race by locating part of its missile defence shield in Poland and warned that its response would go beyond diplomatic measures , according to Telegraph .
Condoleezza Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorsk signed a deal to deploy part of a US missile on Polish territory Photo : AFP
The US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , who yesterday signed a deal with Warsaw to install a silo of 10 interceptor missiles on Poland ’s Baltic Coast , just over 100 miles from Russian territory , described Russian paranoia as “ bizarre ” .
The deal , signed at a ceremony in Warsaw with Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski , would allow for a deployment by 2012 .
Russia has already promised to target the new installation , warning Poland that agreeing to the deal exposed it “ 100 per cent ” to Russian military strikes , possibly with nuclear missiles .
Last night the Russian foreign ministry said its response to the shield “ would go beyond diplomacy ” and said the deal was creating a new arms race in the European “ continent and beyond its borders . ”
After signing the deal however , Miss Rice said such Russian threats “ border on the bizarre ” and promised that the US would “ guarantee ” Poland ’s territory .
She added that the current diplomatic frostiness between Washington and Moscow did not compare with the decades long ideological standoff of the 20th century .
“ I do n’t think this is a new Cold War , ” she said .
“ It is a difficult time but I think we should n’t overstate the depth of the difficulties . ”
Moscow has accused America of using the shield to build a ring of steel around Russia and undermine its strategic nuclear deterrent , but Miss Rice insisted that was not the case .
“ This is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , ” she said .
“ This is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long - range missile threats from countries like Iran or from North Korea . ”
Russian suspicions of a new western - led arms race were exacerbated by the timing of the deal , which was struck last week as Russian forces entered Georgian territory in the Caucasus .
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said it was nothing but “ fairy tales ” to suggest the shield was only directed against “ rogue states ” .
Mr Sikorski has insisted that the timing of the deal was “ pure coincidence ” and said Russia would be invited to inspect the base to ensure that Moscow was not its target .
Despite such assurances , however , the war in the Caucasus has had a dramatic effect on public opinion in Poland , previously sceptical about the benefits of hosting the shield .
Latest surveys reveal that a majority of Poles now back the agreement , which is likely to be ratified by a comprehensive majority in the country ’s parliament .
Some 58 percent of people are now in favour of the missile shield , almost twice the number who supported the deal six months ago .
That was when negotiations between the US and Poland over the missile silo appeared stalled , following 12 months of discussions .
A new Polish government elected last year appeared determined to strike to toughest deal possible in return for Polish cooperation with Washington .
Above all , new centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk wanted American Patriot missile batteries , capable of destroying incoming short - range warheads , on Polish territory .
Under the terms of the deal signed yesterday , a US patriot battery will be relocated to Poland by 2009 .
“ The presence of the Patriot battery which will defend our territory and the US installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement , ” Mr Tusk said .

You could have wasted time anywhere on the internet today .
We 're glad you wasted it here .
A week ago , NPR did a story on Cindy McCain , describing her as the only child of wealthy Arizona businessman Jim Hensley .
No big surprise , as the same thing has been said of her by other media , including ABC , Newsweek , and The New York Times .
Cindy herself routinely describes herself as an “ only child ” , as she did on CNN a month ago .
The only problem is it is n’t true .
Jim Hensley has another daughter , Kathleen , from his first marriage .
Curiously , the story of Jim Hensley ’s two marriages has some ironic parallels to the story of his second daughter ’s husband , John McCain .
Jim Hensley was also a flier and was injured in WWII .
While recuperating ( and still married to his first wife ) , he met another woman , who became his second wife .
And , of course , this is n’t the first time Cindy McCain has lied .
When Jim Hensley died , he left the bulk of his estate ( worth tens , if not hundreds , of millions of dollars ) to Cindy , the daughter from his second wife .
As for his first daughter , her son puts it this way when explaining why he contacted NPR over the story :
The fact that we do n’t exist .
The fact that we ’ve never been recognized , and then Cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something that ’s not true .
Recently , again and again .
It ’s just very , very hurtful .
NPR contacted the McCain campaign ( and Cindy McCain ) to comment or respond .
Neither replied .
UPDATE : Turns out that Cindy has yet another half sister .
I guess ol ’
Jim had lots of “ family values ” as this one appears to have been born out of wedlock .
Cindy McCain also lied about talking to Mother Teresa during a trip to Bangladesh .
According to the Christian Science Monitor she never met or talked to Mother Teresa .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc ’s 5 percent stake in Time Warner Inc ’s AOL unit may be worth less than the $ 1 billion the Web company paid for it in 2006 , Google warned in a regulatory filing on Thursday .

“ We believe our investment in AOL may be impaired , ” Google said in its latest quarterly financial filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Google said it would continue to review its investment for impairment , and financial write - downs could be required in the future .
In a deal announced in December 2005 and which closed the following year , Google paid $ 1 billion in cash for a 5 percent indirect equity stake in AOL .
The deal by the Mountain View , California - based company gave AOL a theoretical valuation of $ 20 billion at the time .
In return , Google secured renewal of its search advertising deal with AOL , its largest ad partner , at least until Google ’s recent partnership with Yahoo takes effect in coming months , analysts say .
Google ’s original pact with AOL in 2002 was the landmark deal that legitimized Google ’s advertising services .
PREPARING TO SPLIT
The formal admission by the Silicon Valley Internet giant that the value of its investment may have fallen follows recent moves by Time Warner to shape up AOL for a possible sale .
Time Warner , which has been considering how it might dispose of AOL in order to focus on its core media properties , said on Wednesday it plans to split AOL ’s dial - up unit from its advertising business by early 2009 .
The move is a major step toward the eventual sale of one or both of the businesses , and would allow Time Warner to move beyond the troubled legacy of its 2001 mega - merger with America Online , which was then hailed as the “ Deal of the Century . ”
On July 1 , Google received the right , but not the obligation , to force the media conglomerate to bring its Internet unit to the market , under terms of their 2006 deal .
But at current market valuations , Google stands to lose an estimated $ 500 million if AOL is spun off , analysts estimate .
AOL ’s $ 20 billion valuation , established at the time by Google ’s $ 1 billion investment , has been cut by roughly half to as low as $ 10 billion by some published projections .
In the six quarters ending last December , AOL shed nearly half of its total subscribers , as 8.3 million cancellations left it with 9.3 million paying members .
FALLING PRICE
Working in AOL ’s favor has been the growing value of its advertising assets .
According to a February report by brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein , less than 35 percent of AOL visitors are members , suggesting it is less reliant on dial - up subscribers .
The report estimated at the time that AOL ’s advertising and media business alone could be worth as little as $ 10.1 billion and its dial - up access business worth about $ 3.7 billion .
For more than a year , Time Warner has been in informal talks with partners ranging from Yahoo Inc to News Corp on potential deals involving its AOL unit , sources have previously told Reuters .
To put the $ 1 billion investment in perspective , Google had $ 12.7 billion in cash as of June 30 .
It generated $ 1.77 billion in cash from operations in the second quarter from sales of advertising sold alongside search results on Google.com and affiliated Web sites such as AOL , MySpace and Ask.com .
Google also gets an estimated $ 70 million to $ 80 million annually from AOL by providing search ad services , and is unlikely to want to risk AOL taking its business to rivals , analysts say .
Google ’s investment in AOL allowed it to keep its long - standing ad partnership with AOL and deprived rival Microsoft from winning the deal during negotiations in 2005 .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - A Norwegian museum director says he has discovered cartoons which he believes were drawn by Adolf Hitler during World War Two .
There was no independent confirmation that the drawings were the work of the Nazi leader , who tried to make a living as an artist before going into politics .
William Hakvaag , director of a war museum in northern Norway , said on Thursday he had found the drawings hidden in a painting signed “ A. Hitler ” that he bought at a German auction for about $ 300 .
He found three colored cartoons of dwarfs from the 1937 Walt Disney film “ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ” , signed A.H. , and an unsigned sketch of “ Pinocchio ” , a character in another Disney film , he said .
He said he had done tests on the paintings and suggested they dated from 1940 .
In 1983 , German news magazine Stern published what it said were extracts from Hitler ’s diaries .
They were later exposed to be forgeries .
Hakvaag told Reuters : “ I am 100 percent sure that these are drawings by Hitler ... If one wanted to make a forgery , one would never hide it in the back of a picture , where it might never be discovered . ”
The initials on the sketches , and the signature on the painting , matched other copies of Hitler ’s handwriting , he said .
“ Hitler had a copy of Snow White .
He thought this was one of the best movies ever made , ” Hakvaag said about the animated classic , an adaptation of a German fairy tale .
The airline 's decision to send its 737s to Malaysia for maintenance checks has come under intense scrutiny after the first plane sent there two months ago came back with 95 defects .
It was grounded in Melbourne on Thursday because of noise from an air - conditioning fault .
Malaysia Airlines issued a statement yesterday defending its checks and calling Australian reports on defects unsubstantiated .
Two other planes were earmarked for heavy " C " checks - a regular procedure lasting more than a week , in which engineers have to check most of the airplane 's parts - in Malaysia .
But the airline 's monthly maintenance schedule put out last week showed the planes were rescheduled to be checked at Tullamarine in Melbourne .
As a result , checks on two other planes that were to take place at Tullamarine will now take place at Avalon in Victoria , and two planes that were to be checked at Avalon will be sent to a third party , John Holland Aviation Services , in Tullamarine .
" We do n't know why it changed , but it 's likely tied to the fact that CASA are yet to finish their investigation [ into maintenance procedures ] , " a source said .
The executive general manager of engineering at Qantas , David Cox , confirmed the maintenance work will now be done in Australia .
" We only have overflow heavy maintenance work undertaken overseas , " he said .
" We explored options for checks on two 737-400 aircraft .
Once space became available at our Tullamarine facility , the decision was taken to have the work done there . "
A CASA spokesman said the decision was made by the airline and was not the result of an order made by the authority .
He confirmed that the airline has regulatory approval to conduct maintenance checks at the Malaysian base but investigations into the aircraft that returned from that facility earlier this year were continuing .
" It 's too early to say whether [ the aircraft 's grounding in Melbourne ] was related to the maintenance check in Malaysia or not , " the spokesman said .
The senior general manager of Malaysia Airlines , Mohammed Roslan Ismail , defended the checks in a statement yesterday , saying Qantas had 12 personnel attached to its maintenance team .
" All the highlights were rectified , to the satisfaction of the Qantas team , before aircraft delivery to Australia , " he said .
" With regards to the ' string of faults ' that were reported in the media , [ Malaysia Airlines ] investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated .
" This is based on the fact that all these aspects were originally checked and found to be free from defect during the maintenance check and test flight , with the concurrence from the Qantas team . "

John DaCosta and N.B. Salty Miller each received $ 139,321.01 from the IRS Whistleblower Office for information they provided about alleged tax violations by Margie Geddes .
They are unhappy with the award and claim that the IRS already has recovered $ 2 million in taxes , penalties , and fines from Ms. Geddes and may ultimately recover $ 50 million .
They filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeking an award of 15 % of the amounts recovered by the IRS from Ms. Geddes .
The court dismissed the case on the ground that the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction over whistleblower claims and that it lacked authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1631 to transfer the case because the Tax Court is not a true " court " for purposes of the statute .

The Federal Communications Commission has approved the first Android - based phone – but that may not be enough to get the phone on the market by the holidays , observers say .
Last week , bloggers were speculating that T - Mobile could introduce the phone , which is being built by Taiwanese manufacturer HTC , as early as Sept. 17 , while the FCC documents suggest a release date closer to Nov. 10 .
Either way , the introduction would be a significant milestone for the Google - backed Android project , which aims to create an open - source operating system for phones but has not yet produced a commercial product .
But can Google , HTC and T - Mobile really deliver a blockbuster product by then ?
Several industry watchers contacted by Wired.com think it is going to be a challenge .
The worst thing Google can do is to rush a “ half - baked product , ” says Jack Gold , an analyst with J. Gold Associates .
And even Google has recently admitted that the operating system is not ready for prime time .
At the LinuxWorld conference in San Francisco earlier this month , Eric Chu , Google ’s mobile platform program manager , said the core operating system was only about 80 percent complete .
That means Google has just days to complete the OS , release a new software developer kit , and get it into the hands of phone manufacturers , especially if it wants to have the phone out in the market in the next two months , says Gold .
Still in its first version , Android will undoubtedly need a lot of testing .
And while Google employees are already part of the testing process , there may not be enough time to iron out all the glitches before Nov. 10 .
What 's more , sources within the Googleplex suggest the phone has n't entirely wowed users , especially when compared with Apple 's iPhone .
Meanwhile , T - Mobile also needs to test the phone and it is unclear if the next few weeks will be enough for the company to finish its own carrier certification process , according to Gold and Trip Chowdhry , an analyst with Global Equities Research .
Chowdhry adds that Google will also need time to build up buzz on the marketing front , adding to the time pressure .
So will the next few weeks be enough for Google , HTC and T - Mobile ?
Gold believes the trio could announce the new Android - powered phone but make it available in retail shelves a few weeks later , much like what Apple did with the iPhone .
That would enable them to offer the device in the fourth quarter , as promised , while buying themselves a few more weeks to test it and get production in line .
Even then , it is likely that Google , HTC and T - Mobile could roll out a basic phone , without all the flexibility of a more mature operating system , says Ross Rubin , director of industry analysis at the NPD Group .
Even if the HTC Dream , as the phone is likely to be called , hits the market on time , it might not be good enough to get users excited , says Gold .
" Anyone can push a device out quickly , " he says .
" But the question is will it be robust enough . "
Google has much at stake and the company needs to get it right the first time around .
Going up against Apple 's iPhone , it may not get too many chances , especially if it botches the launch .

BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) -- Colombian military intelligence used the Red Cross emblem in a rescue operation in which leftist guerrillas were duped into handing over 15 hostages , according to unpublished photographs and video viewed by CNN .
What seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a bib worn by a man involved in the rescue in this official image .
Photographs of the Colombian military intelligence - led team that spearheaded the rescue , shown to CNN by a confidential military source , show one man wearing a bib with the Red Cross symbol .
The military source said the three photos were taken moments before the mission took off to persuade the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebels to release the hostages to a supposed international aid group for transport to another rebel area .
Such a use of the Red Cross emblem could constitute a " war crime " under the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law and could endanger humanitarian workers in the future , according to international legal expert Mark Ellis , executive director of the International Bar Association .
" It is clear that the conventions are very strict regarding use of the symbol because of what it represents : impartiality , neutrality .
The fear is that any misuse of the symbol would weaken that neutrality and would weaken the [ Red Cross ] , " Ellis said .
Watch possible misuse of emblem »
" If you use the emblem in a deceitful way , generally the conventions say it would be a breach .
[ Based on the information as explained to me , ] the way that the images show the Red Cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime , " he added .
The unpublished video and photos of the mission , hailed internationally as a daring success , were shown to CNN by a military source looking to sell the material .
CNN declined to buy the material at the price being asked ; it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and his top generals have categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the July 2 rescue mission that freed the prized hostages , who included former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and soldiers .
The hostages had endured years of harsh captivity and deprivation in jungle camps since being captured or kidnapped .
Some were held for as long as 10 years .
The rescue ruse also included bogus communications , sent electronically and by human couriers , to convince FARC rebels that superiors were ordering them to hand over hostages to the group posing as aid workers for transfer to another rebel camp .
On Monday , government and military spokesmen reiterated that all logos and emblems used in the operation had been invented and that no genuine symbols had been used .
Misuse of the Red Cross emblem is governed by articles 37 , 38 and 85 of Additional Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions , the international rules of war .
The articles prohibit " feigning of protected status by the use of ... emblems " of neutral parties and say that such misuses are considered breaches of international humanitarian law that qualify as a " war crime . "
Colombia signed the Geneva Conventions in 1949 .
That prohibition was put in place to protect the neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations in an armed conflict and to guarantee their access to all sides .
Use of those emblems by one side of a conflict , for example , could endanger aid workers because those on another side might no longer trust that symbols they see really represent those humanitarian organizations .
An ICRC spokesman in Bogota said the organization had been in " an ongoing confidential dialogue " with the Colombian government about the report that the emblem may have been used in the operation .
Among the photos shown to CNN are some bearing a date stamp of July 2 , taken at an unidentified landing site in the jungle alongside a farm house .
In one of those photographs , about 15 members of a Colombian military intelligence - led team pose for a photo alongside a helicopter .
One of the members , dressed in a dark red T - shirt or polo shirt , khaki cargo pants and a black - and - white Arab - style scarf , also wears a bib of the type worn by Red Cross workers .
The bib bears the Red Cross symbol in the center of two black circles on a white background .
In the space between the two black circles appear in capital letters the French words " Comite International Geneve " ( International Committee Geneva ) .
The same man is standing in the doorway of the helicopter , a Russian - made MI - 17 painted white and orange , in another photo .
In a third photo , he is pictured walking near the helicopter still wearing the bib .
The same man pictured in the photos can be seen fleetingly in a heavily edited video of the rescue mission issued to the media by the Defense Ministry two days after the hostages were freed .
In one frame , part of what appears to be the Red Cross bib is visible as the man wearing it stands in a jungle clearing alongside guerrilla commanders Gerardo Antonio Aguilar , alias Cesar , and Alexander Farfan , known as Enrique Gafas , who were captured in the operation .
The red blur of a Red Cross can be seen and part of the two black circles of the emblem and the capital letters " EVE " .
Those are also the last three letters of word Geneve ( Geneva ) , which appears on the official ICRC emblem and bib .
In two other frames of the officially released video , the same man , dressed in the same clothes as in the pre-departure photos , can be seen still wearing the predominantly white bib tied at the sides .
In those shots the ICRC logo is not visible .
The unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the Spanish words " Mision Internacional Humanitaria " ( International Humanitarian Mission ) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves .
In the 3½ - minute video of the operation issued by the military , emblems pasted on the side of the rescue helicopter cannot be seen .
But in the unpublished video and photos shown to CNN , emblems measuring about one square meter ( one square yard ) are pasted onto the outside of the chopper .
The same emblem appears on the Web site for Mision Internacional Humanitaria , which describes itself as a non-governmental organization based in Barcelona , Spain , that " works to improve the processes of development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and peoples . "
Although the site says the group is registered with the Spanish Interior Ministry and the regional Department of Justice , the site is littered with misspellings , and the telephone number that 's listed is 000000000 .
CNN was unable to contact the group to verify its existence .
The group 's Web site could not be accessed early Tuesday .
Additional video clips show how the emblems on the side of the helicopter were stripped off and burned once the rescue mission had been completed .
The fate of the bib is not clear from the clips .
In a brief statement Monday , the media spokesman for the Red Cross mission in Bogota reiterated that the group had not been officially involved in the rescue operation .
" The International Committee of the Red Cross cannot confirm that its logo and / or the Red Cross emblem were used , " the spokesman said .
" The ICRC maintains an ongoing confidential dialogue with the Colombian authorities on a variety of humanitarian issues , including news reports that the Red Cross emblem may have been used in this operation . "
Uribe , Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos , armed forces chief Gen. Freddy Padilla and army chief Gen. Mario Montoya all categorically stated immediately after the rescue operation that no genuine international humanitarian emblems had been used or misused .
In a nationally televised news conference , Uribe asked Betancourt whether she had seen any emblems on the helicopter that came to pick her and the other hostages up .
She replied that she had not and that the lack of markings had puzzled her .
" After all these years of guerrilla war , we have become experts in identifying who is before us , " she answered .
" That 's why I said it was very strange to me .
I said , ' Well , what is this ?
A helicopter , a white helicopter .
Red Cross ?
No. France ?
No . '
There was no flag .
There was nothing ; there was no sign anywhere . "
In the official video released by the military , the man wearing what appeared to be a Red Cross bib is standing alongside Betancourt and another rescued hostage just before they board the rescue helicopter .
That is in the part of the video in which the logo is blurred and not readily identifiable .
Both of Colombia 's two main guerrilla armies , the FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army , have been known to misuse the Red Cross symbol , sometimes transporting fighters in ambulances .
The Colombian government frequently makes international denunciations of rebel violations of international humanitarian law .
The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world are highly respected international and national organizations , especially for their work in combat zones .
Their statutes establish a position of strict neutrality in a conflict , which guarantees their ability to bring humanitarian aid to all sides in a conflict .
Other national and international aid organizations do not have such strict rules on neutrality and operating procedures .
International humanitarian law , partly enshrined in the Geneva Conventions , is seen as a systematic attempt to establish certain rules of war and limit the savagery of conflict .
The laws seek to set clear distinctions between warring factions , neutral parties and civilians and what rights and responsibilities each of these has in a combat zone .
Additional Protocol
One and the articles referring to the misuse of international emblems technically refers to international armed conflicts .
But signatory nations as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross also consider it a benchmark for internal conflicts , such as the four - decade - old war in Colombia .
Other photos shown to CNN indicate how little was done to disguise equipment used in the rescue .
The two military MI - 17 helicopters used in the rescue were repainted white and orange without removing armor- plated panels positioned around the outside of the cockpit .
Another shot shows the pilots wearing what appear to be military pilots ' helmets that have been repainted white with orange or red V - shaped stripes .
The helmets still have prominent mounts on the front used for attaching night vision goggles .
One other video clip shows the two guerrilla commanders , who had boarded the helicopter with their hostages , carried out of the chopper over the shoulders of two men the CNN source identified as plain - clothes military personnel .
The rebels were blindfolded and partially stripped .
As they were dumped on the ground , they appeared groggy and stunned .
Before the departure of the operation , two soldiers in camouflage uniforms can be seen on the farm where the helicopters were staged , chasing a chicken and stunning it with a stun gun .

Advertisement Four protesters have been arrested after breaching a perimeter fence surrounding Kingsnorth power station .
Police said the activists were stopped before they reached the inner fence .
Four people were also arrested trying to launch a boat on the River Medway .
Officers in riot gear and about 15 police vans were stationed in front of the power station on the Hoo peninsula .
About 100 activists opposing the firm 's plans to build new coal - fired units in Kent had marched to the plant gates .
They had said they wanted to shut it down as part of a day of action against climate change .
Human chain E.on spokesman Jonathan Smith denied activists claims that the power station had stopped running .
He said : " It is operating , it 's business as usual .
There is always a lower demand for power on a Saturday , but it is running . "
About 1,500 people have been stationed at the Climate Camp , which is one mile from Kingsnorth , over the past week .
Campaigners carrying drums and banners , and flanked by police officers , marched from the site to the gates of the power station on Saturday morning .
They listened to speeches by environmental campaigners such as Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies once they were outside the plant .
Most of the protesters returned to the camp in the afternoon apart from about 20 who created a human chain in front of the site 's gates and had to be removed by police in riot gear .
Police have stopped people taking part in the " Great Rebel Raft Regatta "
The procession was part of the activists ' " four - pronged attack " on Kingsnorth .
Four demonstrators trying to launch a boat on to the River Medway as part of a " Great Rebel Raft Regatta " were arrested by Kent Police and four boats were stopped .
A spokeswoman for the Climate Camp claimed between 20 to 30 rafts had taken to the River Medway as part of the river protest .
She also said eight kayakers were detained by police when they got close to the station .
The Medway Port Authority harbour master announced on Thursday that he would not give permission to any procession or regatta to take place under river byelaws because of safety concerns .
Cleaner coal
In July E.On was granted an injunction to prevent campaigners getting access to a jetty on the River Medway where fuel is delivered to the power station .
Campaigners from the Climate Camp said they had also planned to approach the power station by air and through the undergrowth surrounding the site .
E.On plans to build two new cleaner coal units on the site , which it claims will be 20 % cleaner .
Medway Council has approved the scheme , which would be the first coal - fired power station to be built in the UK for 24 years , and the final decision will be made by the government .
If approved , E. On said the power station would be operational by 2012 and would provide energy for 1.5 million homes .

What are these ?
More importantly for us now , there are hundreds more biblical prophecies about future events and world conditions .
Some of these are being fulfilled in our times , and they presage the fulfillment of yet others in the future , perhaps even in our lifetimes .
These future events are of such size and scope , and are so momentous in nature , that you will want to be prepared for them when they happen .
The prophets of the Bible foretold amazing things about the future .
Many of their predictions have already come to pass .
For instance , there are over 300 prophecies about Jesus Christ , all written down hundreds of years before
His birth , that were fulfilled during His lifetime on earth .
The chance of even eight of those prophecies being fulfilled in one man have been estimated at one chance in one hundred million billion .
Current predictions about the future of the world run from the utopian to the cataclysmic .
Is the world headed for a bright or dismal future , or both ?
Will humanity ever be able to overcome its legacy of centuries of conflict and short - sighted exploitation and build a unified society of peace and harmony ?
Or will the earth descend into chaos and become an environmental wasteland ?
The following is a short summary of the events and conditions the Bible predicts are to come in chronological order .
Signs of the Times
Today , conditions prevail and events are taking place that Jesus said would signal His return and the end of the world as we know it .
Jesus , as well as several biblical writers , likened these signs to a woman in labor prior to giving birth .
Many of these “ birth pains , ” such as war , famine , earthquakes , and pestilences have been evident for a long time .
Yet man has in this modern age invented weapons capable of previously unheard of death and destruction .
Famine is a reality for millions , and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that over 800 million people go hungry each day , and malnutrition in children contributes to over half of child deaths .
Pollution , global warming , and the depletion of resources points toward even greater famine and consequent violence in the near future .
One bright aspect of the modern age is the global spread of the Good News of the Gospel , made possible by modern communication media such as radio , television and the Internet .
As a result , the Gospel has been taught in all nations , like never before in the course of history .
Daniel , a Jewish prophet who lived 500 years before Jesus , wrote that in the end times travel , knowledge , and education would increase , something that has happened at an exponential rate in contemporary times and continues to do so .
The labor that precedes childbirth does n’t go on indefinitely , and it will be only a matter of time before events culminate in the return of Jesus Christ .
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately .
“ Tell us , ” they said , “ what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age ? ” Jesus answered .
“ You will hear of wars and rumors of wars , but see to it that you are not alarmed .
Such things must happen , but the end is still to come .
Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
There will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
All these are the beginning of birth pains .
“ Because of the increase of wickedness , the love of most will grow cold , but he who stands firm to the end will be saved .
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come . ” ( Matthew 24:3 - 8 , 12-14 NIV )
“ But Daniel , keep this prophecy a secret ; seal it up so that it will not be understood until the end times , when travel and education shall be vastly increased ! ” ( Daniel 12:4 TLB )
The Antichrist
A powerful empire will arise on the world stage , led by a person referred to in the Bible as a “ vile person , ” “ man of lawlessness ” and “ son of perdition , ” but most commonly referred to as the " Antichrist , " who will come to power at the head of this world government .
His evil nature will not be so evident at first , and many will regard him as a savior because he will be able to bring solutions to some of the world ’s most intractable problems such as a more equitable distribution and consumption of resources ; resolution of long - standing hostilities between nations , ideologies , and religions ; and reduction of economic instability and exploitation .
He will be a man of war and yet gain power by both intrigue and nonbelligerent means .
He is , however , in league with Satan , and in the end will become the embodiment of evil .
It is the last hour ; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming .
( 1 John 2:18 ) Let no one deceive you by any means ; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of perdition , who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped , so that he sits as God in the temple of God , showing himself that he is God .
The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan , with all power , signs , and lying wonders .
( 2 Thessalonians 2:3- 4,9 ) [ This ] vile person … shall come in peaceably , and seize the kingdom by intrigue . …
He shall do what his fathers have not done , nor his forefathers : he shall disperse among them the plunder , spoil , and riches ; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds , but only for a time .
( Daniel 11:21,25 )
So they worshiped [ Satan ] who gave authority to the beast [ Antichrist ] ; and they worshiped the beast , saying , “ Who is like the beast ?
Who is able to make war with him ? ” …
And authority was given him over every tribe , tongue , and nation .
All who dwell on the earth will worship him , whose names have not been written in the Book of Life .
( Revelation 13:4,7-8 )
The Covenant
The Antichrist will initiate , or at the least be very much involved in , an agreement called the “ Holy Covenant ” in the Bible , which temporarily brings a measure of peace and security to the world .
It will include a solution to the vexing problem of a just Israeli / Palestinian settlement , and will allow the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem .
The signing of this covenant will signal the start of the last seven years of man ’s dominion on earth and this present age of human history .
Approximately three and a half years into the agreement , after surviving what may likely be an assassination attempt , the megalomaniacal Antichrist will break the covenant , declare himself God , and abolish all religious worship except devotion to himself and his totalitarian world order .
He will confirm a covenant with many for one “ seven ” [ seven years ] .
In the middle of the “ seven ” [ years ] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering [ religious rites ] .
( Daniel 9:27 NIV )
And after the league is made with him [ the Antichrist ] shall act deceitfully , for he shall come up and become strong with a small number of people .
… his heart shall be moved against the holy covenant ; so he shall … rage against the holy covenant , and do damage . …
Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery .
( Daniel 11:23,28-29,32 )
Then I stood on the sand of the sea .
And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea , having seven heads .
…
And I saw one of his heads [ the Antichrist ] as if it had been mortally wounded , and his deadly wound was healed .
And all the world marveled and followed the beast .
( Revelation 13:1,3 )
The Image of the Beast
When the Antichrist breaks the covenant , the mysterious " abomination of desolation " is erected in the precincts of the Jewish Temple .
The prophet Daniel wrote of it a number of times , and Jesus confirmed that when it is erected there it will signal the beginning of the 1,260 - day period known as the Great Tribulation .
Daniel refers several times to this abomination ’s capacity to bring desolation .
In the book of Revelation it is called the " image of the beast , " and it has power to cause those that do not worship it to be killed .
It could be some sort of cybernetic representation of the Antichrist endowed with artificial intelligence allowing it to speak and issue orders .
The Antichrist ’s government demands that all people worship it .
However , those who willingly comply are condemned to the same fate awaiting the Antichrist .
Therefore when you see the “ abomination of desolation , ” spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place … then there will be great tribulation , such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time , no , nor ever shall be .
( Matthew 24:15,21 ) [ The Antichrist ’s false prophet ] deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast , telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived .
He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
( Revelation 13:14 - 16 ) [ An angel said ] with a loud voice , “ If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation .
He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . ” ( Revelation 14:9 - 10 ) ; See also Daniel 9:27 and Daniel 11:31 )
The Great Tribulation
After the covenant is broken , the next three and a half years will see the world plunge into unprecedented social chaos .
This period of time is known in the Bible as the “ Great Tribulation . ”
The Antichrist and his government will systematically persecute those who refuse to worship him .
An electronic monetary system will be put in place , and everyone wishing to “ buy and sell ” will be required to receive the “ mark of the beast . ”
This will be a personalized account number somehow embedded , possibly in the form of an electronic chip , in people ’s right hands or foreheads .
This account number is enigmatically linked to the number 666 .
God ’s
Word warns people not to receive this mark .
Meanwhile , God helps Christians and others who resist the Antichrist , and in their defense unleashes pestilences and plagues on the Antichrist and his followers .
We are also told how two of God ’s prophets will perform miracles and publicly defy the Antichrist .
Other believers may also be empowered by God to perform miracles during this time of Great Tribulation .
For then there will be great distress , unequaled from the beginning of the world until now — and never to be equaled again .
If those days had not been cut short , no one would survive , but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened .
( Matthew 24:21 -23 NIV )
He causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
Here is wisdom .
Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man :
His number is 666 .
( Revelation 13:16 - 18 )
Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth .
And to them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth , or any green thing , or any tree , but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
And they were not given authority to kill them , but to torment them for five months .
And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man .
In those days men will seek death and will not find it ; they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
( Revelation 9:3 - 6 ) [ An angel ] will give power to two witnesses , and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . …
And if anyone wants to harm them , fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies .
And if anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this manner .
These have power to shut heaven , so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy ; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to strike the earth with all plagues , as often as they desire .
( Revelation 11:3,5-6 )
Nuclear War
At some point , likely near the end of the three - and - a - half years of Great Tribulation , the Antichrist and ten “ kings , ” who join forces with him , will destroy the mysterious “ Babylon the Great , ” in what sounds like a nuclear holocaust .
Scripture indicates that this Babylon is not the ancient city or empire by that name , but rather the great worldwide , materialistic , capitalistic system , epitomized by — but not limited to — the USA .
According to the visions of the prophet Daniel , the ten kings who join with the Antichrist emerge from the ancient Roman Empire .
And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns . …
And on her forehead a name was written : ‘ Mystery , Babylon the Great , the Mother of Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth . ’
I saw the woman , drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus .
( Revelation 17:3 , 5 - 6 )
The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet , but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast .
These are of one mind , and they will give their power and authority to the beast . …
These will hate the harlot , make her desolate and naked , eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
( Revelation 17:12 -13,16 )
Therefore her plagues will come in one day — death and mourning and famine .
And she will be utterly burned with fire . …
The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her , when they see the smoke of her burning , standing at a distance for fear of her torment , saying , “ Alas , alas , that great city Babylon , that mighty city !
For in one hour your judgment has come . ”
“ And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her , for no one buys their merchandise anymore : … Alas , alas , that great city , in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth !
For in one hour she is made desolate . ” ( Revelation 18:8-11,19 ) ; See also Daniel 7:7–8,19 –24 .
The Second Coming of Jesus Christ
At the end of the Great Tribulation , Jesus will return .
The sun and the moon will be darkened , but then a bright light will be seen around the world , followed by the sound of a mighty trumpet .
Jesus will be seen by everyone as He appears in the clouds of the sky surrounded by angels .
Then
He will rescue
His followers out of this world , and they will receive new immortal bodies and be caught up from the earth in what is called the Rapture .
Scripture is clear that this event occurs “ immediately after the Tribulation ” and not before , as portrayed in recent popular novels and movies .
Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
( Matthew 24:29 )
Then the seventh angel sounded :
And there were loud voices in heaven , saying , “ The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ , and He shall reign forever and ever ! ” ( Revelation 11:15 )
Then I looked , and behold , a white cloud , and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man , having on His head a golden crown .
( Revelation 14:14 - 16 )
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
And He will send
His angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather together His elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
( Matthew 24:30 - 31 )
Behold , I tell you a mystery :
We shall not all [ die ] , but we shall all be changed — in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet .
For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
( 1 Corinthians 15:51 - 52 )
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel , and with the trumpet of God .
And the dead in Christ will rise first .
Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air .
And thus we shall always be with the Lord .
Therefore comfort one another with these words .
( 1 Thessalonians 4:16 - 18 )
The Marriage Supper of the Lamb
In heaven , a celebration is then held called the Marriage Supper of the Lamb .
One of the titles for Jesus is “ Lamb of God , ” ( John 1:29 ) and His bride is all those who believe on Him .
( Romans 7:4 )
The marital metaphor is used in the Bible to describe the intimate spiritual unity between Christ and His people , and the fervency of the loving union of heart , mind , and spirit that accompanies this relationship .
During this Marriage Supper , Jesus will unite with those
He rescued in the Rapture , and His followers throughout the ages , and at His Judgment Seat
He will reward them with eternal crowns of life .
And I heard , as it were , the voice of a great multitude , as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings , saying , “ Alleluia !
For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns !
Let us be glad and rejoice and give
Him glory , for the marriage of the Lamb has come , and His wife has made herself ready . ”
And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen , clean and bright , for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints .
Then he said to me , “ Write : ‘ Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb ! ’ ” ( Revelation 19:6 - 9 )
For the Son of Man [ Jesus ] will come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and then He will reward each according to his works .
( Matthew 16:27 ) When the Chief Shepherd [ Jesus ] appears , you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away .
( 1 Peter 5:4 )
The Wrath of God
The devastating plagues described in the Bible as the “ wrath of God ” will be poured upon the world , at the same time that the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is being celebrated , specifically targeting the Antichrist and his forces .
And the twenty - four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God , saying : … “ The nations were angry , and Your wrath has come … and should destroy those who destroy the earth . ” ( Revelation 11:16,18 )
Out … came the seven angels having the seven plagues [ and ] seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God . …
The first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth , and a foul and loathsome sore came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image .
Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man ; and every living creature in the sea died .
Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water , and they became blood .
Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and power was given to him to scorch men with fire .
And men were scorched with great heat , and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues ; and they did not repent and give
Him glory .
Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom became full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain .
They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and did not repent of their deeds .
Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up , so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared .
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air , and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ” ( Revelation 15:6 , 16:2-4,8-12,17 )
The Battle of Armageddon
On a plain in northern Israel , the Antichrist will muster his armies for his final campaign against the nations that still oppose him .
At that time , Jesus and His heavenly army will return to earth to utterly destroy the Antichrist ’s forces and deliver those who opposed his tyranny .
The Antichrist and his leading henchman , the false prophet , will both be cast alive into the lake of fire , a place of punishment .
Satan , who plagued humankind throughout history and possessed the Antichrist , will be imprisoned in the “ bottomless pit . ”
The kings of the earth and of the whole world , gather … to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
… to the place called in Hebrew , Armageddon .
( Revelation 16:14,16 ) I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse .
And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness
He judges and makes war . …
And the armies in heaven , clothed in fine linen , white and clean , followed Him on white horses .
…
And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written : King of Kings and Lord of Lords .
( Revelation 19:11,14,16 )
Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations , as He fights in the day of battle .
And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives , which faces Jerusalem on the east .
And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two , from east to west , making a very large valley .
…
Thus the Lord my God will come , and all the saints .
( Zechariah 14:3 - 5 ) And I saw the beast , the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army .
Then the beast was captured , and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence , by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image .
These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone .
And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse .
( Revelation 19:19 - 21 )
Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
He laid hold of the dragon , that serpent of old , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ; and he cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal on him , so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished .
( Revelation 20:1 - 3 )
The Millennium
The restoration of the war - damaged earth will then begin .
Jesus will rule on earth for 1,000 years , assisted by those who had been
His followers in their earthly lives .
This time is commonly called the Millennium and will be a veritable golden age compared to the world that preceded it .
Peace and harmony will be largely restored to the world and enmity between animals — and between animals and humankind — will end .
There will be those who survive the cataclysms surrounding Armageddon , people who neither followed the Antichrist nor were believers in Jesus Christ .
These live on in a simpler and righteous world , where loving God and others will be the governing rule .
The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed .
( Daniel 2:44 )
The kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people , the saints of the Most High .
His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey Him .
( Daniel 7:27 )
And I saw thrones , and they sat on them , and judgment was committed to them .
Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands . …
They shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with Him a thousand years .
( Revelation 20:4,6 )
He shall judge between the nations , and rebuke many people ; they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war anymore .
( Isaiah 2:4 ) The whole earth is at rest and quiet .
( Isaiah 14:7 ) [ The Lord ] will even make … rivers in the desert .
The beast of the field will honor [ Him ] .
( Isaiah 43:19 - 20 )
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , the leopard shall lie down with the young goat , the calf and the young lion and the fatling together ; and a little child shall lead them .
The cow and the bear shall graze ; their young ones shall lie down together ; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
The nursing child shall play by the cobra ’s hole , and the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper ’s den .
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain , for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea .
( Isaiah 11:6 - 9 )
The Battle of Gog and Magog
At the end of the Millennium , Satan will be released from the bottomless pit .
He will recruit followers and form a rebellion against Jesus and His government .
Although it seems inconceivable , apparently he will find plenty of followers who rebel against the conditions of Christ ’s benign but firm rule in the Millennium .
That rebellion will be obliterated , along with the entire surface of the earth in the Battle of Gog and Magog .
Then a beautiful new and significantly changed surface will be recreated on the earth .
Now when the thousand years have expired , Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle , whose number is as the sand of the sea .
They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city .
And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them .
( Revelation 20:7-9 )
The heavens will pass away with a great noise , and the elements will melt with fervent heat ; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up . …
The heavens will be dissolved , being on fire , and the elements will melt with fervent heat .
( 2 Peter 3:10,12 ) Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved out of its place .
( Revelation 6:14 ) Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth , for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away .
Also there was no more sea .
[ Revelation 21:1 ( see also 2 Peter 3:13 ) ]
The Great White Throne Judgment
After this , all people from the beginning of time who had not known or believed in Jesus will be resurrected and will stand before God ’s throne to be judged .
They will be either rewarded or punished according to their works and assigned to their places in the hereafter .
And Satan will be cast into “ the lake of fire . ”
Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away .
And there was found no place for them .
( Revelation 20:11 )
He who sat on the throne said , “ I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . ” ( Revelation 21:5 - 6 )
And I saw the dead , small and great , standing before God , and books were opened .
And another book was opened , which is the Book of Life .
And the dead were judged according to their works , by the things which were written in the books .
The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them .
And they were judged , each one according to his works .
( Revelation 20:12 - 13 )
All the nations will be gathered before Him . …
Then the King will say to those on His right hand , “ Come , you blessed of My Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
…
Assuredly , I say to you , inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren , you did it to Me. ” …
Then
He will also say to those on the left hand , “ Depart from Me , you cursed , into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
…
Assuredly , I say to you , inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to Me . ”
And these will go away into everlasting punishment , but the righteous into eternal life .
( Matthew 25:32,34,40-41,45-46 )
The devil , who deceived them , was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are .
And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
( Revelation 20:10 )
And anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
( Revelation 20:14 - 15 )
The Heavenly City
God ’s great pyramid - shaped heavenly city , the dimensions of which are an astronomical 2,200 kilometers square at the base and 2,200 kilometers high at the apex , will then descend to the recreated surface of the earth .
God will dwell in that city with those who love and serve Him !
Then I , John , saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and He will dwell with them , and they shall be His people .
God Himself will be with them and be their God .
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes ; there shall be no more death , nor sorrow , nor crying .
There shall be no more pain , for the former things have passed away . ”
Then
He who sat on the throne said , “ Behold , I make all things new . ” …
I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts .
He who overcomes shall inherit all things , and I will be his God and he shall be My son .
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me , saying , “ Come , I will show you the bride , the Lamb ’s wife . ”
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me the great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , having the glory of God .
Her light was like a most precious stone , like a jasper stone , clear as crystal .
Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates , and twelve angels at the gates , and names written on them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel : three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
The city is laid out as a square ; its length is as great as its breadth .
And he measured the city with the reed : twelve thousand furlongs .
Its length , breadth , and height are equal .
Then he measured its wall : one hundred and forty - four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
The construction of its wall was of jasper ; and the city was pure gold , like clear glass .
The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones : the first foundation was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald , the fifth sardonyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
The twelve gates were twelve pearls : each individual gate was of one pearl .
And the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
But I saw no temple in it , for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple .
The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it , for the glory of God illuminated it .
The Lamb is its light .
And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light , and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it .
Its gates shall not be shut at all by day ( there shall be no night there ) .
And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it .
But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles , or causes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lamb ’s Book of Life .
And he showed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
In the middle of its street , and on either side of the river , was the tree of life , which bore twelve fruits , each tree yielding its fruit every month .
The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
And there shall be no more curse , but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall serve Him .
They shall see His face , and His name shall be on their foreheads .
There shall be no night there :
They need no lamp nor light of the sun , for the Lord God gives them light .
And they shall reign forever and ever .
( Revelation 21:1-7,9-27 , 22:5 )
And that is the happy ending .
Although there are frightening things looming in the future before the end of the story , we can take heart that God is in control and that after the dark night there is a beautiful and eternal tomorrow waiting .
All of these things will come to pass , and you can be prepared in the best way possible for all these events by inviting Jesus into your life and heart today .
He will answer your call and you will be blessed with His presence and love from this time forward , and everlasting life in the future .
You can simply pray the following prayer :
Dear Jesus , I believe that You died for me and that You love me .
I know I need Your presence in my life , and I open my heart and ask You to come in .
Forgive me for my past sins .
Thank you for Your free gift of everlasting life and for Your forgiveness of all my sins .
Help me to love
You and to share Your love and truth with others .
Amen .

Newsbeat reporter
The MyLOL . net website 's owner says changes may take months A Newsbeat investigation has uncovered a dating website specifically for teenagers which campaigners fear will become a " playground for paedophiles " .
Children 's Charity , NSPCC , says MyLOL.net , which is marketed for teenagers but has hundreds of adult profiles , should clean up its act or be shut down .
The site 's owner claims there are security measures in place and they 'll be toughened up soon .
The front page of the site shows a picture of a female in her underwear , who is its most popular member .
Watch a report about MyLOL .
net from BBC Switch
It has 17,000 members worldwide and if you put teen dating into Google , it comes up first in the search .
It has almost 1,700 members in the UK , a quarter of which are under - 16 .
Many of them are pictured in swimwear or underwear .
It also has more than 150 male members who are listed as older than 40 .
Older man ' warning '
The NSPCC says there is a " huge danger " the site will be used by adults to make illegal contact with younger children .
The charity says the site encourages children to give out personal details and photos in a sexualised way .
Zoe Hilton from the charity wants it shut down .
She said : " Many people who may be searching for children will not be honest about their age .
" There does n't seem to be any evidence on this site that they are actually moderating what is going on at all .
We state pretty clearly in the terms of service , specifically not to give out any personal information at all .
It 's up to them if they want to be open
MyLOL.net owner Anthony Lipari " Sites like this one should be taken off the internet . "
Newsbeat discovered online conversations between older men and teenage girls .
In one , a man who says he 's 23 swaps contact details with a 14 - year - old .
Another of the charity 's criticisms is the lack of controls to stop under - 13s using the site .
An 11 - year - old girl called Bethany who uses it told Newsbeat random people have contacted her but " if anyone 's older than me I do n't normally talk to them " .
Her mum Tammy told Newsbeat she 's aware she uses it and checks who she talks to .
She said : " The whole internet , there 's going to be people who are portraying themselves as things they 're not .
" That 's a risk you 've got to teach them about rather than trying to avoid it completely . "
Website advice
There are ' report abuse ' buttons on people 's profiles .
There is also an advice page warning about the dangers of chat rooms and fake users , but you have to click through four pages before you can see it and it's not simple to find .
Please turn on JavaScript .

He bought it recently and says he has n't had time yet to make all the changes he wants to .
He also defended it : " We state pretty clearly in the terms of service , specifically not to give out any personal information at all .
It 's up to them if they want to be open . "
When asked about the dangers of older men contacting young children he replied : " What can we do about it ?
We can't actually find out if they 're paedophiles or anything .
They 're just guys using the site . "
He said there 's already been a case where a 40 - year - old man was harassing a girl on the site .
Anthony Lipari said : " They can report problems if they find guys are abusing them or sending any sort of messages . "
But after being made aware of all the concerns with the site Mr Lipari said security would be improved .
The changes should take a few months .
A spokesperson for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre , CEOP , said : " The issue is whether the content is illegal or not .
" We are aware of the site but wo n't say if it 's under investigation . "

Bush lauds McCain ’s work on GI Bill expansion — despite McCain ’s opposition
On Thursday night , the Senate approved the war supplemental , which included the expansion of the GI Bill , sponsored by Sens. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) and Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) , and approved with broad , bipartisan support .
This morning , the president signed it into law .
For those of you who ca n’t watch clips online , Bush said , “ … I want to thank members who worked hard for the GI Bill expansion — especially Senators Webb and Warner , Graham , Burr , and McCain .
This bill shows the American people that even in an election year , Republicans and Democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families . ”
The chutzpah involved with such a pronouncement is truly breathtaking .
First , the Bush White House publicly opposed the GI Bill expansion .
The president ended up reversing course when lawmakers ignored his demands and passed the bill anyway — by a veto - proof majority ( 75 votes ) .
It left Bush in the untenable position of signing into law a bill he actively fought against , or vetoing a measure to help give veterans better educational benefits .
He wisely chose the prior , but his comments this morning made it sound like Bush wanted the GI Bill expansion all along .
The opposite is true .
Second , and more importantly , the president praising McCain for his “ hard work ” on this bill is a special kind of stupid .
McCain not only opposed the GI Bill expansion , he fought against it .
Indeed , he bragged that his opposition to the bill was evidence of his character .
Just one month before the bill passed , McCain said , “ It would be easier , much easier politically for me to have joined Senator Webb in offering his legislation . ”
But the AP noted , “ McCain said he opposed Webb ’s measure because it would give the same benefit to everyone regardless of how many times he or she has enlisted . ”
McCain went so far as to say the GI Bill expansion would literally “ hurt the military . ”
What ’s more , praising McCain for having “ worked hard ” to pass the bill is especially amusing considering that McCain did n’t even show up to vote at all when the bill came to the floor , and did n’t show up to vote on the supplemental , either .
Indeed , Bush praised five senators this morning for their leadership .
One ( McCain ) fought against the bill and then did n’t bother to vote on it .
Two ( Graham and Burr ) fought against the bill and voted against it .
Chuck Hagel was an original sponsor of the bill , the president ignored him altogether .
( Talk about a slap in the face … . )
Now , the right will argue that McCain , Graham , and Burr deserve praise because they worked with House Republicans to water the bill down a little before final passage .
Why Bush and conservatives believe that was a valuable move is a mystery .
And all of this , of course , comes just a few days after McCain took credit for the passage of a bill he fought every step of the way .
We ’re dealing with a group of people who know no shame , and will lie recklessly and without a hint of embarrassment .
McCain ’s proposal to end the moratorium sparked a fierce back and forth with Barack Obama ’s campaign on energy policy .
McCain plays with fire on offshore drilling
By calling for an end to the federal ban on offshore oil drilling , John McCain is placing a risky bet .
He is wagering that skyrocketing gas prices have finally reached a tipping point , a threshold moment that has led voters to rethink their strong and long - held opinions against coastal oil exploration .
The stakes could n’t be higher :
If he is wrong , McCain will have seriously damaged his chances in two key states with thousands of miles of coastline — California and Florida — and where opposition to offshore oil drilling has been unwavering .
And he will have undermined some of his closest political allies in those states and others , including potential fall battlegrounds such as Virginia and North Carolina .

“ Before $ 4.25 - per - gallon gas , this would have been like pulling a pin on a grenade and rolling it into the state , ” said David Johnson , the former executive director of the Florida Republican Party .
“ It would have been a fool ’s errand to recommend it .
It was never , ever a thing that a smart politician would have done in Florida . ”
In California , the drilling issue is just as volatile , said Sal Russo , a veteran Sacramento , Calif . - based Republican consultant .
“ California got really sensitive about these issues since the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill .
And I do n’t think it ’s changed much since then , ” he said .
“ There are strong feelings on the issue . ”
Indeed , an overwhelming 64 percent of Californians opposed opening up more of the state ’s coast to oil drilling , according to a February 2006 survey by the Public Policy Institute of California .
That figure was up 14 percentage points from 2004 .
“ Overall , the state has been clearly on record , from the governor on down , as strongly opposing offshore drilling , ” said Rep. Lois Capps ( D - Calif. ) , who represents a Santa Barbara - based coastal district that is home to some of the state ’s most vocal drilling resistance .
But that was before the latest gas price spike in two states heavily dependent on automobiles .
State Assemblyman Doug LaMalfa , a Northern California Republican who favors offshore drilling , acknowledged drilling would be a heavy political lift but said rising prices may be a mitigating factor .
“ Traditionally in California , it ’s very difficult to move anything that even hints of being an environmentally sensitive issue .
...
But people are sick and tired of creeping up to $ 5 gas .
Will $ 5 a gallon be enough ? $ 6 ? $ 7 ? ” he said .
" If [ McCain ] can articulate that we can safely and responsibly do this kind of exploration off shore , and that will lower gas prices and help national security , reasonable people would buy that notion . ”
Rep. Sue Myrick ( R - N.C. ) also brushed off concerns that calls to lift the oil drilling moratorium could alienate environmentally minded independent voters .
“ I do n’t see it as a problem .
In paying $ 4 a gallon for gas , the American people have come to realize we ’ve got to get oil for ourselves , ” said Myrick , who recently introduced legislation that would overturn a long - standing moratorium on drilling for oil and natural gas off the Atlantic Coast .
“ Everybody wants clean beaches .
I certainly would not do anything that was going to destroy anything . ”
Myrick and others pointed to a new Rasmussen Reports survey — conducted before McCain announced his proposal on Monday — which found that 67 percent of voters believed drilling should be allowed off the coasts of California , Florida and other states .
Only 18 percent disagreed and 15 percent were undecided .
According to the poll , conservative and moderate voters strongly support offshore drilling , while liberals are more evenly divided : 46 percent of liberals favor drilling ; 37 percent oppose it .
National surveys , however , can fail to take into account the fierce resistance to offshore oil drilling in the states that stand to be affected .
“ We have 1,300 square miles of coastline here and our whole culture and identity is tied to our coastline , ” said Holly Binns , field director for Environment Florida , an environmental advocacy group that opposes offshore oil drilling .
“ This is a state where if you do n’t understand how deep the connections are to our identity and our culture , you could step on a landmine .
This could be one of those cases . ”
Already , one politician appears to have done that .
After opposing drilling during his successful 2006 election campaign , Gov. Charlie Crist ( R - Fla . ) is drawing the ire of environmentalists for appearing to back off from his position in recent days .
He told reporters Tuesday that his position was evolving and that he now supports exploratory drilling for oil and gas off Florida ’s coast because “ Floridians are suffering . ”
“ When you ’re paying over $ 4 a gallon for gas , you have to wonder whether there might be additional resources to bring that price down , ” Crist said .
Crist , who is frequently mentioned as a prospective running mate for McCain , is not the only politician inconvenienced by McCain ’s stance .
“ I ’m trying to clarify my position , ” said Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) .
“ In Florida today most voters probably want more drilling . ”
But Martinez quickly cautioned that Florida would need to be protected by the larger buffer zone mandated in 2006 legislation that promised Florida a 125 - mile barrier from offshore drilling .
The current federal moratorium on drilling is just 50 miles .
“ I want to have more detail , but my hope is [ McCain ] will understand the need to maintain the law as we passed it in 2006 , which gives Florida a 125 - mile buffer , ” Martinez said .
“ The rest of it I can probably live with .
It ’s about providing enough resources where the states want to do it and permit it . ”
McCain ’s proposal to end the moratorium , coupled with a Tuesday speech in Houston in which he broke with many of the environmental policies of the Bush administration , sparked a fierce back and forth on energy policy with Barack Obama ’s campaign .
McCain knocked Obama for proposing “ a windfall profits tax on oil , to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas .
If the plan sounds familiar , it ’s because that was President Jimmy Carter ’s big idea too — and a lot of good it did us . ”
But in May , McCain said he would consider the same proposal .
“ His decision to completely change his position and tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same Washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades , ” the Obama campaign said in a statement .
WE HAVE RETURNED !
What are we ?

Show is an Internet - based puppet show created by Randy “ Yappy ” Fox in November 1999 , broadcast on Sunday nights from 18:00 to 22:00 ET from his home in Kissimmee , Florida .
On September 12 , 2017 , it was announced on the show 's official main page that the show 's original run had come to an end and would no longer be airing with new episodes , after almost 18 years of broadcasting and a total run of 756 episodes .
The reasons cited were the end of Furstre.am and increasing audio license issues due to the music industry making it too difficult to legally use songs in their show .
Video copyright complications also played a role .
It was also decided that ending abruptly would be easier for the cast than doing an emotional last show , thus giving it an unexpected end .
However , we felt a void in our lives ..
On September 2 , 2018 , the Funday Pawet Twitter account officially announced the show would be revived with new episodes once again on Sunday September 9 , 2018 through different platforms by means of streaming .
This was after rumors were confirmed about the series ' making a comeback as the series resulted in a year hiatus .
Unlike the show 's original run however , the revival will not have new episodes on a weekly basis , so it will now run on a semi- weekly or monthly basis .
On top of that , licensed content such as copyrighted music will no longer be used in the show due to royalty issues , so they must use entirely fan - created pieces or public domain music .
Copyrighted videos will no longer be in the series ' run as well .

With the eyes of the world on the Beijing Olympics , Russia and Georgia clashed over the South Ossetia region .
You ’ve read it all — Russia claiming 1,600 dead , tanks , armored vehicles and troops entered South Ossetia with the Russian Navy at the helm , and the Russian Air Force bombing , to “ protect and defend ” South Ossetia from Georgia .
The history of the region is pretty well laid out .
Georgia , as many other countries have been , was first “ absorbed ” by the Russians in the 19th Century , and then , in 1922 , became part of Soviet Russia .
The Soviet “ absorption ” ended in 1991 , and , with some unrest , some conflict , and the typical economic problems that occurred with break off countries , Georgia became it ’s own nation .
It has not been a smooth road – civil unrest , and conflicts arising as both South Ossetia and Abkhazia resolved to be independent and secede from Georgia .
The conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia has been going on since 1992 .
Multiple cease - fires and violent conflicts have continued , on and off since then , with the latest cease - fire ending , and Georgia entering the South Ossetia region .
On August 7 , 2008 , Georgian forces and separatists in South Ossetia agree to observe a ceasefire and hold Russian - mediated talks to end their long - simmering conflict .
Hours later , Georgian forces launch a surprise attack , sending a large force against the breakaway province and reaching the capital Tskhinvali .
( See the timeline , from BBC )
Russia , being the regions “ mediator ” in this conflict , promptly pours it ’s troops and armored division into South Ossetia and engages Georgian forces in Tskhinvali .
Putin was quoted saying [ sic : the Russian Government ] “ condemns the aggressive actions by Georgian troops in South Ossetia ” and that Russia would be compelled to retaliate .
And retaliate they did — with troops , armor , naval ships and air force .
To be totally honest , my first thoughts when this conflict first came to light on the 8th , was 1 ) , “ Perfect timing , while the worlds attention is on the Olympics ” , and 2 ) , “ Oh for - gods - sake I hope the US does n’t think it needs to get involved and that Russia backs off . ”
Wishful thinking on my part ?
But rather alarmed , too , for fear that this will escalate and get out of hand .
But I think I ’m more frightened because of the future implications of Russia ’s current action .
In the most simplistic terms , if Russia can do this with South Ossetia and Georgia , what is to keep them from one day doing the same thing to Estonia ?
Latvia ?
Belarus ?
Moldova ?
Lithuania ?
or any of the other post -Soviet countries ?
Who is to say , that if Russia does not like how Estonia or Ukraine treats its Russians , that Russia wo n’t do the same thing , and again , absorb independent countries into a new Soviet regime ?
If , by any chance , you think me over worried , just look at this :
( Monday , August 18 , 2008 ) FOX News : Russia has placed short range SS - 21 missiles in South Ossetia , that could pose a threat to most major Georgian cities , ” including the capital , Tbilisi , a U.S. Defense official confirmed to FOX News on Monday .

And
BRUSSELS , Belgium ( AP ) – Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that Russia is playing a “ very dangerous game ” with the U.S. and its allies and warned that NATO would not allow Moscow to win in Georgia , destabilize Europe or draw a new Iron Curtain through it .
On her way to an emergency NATO foreign ministers meeting on the crisis , Rice said the alliance would punish Russia for its invasion of the Georgia and deny its ambitions by rebuilding and fully backing Georgia and other Eastern European democracies .
“ We have to deny Russian strategic objectives , which are clearly to undermine Georgia ’s democracy , to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy Georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the Georgian state , ” she said .
“ We are determined to deny them their strategic objective , ” Rice told reporters aboard her plane , adding that any attempt to recreate the Cold War by drawing a “ new line ” through Europe and intimidating former Soviet republics and ex-satellite states into submission would fail .
“ We are not going to allow Russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans - Atlantic structures , ” she said , referring to Georgia and Ukraine , which have not yet joined NATO or the European Union but would like to .

And
Times Online : President Medvedev of Russia yesterday promised a “ shattering blow ” against any foreign power that moved against Russian citizens .

The questions abound —
Why is Russia purporting to care about this region ?
WTF Is Russia doing by placing missiles in South Ossetia ?
Is Russia doing by placing missiles in South Ossetia ?
Is it the Kosovo Factor ?
( Kosovo declared independence in February , 2008 , and is now recognized as an independent nation by many countries in the west . )
Factor ?
( Kosovo declared independence in February , 2008 , and is now recognized as an independent nation by many countries in the west . )
Is it the pipeline ?
Is it just power , for the sake of it ?
Is it in retaliation for Poland wanting the shield ?
Is it because Georgia is not a willing ally and therefore , must pay the price for Pro-Western ambition ?
Why does South Ossetia want sovereignty ?
Do they not understand that , by doing so , they undermine themselves , the region , and any type of livable accord with it ’s neighboring county , and that by declaring itself part of Georgia , it eliminates Putins ’ puppet - mastery and self ( country ? ) aggrandizing need for control ?
Did South Ossetia provoke Georgia , to draw in Russia ?
Why is Georgia armed and readily using force on South Ossetia ?
Did Georgia provoke Russia , thinking that they would have some sort of international military support ?
Why did they back out of the mediation ?
Further , why is Georgia wearing U.S. Military uniforms ?
Is the U.S. training Georgia for conflict , and if so , to what end , and purpose ?
I have too many questions , and not enough answers .
So , I ’m not sure I can really provide any opinion here .
Maybe I ’m just over war ’ed out , as are many Americans – almost to a point of complete apathy .
I look at this conflict with detached and abject eyes : Russia , the aggressor of Georgia ; Georgia the aggressor of South Ossetia ; South Ossetia young , corrupt ( as all young want - to - be ’s are ) , and wanting to be a nation , ( which in my opinion is incredibly idealistic ) , but without the knowledge or understanding of the international implications of it ’s actions .
I can somewhat understand that Russia , playing it ’s Soviet - era games as it always has , will back the South Ossetia citizenry , because it is in Russia ’s best interest to do so .
But to what end ?
What are the real reasons ?
I can fully understand Georgia ’s point of view — if the areas , including both South Ossetia and Abkhazia , become compliant and join with Georgia , NATO and the EU are attainable .
I can fully understand South Ossetia ’s point of view — they wish to be a sovereign nation in their own right .
What people , under the circumstances , would not want that ?
What I would like to see happen is for Russia to back out of the region , Georgia to back out of the conflict , and South Ossetia to get it ’s collective head out of it ’s ass , and hold on to the one good thing they will have if they do so — Georgia as a whole nation , with NATO allies , the backing of the EU and an end to senseless conflict in such a precarious region of the world .
However , with Medvedev being used as the puppet of Putin , ( and therefore Medvedev has no real say ) , and the history of Russia , I can see this conflict ongoing and potentially unstoppable .
Putin has been quoted , stating that he claims to want a “ fair and democratic world order that would ensure security and prosperity not only for a select few , but for all . ”
I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve never really thought of Putin as a “ fair and democratic ” type of person .
Even with the pullout of forces that has supposedly begun , unless all parties can come to a bargaining table , with actual chips to move around , I foresee this ending badly , with many lives lost , and a world at even more odds with itself .
Sander :
There is nothing clear or simple about the five - day war .
We have very little information about what actually happened there .
Massive propaganda war by Russia , which they thankfully lost , muddled things further ( as a side comment , does Kremlin still think that anyone trusts its publications , be they openly Kremlin mouthpieces like regnum .ru or Pravda – or seemingly oh - so - liberal - and - cool sites such as eXile.ru .
There is a reason why Russia is 144th out of 169 countries in 2007 Press Freedom Index – and it ai n’t their love for free media ) .
One thing seems to be certain – after months of open provocations ( which included bombing Georgian villages by “ Ossetian separatists ” ( read : Russian planning , financing and weapons ) )
Georgia finally flipped and moved military to South Ossetia .
Stories about bombing civilians and genocide do n’t seem to have any truth to them – or does anyone really believe that Georgians made a video how they launched rockets to kill civilians , and then promptly released that video to Russian media for propaganda purposes ?
Not to mention , while at first Russian officials reported 2000 victims and reduced the number to 1600 soon , Tskhinvali central hospital naively reported only 44 deaths .
Also , Russian and Ossetian forces were caught presenting their KIA soldiers as civilian casualties , going so far as to dress their killed to civilian clothes and “ planting ” them to residential buildings .
If there was bombing of civilians , I fear it was in the same style like shelling of Mainila .
It is easy to see in hindsight , but Georgian president Saakashvili did not realize two things when he ordered troops to move into separatist South Ossetia – firstly , that Russia had been waiting for that and were instantly ready to move in their “ peacekeeping ” forces – and secondly , that Georgia ’s western allies were not ready to be involved to a military conflict .
There are many reasons why Russia wanted to have that conflict .
Not in any particular order :
Saakashvili and his Western orientation
Russia still has its imperial ambitions , not realizing that time of empires ended on 19th century .
Any country that Russia has ever owned , should either be a part of Russia or under Russian “ sphere of influence ” .
Will of the people living in that area be damned , now you will be governed from Moscow .
But Georgians chose Saakasvili and his Western views – freely , there was no massive CIA - financed campaign or whatever other bullshit Russian publications have spewed out .
And Georgia was doing massive steps forward , both economically and away from Russia .
And this was something that was displeasing Kremlin to no end – an example that a country in Caucasus can exist just fine without Russian support or influence .
How can that be ?!
Russia has broken its teeth on Caucasus for close to 300 years , sometimes being able to occupy the countries using age - old divide - and - conquer tactics , only to be pushed out soon again .
Thankfully it seems Russia failed to install new president and a puppet government ( a la Chechnya ) to Georgia .
However , to some extent they ’ve destroyed the economy of Georgia , by destroying ports , bridges and railroads .
Oil and gas : Russian economy depends on it
While the income and life standards in bigger cities has become considerably higher , most of Russia lives actually worse then a decade ago .
That is because there is no real economy ; Russia ’s economy is solely based on exporting crude oil and gas .
Corruption is running rampant – it is actually worse then before Putin came to power .
Ant the benefits of attacking Georgia would be two - fold in this perspective – firstly , oil prices have been dropping , something very clearly not in interest of Russia – and secondly , Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline .
Creating destabilization and fear in the area would rise the crude oil price and force Europe to buy oil from Russia .
In that , Russia had some initial success – prices of oil stopped getting lower and even rose a bit .
But after BT confirmed that pipeline was still functional , oil price continued to ease .
Also , economists and analysts know Russia needs to sell the oil .
If Europe does n’t buy Russian oil , then Russia needs to find a new buyer immediately , be it China , India or Japan .
Russia simply needs those oil dollars or it would collapse economically .
Internal affairs
Find an enemy and blame everything on them – Hitler blamed Jews , Stalin kulaks and so forth .
Another old way to consolidate people behind the leaders .
Russia has been cycling enemies every six months – USA , Estonia , UK , Latvia , Georgia , Poland , USA , Estonia , UK … I guess the cycling is needed because otherwise Russian commoners might look at the map and realize – “ hey , Latvia is tiny … how can they occupy and enslave us like Our Father Putin said … hmm , something does n’t make sense here ” .
Like it has always been known , there is nothing better to boost the moral and support to leaders then a short and victorious war .
And it worked – Russians have no access to free media or that information is discredited ( “ Known CIA propaganda sites BBC , CNN and Economist ” , “ Cold War era warhorses Conquest and Edward Lucas ” , … ) .
So they believe that Georgia is aggressor and Mother Russia is saving the day by taking “ peacekeepers ” against evil joint Georgia - CIA forces .
Popularity of Medvedev has risen in Russia – Putin ’s has n’t , as it was already at 110 % .
And no one pays attention to food prices – which have risen more then 20 % in six months and will continue to rise .
Conclusions : where shall we go from here ?
Georgia will probably have to say goodbye to South Ossetia .
It wo n’t be incorporated into Russian Federation – instead it will get UN / EU peacekeepers , and sort of dangle as a part of Georgia for decades .
Best solution – and one that would save the face of Russia quite a bit – would be to create a country of Ossetia .
Georgia will give up South Ossetia , Russia will give up North Ossetia – and everybody will be happy .
Sadly , that wo n’t happen .
Russia will never give up any part of its lands , no matter how low their explanations for occupying those areas get .
Also , that would stabilize Caucasus a lot – not in the interest of Russia at all – and create a dangerous precedent .
Huge chunks of Russian Federation would love to get away from it – and that is something Kremlin cannot allow .
Funnily , in online websites , comments by Russians often bring up the South Ossetian 2006 .
independence referendum – in which 99 % of voters supported independence .
However , they “ forget ” that ethnic Georgians in Ossetia were not given the right to vote .
And furthermore , they always get strangely quiet when asked when similar referendum will be held in Chechnya .
Of course , Chechnyan independence referendum would probably show 99.99 % wish to remain a part of Russia , no matter that Chechnens have struggled against Russian rule for centuries .
After all , Chechnya had similar support to Medvedev in presidential elections .
At least they got their math right , not like few Siberian areas that had more then 100 % support for pro-Putin parties in parliament elections …
Russians will be forced to pull our their troops from Georgia – and eventually from South Ossetia as well , when UN takes their peacekeepers there .
Economy of Georgia will recover pretty fast , thanks to foreign aid , South Ossetia will live on charity for a decade .
Georgia and Ukraine are on a fasttrack to full NATO membership , other Caucasus coutries will start to think about NATO as well .
Hopefully this whole incident has opened the eyes of Western countries – on what kind of country Russia has become .
Especially Germany , who has lately dropped pants and bent over whenever Russia has looked their way .
Oil prices will continue to drop and stabilize soon – thanks to end of Olympic games and strengthening dollar .
The trend will continue in the winter , as US has apparently always enjoyed a brief burst of economical growth after the presidential elections , when everybody are hopeful that things will change .
Oh , an interesting tidbit – the constitution of Russian Federation requires the permission of Russian Congress ( Duma ) to use armed forces outside of Russian borders .
This permission has not been given .
Does this mean Georgia is considered to be within Russian borders ?
Or small details like the constitution and such simply just do n’t bother Putin .
If we ’re lucky , next Olympic games wo n’t be held in Russia and Russia will be kicked out of G8 .
Russia will go into more and more international isolation – until they are forced to become a normal , democratic country , who is n’t a feared and hated bully in the region .
Instead they are trusted and honored economic and cultural partner .
Yes , yes , I know it wo n’t happen , but one can dream of a better future , cannot I ?
Confirming everything that ’s ever been said about Python
As mentioned earlier , I ’ve been working on a medium - scale project written in Python .
It ’s the first time I ’ve used python beyond a few lines in a script .
After a few weeks of working in Python I returned to an application I had been developing for the Mac in Objective - C over the weekend .
It was n’t until I made the switch back to a “ traditional ” static typing language that the sheer beauty of Python struck in full force .
It ’s really not fair to pick on Objective - C here .
A number of languages could sit in its place .
Nonetheless , after working with Python for only two weeks , coding in Objective - C felt like being stuck in the middle of a traffic jam where all the other cars are driven by lobotomized chimps .
Every one of my intentions had to be slowly and laboriously explained in great detail to the computer lest I cause a massive digital pile up .
To avoid , I was required to take several trips to Apple ’s mediocre documentation before I assembled enough square brackets to build the Eiffel Tower .
Even once the appropriate method was called , trying to break down the over - abstracted object return types to get the simple data I wanted resulted in so many code - compile - crash loops it hurt .
I wondered how much of my life I had already wasted prefixing all the class names with “ NS ” , or how many more times I would have to chase down some archaic memory error only to find that I had forgot to put a @ before my string .
Do n’t get me started on strings in Objective - C either .
I do n’t know how the language designers at Apple can respect themselves when it takes almost 50 characters to do a replace ( Actual Method Signature : stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString : ) , oh and you have to give up backwards compatibility with 10.4 if you want to use it .
This only showed me just how much I loved Python .
String slicing .
Unicode strings .
Dictionaries and Lists everywhere .
Generator Functions .
List comprehension and filters .
Easy to understand / parse syntax .
Lots of Third - party modules .
With simple APIs .
That are open - source .
And are actively maintained .
Mature .
And well documented .
I found myself writing far less code and accomplishing much more .
In fact , I distinctly remember feeling excited about just how much functionality I had accomplished in such little time ( Django is partly to blame for this ) .
I has used Ruby a reasonable amount before , but I did n’t fall head over heals largely because of the lack of maturity .
The maturity of the documentation of both the core library and third - party modules is one of the most important features of a language for me , and something I missed tremendously coming from a Java background .
In fact , I ’ve re-written the ruby script that powered my Pitchfork Reviews gadget to be Python .
It took me about 30 minutes .
I ’m in love .
MONTREAL , June 18 ( UPI ) --
An appeal will be filed in a Montreal court after a Quebec judge overruled a father who grounded his 12 - year - old daughter for dangerous Internet use .
The lawyer for the father , who can't be identified to protect the girl , told The Gazette newspaper that Justice Suzanne Tessier overstepped the court 's bounds last Friday when she ruled in favor of the girl 's legal challenge and said she would be allowed to go on a school trip her father had forbidden because of misbehavior .

" I do n't think this tribunal was the proper forum for a decision like this one , " lawyer Kim Beaudoin said .
" If we do n't learn at the age of 12 there are rules to follow , when do we ? "
He said he was preparing an appeal based on the fact the judge acknowledged the girl 's repeated defiance of her father 's house rules .
They included bypassing security settings to block Web sites the father did n't trust , then using a friend 's computer to access those sites .
Beaudoin said the girl also posted online photos of herself " inappropriate for a child her age , " the report said .
Using a thin beam of synchrotron X - rays generated by a particle accelerator , European scientists have reconstructed a portrait of a peasant woman painted by Vincent van Gogh that had been concealed beneath another painting for 121 years .
The image , unveiled in a scientific journal published today , bears a striking resemblance to a series of somber portraits the artist produced in the Dutch town of Nuenen , where he composed “ The Potato Eaters , ” completed in 1885 and regarded as his first major work .
Conventional X-rays had revealed the rough outlines of the portrait , which Van Gogh covered 2 1/ 2 years later with a vibrant landscape of a flowering meadow after he moved to Paris and was influenced by Impressionism .
But those X - rays were n’t good at distinguishing between the many layers of paint on the single canvas , and pigments made from heavy metals obscured colors derived from other elements .
“ We get a very partial , fragmentary , color - blind view , ” said Joris Dik , a materials scientist and art historian at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands .

So Dik and his colleagues took the painting , “ Patch of Grass , ” which was completed in 1887 , to a particle accelerator in Hamburg , Germany .
The intense X - ray beam excited the atoms on the canvas , causing them to emit X - rays of their own that were captured by a florescence detector .
It took two days to scan the roughly 7 - by - 7 - inch portion of the meadow that masked the portrait .
Since each element in the painting had its own X - ray signature , the scientists were able to identify the distribution of metals in the various layers of paint and construct a three - dimensional model of the work .
Then the team peeled off the layers one by one .
The top layer consisted of paints made with zinc , barium , sulfur and other elements .
Behind that they found a uniform distribution of lead , which was used as a primer to hide the portrait and prepare the canvas for a new painting .
Once that was removed , they combined the distributions of two more elements -- mercury and antimony -- to produce the outlines of the hidden portrait .
Then , with the help of computer software , the team embarked on an elaborate version of painting by numbers .

“ We colorized those two distributions according to the color that the pigment would have had , ” Dik said .
Chemical analysis revealed that the mercury was an ingredient of vermilion , the red pigment used to color the woman ’s lips , cheeks and forehead .
Antimony was a component of Naples yellow , which was mixed with zinc white paint to highlight certain areas of the woman ’s face , according to the report in the August issue of Analytical Chemistry .
Van Gogh often recycled his canvases .
Art experts estimate that one - third of his early paintings hide others , which may be ripe for new analysis .

For two years Gary McKinnon , an unemployed Scotsman armed with only some spliffs , a few beers , and a dial - up internet connection , went looking for beings of superior intelligence .
He could n't find them .
Instead , he found the US Military - Industrial Complex , an altogether different grade of brain .
And , after he'd found them , and fooled around inside their computer systems for a few years , he got sloppy .
And so , in turn , he was found in Crouch End , north London , by the US Justice Department , or rather its surrogates in the UK , the Home Office 's then National Hi-Tech Crime Unit .
In a scene reminiscent of so many extra-terrestrial fantasies of people like Mr McKinnon , one morning in November 2002 , they appeared at the foot of his bed – and abducted him .
Using their high - speed craft with its mysterious , revolving light on top , they carried him off to Holloway Road police station and probed him for his innermost secrets .
McKinnon ( " I 'm only a little nerd " ) was powerless to resist .
And when they returned him to his own world , he was a changed man .
No longer free to come and go without reporting every evening at a police station ; no longer allowed near a computer with an internet connection ; and no longer the anonymous obsessive , whiling away the days burrowing deep into the networks of the US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Defense Department .
He was now that most alien of creatures : the cause célèbre .
And , after the law lords ' decision on Wednesday to extradite him to the US to face trial , and possibly a lengthy jail sentence , he is that even rarer phenomenon : the transatlantic cause célèbre .
To civil liberty groups , McKinnon is a UFO believer whose enthusiasm got the better of his admittedly limited judgement , and whose chief crime was mere electronic trespass .
He is just a nut , to whom a superpower 's sledgehammer is now being unnecessarily – and vindictively – applied .
The Americans see things rather differently .
His actions were , said one US prosecutor , " the biggest military computer hack of all time " .
According to the Justice Department indictment , he , among other things , " broke into the computer network at the Earle Naval Weapons Station , stealing computer passwords , and shutting down the network in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks " ; and he caused " approximately $ 900,000 [ £ 450,000 ] in damages to computers " .
This month , McKinnon will head to the European Court of Human Rights for his last hope of avoiding the plane ride west .
The Americans will fight him all the way .
They want his ass .
And , after they 've finished with it , McKinnon might then be taking it into the US prison system .
You can see why he 's worried .

Some zircon crystals have been dated to 4.4bn years ago Tiny slivers of diamond forged on an infant Earth may contain the earliest traces of life , a study has shown .
Analysis of the crystals showed they contain a form of carbon often associated with plants and bacteria .
The rare gems were found inside zircon crystals , formed a few hundred million years after the Earth came into being .
Writing in the journal Nature , the researchers caution that their results are not definitive proof of early life but do " not exclude " the possibility .
" We 're all a little sceptical , " said Dr Martin Whitehouse of the Swedish Museum of Natural History and one of the authors of the paper .
If the carbon was derived from primitive organisms , it would push back the date for life appearing on Earth by around 500 million years , to beyond 4.25 billion years ago .
The Earth itself is just 4.6 billion years old .
" When you look at the carbon isotopes , they could be interpreted as biogenic because we know that biologic processes do generate light carbon isotopes .
But of course there are other processes that can do that , " Dr Whitehouse told BBC News .
" The most common way to form light carbon on the modern Earth is photosynthesis
Alexander Nemchin
Other possibilities include chemical reactions involving carbon oxides or even the material being delivered from space by meteorites .
However , some observers have raised the possibility that the diamonds may be contamination , introduced during polishing of the zircons .
" If you look at the photos that they present , you always see these diamonds sat in cracks and fissures and cavities , " Professor Minik Rosing of the University of Copenhagen told BBC News .
If they were original features , he said , you would expect at least some to be embedded within the structure of the crystals .
" There is always fear that they might actually not be primary . "
However , Dr Rosing explained , the possibility that the signatures were from early Life was " tantalising " .
Time capsules
The tiny zircon crystals - just 0.3 mm across - were found in the Jack Hills of Western Australia .
They are the tough remnants of ancient rocks that have long since disappeared .
" We do n't have the rocks .
These zircons are just little fragments of something that was broken up , weathered and redeposited as sediments , " explained Dr Whitehouse .
Radioactive dating has suggested that some of the crystals formed as far back as 4.4 billion years ago .
Scientists describe this phase in Earth history as the Hadean , and it has long been thought that it would be impossible for life to begin at this time because of the inhospitable conditions on the young planet .
But the Jack Hills zircons have begun to cast doubt on this theory .
Earlier work raised the intriguing possibility that the infant Earth would have been cooler and wetter than previously thought as the crystals show evidence of growing out of a low - temperature magma that had been in contact with water .
The new analysis of the diamond and graphite inclusions in the crystals could lend further weight to this theory .
" I think there is an interesting possibility here , " said Dr Whitehouse .
Deep understanding
The scientists analysed 22 graphite and diamond inclusions in 18 zircon crystals .
The results showed that the capsules had unusual levels of a light form , or isotope , of carbon , known as carbon 12 .
" The most common way to form light carbon on the modern Earth is photosynthesis , " explained Dr Alexander Nemchin of the Curtin University of Technology , Australia , and another author of the paper .
During this process organisms preferentially extract light carbon , leaving heavier forms in the atmosphere .
The Isua Belt may contain chemical traces of ancient life
Oldest evidence of photosynthesis Diamond record of ancient Earth " When they die , they preserve that signature , " he said .
The results of the team 's experiments show that the carbon inclusions have a range of isotopes , which suggested , they said , that the carbon reservoir was " heterogeneous " .
This would then have had to be buried deep inside the Earth to generate the extreme pressures required to turn it into diamond .
" If this stuff was life - which then would have presumably formed on the surface - you do then need a process to take it down to something like 150 km or 200 km , " said Dr Whitehouse .
On the modern Earth , crust is recycled at depth in so - called subduction zones , such as those found along the edge of the Pacific Ocean .
Here , cool , dense oceanic crust plunges under the buoyant and long - lived continental crust .
Previous work on the diamonds supports the notion that similar processes were occurring on the Hadean Earth .
But not all scientists agree ; instead they suggest that the early crust was relatively stable .
Either way , Dr Whitehouse does not believe that this rules out a biogenic origin for the carbon .
" All this tells you is that there could have been a process that put things down to 200 km , " he said .
" There may have been other things happening that we do n't know about . "
Open questions
However , the team readily admit that the conclusion is not definitive .
Currently , what is thought to be the oldest signature of life by some - dated at around 3.7bn years old - was discovered by Professor Rosing in an area of intensely deformed rocks in West Greenland known as the Isua Belt .
That to me is completely the opposite of a biological signature
Minik Rosing
Here , chemical traces again suggest the presence of photosynthetic life forms .
But crucially the signature is seen in a complete sequence of rocks rather than isolated crystals .
This gives geologists clues about the environment in which the rocks were laid down and whether or not they could feasibly have contained life .
" The problem with the Jack Hills is that we do n't have the rock , " admits Dr Whitehouse " The carbon isotopes alone are not a distinct biosignature . "
As a result they have suggested other possibilities for the origin of the carbon including inorganic chemical reactions , similar to those that take place in the catalytic converter of a car .
Professor Rosing believes that this is the most likely explanation .
He points to the range of carbon values that were found in the inclusions .
" That to me is completely the opposite of a biological signature , " he said .
" That 's the signature of some chemistry - a fractionation process or something . "
Photosynthesis , he explained , would produce constant values for the carbon isotope ratios .
Another possibility , the team suggests , is that the carbon came from so - called " chondritic " meteorites , which also have a similar chemical signature .
This theory is appealing as the Hadean is thought to have ended roughly 3.8 bn years ago with a period of intense bombardment believed by some to have initiated the emergence of life on Earth .
However , according to Professor Rosing , if the diamonds and zircons are extraterrestrial it undermines every other theory related to the zircons , including the possibility of a cooler , more habitable early Earth .
" If that is the case , then every other argument about these zircons falls apart , he said .
" Then we do n't know anything . "

What are these ?
Would n't it be something if U.S. intelligence services started screening buyers of Hannity 's books as possible domestic terrorists ?
" Conservative " talk show personalities Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Mark Levin , and Ann Coulter might be reconsidering their stance on the right of the government to snoop on individual citizens ' reading lists this week .
Hannity might be actually remorseful after revelations wrought Tuesday by Knoxville police and reporters .
Levin ?
Coulter ?
Nah .
In short , one of Hannity 's listeners went off the deep end and shot up a bunch of complete strangers who he thought were " liberals " , " leftists " or " them " .
On his bookshelf were books by Hannity , Bill O'Reilly , and Michael Savage .
The question is where the responsibility ends for a talk host who conditions his listeners for " three hours a day " to resent a subset of his fellow Americans for all that he feels is wrong .
Using Bernaysian psychology , Hannity and Limbaugh blame " them " for everything , while claiming to be your friend , guide , mentor , and savior , projecting limitless familial warmth as they spew hatred out of the other side of their mouth .
This is right out of Bernays ' signature text , a favorite of Hitler and the Nazis , the original Propaganda , published in 1928 and preceeded by Crystallizing Public Opinion in 1923 .
In these books , the " father of public relations " explains how to use a simultaneous good guy / bad guy approach to sway the gullible masses , borrowing greatly from his uncle Sigmund Freud 's then - revolutionary theories on human psychology .
Hannity and Limbaugh are practiced in the art of manipulation , instructing you who to fear and hate , but with no specifics .
Each day , they pick only certain news stories like bonbons , recounting the bad things liberal politicians do , but over and over , every hour , they extend the blame to ALL liberals - worthy of our worst contempt , even though we know nothing about these hundreds of millions of strangers .
These are the " them " Jim Adkisson went after , because he could n't get to the liberal leaders .
The unemployed , suicidal veteran is a self - described foot soldier in the struggle against " liberalism " .
Anyone with questions can hear about this struggle every day during the unprofessionally biased and possibly illegal broadcasts of Hannity , Limbaugh and the others .
The heart of the problem with Limbaugh and Hannity is their failure to adhere to basic journalistic standards .
No self - respecting news outlet would ever report that all Mexicans are bad because one Mexican committed a crime .
Or that all Jews are evil just because one Jew embezzled some money .
But this is what we accept on a daily basis from Hannity and Limbaugh , Levin , Coulter and so many others looking for a slice of the $ 400 million Conservative radio jackpot .
Does it happen on the left ?
Sure , I say so everytime I see it ( Randi , Malloy , etc . )
But no radio audience compares to the Hannity - Limbaugh one - two punch .
Responsible journalism considers arguments transparently and completely , in the face of dissent .
It 's fine to take issue with liberalism , but not while whitewashing important stories .
Senseless murder is why irresponsible , even immoral punditry has to be countered .
Too many in our society look the other way when Limbaugh and Hannity broad - brush ALL liberals , but this can pervade the minds of their listeners , who accept that all liberals need to be " not just debated , defeated " .
To all Conservatives : I wish you would insist on better reasoning from your pundits .
We are all fellow Americans and want the best for our kids .
We need fiscal responsibility , smaller government and a return to ethics .
Where do you see anything near to this in Hannity and Limbaugh 's agit - prop ?
What I see is fear and hate - mongering , selling ad time , getting rich and helping the defense and energy industries siphon taxpayer dough for themselves .
Worst of all , they are too cowardly to take calls that want to debate their logic openly .
Hannity , Limbaugh , Coulter and Levin do a lot of useless whining about liberals after 7 years of iron - fisted Neocon rule .
But Bush and Cheney 's economic performance is the number one reason for Republican flight today , yet Sean is blaming liberals .
Conservatism is supposed to be about hard work , merit and bootstraps , not all - day negativity , sniveling , sliming and swiftboating without substantive ammo .
You know who made America great this week ?
60 - year old Greg McKendry who died to save others he did n't even know .

Introduction
The goal of this tutorial is to explain the background and all necessary steps that are required to implement a simple linear algebra operator on the GPU : saxpy ( ) as known from the BLAS library .
For two vectors x and y of length N and a scalar value alpha , we want to compute a scaled vector - vector addition : y = y + alpha * x .
The saxpy ( ) operation requires almost no background in linear algebra , and serves well to illustrate all entry - level GPGPU concepts .
The techniques and implementation details introduced in this tutorial can easily be extended to more complex calculations on GPUs .
Prerequisites
This tutorial is not intended to explain every single detail from scratch .
It is written for programmers with a basic understanding of OpenGL , its state machine concept and the way OpenGL models the graphics pipeline .
It is recommended to go through the examples and excercises of the OpenGL Programming Guide ( Red Book ) .
PDF and HTML versions and sample programs are freely available on the internet .
Additionally , chapter 1 of the Orange Book ( " OpenGL Shading Language " ) , titled " A Review of OpenGL Basics " , provides an excellent summary .
NeHe 's OpenGL tutorials are also recommended .
This tutorial is based on OpenGL , simply because the target platform should not be limited to MS Windows .
Most concepts explained here however translate directly to DirectX .
For a good overview and pointers to reading material , please refer to the FAQ at the community site GPGPU.org .
The sections ' Where can I learn about OpenGL and Direct3D ? ' , ' How does the GPU pipeline work ? ' and ' In what ways is GPU programming similar to CPU programming ? ' are highly recommended .
Hardware requirements
You will need at least a NVIDIA GeForce FX or an ATI RADEON 9500 graphics card .
Older GPUs do not provide the features ( most importantly , single precision floating point data storage and computation ) which we require .
Software requirements
First of all , a C/ C++ compiler is required .
Visual Studio .NET 2003 and 2005 , Eclipse 3.x plus CDT / MinGW , the Intel C++ Compiler 9.x and GCC 3.4 + have been successfully tested .
Up - to - date drivers for the graphics card are essential .
At the time of writing , using an ATI card only works with Windows , whereas NVIDIA drivers support both Windows and Linux ( and in theory , also Solaris x86 and FreeBSD , though I never tested this myself ) .
The accompanying code uses two external libraries , GLUT and GLEW .
For Windows systems , GLUT is available here , on Linux , the packages freeglut and freeglut - devel ship with most distributions .
GLEW can be downloaded from SourceForge .
Header files and binaries must be installed in a location where the compiler can locate them , alternatively , the locations need to be added to the compiler 's include and library paths .
Shader support for GLSL is built into the driver , to use Cg , the Cg Toolkit is required .
Alternatives
For a similar example program done in DirectX , refer to Jens Krügers Implicit Water Surface demo ( there is also a version based on OpenGL available ) .
This is however well - commented example code and not a tutorial .
GPU metaprogramming languages abstract from the graphical context completely .
Both BrookGPU and Sh are recommended .
Note that Sh is continued as RapidMind these days .

Setting up OpenGL
GLUT
GLUT , the OpenGL Utility Toolkit , provides functions to handle window events , create simple menus etc .
Here , we just use it to set up a valid OpenGL context ( allowing us access to the graphics hardware through the GL API later on ) with as few code lines as possible .
Additionally , this approach is completely independent of the window system that is actually running on the computer ( MS - Windows or Xfree / Xorg on Linux / Unix and Mac ) .
// include the GLUT header file # include < GL / glut.h > // call this and pass the command line arguments from main ( ) void initGLUT ( int argc , char ** argv ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutCreateWindow ( " SAXPY TESTS " ) ; }
OpenGL extensions
Most of the features that are required to perform general floating - point computations on the GPU are not part of core OpenGL .
OpenGL Extensions however provide a mechanism to access features of the hardware through extensions to the OpenGL API .
They are typically not supported by every type of hardware and by every driver release because they are designed to expose new features of the hardware ( such as those we need ) to application programmers .
In a real application , carefully checking if the necessary extensions are supported and implementing a fallback to software otherwise is required .
In this tutorial , we skip this to prevent code obfuscation .
A list of ( almost all ) OpenGL extensions is available at the OpenGL Extension Registry .
The extensions actually required for this implementation will be presented when we need the functionality they provide in our code .
The small tool glewinfo that ships with GLEW , or any other OpenGL extension viewer , or even OpenGL itself ( an example can be found when following the link above ) can be used to check if the hardware and driver support a given extension .
Obtaining pointers to the functions the extensions define is an advanced issue , so in this example , we use GLEW as an extension loading library that wraps everything we need up nicely with a minimalistic interface :
void initGLEW ( void ) { // init GLEW , obtain function pointers int err = glewInit ( ) ; //
Warning :
This does not check if all extensions used // in a given implementation are actually supported .
// Function entry points created by glewInit ( ) will be // NULL in that case ! if ( GLEW_OK != err ) { printf ( ( char*) glewGetErrorString( err ) ) ; exit( ERROR_GLEW ) ; } }
Preparing OpenGL for offscreen rendering
In the GPU pipeline , the traditional end point of every rendering operation is the frame buffer , a special chunk of graphics memory from which the image that appears on the display is read .
Depending on the display settings , the most we can get is 32 bits of color depth , shared among the red , green , blue and alpha channels of your display :
Eight bits to represent the amount of " red " in a image ( same for green etc. : RGBA ) is all we can expect and in fact need on the display .
This already sums up to more than 16 million different colors .
Since we want to work with floating point values , 8 bits is clearly insufficient with respect to precision .
Another problem is that the data will always be clamped to the range of [ 0/255 ; 255/255 ] once it reaches the framebuffer .
How can we work around this ?
We could invent a cumbersome arithmetics that maps the sign - mantissa - exponent data format of an IEEE 32 - bit floating point value into the four 8 - bit channels .
But luckily , we do n't have to !
First , 32 - bit floating poit values on GPUs are provided through a set of OpenGL extensions ( see section 2 ) .
Second , an OpenGL extension called EXT_framebuffer_object allows us to use an offscreen buffer as the target for rendering operations such as our vector calculations , providing full precision and removing all the unwanted clamping issues .
The commonly used abbreviation is FBO , short for framebuffer object .
To use this extension and to turn off the traditional framebuffer and use an offscreen buffer ( surface ) for our calculations , a few lines of code suffice .
Note that binding FBO number 0 will restore the window - system specific framebuffer at any time .
This is useful for advanced applications but beyond the scope of this tutorial .
GLuint fb ; void initFBO ( void ) { // create FBO ( off - screen framebuffer ) glGenFramebuffersEXT ( 1 , &fb ) ; // bind offscreen buffer glBindFramebufferEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , fb ) ; }

GPGPU concept 1 : Arrays = textures
One - dimensional arrays are the native CPU data layout .
Higher - dimensional arrays are typically accessed ( at least once the compiler is done with it ) by offsetting coordinates in a large 1D array .
An example for this is the row - wise mapping of a two - dimensional array a [ i ] [ j ] of dimensions M and N into the one - dimensional array a [ i * M+j ] , assuming array indices start with zero ( as in C , C++ and Java but not in Fortran ) .
For GPUs , the native data layout is a two - dimensional array .
One - and three - dimensional arrays are also supported , but they either impose a performance penalty or cannot be used directly with the techniques we employ in this tutorial .
Arrays in GPU memory are called textures or texture samplers .
Texture dimensions are limited on GPUs , the maximum value in each dimension can be queried with a bit of code like this once a valid OpenGL context is available ( that is , once GLUT is initialized ) :
int maxtexsize ; glGetIntegerv( GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE , &maxtexsize ) ; printf ( " GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE , %d
" , maxtexsize ) ;
On today 's cards , the resulting value is 2048 or 4096 per dimension .
Be warned though that although a given card seems to support three - dimensional floating point textures of size 4096 * 4096*4096 , the available graphics memory is still a hard limit !
On the CPU , we usually talk about array indices , on the GPU , we will need texture coordinates to access values stored in the textures .
Texture coordinates need to address texel centers .
Traditionally , GPUs work on four - tupels of data simultaneously :
There are four color channels called red , green , blue and alpha ( RGBA ) .
We will explain later on how we can exploit this to speed up our implementation on certain hardware .
Creating arrays on the CPU
Let us recall the calculation we want to perform : y = y + alpha * x for a given vector length N.
We need two arrays containing floating point values and a single float value to do this :
float * dataY = ( float * ) malloc ( N*sizeof ( float ) ) ; float * dataX = ( float * ) malloc ( N*sizeof ( float ) ) ; float alpha ;
Although the actual computation will be performed on the GPU , we still need to allocate these arrays on the CPU and fill them with initial values .
Creating floating point textures on the GPU
This topic requires quite a lot of explanation , so let us first recall that on the CPU , we simply need two arrays with floating point values .
On the GPU , we use floating point textures to store the data .
The first important complication is that we have a variety of different so - called texture targets available .
Even if we skip the non-native targets and only restrict ourselves to two - dimensional textures , we are left with two choices .
GL_TEXTURE_2D is the traditional OpenGL two - dimensional texture target , referred to as texture2D throughout this tutorial .
ARB_texture_rectangle is an OpenGL extension that provides so - called texture rectangles , sometimes easier to use for programmers without a graphics background .
There are two conceptual differences between texture2Ds and texture rectangles , which we list here for reference .
We will work through some examples later on .
texture2D texture rectangle texture target GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB
texture coordinates Coordinates have to be normalized to the range [ 0,1 ] by [ 0,1 ] , independent of the dimension [ 0 , M ] by [ 0 ,N ] of the texture .
Coordinates are not normalized .
texture dimensions Dimensions are constrained to powers of two ( e.g. 1024 by 512 ) unless the driver supports the extension ARB_non_power_of_two or unless the driver exposes OpenGL 2.0 which alleviates this restriction .
Dimensions can be arbitrary by definition , e.g. 513 by 1025 .
The next important decision affects the texture format .
GPUs allow for the simultaneous processing of scalars , tupels , tripels or four - tupels of data .
In this tutorial , we focus on scalars and four - tupels exemplarily .
The easier case is to allocate a texture that stores a single floating point value per texel .
In OpenGL , GL_LUMINANCE is the texture format to be used for this .
To use all four channels , the texture format is GL_RGBA .
This means that we store four floating point values per texel , one in the red color channel , one in the green channel and so on .
For single precision floating point values , a LUMINANCE texture will consume 32 bits ( 4 bytes ) of memory per texel , and a RGBA texture requires 4*32=128 bits ( 16 bytes ) per texel .
Now it gets really tricky :
There are three extensions to OpenGL that expose true single precision floating point values as internal format for textures , NV_float_buffer , ATI_texture_float and ARB_texture_float .
Each extension defines a set of enumerants ( for example , GL_FLOAT_R32_NV ) and symbols ( for example , 0x8880 ) that can be used to define and allocate textures , as described later on .
The enumerants for the two texture formats we are interested in here are GL_FLOAT_R32_NV and GL_FLOAT_RGBA32_NV .
The first enumerant tells the GL that we want to store a single floating point value per texel , the latter stores a 4 - tupel of floating point values in each texel .
The two extensions ATI_texture_float and ARB_texture_float are identical from our point of view except that they define different enumerants for the same symbols .
It is a matter of preference which one to use , because they are supported on both GeForce 6 ( and better ) and ATI hardware .
The enumerants are GL_LUMINANCE_FLOAT32_ATI , GL_RGBA_FLOAT32_ATI and GL_LUMINANCE32F_ARB , GL_RGBA32F_ARB respectively .
The last problem we have to tackle is the question how to map a vector on the CPU into a texture on the GPU .
We choose the easiest mapping that comes to mind : A vector of length N is mapped into a texture of size sqrt ( N ) by sqrt( N ) for LUMINANCE formats ( this means we assume N is a power of two ) , and into a texture of size sqrt ( N/4 ) by sqrt ( N/4 ) for RGBA formats , again assuming N is chosen so that the mapping " fits " .
For instance , N=1024 ^2 yields a texture of size 512 by 512 .
We store the corresponding value in the variable texSize .
The following table summmarizes all the things we just discussed , sorted by the available GPU types : NVIDIA GeForce FX ( NV3x ) , GeForce 6 , 7 and 8 ( NV4x , G7x , G8 x ) and ATI .
NV3x NV4x , G7x , G8 x ( RECT ) NV4x , G7x , G8 x ( 2D ) ATI target texture rectangle texture rectangle texture2D texture2D and texture rectangle format LUMINANCE and RGBA ( and RG and RGB ) * internal
format NV_float_buffer NV_float_buffer ATI_texture_float
ARB_texture_float ATI_texture_float
ARB_texture_float
(*) Warning : these formats are supported as textures , but not all of them as render targets ( see below ) .
After this large theory section , it is time to go back to some code .
Luckily , allocating a texture is very easy once we know which texture target , texture format and internal format we want to use :
// create a new texture name GLuint texID ; glGenTextures ( 1 , & texID ) ; // bind the texture name to a texture target glBindTexture ( texture_target , texID ) ; // turn off filtering and set proper wrap mode // ( obligatory for float textures atm ) glTexParameteri( texture_target , GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER , GL_NEAREST ) ; glTexParameteri( texture_target , GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER , GL_NEAREST ) ; glTexParameteri( texture_target , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S , GL_CLAMP ) ; glTexParameteri( texture_target , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T , GL_CLAMP ) ; // set texenv to replace instead of the default modulate glTexEnvi( GL_TEXTURE_ENV , GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE , GL_REPLACE ) ; // and allocate graphics memory glTexImage2D ( texture_target , 0 , internal_format , texSize , texSize , 0 , texture_format , GL_FLOAT , 0 ) ;
Let us digest this last OpenGL call one parameter at a time :
We already know what texture_target should be .
The next parameter ( set to 0 ) tells the GL not to use any mipmap levels for this texture .
The internal format is clear , and so should be the texSize parameter .
The next parameter ( again set to 0 ) turns off borders for our texture because we do n't need them .
The texture format chooses the number of channels , as explained above .
The parameter GL_FLOAT should not be misinterpreted :
It has nothing to do with the precision of the values we want to store in the texture , it is only relevant on the CPU side because it tells the GL that the actual data which gets passed in later calls is floating point .
The last parameter ( set to 0 ) simply tells the GL that we do not want to specify any data for the texture right now .
This call therefore results in a properly allocated texture corresponding to the settings we decided upon before .
It might be a good analogy to think of this piece of code as the equivalent of an allocation by malloc ( ) ( or similar ) as described above .
One last remark : Choosing a proper data layout , that is , a mapping between texture formats , texture sizes and your CPU data , is a very problem - depending question .
Experience shows that for some cases , defining such a mapping is obvious and in other cases , this takes up most of your time .
Suboptimal mappings can seriously impact performance !
One - to - one mapping from array index to texture coordinates
Later on in this tutorial , we update our data stored in textures by a rendering operation .
To be able to control exactly which data elements we compute or access from texture memory , we will need to choose a special projection that maps from the 3D world ( world or model coordinate space ) to the 2D screen ( screen or display coordinate space ) , and additionally a 1:1 mapping between pixels ( which we want to render to ) and texels ( which we access data from ) .
The key to success here is to choose an orthogonal projection and a proper viewport that will enable a one to one mapping between geometry coordinates ( used in rendering ) and texture coordinates ( used for data input ) and pixel coordinates ( used for data output ) .
The mapping is based on the only value we have available so far , the size ( in each dimension ) we allocate textures with .
One warning though :
With texture2 Ds , some scaling for the texture coordinates as explained above is still required .
This is typically done in another part of the implementation and we explain it once we get there .
With the projection and viewport set here , this is however trivial .
To set up the mapping , we essentially set the z coordinate in world coordinates to zero and apply the 1:1 mapping :
The following lines can be added to the initFBO ( ) routine :
// viewport for 1:1 pixel=texel=geometry mapping glMatrixMode ( GL_PROJECTION ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; gluOrtho2D ( 0.0 , texSize , 0.0 , texSize ) ; glMatrixMode ( GL_MODELVIEW ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; glViewport ( 0 , 0 , texSize , texSize ) ;
Using textures as render targets
One key functionality to achieve good performance rates is the possibility to use textures not only for data input , but also for data output :
With the framebuffer_object extension , we can render directly to a texture .
The only drawback is : Textures are either read - only or write - only .
GPU hardware design provides an explanation : Internally , GPUs schedule rendering tasks into several pipelines working in parallel , independent of each other .
We will discuss this later on in more detail .
Allowing for simultaneous reads from and writes into the same texture would require an awful lot of logic to prevent reading from a previously modified position ( read - modify - write ) .
Even if that chip logic was available , there would be no way to implement this ( in hardware or software ) without seriously inhibiting performance : GPUs are not instruction - stream based von Neumann architectures , but data - stream based architectures .
In our implementation , we thus need three textures for the two data vectors :
One texture ( read - only ) is used for the vector x , another read - only texture for the input vector y and a third write - only texture that contains the result of the computation .
This approach basically means that we rewrite our original calculation y = y + alpha * x to this : y_new = y_old + alpha * x .
The framebuffer object extension provides a very narrow interface to render to a texture .
To use a texture as render target , we have to attach the texture to the FBO , assuming that the offscreen framebuffer is already bound :
glFramebufferTexture2DEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT , texture_target , texID , 0 ) ;
The first parameter is obligatory .
The second parameter defines the attachment point ( up to four different texture attachments are supported per FBO , this depends on the hardware and can be queried from GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS_EXT ) .
The third and fourth parameter should be clear ; they identify the actual texture to attach .
The last parameter selects the mipmap level of the texture , we do not use mipmapping so we simply set it to zero .
Note that in order to successfully attach a texture , it just has to be allocated and defined by means of glTexImage2D ( ) , it does not need to contain any useful data .
It is a good analogy to think of FBOs as structs of pointers , in order to redirect rendering operations to a texture attachment , all we ( conceptually ) need to do is some pointer manipulation by means of OpenGL calls .
Unfortunately , the framebuffer_object specification only defines texture attachments with the format GL_RGB or GL_RGBA ( the latter being important for us ) .
LUMINANCE attachments will hopefully be defined in a follow - up extension .
At the time of writing , NVIDIA hardware and the NVIDIA driver support them nontheless , but only in combination with the enumerants defined in NV_float_buffer .
In other words , the distinction between formats that are allowed as floating point textures and formats that are allowed as floating point render targets or more precise , floating point color attachments , is essential .
Color - renderable texture formats is the term used in the spec to make this distinction .
The following table summmarizes which texture formats and which texture targets are supported as render targets on various hardware platforms ( many more are supported , we are however only interested in floating point formats ! ) :
NV3x NV4x , G7x , G8x ATI texture 2D , ATI / ARB_texture_float , LUMINANCE no no no texture 2D , ATI / ARB_texture_float , RGB , RGBA no yes yes texture 2D , NV_float_buffer , LUMINANCE no no no texture 2D , NV_float_buffer , RGB , RGBA no no no texture RECT , ATI / ARB_texture_float , LUMINANCE no no no texture RECT , ATI / ARB_texture_float , RGB , RGBA no yes yes texture RECT , NV_float_buffer , LUMINANCE yes yes no texture RECT , NV_float_buffer , RGB , RGBA yes yes no
The bottom line of this table is that it is currently impossible to write portable code for all the listed GPUs .
If you want to use LUMINANCE textures , you have to use texture rectangles on NVIDIA only .
Portable code on ATI and newer NVIDIA hardware is already possible .
It is impossible to write code that works on old NV3x and ATI hardware at the same time .
The good news is that the changes to the code are more or less minimal , just a few switch - case statements or preprocessor ifdef 's are required to write truely portable code that works on all the listed architectures , at least if a given application allows to be laid out in RGBA .
I believe that the limitations implied by this table will be removed as soon as the ARB releases an extension that provides LUMINANCE attachments to FBOs .
This will turn the NV_float_buffer extension into a NV3 x legacy , and the ATI and ARB_texture_float enumerants will be usable on both ATI and newer NVIDIA hardware for LUMINANCE and RGBA texture formats .
Transferring data from CPU arrays to GPU textures
To transfer data ( like the two vectors dataX and dataY we created previously ) to a texture , we have to bind the texture to a texture target and schedule the data for transfer with an OpenGL call .
It is essential that the array passed to the function as a pointer parameter is properly dimensioned .
In the case of our vectors , LUMINANCE format implies the array must contain texSize by texSize elements , and for RGBA formats , we need an additional factor of four more elements .
Since we use GL_FLOAT , the data has to be a pointer to an array of floats as defined above .
Note that we have absolutely no control when the data will actually be transferred to graphics memory , this is entirely left to the driver .
We can however be sure that once the GL call returns , we can safely alter the data on the CPU side without affecting the texture .
Additionally we are guaranteed that the data will be available when we access the texture for the next time .
That being said , we can dive into the code .
On NVIDIA hardware , the following code is hardware - accelerated :
glBindTexture ( texture_target , texID ) ; glTexSubImage2D( texture_target,0,0,0,texSize , texSize , texture_format , GL_FLOAT , data ) ;
The three zeros we pass as parameters define the offset and the mipmap level .
We will ignore all of them because we do not use mipmaps and because we transfer a whole vector at once into a texture with the corresponding size .
On ATI hardware , the preferred technique is to transfer data to a texture that is already attached to a framebuffer object by just redirecting the OpenGL render target to the attachment and by issueing a conventional OpenGL framebuffer image manipulation call :
glDrawBuffer ( GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT ) ; glRasterPos2i( 0,0 ) ; glDrawPixels ( texSize, texSize , texture_format , GL_FLOAT , data ) ;
The first call redirects the output .
In the the second call , we use the origin as the reference position because we download the whole chunk of data into the texture with the last call .
In both cases , the CPU array is mapped row - wise to the texture .
More detailed : For RGBA formats , the first four array elements end up in the red to alpha components of the first texel and so on .
For LUMINANCE textures , the first two texels in a row contain the first two components of the data vector .
Transferring data from GPU textures to CPU arrays
The other way round , there are again two alternative ways to implement transfers from GPU textures to CPU arrays .
The traditional OpenGL texturing approach involves binding the texture to a texture target and calling glGetTexImage ( ) .
The parameters should be clear by now :
glBindTexture ( texture_target , texID ) ; glGetTexImage ( texture_target,0 , texture_format , GL_FLOAT , data ) ;
If the texture to be read back to the host is already attached to a FBO attachment point , we can again perform the pointer redirection technique :
glReadBuffer ( GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT ) ; glReadPixels ( 0,0, texSize , texSize , texture_format , GL_FLOAT , data ) ;
Since we read back the whole texture from GPU memory to CPU memory , we pass the origin as the first two parameters .
This technique is recommended .
One word of advice : Data transfers between main memory and GPU memory are expensive compared to computations on the GPU , so they should be used sparingly .
Refer to the section about issues in current driver implementations to avoid problems that I ran into .
A short example program
Now it is time to lean back a little .
I strongly suggest to start toying around before moving on to more advanced topics .
Write a little example program and try to define textures with varying formats , targets and internal formats .
Download data into them and read back the data again to a different CPU array to get acquainted with the techniques and implementation details .
Try to put the different pieces of the puzzle together into a running program !
The section about issues in current driver implementations and especially the sections about error checking in the appendix should be consulted to avoid problems .
For reference , this is the most minimalistic program I have come up with to achieve roundtrips , exemplarily using texture rectangles and ARB_texture_float on NVIDIA :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < GL/glew.h > # include < GL / glut.h > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { // declare texture size , the actual data will be a vector // of size texSize * texSize * 4 int texSize = 2 ; // create test data float * data = ( float * ) malloc( 4*texSize*texSize*sizeof ( float ) ) ; float * result = ( float * ) malloc( 4*texSize*texSize*sizeof ( float ) ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i< texSize* texSize * 4 ; i++) data [ i ] = i+1.0 ; // set up glut to get valid GL context and // get extension entry points glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutCreateWindow ( " TEST1 " ) ; glewInit ( ) ; // viewport transform for 1:1 pixel=texel=data mapping glMatrixMode ( GL_PROJECTION ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; gluOrtho2D( 0.0, texSize,0.0,texSize ) ; glMatrixMode ( GL_MODELVIEW ) ; glLoadIdentity ( ) ; glViewport ( 0,0, texSize , texSize ) ; // create FBO and bind it ( that is , use offscreen render target ) GLuint fb ; glGenFramebuffersEXT ( 1, &fb ) ; glBindFramebufferEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , fb ) ; // create texture GLuint tex ; glGenTextures ( 1 , &tex ) ; glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB,tex ) ; // set texture parameters glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB , GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER , GL_NEAREST ) ; glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB , GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER , GL_NEAREST ) ; glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S , GL_CLAMP ) ; glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB , GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T , GL_CLAMP ) ; // define texture with floating point format glTexImage2D ( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB,0 , GL_RGBA32F_ARB , texSize , texSize,0 , GL_RGBA , GL_FLOAT,0 ) ; // attach texture glFramebufferTexture2DEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT , GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB,tex,0 ) ; // transfer data to texture glTexSubImage2D ( GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB,0,0,0,texSize, texSize , GL_RGBA , GL_FLOAT , data ) ; // and read back glReadBuffer ( GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT ) ; glReadPixels ( 0 , 0 , texSize , texSize , GL_RGBA , GL_FLOAT , result ) ; // print out results printf ( " Data before roundtrip :

GPGPU concept 2 : Kernels = shaders
In this chapter , we discuss the fundamental difference in the computing model between GPUs and CPUs , and the impact on our way of thinking algorithmically and methodically .
Once we have a clear understanding of the data - parallel paradigm GPUs subject to , programming shaders is fairly easy .
Loop - oriented CPU implementation vs. kernel - oriented data - parallel implementation
Let us first recall the problem we want to solve : y = y + alpha * x .
On the CPU , we typically use a single loop over all array elements like this :
for ( int i=0 ; i< N ; i++) dataY [ i ] = dataY [ i ] + alpha * dataX [ i ] ;
Two levels of computation are active at the same time :
Outside the loop , the loop counter is incremented and compared with the length of our vectors , and inside the loop , we access the arrays at a fixed position which is determined by the loop counter and perform the actual computation we are interested in : a multiplication and an addition on each data element .
It is important to note that the calculations performed on each data element in the vectors are independent of each other , for a given output position , we access distinct input memory locations and there are no data dependencies between elements in the result vector .
If we had a vector processor that is capable of performing operations on whole vectors of length N or even N CPUs , we would not need the loop at all !
This paradigm is commonly called SIMD ( single instruction multiple data ) .
On a side note : partial loop unrolling is a common technique in high performance computing to allow the compiler to make better usage of the extensions available in today 's CPUs like SSE or SSE2 .
The core idea of GPU computing for the problem we want to tackle in this tutorial should now be clear :
We separate the outer loop from the inner calculations .
The calculations we do inside the loop are extracted into a computational kernel : y_new [ i ] = y_old [ i ] + alpha * x[ i ] .
Be aware that the kernel is no longer a vector expression but conceptually a scalar template of the underlying math that forms a single output value from a set of input values .
For a single output element , there are no data dependencies with other output elements , and all dependencies to input elements can be described relatively ..
In our example , the array index of a given output element is identical to the array indices of the input values , or more precisely , the input positions from all arrays are identical from the point of view of an output element .
Another , less trivial dependency arises from the standard 1D Finite Difference scheme : y[ i ] = - x [ i - 1 ] + 2 * x [ i ] - x [ i+1 ] .
Informally , the corresponding kernel would be : " Compute each value in the vector y by multiplying the the value of x by two at that position , and subtract the the value to the left and the value to the right " .
The programmable part of the GPU we want to use in our computations , the so - called fragment pipeline , consists of several parallel processing units , up to 24 in the GeForce 7800GTX .
The hardware and driver logic however that schedules each data item into the different pipelines is not programmable !
So from a conceptual point of view , all work on the data items is performed independently , without any influence among the various " fragments in flight through the pipeline " .
In the previous chapter we discussed that we use textures as render targets ( the end point of the pipeline ) and that we store our vectors in textures .
Thus , another useful analogy that is valid for our kind of computations is :
The fragment pipeline behaves like a vector processor of the size of our textures .
Although internally the computation is split up among the available fragment processors , we cannot control the order in which fragments are processed .
All we know however is the " address " , the coordinates ( pixel coordinates in screen space ) in the target texture where an individual data item will end up .
We can therefore assume all work is done in parallel without any data interdependence .
This paradigm is commonly referred to as data - parallel computing .
Now that we have extracted the computational kernel from our problem , we can discuss the way the programmable fragment pipeline is actually programmed .
Kernels translate to shaders on the GPU , so what we have to do is to write an actual shader and include it into our implementation .
In this tutorial , we discuss how to achieve this with the Cg shading language and the OpenGL shading language .
The following two subsections are therefore partly redundant , the idea is that you pick one and skip the others because advantages and disadvantages of each language and runtime are beyond the scope of this tutorial .
Creating a shader with the Cg shading language
To use shaders with Cg , we have to distinguish between the shading language and the Cg runtime which we use to prepare the shader .
There are two types of shaders available , corresponding to the two programmable stages of he graphics pipeline .
In this tutorial , we rely on the fixed function pipeline in the vertex stage and only program the fragment shader :
The fragment pipeline is much better suited for the kind of computations we pursue , using the vertex stage is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this tutorial .
Additionally , the fragment pipeline traditionally provides more computational horsepower .
Let us start with writing the shader code itself .
Recall that the kernel on the CPU contains some arithmetics , two lookups into the data arrays and a constant floating point value .
We already know that textures are the equivalent of arrays on GPUs , so we use texture lookups instead of array lookups .
In graphics terms , we sample the textures at given texture coordinates .
We will postpone the question of how correct texture coordinates are calculated automatically by the hardware until the next chapter .
To deal with the constant floating point value , we have two options :
We can inline the value into the shader source code and dynamically recompile the shader whenever it changes , or , more efficiently , we can pass the value as a uniform ( " uniform " as in " not changing over the whole render target " ) parameter .
The following bit of code contrasts a very elaborate version of the kernel and the shader source :
float saxpy ( float2 coords : TEXCOORD0 , uniform sampler2D textureY , uniform sampler2D textureX , uniform float alpha ) : COLOR { float result ; float yval=y_old [ i ] ; float y = tex2 D ( textureY , coords ) ; float xval=x [ i ] ; float x = tex2D ( textureX , coords ) ; y_new [ i] =yval +alpha*xval ; result = y + alpha * x ; return result ; }
Conceptually , a fragment shader like the one above is a tiny program that is executed for each fragment .
In our case , the program is called saxpy .
It receives several input parameters and returns a float .
The colon syntax is called semantics binding : Input and output parameters are identified with various state variables of the fragment .
We called this " address " in the previous section .
The output value of the shader has to be bound to the COLOR semantics , even though this is not too intuitive in our case since we do not use colors in the traditional sense .
Binding a tuple of floats ( float2 in Cg syntax ) to the TEXCOORD0 semantics will cause the runtime to assign the texture coordinates that were computed in a previous stage of the graphics pipeline to each fragment .
More on that later , for now , we can safely assume that we sample the textures at precisely the coordinates we want .
The way we declare the textures in the parameter list and the actual lookup / sampling function depends on the texture target we use :
texture2D texture rectangle sampler definition uniform sampler2D uniform samplerRECT texture lookup tex2 D ( name , coords ) texRECT ( name , coords )
To use four - channeled textures instead of luminance textures , we just replace the type of the variable that holds the result of a texture lookup ( and of course the return value ) with float4 .
Since GPUs are able to perform all calculations on four - tuples in parallel , the shader source for texture rectangles and RGBA textures reads :
float4 saxpy ( float2 coords : TEXCOORD0 , uniform samplerRECT textureY , uniform samplerRECT textureX , uniform float alpha ) : COLOR { float4 result ; float4 y = texRECT ( textureY , coords ) ; float4 x = texRECT ( textureX , coords ) ; result = y + alpha*x ; // equivalent : result.rgba=y.rgba+alpha*x.rgba // or : result.r=y.r+alpha*x.y ; result.g= ... return result ; }
We store the shader source in a char array or in a file to access it from our OpenGL program through the Cg runtime .
Setting up the Cg runtime
This subsection describes how to set up the Cg runtime in an OpenGL application .
First , we need to include the Cg headers ( it is sufficient to include < Cg/ cgGL.h > ) and add the Cg libraries to our compiler and linker options .
Then , we declare some variables :
// Cg vars CGcontext cgContext ; CGprofile fragmentProfile ; CGprogram fragmentProgram ; CGparameter yParam , xParam , alphaParam ; char * program_source = " float saxpy ( [....] return result ; } " ;
The CGcontext is the entry point for the Cg runtime , since we want to program the fragment pipeline , we need a fragment profile ( Cg is profile - based ) and a program container for the program we just wrote .
For the sake of simplicity , we also declare three handles to the parameters we use in the shader that are not bound to any semantics , and we use a global variable that contains the shader source we just wrote .
We encapsulate all the Cg runtime initialization in one function .
This is pretty straight forward , details are covered in the Cg manual which is available at the Cg Toolkit page .
void initCG ( void ) { // set up Cg cgContext = cgCreateContext ( ) ; fragment Profile = cgGLGetLatestProfile( CG_GL_FRAGMENT ) ; cgGLSetOptimalOptions ( fragmentProfile ) ; // create fragment program fragmentProgram = cgCreateProgram ( cgContext , CG_SOURCE , program_source , fragment Profile , " saxpy " , NULL ) ; // load program cgGLLoadProgram ( fragmentProgram ) ; // and get parameter handles by name yParam = cgGetNamedParameter ( fragmentProgram , " textureY " ) ; xParam = cgGetNamedParameter ( fragmentProgram , " textureX " ) ; alphaParam = cgGetNamedParameter ( fragmentProgram , " alpha " ) ; }
Setting up a shader for computation with the OpenGL shading language
It is not neccessary to include any additional header files or libraries to use the OpenGL Shading Language , it is built into the driver .
Three OpenGL extensions ( ARB_shader_objects , ARB_vertex_shader and ARB_fragment_shader ) define the API , and the specification defines the language itself .
Both API and language are now part of core OpenGL 2.x , and underwent some renamings .
We will use the core API names here , the older version is provided for download .
We define a series of global variables for the program , the shader and handles to the data variables we want to access in the shaders .
The first two are simply data containers managed by OpenGL , one program can consist of exactly one vertex and fragment shader , both subtypes can consist of several shader sources , a shader can in turn be part of several programs etc .
// GLSL vars GLuint glslProgram ; GLuint fragmentShader ; GLint yParam , xParam , alphaParam ;
Writing the actual shaders is similar to using the Cg shading language , so we just present two example shaders .
The two main differences are probably that all variables we assign explicitly through the runtime are declared globally , and that instead of parameter bindings to GL state variables , we use a set of reserved variable names that are bound implicitely to the current GL state .
Also note that GLSL reflects the extension mechanism of OpenGL , so we need to explicitly enable the GL extensions we need , in this case , GL_ARB_texture_rectangle to be able to use the reserved keywords for sampling texture rectangles .
// shader for luminance data // shader for RGBA data // and texture rectangles // and texture2D #extension GL_ARB_texture_rectangle : enable uniform sampler2DRect textureY ; uniform sampler2D textureY ; uniform sampler2DRect textureX ; uniform sampler2D textureX ; uniform float alpha ; uniform float alpha ; void main ( void ) { void main ( void ) { float y = texture2DRect ( vec4 y = texture2D ( textureY , textureY , gl_TexCoord [ 0].st ) .x ; gl_TexCoord [ 0].st ) ; float x = texture2DRect ( vec4 x = texture2D ( textureX , textureX gl_TexCoord [ 0].st ) .x ; gl_TexCoord [ 0].st ) ; gl_FragColor.x = gl_FragColor = y + alpha*x ; y + alpha*x ; } }
We can encapsule the initialization of the GLSL runtime again into a single function .
The GLSL API is designed to mimic the traditional compilation and linking process .
For details please refer to the Orange Book or take a look at the various GLSL tutorials available on the internet .
Lighthouse 3D 's GLSL tutorial is recommended .
void initGLSL ( void ) { // create program object glslProgram = glCreateProgram ( ) ; // create shader object ( fragment shader ) fragmentShader = glCreateShader ( GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_ARB ) ; // set source for shader const GLchar * source = textureParameters.shader_source ; glShaderSource( fragmentShader , 1 , & source , NULL ) ; // compile shader glCompileShader ( fragmentShader ) ; // check for errors printInfoLog( fragmentShader ) ; // attach shader to program glAttachShader ( glslProgram , fragmentShader ) ; // link into full program , use fixed function vertex pipeline glLinkProgram( glslProgram ) ; // check for errors printInfoLog( glslProgram ) ; //
Get location of the texture samplers for future use yParam = glGetUniformLocation ( glslProgram , " textureY " ) ; xParam = glGetUniformLocation ( glslProgram , " textureX " ) ; alphaParam = glGetUniformLocation ( glslProgram , " alpha " ) ; }

GPGPU concept 3 : Computing = drawing
In this chapter , we will discuss how everything we learned in the previous chapters of this tutorial is pieced together to perform the scaled vector - vector addition y_new = y_old + alpha * x .
In the accompanying implementation , this is encapsulated in the performComputation ( ) routine .
Four steps are required :
The kernel is activated , input and output arrays are assigned using the shader runtime ( Cg , GLSL or plain OpenGL ) , and finally , the computation is triggered by rendering a suitable geometry .
This last step is embarrassingly simple after all the foundations we laid in the previous chapters .
Preparing the computational kernel
To activate the kernel using the Cg runtime , the fragment profile we created previously is enabled and the shader we wrote and already loaded is bound .
Only one shader can be active at the same time .
More correctly , only one vertex and one fragment shader can be active at a given time , but we rely on the fixed function pipeline at the vertex stage in this tutorial , as mentioned before .
This requires just two lines of code :
// enable fragment profile cgGLEnableProfile ( fragmentProfile ) ; // bind saxpy program cgGLBindProgram ( fragmentProgram ) ;
Using the GLSL runtime , this is even easier :
If our program has been linked successfully , all we have to do is to install the program as part of the rendering pipeline :
glUseProgram( glslProgram ) ;
Setting input arrays / textures
Using the Cg runtime , linking and enabling the input arrays / textures y_old and x and the uniform value ( the right hand side of the equation , texture identifiers y_oldTexID and xTexID respectively ) is straight - forward use of the Cg runtime :
// enable texture y_old ( read- only ) cgGLSetTextureParameter ( yParam , y_oldTexID ) ; cgGLEnableTextureParameter( yParam ) ; // enable texture x ( read-only ) cgGLSetTextureParameter( xParam , xTexID ) ; cgGLEnableTextureParameter( xParam ) ; // enable scalar alpha cgSetParameter1 f ( alphaParam , alpha ) ;
In GLSL , we have to bind our textures to different texture units ( the Cg runtime does this automatically for us ) and pass these units to our uniform parameters :
// enable texture y_old ( read-only ) glActiveTexture ( GL_TEXTURE0 ) ; glBindTexture ( textureParameters.texTarget , yTexID[readTex ] ) ; glUniform1i( yParam,0 ) ; // texunit 0 // enable texture x ( read-only ) glActiveTexture ( GL_TEXTURE1 ) ; glBindTexture ( textureParameters.texTarget,xTexID ) ; glUniform1i( xParam , 1 ) ; // texunit 1 // enable scalar alpha glUniform1 f ( alphaParam , alpha ) ;
Setting output arrays / textures
Defining the output array ( the left side of the equation ) is essentially the same operation like the one we discussed to transfer data to a texture already attached to our FBO .
Simple pointer manipulation by means of GL calls is all we need .
In other words , we simply redirect the output :
If we did not do so yet , we attach the target texture to our FBO and use standard GL calls to use it as the render target :
// attach target texture to first attachment point glFramebufferTexture2DEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT , texture_target , y_newTexID , 0 ) ; // set the texture as render target glDrawBuffer ( GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT ) ;
Performing the computation
Let us briefly recall what we did so far .
We enabled a 1:1 mapping between the target pixels , the texture coordinates and the geometry we are about to draw .
We also prepared a fragment shader we want to execute for each fragment .
All that remains to be done is : Render a " suitable geometry " that ensures that our fragment shader is executed for each data element we stored in the target texture .
In other words , we make sure that each data item is transformed uniquely into a fragment .
Given our projection and viewport settings , this is embarrassingly easy :
All we need is a filled quad that covers the whole viewport !
We define the quad with standard OpenGL ( immediate mode ) rendering calls .
This means we directly specify the four corner vertices of the quad .
We also assign texture coordinates as vertex attributes to the four vertices .
The four vertices will be transformed to screen space by the fixed function vertex stage which we did not program .
The rasterizer , a fixed - function part of the graphics pipeline located between the vertex and fragment stage , will then perform a bilinear interpolation for each pixel that is covered by the quad , interpolating both the position ( in screen space ) of the pixels and the vertex attributes ( texture coordinates ) from the vertex data .
It generates a fragment for each pixel covered by the quad .
The interpolated values will be passed automatically to the fragment shader because we used the binding semantics when we wrote the shader .
In other words , rendering a simple quad serves as a data stream generator for the fragment program .
Because of the viewport and projection settings we implemented , the whole output array / texture ) is covered by the quad , and is thus transformed into a fragment automatically , including interpolated attributes such as texture coordinates .
Consequently , the fragment program execution is triggered for each output position in the array :
By rendering a simple textured quad , we achieve that the kernel is executed for each data item in the original vector / texture !
This is what we wanted to achieve throughout the whole tutorial .
Using texture rectangles ( texture coordinates are identical to pixel coordinates ) , we use a few code lines like this :
// make quad filled to hit every pixel / texel glPolygonMode ( GL_FRONT , GL_FILL ) ; // and render quad glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; glTexCoord2f ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glVertex2 f ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glTexCoord2 f( texSize , 0.0 ) ; glVertex2 f( texSize , 0.0 ) ; glTexCoord2 f( texSize , texSize ) ; glVertex2 f( texSize , texSize ) ; glTexCoord2 f ( 0.0 , texSize ) ; glVertex2 f ( 0.0 , texSize ) ; glEnd ( ) ;
Using texture2Ds ( and therefore normalized texture coordinates ) , this is equivalent to :
// make quad filled to hit every pixel / texel glPolygonMode ( GL_FRONT , GL_FILL ) ; // and render quad glBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; glTexCoord2f ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glVertex2 f ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) ; glTexCoord2 f ( 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; glVertex2 f( texSize , 0.0 ) ; glTexCoord2 f ( 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; glVertex2 f( texSize , texSize ) ; glTexCoord2f ( 0.0 , 1.0 ) ; glVertex2 f ( 0.0 , texSize ) ; glEnd ( ) ;
One remark for advanced programmers :
In our shaders , we only use one set of texture coordinates .
It is possible to define several sets of ( different ) texture coordinates per vertex , refer to the documentation of glMultiTexCoord ( ) for details .
Back to top
GPGPU concept 4 : Feedback
After the calculation is performed , the resulting values are stored in the target texture y_new .
Multiple rendering passes
In a proper application , the result is typically used as input for a subsequent computation .
On the GPU , this means we perform another rendering pass and bind different input and output textures , eventually a different kernel etc .
The most important ingredient for this kind of multipass rendering is the ping pong technique .
The ping pong technique
Ping pong is a technique to alternately use the output of a given rendering pass as input in the next one .
In our case , ( recall y_new = y_old + alpha * x ) , this means that we swap the role of the two textures y_new and y_old , since we do not need the values in y_old any more once the new values have been computed .
There are three possible ways to implement this kind of data reuse ( take a look at Simon Green 's FBO slides for additional material on this ) :
Use one FBO with one attachment per texture that is rendered to , and bind a different FBO in each rendering pass using glBindFramebufferEXT ( ) .
.
Use one FBO , reattach the render target texture in each pass using glFramebufferTexture2DEXT ( ) .
.
Use one FBO and multiple attachment points , switch using glDrawBuffer ( ) .
Since there are up to four attachment points available per FBO and since the last approach turns out to be fastest , we will explain how to ping pong between different attachments .
To do this , we first need a set of management variables :
// two textures identifiers referencing y_old and y_new GLuint yTexID [ 2 ] ; // ping pong management vars int writeTex = 0 ; int readTex = 1 ; GLenum attachmentpoints [ ]
= { GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT , GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT
} ;
During the computation , all we need to do now is to pass the correct value from these two tupels to the corresponding OpenGL calls , and to swap the two index variables after each pass :
// attach two textures to FBO glFramebufferTexture2DEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , attachmentpoints[writeTex ] , texture_Target , yTexID[ writeTex ] , 0 ) ; glFramebufferTexture2DEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT , attachmentpoints[readTex ] , texture_Target , yTexID[ readTex ] , 0 ) ; // enable fragment profile , bind program [...] // enable texture x ( read - only ) and uniform parameter [...] // iterate computation several times for ( int i=0 ; i<numIterations ; i++) { // set render destination glDrawBuffer ( attachmentpoints [ writeTex ] ) ; // enable texture y_old ( read- only ) cgGLSetTextureParameter( yParam , yTexID[readTex ] ) ; cgGLEnableTextureParameter( yParam ) ; // and render multitextured viewport - sized quad // swap role of the two textures ( read - only source becomes // write - only target and the other way round ) : swap ( ) ; }

Putting it all together
A brief overview of the accompanying source code
The accompagying example program uses all concepts explained in this tutorial to perform the following operations :
Create one floating point texture per vector .
Transfer initial data to these textures .
Create a shader using Cg or GLSL .
Iterate the computation several times to demonstrate the ping pong technique .
Transfer the results back to main memory .
Compare the results with a CPU reference solution .
Variable parts of the implementation
In the code , a series of structs are used to store the possible parameters to OpenGL calls such as the enumerants from the various floating point texture extensions , the texture format , the slightly different shaders they imply etc .
This is an example of such a struct for the luminance format , texture rectangles and the NV_float_buffer extension :
rect_nv_r_32.name = " TEXRECT - float_NV - R - 32 " ; rect_nv_r_32.texTarget = GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB
; rect_nv_r_32.texInternalFormat = GL_FLOAT_R32_NV ; rect_nv_r_32.texFormat = GL_LUMINANCE ; rect_nv_r_32.shader_source = " float saxpy ( " \ " in float2 coords : TEXCOORD0 , " \ " uniform samplerRECT textureY , " \ " uniform samplerRECT textureX , " \ " uniform float alpha ) : COLOR { " \ " float y = texRECT ( textureY , coords ) ; " \ " float x = texRECT ( textureX , coords ) ; " \ " return y+alpha*x ; } " ;
To extract a working version for a special case , just do a search and replace , or use the second command line parameter which is just a string literal like rect_nv_r_32 .
In the application , the global variable textureParameters points to the struct actually used .
Command line parameters
The program uses command line parameters for configuration .
If you run the program without any parameters , it will print out an explanation of the various parameters .
Be warned though that the parsing code for the command line is rather unstable ( writing proper parsing code is clearly beyond the scope of this tutorial and would blow up the code , which is why I refrained from it ) and will probably crash if calling conventions are ignored .
I strongly recomment to use the output level parameter to display the results of the computation for low problem sizes , especially if you do not trust the computed errors .
Please refer to the batch files included for examples .
The test mode
The program can be used to test , for a given GPU and driver combination , which internal formats and texture layouts can be used together with the framebuffer object extension .
There are batch files called run_test _*. bat that run the program with different command line parameters and generate a report file .
The linux Makefile provides a similar test target as well .
The benchmark mode
This mode is included just for fun .
It times a sequence of computations and prints out MFLOP /s rates for given problem sizes .
Like every benchmark , it should be taken with a grain of salt .
It especially does not measure the peak GPU performance , but instead something that is close to peak GPU bandwidth due to the low arithmetic intensity of this example code .
Refer to the command line parameters on how to enable it .

Appendices
Summary of differences between Windows and Linux , ATI and NVIDIA
On NVIDIA hardware , both the Windows and Linux drivers expose the same functionality with respect to this tutorial .
On ATI hardware , Linux is not very well supported at the time of writing ( Nov.2005 ) .
Take a good look at the table summarizing renderable texture formats on various hardware .
The source code as provided for download is set to work on NV4x and above .
ATI users should apply the following modification : Change the code of the transferToTexture ( ) function by commenting out the NVIDIA - specific and commenting in the ATI specific part as described here and in the code comments .
Also be aware of the issues and limitations listed in the next paragraph .
Cg 1.5 combined with the precompiled freeglut that ships with certain Linux distributions somehow breaks " true offscreen rendering " since a totally meaningless empty window pops up .
There are three workarounds : Live with it .
Use " real GLUT " instead of freeglut .
Use plain X as described in the OpenGL.org wiki ( just leave out the mapping of the created window to avoid it being displayed ) .
Issues and Limitations
Transferring data to a texture with glTexSubImage2D ( ) causes strange data swizzles ( RGBA becomes BGRA ) on ATI .
This is a confirmed bug in Catalyst 6.9 and earlier and will hopefully be fixed in the future .
Use glDrawPixels ( ) instead .

Catalyst 6.9 seems to bork for problem sizes greater than 512^2 .
Since I do no longer have access to ATI on Windows , I am inviting volunteers to examine this issue more profoundly .
ATI does not support sampling of texture rectangles in GLSL , the shader refuses to compile .
samplerRect or sampler2DRect are recognized as reserved keywords ( as defined in the ARB_texture_rextangle extension specification , but the driver does not support them .
Use Cg instead .

Texture download with glDrawPixels ( ) fails on ATI when texturing is enabled .

This is not a bug , but an issue that can be very hard to debug .
NVIDIA hardware refuses to render into the last column of a texture of maximum size .
This means although glGetIntegerv( GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE , &maxtexsize ) ; reports 4096 , you can only render into a texture up to 4095 by 4095 .
This is a known bug that will hopefully be fixed in the future .
Error checking in OpenGL
It is highly recommended to add calls to this useful function in your own codes very often while debugging .
void checkGLErrors ( const char * label ) { GLenum errCode ; const GLubyte * errStr ; if ( ( errCode = glGetError ( ) ) != GL_NO_ERROR ) { errStr = gluErrorString ( errCode ) ; printf ( " OpenGL ERROR : " ) ; printf ( ( char * ) errStr ) ; printf ( " ( Label : " ) ; printf ( label ) ; printf ( " )
. " ) ; } }
Error checking with FBOs
The EXT_framebuffer_object extension defines a neat debugging routine which I just list here for reference .
To decode the error messages , reading the section about framebuffer completeness in the specification is recommended .
bool checkFramebufferStatus ( ) { GLenum status ; status= ( GLenum) glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT( GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT ) ; switch ( status ) { case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE_EXT : return true ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_ATTACHMENT_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , incomplete attachment
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED_EXT : printf ( " Unsupported framebuffer format
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MISSING_ATTACHMENT_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , missing attachment
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DIMENSIONS_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , attached images must have same dimensions
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_FORMATS_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , attached images must have same format
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DRAW_BUFFER_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , missing draw buffer
" ) ; return false ; case GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_READ_BUFFER_EXT : printf ( " Framebuffer incomplete , missing read buffer
" ) ; return false ; } return false ; }
Error checking with Cg
Error checking with Cg is done slightly different .
A self - written error handler is passed to the Cg runtime as an error callback function .
// register the error callback once the context has been created cgSetErrorCallback( cgErrorCallback ) ; // callback function void cgErrorCallback ( void ) { CGerror lastError = cgGetError ( ) ; if( lastError ) { printf ( cgGetErrorString( lastError ) ) ; printf ( cgGetLastListing ( cgContext ) ) ; } }
Error checking with GLSL
To see the results of shader compilation and / or program linking , use these functions by passing the program or shader identifier to it :
/** * error checking for GLSL */ void printProgramInfoLog( GLuint obj ) { int infologLength = 0 ; int charsWritten = 0 ; char * infoLog ; glGetProgramiv ( obj , GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH , &infologLength ) ; if ( infologLength > 1 ) { infoLog = ( char *)malloc( infologLength ) ; glGetProgramInfoLog ( obj , infologLength , & charsWritten , infoLog ) ; printf ( infoLog ) ; printf ( "
" ) ; free ( infoLog ) ; } } void printShaderInfoLog( GLuint obj ) { int infologLength = 0 ; int charsWritten = 0 ; char * infoLog ; glGetShaderiv ( obj , GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH , &infologLength ) ; if ( infologLength > 1 ) { infoLog = ( char *)malloc( infologLength ) ; glGetShaderInfoLog ( obj , infologLength , & charsWritten , infoLog ) ; printf ( infoLog ) ; printf ( "
" ) ; free ( infoLog ) ; } }
You can use queries like this for most states , refer to the GLSL documentation and specification for more details .

How to cook bok choy in the microwave ( 3 minute recipe )
How to Make an Almost Perfect Ice Lens
Not being satisfied with the previous jig , I went off and designed / built a bunch of things .
I wanted to feed my lens machine with cylinders of ice .
A cylinder is already circular in two dimensions - a good start .
I took a tin can and soldered a piece of steel strapping to the open end .
I cut teeth into the strapping .
The strapping is n't hardened , but for ice it 's just fine .
This picture shows an ice cylinder " drilled " out with the modified can .
Beside the ice is a piece out of an old disk - drive that I used to hold the ice cylinder .
This picture shows the " machine . "
It works on the same principle as the " field jig . "
There is an arm which " rotates " about a pivot point .
On the arm is a rotary tool with a coarse bit .
The base assembly holding the ice in its frame can move up and down as well as rotate .
( The base assembly can also slide back and forth for experiments with plano - convex lenses . )
The ice lens can be removed along with the frame and then inverted to machine the other side .
The frame also provided a convenient way of holding the lens without melting it .
This is a close - up of the " business " portion of the machine
Did it work ?
A picture with smoke is better than any words . :-)
Note - this lens was n't as aggressive in it 's curvature - but the compensating factor was the optical quality .
Another view with the lens removed from its frame .
This picture and the next were taken with the same camera position .
The first picture ( to the left ) shows pine needles with some burned tinder fungus .
The second picture ( below ) was taken with the ice lens placed in front of the camera lens .
This shows the magnification of the ice lens .
Due to melting , I rushed this lens so the optical quality is not the best .
So why try to make an optically perfect ice lens ?
Stay tuned ....
Eureka - it was always staring me in the Face !
From my first day playing with ice lenses , the word " sphere " kept coming up .
If we think about a double convex lens , it is just a sphere with its middle removed .
Why not use the whole sphere for an ice lens ?
It certainly has a very aggressive curvature and as long as the ice is n't cloudy , the extra ice in the middle does n't do any harm .
I tried it .
Wow .
I started with a block of ice .
Using a small hand saw , I first carved a cylinder .
I then started to round out the top and bottom of the cylinder .
In about 20 minutes I had something that looked like a sphere .
A bit of hand polishing ...
Some more hand polishing .
The advantage of making a sphere is that " everyone " knows what a sphere looks like .
Imperfections are pretty obvious .
In a double convex lens , it 's far more difficult to identify flaws .
The technique for hand polishing is similar to packing a snowball , or making meatballs .
The constant " packing " and rotating motion of the hands tends to improve the geometry of the sphere .
This picture shows the very short focal point for this lens .
Did it work ?
The tinder lit so quickly that I had to be fast on the camera shutter !
If You Don't Read Any Other Text on this Page , Read this :
One very important feature of an ice sphere is that it contains an " infinite " number of lenses .
Why is this important ?
Let 's think about a normal double convex lens .
Once you are done , there is only one " optical axis . "
As soon as you tilt the lens in one direction or another , you are n't taking full advantage of the lens .
( For a variety of reasons . )
Now , here 's the beauty of an ice sphere : you can rotate the lens as much as you want .
If the sphere were perfect in shape , then any rotation would have no effect .
Given that these hand - made spheres are not perfect , we can rotate the sphere and look for the sharpest focus or dot .
It is surprising how what I thought was a pretty good sphere worked extremely well in certain orientations and poorly in others .
Given the ease of construction and the flexibility in use , I am quite convinced that an ice sphere is an excellent candidate - if not the best - for an ice lens .
My next question was to find out how small of an ice sphere will still work and how quickly I could make one .
I gave myself a 15 minute time limit and started with a " random " chunk of ice .
The picture on the left shows what I came up with .
Did it work ?
The proof is in the smoke in the next photo ( below ) .
It was quite a journey for me to make fire from ice .
I hope you have gained some insights from reading about my discoveries and hope you will share some of your thoughts or experiences .

Word of Tim Russert 's death at 58 shocked many Americans today , and behind the grief came nagging questions about heart attacks , like the one that struck the newsman , and anxiety about how they kill .
Russert 's death came in a week when the government reported U.S. life expectancy had risen to 78 years as heart disease and other leading causes of death decline .
About 1.2 million Americans suffer from heart attacks annually , and about 40 percent die from them .
Russert sadly fit the profile , in some ways , for those who typically suffer from heart disease — he was overweight and was under heavy stress at times due to his career .
He also reportedly suffered from diabetes and people with that disease are at higher risk for heart disease .
The typical heart attack victim is 65 , but they can occur at any age in men and women .
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States , and the most common heart disease here is a heart attack , according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta .
One American dies every minute from a heart attack .
Heart attacks occur when a clogged artery blocks blood flow to a part of the heart , starving it of oxygen and causing part of the muscle to die and beat irregularly .
Arteries do n't clog overnight .
Rather , plaque accumulates in them over years as a result , in part , of a diet high in cholesterol .
High cholesterol foods include all animal products , including meat and dairy .
Part two of the process happens when the plaque in arteries cracks or tears ( due to stress ) , and the body 's platelets rally to the location to repair it .
That can cause a clot that ironically finishes blocking the artery , causing the heart attack .
Stress is a big part of the heart disease equation , as it causes the heart rate to go up , much higher than most stressed - out people are aware of .
One study found that people who experience high amounts of stress at work are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes .
Stress also is related to numerous other diseases , such as psoriasis , eczema and some cancers .
It also lowers resistance to viruses .
Spousal discord also raises the risk of heart attacks and makes it harder to recovery from them .
The American Heart Association released new guidelines earlier this year for women on how to avoid heart disease .
Cardiac care has advanced significantly in the past 30 years .
While heart attacks still kill , the death rate is much lower today than it once was .
In fact , after decades as the leading killer of Americans under age 85 , heart disease in 2005 gave way to cancer in the top spot .
Billboards Claim Rev. King Was Republican Associated Press
Published : Saturday July 5 , 2008
Print This Email This TALLAHASSEE - A black Republican group has put up billboards in Florida and South Carolina saying the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican , a claim that black leaders say is ridiculous .
The National Black Republican Association has paid for billboards showing an image of the civil rights leader and the words " Martin Luther King Jr. was REPUBLICAN . "
Told about the billboards , the Rev. Joseph Lowery let out a soft chuckle that grew stronger as he began to think more about the idea .
" These guys never give up , do they ? " said Lowery , who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King .
" Lord have mercy . "
Seven billboards have gone up in six Florida counties , and another in Orangeburg , S.C. , said Frances Rice , the Republican group 's chairwoman .
Part of its mission is to highlight what she said is the Democratic Party 's racist past .
" I knew the King family well .
We were all Republicans , " said Rice , 64 .
" There was no way Dr. King would have wanted to be in the party of the Ku Klux Klan . "
Her assertion angered state Rep. Joe Gibbons , a Democrat who chairs the Florida Legislative Black Caucus .
" Nobody knew who was leading the Ku Klux Klan , they had sheets over their heads .
Was she at the cross burning meetings ? "
Gibbons said with a disgust that was just as strong when he talked about the billboards .
" To make a statement like that is ridiculous .
To make a claim without presenting proof is bogus . "
The King Center in Atlanta says there is no proof that King was ever a Republican .
Rice stands by her claim .
In Tampa , Clarissa Robinson sat in her car directly under the billboard on Busch Boulevard east of Interstate 275 and looked up at it .
" Why 'd they put that up there ? " said Robinson , 22 , who is black and a Democrat .
" So nobody will vote for Democrat Barack Obama .
They 're trying to make us vote for the other guy . "
At the nearby gas station , Devoney Karvonen , 30 , a white Republican , said she thought the billboard was offensive .
" I do n't know the reason they would put that up , " she said .
" I do n't think it 's right .
You 're obviously lying about something and you should n't be . "
Lowery , who knew King well , said there is no reason why anyone would think King was a Republican .
He said King most certainly voted for President Kennedy , and the only time he openly talked about politics was when he criticized Republican Barry Goldwater during the 1964 presidential campaign .
" That was not the Martin I know and I do n't think they can substantiate that by any shape , form or fashion .
It 's purely propaganda and poppycock , " Lowery said .
" Even if he was , he would have nothing to do with what the Republican Party stands for today .
Do they think Martin would support George W. Bush and the war in Iraq ? "
In " The Autobiography of Martin Luther King , Jr. , " which was published after his death from his written material and records , King called the Republican national convention that nominated Goldwater a " frenzied wedding ... of the KKK and the radical right . "
" The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism , reaction , and extremism , " King said in the book .

In the Golden Age of Hucksterism , an unsavory gent might try to sell you a bridge , or a large area of swampland , or perhaps a simple faux - Stradivarius violin .
The first step , though , would always be to gain your confidence – the " con " in " con man . "
They did this the old - fashioned way , gaining your trust and even becoming your friend through an elaborate set of lies set one on top of another like Roman architecture .
And when they departed , taking your money and your ability to trust your fellow man with them , you could take solace in knowing that this was your con , specially concocted for you and nobody else .
What do you get now ?
Form letters from deposed African royalty , handed out impartially like advertisements for prostitutes on the Vegas strip .
Dry , clinical warnings of fictional eBay disputes .
Mindless , soulless pop-up ads for " antivirus programs " that merely throw up more mindless , soulless ads .
The soul of yesteryear 's con man may have been shriveled and caustic with disdain for humanity , but at least he had one .
Can a computer cackle with glee as it fans its face with a stack of bills taken from your nest - egg account ?
Well , yes it can , but only if you build it especially for that purpose .
Most of today 's swindlers wo n't even take the time to do that .
And the stories !
It used to be that a con man would leave you with a tale to tell passers - by as you held out your hand for a few meager coins : the Spanish princess in need of a young man to do double duty as her rescuer and her husband ... the briefcase that held thousands of dollars when it was shown to you , but somehow contained only newspaper once it was yours ... the betting store , bustling with gamblers , all of whom turned out to be in on the scam .
The story itself might be worth maybe one - twentieth of the money you lost in your naive ignorance .
Today , of course , you 're lucky if you get a few run-on sentences about Nigerian royalty .
More likely , if you fall for a modern scam , the only tale you 'll have to tell is some boring sob story about trying to sell a laptop and getting paid with a cashier 's check .
How many sympathy drinks can you get out of , " Well , this website asked for my login and password , so I gave it to them " ?
There 's no epic sweep there , no sense of gravitas or adventure .
I call upon the grifters , schemers and flim - flam artists of this brave new age to step up their game !
Do n't just throw a form in my face – get to know me !
Befriend me , then let me in on the opportunity of a lifetime , something so juicy that I 'd run off to tell my friends if I were n't concerned that they 'd beat me to it .
Then finally , with flair and grace , rip my heart out , take my money and tip your hat to me as you depart .
Anyone can cheat me , but only you can truly con me .

Speakers in four different languages all use the same word order when making gestures to communicate ideas .
They put the subject first , followed by the object and then the verb , despite the order used in many spoken languages .
The mind apparently has a consistent way of ordering an event that defies the order in which subjects , verbs , and objects typically appear in languages , according to research at the University of Chicago .
" Not surprisingly , speakers of different languages describe events using the word orders prescribed by their language .
The surprise is that when the same speakers are asked to ' speak ' with their hands and not their mouths , they ignore these orders – they all use exactly the same order when they gesture , " said Susan Goldin - Meadow , the Bearsdley Rum Distinguished Service Professor in Psychology and lead author of the paper , " The Natural Order of Events : How Speakers of Different Languages Represent Events Nonverbally " published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
For the study , the team tested 40 speakers of four different languages : 10 English , 10 Mandarin Chinese , 10 Spanish and 10 Turkish speakers .
They showed them simple video sequences of activities and asked them to describe the action first in speech and a second time using only gestures .
They also gave another 40 speakers of the same languages transparencies to assemble after watching the video sequences .
Some of the videos portrayed real people and others animated toys that represented a variety of sentence types : a girl waves , a duck moves to a wheelbarrow , a woman twists a knob and a girl gives a flower to man .
When asked to describe the scenes in speech , the speakers used the word orders typical of their respective languages .
English , Spanish , and Chinese speakers first produced the subject , followed by the verb , and then the object ( woman twists knob ) .
Turkish speakers first produced the subject , followed by the object , and then the verb ( woman knob twists ) .
But when asked to describe the same scenes using only their hands , all of the adults , no matter what language they spoke , produced the same order –– subject , object , verb ( woman knob twists ) .
When asked to assemble the transparencies after watching the video sequences ( another nonverbal task , but one that is not communicative ) , people also tended to follow the subject , object , verb ordering found in the gestures produced without speech .
The grammars of modern languages developed over time and are the result of very distant cultural considerations that are difficult for linguists to study .
Newly emerging sign languages , however , offer intriguing corroborating evidence that the subject - object - verb ( SOV ) order is a fundamental one .
SOV is the order currently emerging in a language created spontaneously without any external influence .
Al - Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language arose within the last 70 years in an isolated community with a high incidence of profound prelingual deafness .
In the space of one generation , the language assumed grammatical structure , including the SOV order .
Moreover , when deaf children invent their own gesture systems , they use OV order .
Chinese and American deaf children , whose hearing losses prevent them from acquiring spoken language and whose hearing parents have not exposed them to sign language , use the OV order in the gesture sentences they create .
The research challenges the idea that the language we speak inevitably shapes the way we think when we are not speaking .
This study is the first to test the notion with respect to word order .
" Our data suggest that the ordering we use when representing events in a nonverbal format is not highly susceptible to language 's influence , " Goldin - Meadow and her co-authors write .
" Rather , there appears to be a natural order that humans use when asked to represent events nonverbally .
Indeed , the influence may well go in the other direction — the ordering seen in our nonverbal tasks may shape language in its emerging stages . "

Did you take out a conservative loan that you could actually afford ?
You ’re going to be paying for everyone who did n’t ; which means that you ’re also going to be paying for the crimes of the bankers who made the toxic waste loans available in the first place .
Renters , the same goes for you , too .

Via : San Francisco Chronicle :
Congress completed work Saturday on the government ’s most sweeping response yet to the nation ’s housing crisis , sending to President Bush a bill designed to help homeowners avoid foreclosure , spur home buying and prop up struggling mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The Senate , in a rare weekend session , overwhelmingly approved the measure , 72 - 13 , a reflection of the election - year jitters on Capitol Hill over the troubled economy .
Bush has said he will sign the bill , which the House approved 272-152 .
“ Today , Congress did more than send a bill to the president – we sent a message to American families that help is on the way , ” said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , who helped write the legislation .
The measure ’s critics attacked it as a bailout of speculators and irresponsible borrowers at potentially huge cost to taxpayers .
“ This bill is fraught with too much risk and too little protection to the taxpayer , ” said Sen. Christopher Bond , R - Mo. , contending it would allow lenders to “ dump their worst subprime mortgages ” on the Federal Housing Administration .

It is possible that scientists managed to create a pill that can help people suffering from obesity .
The pill frees dieters from different eating rules and in addition helps slow down the process of aging .
The research was published in the journal entitled Mechanisms of Ageing and Development .
It claims that the pill " locks in " the advantages of dieting and allows people to get back to normal eating having no fear of gaining extra weight .
The name of the pill is alpha-lipoic acid and scientists working at the Britain 's University of Liverpool claim that it not only helps obese people but may also have a positive effect of slowing down aging .
The lead researcher of the study , Malcolm Goyns , who is also the director of Immorgene Concepts , which is a scientific research company based in Stockton - on - Tees , stated that he was certain to follow the approach himself .
" Our discovery indicates that by following a calorie restriction diet for six months and then taking alpha-lipoic acid while eating normally , the same life extension effects will be experienced , " the Independent newspaper quoted Goyns as saying .
But the scientists warned that by simply adding the dietary supplement to the diet will not have any effect .
" It seems that alpha - lipoic acid fools the body into behaving as if it was still on whatever diet it was following before the supplement was added .
We found there was an anti-obesity effect as well , " said Goyns .
However , some scientists are still uncertain whether the finding could be used by humans , since the research was carried out on rats .
" It is an unusual and interesting finding and it needs repeating in further research .
That was as far as I was prepared to go , but Malcolm wanted to apply it to humans .
I said I did n't agree with his interpretation and we had to wait for further studies , " mentioned Brian Merry of the School of Biological Sciences at the British University .

Quentin Tarantino is lining up Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt for his forthcoming tribute to the Dirty Dozen films , Inglorious Bastards .
The film - maker has been shopping his script for the wartime tale , which he wants to screen in two sections , around Hollywood studios in the past few weeks , and has now set his sights on two of the world 's biggest stars to play two of the main characters .
Tarantino met Pitt yesterday in France , where the actor is residing with wife Angelina Jolie following the birth of the couple 's twins , to discuss the role of Lt Aldo Raine , aka Aldo The Apache , the hard - as - nails head honcho of the Bastards , a crack unit parachuted behind enemy lines with the aim of putting as many Nazis as possible under the ground .
According to Hollywood industry bible Variety , he will meet DiCaprio tomorrow to discuss the role of the film 's chief villain , the German colonel Landa , a horrible individual whose nickname is The Jewhunter .
Variety reports that several studios view the script for Bastards as " vintage Tarantino " , but the addition of a couple of A - list actors would surely help oil the cogs of any future deal .
The film - maker 's stock has dipped in Hollywood following the ill - fated venture that was Grindhouse , and he is funding his new film without help from Harvey Weinstein , formerly of Miramax , now of the Weinstein Company , for the first time .
Pitt played the small but memorable role of a stoner in the Tarantino - scripted , Tony Scott - directed True Romance , while DiCaprio would be making his first appearance for the film - maker .
The film will shoot this autumn in Germany and France .
* Illustration : Nate Van Dyke * Tonight 's subject at the History Book Club : the Vikings .
This is primo stuff for the men who gather once a month in Seattle to gab about some long - gone era or icon , from early Romans to Frederick the Great .
You really can't beat tales of merciless Scandinavian pirate forays and bloody ninth - century clashes .
To complement the evening 's topic , one clubber is bringing mead .
The dinner , of course , is meat cooked over fire .
" Damp will be the weather , yet hot the pyre in my backyard , " read the email invite , written by host Njall Mildew - Beard .
That 's Neal Stephenson , best - selling novelist , cult science fictionist , and literary channeler of the hacker mindset .
For Stephenson , whose books mash up past , present , and future — and whose hotly awaited new work imagines an entire planet , with 7,000 years of its own history — the HBC is a way to mix background reading and socializing .
" Neal was already doing the research , " says computer graphics pioneer Alvy Ray Smith , who used to host the club until he moved from a house to a less convenient downtown apartment .
" So why not read the books and talk about them , too ? "
With his shaved head and ( mildewless ) beard , Stephenson could cut something of an imposing figure .
But his demeanor is gentle , his comments droll and understated .
( " He's on the shy side , " Smith says .
" A strong ego , but nicely hidden . " )
The session moves out of his kitchen , and a half dozen HBCers — including a litigator , a commercial real estate agent , and a chef / barkeep / PR guy — pull up chairs around the dining room table to talk and compare notes .
Harald Bluetooth , Erik Bloodaxe , and Halfdan the Black are dispatched in a couple of hours .
But before the members split for the night , they detour to the basement to see Stephenson 's workshop , where he has an impressive assortment of metalworking tools to help him on his current DIY project : a scary - looking steel helmet to protect the shiny Stephenson noggin from accidental scalp removal while indulging in his recent passion , Western martial arts .
This is the polite term for going medieval with swords and daggers .
It 's a hobby the author picked up during research for the Baroque Cycle , his three - volume , 2,688 - page tribute to 18th - century science , philosophy , and swordplay .
( Stephenson owns 12 swords . )
He proudly demonstrates his welding setup — a bossing mallet to pound steel sheets and a 5 - foot - high metal - shaping device called an English wheel .
That particular tool once cost thousands of dollars but , thanks to Asian manufacturing , is now available at Harbor Freight hardware stores for less than $ 300 .
Unmentioned is the other work performed in Njall Mildew - Beard 's basement , the work involving intense eruptions of imagination that result in books the size of cinder blocks .
These have made Stephenson the most avidly followed science fiction writer of his generation .
His breakthrough 1992 novel , Snow Crash , has served as a blueprint for real computer scientists attempting the creation of virtual worlds .
His deep understanding of not only computers but the people who go nuts over them has made him a god among the geek set .
Salon called him the " poet laureate of hacker culture . "
Fanboys track his movements on blogs and try to top one another with praise on Amazon.com reviews .
But Stephenson 's sprawling , Pynchon - esque works transcend his cult status and are having an impact on the mainstream literary world .
His last four books have all hit the New York Times best - seller list .
Only a few months ago , another epic bubbled up from his basement .
Anathem , Stephenson 's ninth novel , is set for release on September 9 .
The Nealosphere , of course , is over the top with anticipation .
This time , Stephenson has given himself the broadest stage yet : a world of his own creation , including a new language .
Though he 's been consistently ambitious in his work , this latest effort marks a high point in his risk - taking , daring to blend the elements of a barn - burner space opera with heavy dollops of philosophical dialog .
It 's got elements of Dune , The Name of the Rose , and Michael Frayn 's quantum - physics talkathon , Copenhagen .
Befitting a novel written by a founding member of the History Book Club , its leitmotif is time — and its message could n't be more timely .
Oh , and Stephenson manages to do it all in only 960 pages .
Set on a planet called Arbre ( pronounced " arb " ) , Anathem documents a civilization split between two cultures : an indulgent Saecular general population ( hooked on casinos , shopping in megastores , trashing the environment — sound familiar ? ) and the super - educated cohort known as the avout , who live a monastic existence defined by intellectual activity and circumscribed rituals called " auts . "
Freed from the pressures of pedestrian life , the avout view time differently .
Their society — the " mathic " world — is clustered in walled - off areas known as concents built around giant clocks designed to last for centuries .
The avout are separated into four groups , distinguished by the amount of time they are isolated from the outside world and each other .
11 Unarians stay inside the wall for a year .
Decenarians can venture outside only once a decade .
Centenarians are locked in for a hundred years , and Millennarians — long - lifespanners who are endowed with Yoda - esque wisdom — emerge only in years ending in triple zeros .
Stephenson centers his narrative around a crisis that jars this system — a crisis that allows him to introduce action scenes worthy of Buck Rogers and even a bit of martial arts .
It 's a rather complicated setup ; fortunately , there 's a detailed timeline and 20 - page glossary to help the reader decode things .
Stephenson says the story was inspired by the real - life Millennium Clock , a project thought up by inventor Danny Hillis and developed by the Long Now Foundation .
The nub of the endeavor is the construction of a clock that has the mother of all warranties :
It 's built to last 10,000 years .
Hillis conceived it to mitigate the mega-rapidity of the digital world .
He was working on a massively parallel supercomputer , the Connection Machine , designed to scale to a million processors , and found himself obsessed with speed , slicing seconds into billions of pieces .
" I was going for faster , faster , faster .
But something in me was rejecting that , " Hillis explained to me back in 1999 , when he launched the project .
" It was n't clear that the world needed faster , faster , faster .
So I began thinking about the opposite .
Working on the fastest machine in the world got me thinking about the slowest . "
How slow ?
Hillis ' timepiece would tick once a year , its insides would bong once a century , and the cuckoo would appear once a millennium .
Building the clock , it turns out , has been an antidote to the toxic fixation on short - term thinking that permeates our culture .
Hillis and the friends who joined him — like fellow Long Now cofounders Stewart Brand ( who wrote a book about the project ) and Brian Eno ( who composed a CD of chimes inspired by the clock ) — found that its design and construction required recalibrating one 's own mental clock to envision what things would be like in the distant future .
Ideally , that mindset encourages behavior that tends to preserve the environment for clock customers in the year 12000 , instead of gobbling up resources and leaving behind trash that tends to mess things up for those folks .
Or so goes the thinking of the project 's goofily optimistic supporters .
Back at the launch , Brand marveled at the notion of looking so far beyond the temporal horizon .
" It 's the only 10,000 - year - forward thing I know of , " he said , " outside of science fiction , where it 's fairly common . "
Enter Neal Stephenson .
He first heard about the clock from Hillis and Brand at the annual Hackers Conference , and in 1999 the Long Now asked him and a few others to share some thoughts for its
Web site .
" In my little back - of - the - napkin sketch , I drew a picture showing a clock with concentric walls around it , " he says over lunch in downtown Seattle the day after the book club meeting .
" I proposed that you could have a system of gates where it was open for a while at a certain time of year , or decade , or whatever , when you could go in and out freely .
But if you were inside it when the gate closed , you'd be making a commitment to stay in until it opened again .
And I talked about clock monks who would tend the clock .
I put that idea in cold storage because I was working on the Baroque Cycle .
When I recovered , I decided , what the hell , I 'm just going to try writing this . "
Stephenson measures his novels not by word count but by visually assessing the printout .
" You 've got manuscripts that are relatively short , and then you 've got manuscripts that are taller than they are wide , and then you 've got ones that are taller than they are long . "
Anathem falls into category three .
" I was thinking shorter , but once you 've done all the work to build the project and get the reader into it , there 's the temptation to keep it going , " he says .
In a sense , the length of Anathem , as well as its challenges to the reader , are part of its theme .
Despite the monastic trappings of the clock - tenders , the avout are not driven by faith .
What binds them is a commitment to logic and rationality .
The robes and rituals , Stephenson says , are not religion but " their way of glorifying and expressing respect for ideas and thinkers that are important to them . "
Outside the walls ( " extramuros , " as the term goes — by the time you 're a couple of hundred pages in , this language thing begins to fall in place ) , people zip around in an ADD haze of fast - food joints , persistent gadgets ( instead of CrackBerry , they are addicted to handheld " jeejahs " ) , and evangelical religion .
Stephenson sees a parallel to the George W. Bush - era wars between science and religion , made possible because the general population is either indifferent or hostile to extended rational thought .
" I could never get that idea , the notion that society in general is becoming aliterate , out of my head , " he says .
" People who write books , people who work in universities , who work on big projects for a long time , are on a diverging course from the rest of society .
Slowly , the two cultures just get further and further apart . "
Hillis is thrilled about Stephenson 's choice of subject matter .
" One of the more interesting things about the project has been what anybody adds to it , " he says .
" Clearly , Neal 's imagination is extraordinary .
He creates a whole world in his mind ; he 's got every building imagined in more detail than it 's described in the book . "
Long
Now executive director Alexander Rose is also delighted but makes it clear that Stephenson 's ideas are n't exactly in sync with the foundation 's plans , which include construction of the clock inside a mountain in eastern Nevada , where it will draw power from temperature changes and visitors stopping by to wind it .
" We 're not planning on locking up people for thousands of years , " he says .
In every Neal Stephenson novel , there are characters who regard the world with an insatiable yet bemused curiosity ; they are fascinated with the way things work and are forever eager to lay on hands , tinker , tweak , and obsess .
In other words , they 're hackers .
In Anathem , the narrator , Erasmas , though not a techie , shares this trait .
So does the author .
Stephenson was born in 1959 in Fort Meade , Maryland , a son of academics ( his dad taught electrical engineering ; his mother was a biochemistry researcher ) .
He grew up in the college town of Ames , Iowa , a self - described theater geek who also had a streak of the hacker in him .
" I played the role of Mephistopheles in Christopher Marlowe 's Doctor Faustus and on the technical side made a full - size mechanical Kong hand that , at one point in the play , reaches through a window and drags somebody offstage , " he says .
He graduated from Boston University in 1981 and moved to Seattle with his wife , Ellen , who did her medical residency there .
His early books , a satire about big universities and an eco-thriller , were well received but not huge sellers .
22 In 1991 , Stephenson says , his career " was moving along at low rpms . "
Then he wrote Snow Crash , a book that postulated the Metaverse , an exquisitely fleshed - out vision of a digital alternative world , and Stephenson found himself at the front ranks of cyberpunk authors .
" I was sort of going for broke with Snow Crash , " he told me a few years back .
" I had tried to write stuff that was more conventional and that would be appealing to a large audience , and it did n't work .
I figured I would just go for broke , write something really weird , and not be so worried about whether it was a good career move or not . "
Other triumphs followed — The Diamond Age , a near - future chronicle set in Shanghai in which a young woman owns a nanotech book that puts the Kindle to shame ; Cryptonomicon , a multithreaded excursion into the wonders of cryptography ; and the ultimate steampunker , the Baroque Cycle , which rocketed the mathematical conflicts between Newton and Leibniz to best - sellerdom .
Stephenson spends his mornings cloistered in the basement , writing longhand in fountain pen and reworking the pages on a Mac version of the Emacs text editor .
This intensity cannot be sustained all day —
" It 's part of my personality that I have to mess with stuff , " he says — so after the writing sessions , he likes to get his hands on something real or hack stuff on the computer .
( He 's particularly adept at Mathematica , the equation - crunching software of choice for mathematicians and engineers . )
For six years , he was an adviser to Jeff Bezos ' space - flight startup , Blue Origin .
He left amicably in 2006 .
Last year , he went to work for another Northwest tech icon , Nathan Myhrvold , who heads Intellectual Ventures , an invention factory that churns out patents and prototypes of high - risk , high - reward ideas .
Stephenson and two partners spend most afternoons across Lake Washington in the IV lab , a low - slung building with an exotic array of tools and machines to make physical manifestations of the fancies that flow from the big thinkers on call there .
" In Neal 's books , he 's been fantastically good at creating scenarios and technologies that are purely imaginary , " Myhrvold says .
" But they 're much easier imagined than built .
So we spend a certain amount of our time imagining them but the rest of our time building them .
It 's also very cool but different to say , ' Let 's come up with new ways of doing brain surgery . ' "
That 's right — brain surgery is one of the things Stephenson is tinkering with .
He and his team are helping refine some mechanical aspects of a new tool , a helical needle for operating on brain tumors .
It 's the kind of cool job one of his characters might have .
Which indicates that Stephenson 's afternoon job , besides letting him get his hands dirty on weird machines , is maybe not so different from the activity he undertakes in his basement .
Myhrvold , while making sure his company is decidedly commercial , is still a sucker for big ideas from big brains .
He 's also a major funder of the Long Now and even has a prototype of the 10,000 - year clock in his home .
It makes sense that people like Stephenson and Myhrvold are drawn to the Long Now 's cosmically improbable but cerebrally galvanizing effort .
" It 's an insanely ambitious project ; it is a total folly , " Brand says of the clock effort .
" It presents itself as rational , but that 's like presenting the pyramids as rational .
You can argue with it , but if you put it out there as this gonzo , over - the - top - crazy but weirdly plausible , adventurous thing to do , then people want to be part of it .
About two out of 10 light up , and the other eight are going , ' Do n't you have something better to do with your time ? ' "
Hey , that sounds like the reaction to a Neal Stephenson novel .
This fall , Stephenson will reluctantly break from his cherished routines to promote Anathem .
" If I had to do a book tour every day it would kill me .
But four weeks every four years is n't too much to ask , " he says .
The tinkerer in him has stuffed some extra elements into the final package .
The book includes three appendices consisting of passages that did n't make it into the text — fascinating digressions involving puzzle - like conundrums ( sort of the hard - copy equivalent of the bonus deleted scenes on a DVD ) .
Another subsidiary project is a CD that re-creates the spooky a cappella hymns , based on mathematical proofs and behavior of cellular automata , sung by the clock - tenders inside the concents .
David Stutz , a former Microsoft techie now involved in early classical music — and an HBC member — composed and produced the effort , which is being considered for widespread release .
" It 's a pseudo - liturgical use of mathematics and higher thinking , " Stutz says .
Actually , to the untrained ear it sounds like the neo-Gregorian chanting that accompanies ritual baby sacrifice in horror films .
Anathem asks a lot of its readers , but Stephenson 's got a lot of devoted ones .
The hardcore ( Brand 's " two out of 10 " ) will just buy his books no questions asked .
It will be interesting to see what the rest will do .
" It 's really about the difference between people who can sit down and focus their attention for a long period of time on something complicated in a patient and steady way — versus people who never read anything longer than a sentence or paragraph and who get very impatient if you try to go on at any length , " Stephenson says .
The author himself concedes that 's he 's got one foot on either side of the Saecular / mathic divide .
He 's trapped in his own theme , our society 's secret war between the Long Now and the now .
" When I 'm working on a book , I need to be uninterrupted — a long - attention - span kind of thing .
On the other hand , there are a lot of things in my life that are important and keep me communicating over email .
It 's harder for me even to read books than it used to be , and there 's an obvious irony there . "
But after the Anathem tour ends this fall , he fully expects to be back in the basement , using a fine - nibbed fountain pen to fill up another cinder block of paper .

Gee , not very straight talking .
Also kind of nasty for someone who ’s always bristling at how mean the Democrats are to him .
What will Mrs. Greenspan say ?
More from Congressional Quarterly ’s fact checker :
What the ad pins on Obama — and others who are “ saying no to ( new offshore ) drilling in America ” — are the price increases the country is currently enduring .
That saddles the Illinois senator with a lot more influence than he has had .
If one were to line up all the leaders in Washington who share some responsibility for the offshore drilling moratorium — the first President Bush , the Republican leadership of Congress , the Democratic leadership of Congress , the Florida delegation — there would be quite a few people ahead of Obama .
We find McCain ’s claim to be False .
On June 25 , 1876 a distant relative of mine , Major General George A Custer , met his end leading 210 troopers into a disastrous aborted attack against a thousand or more Dakota ( Sioux ) , Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors .
Today Custer is remembered most often as the butt of jokes and cartoons .
However , a twist of fate related his family to my family .
To better understand our infamous kin my grandpa acquired a small collection of books by * and about Custer that I read as a kid .
It became clear the popular story of “ stupid idiot attacks huge Indian camp with tiny army ” was n’t accurate .
In 1876 Custer was one of America ’s best frontier soldiers .
Only 7 years before in a brilliant and nearly bloodless ( thus nearly forgotten ) campaign he had concluded an enormously successful posting in Kansas ending the Indian wars in that part of the plains .
Going into his final battle there is good evidence that Custer believe he would repeat that success .
And with good reason — he was an expert–he understood the tribes of the plains .
The facts as he knew them :
1 ) Villages were small — the plains tribes engaged in hunting for survival and trade **.
Small villages were more efficient .
2 ) Villages were highly mobile , but hard to defend .
When attacked villagers typically fled .
3 ) If villagers spotted an enemy scout they would flee first and ask questions later .
Thus reconnaissance / scouting was kept to a minimum .
As he approached the village he attacked according to this “ truth ” .
He divided his command into three groups .
One to attack from one side , one to attack from the other , the third to circle around and cut off fleeing villagers .
Custer did n’t live long to appreciate his mistake .
The “ village ” was actually a tribal gathering of about half a dozen villages who may have outnumbered his entire command two or three to one .
His small bands were easily pinned down to be destroyed at will .
The first attack was immediately beaten back .
The second band of attackers was completely annihilated .
The third group found no fleeing villagers and returned in time only to save the first group from annihilation .
Application
What happened on the Little Bighorn in 1876 is nothing unusual .
After a few years of success in any field it is natural to being to feel like an expert .
The inquisitiveness of the junior employee disappears in the confidence of accomplishment .
Experts understand the “ truth ” .
But when that “ truth ” changes experts are often caught totally off guard .
As a computer programmer I have to constantly guard against falling into my own “ Last Stands ” – technology changes , best methods change , problems change .
The only solution is to keep open , growing and flexible .
* Custer was an excellent writer
** By this time the tribes were very dependent on non-indigenous technology — guns , ammunition and durable metal arrowheads .

At Redtail Ridge Elementary School in Savage , colored circles in the carpet mark where kindergarten students will someday sit at classroom meetings .
In the computer lab , piles of blue electrical cable lie coiled , ready for computers and tables .
Construction workers spent this month finishing up with flooring and stairwells in the brand - new , $ 16.8 million school .
But as thousands of Minnesota students head to school , the already crowded Prior Lake - Savage district is n't getting ready to open Redtail Ridge .
They 're closing it .
When district voters rejected a property tax increase last fall that would have paid to hire teachers and open the school , the school board made good on a threat to mothball the building for at least a year .
School districts sometimes struggle to win voter approval to both build and run a school , but it 's rare for a new school to sit empty during its first year .
Now , Redtail Ridge stands as a reminder of the challenge faced by suburban districts that are trying to make room for more students even as a wallet - draining economy strains voters .
" I think having an empty building standing there is kind of a harsh reality , " said Lisa Provost , a Savage resident whose 9 - year - old son probably would have been at Redtail Ridge this fall .
" It 's like , ' Ouch !
How could this not be open ? ' "
Redtail Ridge was built to reduce class sizes in a district where about half of all elementary classrooms will be overcrowded this fall , according to Superintendent Sue Ann Gruver .
But last fall , more than 60 percent of voters rejected the district 's request for $ 4.5 million a year in operating funds and $ 28.9 million in bonds for an addition to Prior Lake High School .
" Last fall , we thought it was excessive , " said Prior Lake resident Dave Thompson , president of a local group called Citizens for Accountable Government .
Still , many residents did n't really believe the district would mothball Redtail Ridge , Provost said , even though the school board warned voters before the election that it would .
" The bond passed to build the school , but the levy did n't pass to run the school , and people do n't always understand that they 're two different things , " she said .
A juggling act In February 2005 , Prior Lake - Savage voters approved bonds to build three new schools , including Redtail Ridge .
The district saw growth coming and wanted to start building two of them right away , but it was n't sure exactly when it would need to open Redtail Ridge , said district spokeswoman Kristi Mussman .
The district did n't want to ask voters for money to run Redtail Ridge and risk having the cash sit unused in public coffers for years before the school was built , she said .
It also could n't ask for operating funds at that vote , anyway .
That 's because state law requires school districts to put levy referendums -- unlike bond referendums -- on regular November - election ballots .
So the district requested construction funding to secure land for the school and avoid " coming to the voters every six months , " said Pam Becker , an elementary school principal in the district who would have been principal at Redtail Ridge this year .
Later , it became clear that the area was growing fast enough to justify opening Redtail Ridge in 2008 , and the district found itself in need of operating funds for the new school last fall .
Minnesota school districts often stretch their budgets to avoid going to voters for the money to open a new school , said Charlie Kyte , executive director of the Minnesota Association of School Administrators .
Districts also can link ballot questions , asking for construction and operating dollars at the same time and telling voters that a school wo n't go up unless both measures pass .
" In most cases , school buildings are built and districts , one way or another , willy - nilly , find a way to get them open , even if it causes some additional pain in other parts of the district , " he said .
Request cut in half Even empty , Redtail Ridge will cost the district $ 150,000 this school year for costs such as utilities and a custodian to monitor the building .
It would cost $ 1.4 million a year to run the school , a price that includes hiring about 11 new teachers .
Bloom filters are highly space / time efficient probabilistic data structures that are used to solve the membership problem of a set , that is , given an element , it is used to find out whether the particular element belongs to the set or not .
False positives can occur in the results ( though we can really minimize its probability ) but false negatives are not allowed .
Ever wondered how the browser / text editor spell checkers work ?
They tend to take some bare minimum space and are very time efficient .
You guessed it right : Bloom Filters is the key !
I have designed a Spellchecker in C language using bloom filters and would like to explain how it works , thereby explaining bloom filters in general .
Now , the data structure of the spell checker is basically a m - bit array .
Moreover we have k hash functions which act on strings and return a number between 1 to m - 1 .
For inserting each word in the dictionary , we calculate its hash and set the corresponding bit it generated to be 1 .
So for each word , it is acted upon by k hash functions and correspondingly k bits are set to 1 .
Similarly , other words are also added in a similar fashion .
Now , for testing membership , we calculate the k hashes of the word to be tested and if either of the bit corresponding to the generated position is found to be zero , we reject it .
Clearly , false positives are possible ( the bit being set to 1 by some other string ) but false negatives can never be possible .
And now , the coolest part .
Let us mathematically play around with the probability of false positives :
Assume that a hash function selects each array position with equal probability .
The probability that a certain bit is not set to one by a certain hash function during the insertion of an element is then
.
The probability that it is not set by any of the hash functions is
.
If we have inserted n elements , the probability that a certain bit is still 0 is
;
the probability that it is 1 is therefore
.
Now test membership of an element that is not in the set .
Each of the k array positions computed by the hash functions is 1 with a probability as above .
The probability of all of them being 1 , which would cause the algorithm to erroneously claim that the element is in the set , is then
.
Obviously , the probability of false positives decreases as m ( the number of bits in the array ) increases , and increases as n ( the number of inserted elements ) increases .
For a given m and n , the value of k ( the number of hash functions ) that minimizes the probability is
,
which gives the false positive probability of
.
OK , there was quite a bit of catch in assuming that the “ hash function selects each array position with equal probability ” .
Theoretically this is not quite possible .
Randomness is not to random in the world of computer science , but it is nevertheless a good approximation ( or at least I would LIKE to believe that )
Implementation
Source code of the spell checker can be obtained here
The spell checker presently has 3 options :
1 . Add a new word :
This basically requires making the word go through k hash functions ( k = 1 1 in my implementation ) and the setting of corresponding bits in the bit array .
The standard hash functions I used are :
RSHash
JSHash
PJWHash
ELFHash
BKDRHash
SDBMHash
DJBHash
DEKHash
BPHash
FNVHash
APHash
These functions are a beauty in themselves , I will will also blog about them soon
2. Query a word :
Requires the word to be operated on by k hash functions are returned true if all the corresponding bits are set .
3. Recreate optimized bit array : Now , as shown above , the value of k that minimizes the probability of false positives
So , here we have k fixed and n depends on the number of words in the dictionary .
So , we can only edit m , i.e. the number of bits in the bit array .
Therefore , whenever we needs to recreate the optimized bit array , we simply re-calculate m based on this equation and re-hash the words .
Operation 1 and 2 are constant time operations while operation 3 is quite expensive and must be used once in a while .
Moreover , just an interesting fact is that a Bloom filter with 1 % error and an optimal value of k , on the other hand , requires only about 9.6 bits per element — regardless of the size of the elements !
This advantage comes partly from its compactness , inherited from arrays , and partly from its probabilistic nature .
If a 1 % false positive rate seems too high , each time we add about 4.8 bits per element we decrease it by ten times .

HAWKS in the American government are pushing President George W Bush to take a much tougher line towards Russia , putting Washington and Moscow on a collision course .
Hardliners are trying to wrest control of foreign policy from Condoleezza Rice , the US Secretary of State , who is widely blamed for failing to predict the Russian invasion of Georgia 10 days ago .
White House advisers say that events in the Caucasus have strengthened the hand of neo-conservatives , who have been steadily losing influence in Washington since the Iraq campaign .
The hawks are pushing for America to press NATO to bring Georgia and the Ukraine into the alliance by the end of the year to deter further Russian aggression .
Allies of Vice President Dick Cheney are also pressing Mr Bush to seek Russia 's expulsion from the G8 group of leading economies .
They were instrumental in pushing ahead with a missile defence deal with Poland on Thursday , which led to Russian threats that Poland was a target for Moscow 's nuclear arsenal .
" We 've got to get Georgia and the Ukrainians into NATO , '' said a former White House official who still advises the Bush administration .
" What we 've got now , promising them future entry but not yet , is the worst of all worlds .
It is a red rag to the Russians . ''
Charles Kupchan , the former director of European affairs on America 's National Security Council and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , said : " For the neo-cons , this is the gift on a silver platter because it justifies their view of the world and provides reason to return to a policy of militarised containment of Russia .
" There is a troubling sense that there is a longing to return to a world that is more black and white .
You would think we were in a new Cold War . ''
This week , Ms Rice travels to Brussels , where she will meet NATO and EU foreign ministers to rally support for Georgia .
Her reputation has taken a serious hit in Washington , where she first made her name as a Russia expert in the 1980s .
She is blamed for underestimating Russia 's strength and desire to make a power play in the Caucasus .
Conservatives claim that Miss Rice failed to make it clear to President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia when she visited there a month ago that America would not provide military assistance in his confrontation with Russia over South Ossetia .
" She took her eye off the ball , '' the former White House official said .
" Her entire career has been based on being nice to the Russians , and look where 's that 's got us . ''
Some officials in the State Department , stung by the criticism of their performance , believe Mr Bush 's rose - tinted view of Georgia , driven by his wish to promote the country as a model democracy , is to blame for convincing Mr Saakashvili he could act with impunity .
Prof Kupchan said : " The US was giving mixed signals to Saakashvili .
Through private channels it was saying , ' You have to behave ' , but publicly it was portraying him as a knight in shining armour .
There was an underestimation of the return of Russian power and an under - appreciation of how disgruntled Russia was becoming . ''
Ms Rice 's falling stock has potential significance beyond the Russia dispute .
Along with Robert Gates , the defence secretary , she has been a bulwark against hawks , who have urged a tougher line on a wide range of issues , including Iran 's nuclear programme .
Washington officials say that the Bush administration was caught unawares by events in Georgia , where usable intelligence for making political judgments was frequently thin on the ground .
Mr Bush rejected suggestions that he should return home early from the Olympics .
When he did come back he was " irritated ' ' to learn that the State Department and CIA 's assessment that Russia would not push into Georgia proper had proved inaccurate .
An official who advises the Pentagon said that the affair had exposed the folly of Mr Bush 's belief that he could trust Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
" There was little understanding of how serious this was , " the official said .
" He thought he could talk to Putin and sort it out .
That turned out to be wildly optimistic . "
Many , however , fear that Washington hawks will make the situation worse .
James Collins , the US ambassador to Moscow between 1997 and 2001 , said America should at least show that it understood Russia 's defence interests , even if it could not accommodate them .
He said that NATO 's attitude that Russia has " no veto ' ' on its activities " was perceived as , ' We do n't care what you think .
We 're doing it our way . '
That leads to confrontation . ''

Japanator ’s Dick McVengeance issued a challenge in the comments of his response to my fansub controversy .
He wanted to know if the American DVD sales of anime actually meant anything to the Japanese .
Was the American market really important to the global anime economy , or were we all just gravy to them , just the icing on the cake ?
It was a valid question , and one that I had been dealing with ever since I first said , “ buy a damn DVD ” all those years ago .
Why did we have to worry about supporting the “ industry ” in America when all we wanted was the product coming out of Japan ?
Well , being the industry fanboy that I am , of course my answer was going to be that we were n’t just gravy to the Japanese .
I believed that America anime market was actually a critical part of their business over there .
My Take on Gravy
While it might seem like a bit of narcissism from myself about my homelands , this theory is based on the story ADV tells whenever they are asked the question , “ Why did n’t you guys release the Evangelion movies ? ” ADV rep David Williams explains that studio Gainax was demanding a high price for the movies , a price ADV was not willing to pay .
So Gainax gave the rights to the movies to Manga Entertainment , a move that Williams claims Manga has yet to financially recover from .
Why would Gainax demand so much money from the American company if they did not see American market as being very profitable ?
What would give them the gall to say , “ No , we ’re going to have to ask for a little more from you guys , ” and risk losing the sale if America meant nothing to them ?
And now take a look at the current situation with ADV .
With their sales dramatically underperformed , we see Japanese companies actually revoking licenses for the American company even with series in mid-production or mid-release over here .
Clearly the American market and sales mean something to the Japanese , otherwise why would they proactively interfere with our business ?
I believe that we grossly underestimate our value in the global anime economy .
However , even though I believe we are important to the Japanese , I do also acknowledge that Japanese have taken a very hands - off approach to our market and do not even think about us when they are creating new shows .
My guess is that this was rooted back in the early days of anime , when the Japanese would just hand us the raw material for Astro Boy and Speed Racer , and we ’d Americanize it to the point of becoming a part of our mainstream pop culture .
Even in today ’s world , the Japanese would just hand over their raw material to an American company to handle everything after that .
What did it matter if Funimation tried to stay as “ pure ” to the original story with their English adaptions or 4 Kids “ butchers ” the show to sell more merchandise to the kids ?
For the Japanese , it all meant one thing in the long run – a big fat paycheck .
It did n’t matter how those American elves were able to create it , the magical American money will come in and continue to fund the Japanese industry .
But now that the American DVD sales are dwindling , the Japanese are finally taking action in our market .
I feel that we can see this within the past few months with the recent actions of Gonzo to combat fansubs and ADV ’s aforementioned drama with their licenses .
But a theory is just a theory , and sure enough , my reasoning is contested by every other armchair economist out there in the blogosphere .
So instead of just using my observations and logic to answer the gravy question , I used my press badge at Otakon to ask those with actual insight into the business .
And while their answers were not exactly those I were looking for , I did learn some things that were still important to my case .
My Investigation
Do American DVD sales mean nothing to the Japanese ?
“ That is absolutely not true , ” explains Robert Napton , marking director of Bandai Entertainment , “ The overseas sales is very important to the Japanese , and they do pay attention to it . ”
How much of the money goes back to Japan ?
Well , Mr. Napton was not really able to tell me , mostly because the deals really range from title to title .
But Lance Heiskell of Funimation was a little more dramatic at Otakon over this fact .
While I did n’t have enough time to ask the question to Lance directly , he did say that “ a majority of the DVD profits go right back to Japan ” during several panels through out the convention .
But one thing that did seem certain to me was that there is a set amount of royalties that go into every single DVD sale , so according to Mr. Napton , “ when you do n’t buy a DVD , that is lost revenue for the Japanese . ”
And that ’s something that the Japanese will pay attention to when it stops coming in .
Good , good stuff .
Our DVD sales actually mean something to the Japanese .
Now for the kicker :
Can the Japanese survive without the US market ?
“ Oh sure , ” he tells me without hesitation .
“ They still have their domestic market to fall back on .
The American revenue is not nearly as big as the Japanese . ”
You ’re not really helping me here , Rob… ( ^^ ; )
But of course , speaking to representatives from Bandai and listening to statements from Funimation was only giving me the perspective from the American side of the equation .
These people faced the same bias and attitude to the current fansub situation as I do .
So I spoke to someone with a different background but still very knowledgeable in this area – Ms. Chiyako Tasai of Kadokawa Pictures USA .
Ms. Tasai serves as somewhat of a liaison between Japan and America .
Her company “ licenses ” shows from Japan , but then teams up with a traditional American distributor to handle every other aspect of the overseas production .
This was the case with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky Star .
While Bandai served as the official distributor of these shows , you will still see the Kadokawa USA label on every disc .
She came to Otakon to give the American fans an exclusive look on such “ new ” shows out of Japan , such as H2O – Footprints in the Sand , Spice and Wolf , and Rental Magika .
While none of these titles have yet to be picked up by an American distributor , she wanted to give the fans a “ sneak peak ” at these shows to raise awareness and interest in them .
Unfortunately , she was slightly unaware of the current situation with fansubs in America .
At one point in the panel , she asks the audience in genuine disbelief , “ You know about this show already ?
How ? ”
So while it is her job to bring titles to the US , I feel that her views do n’t come with the same bias as all the others .
So according to Ms. Tasai , just how important is the American market to the Japanese ?
“ The American market is big , ” she informs me .
“ It is the second largest anime market in the world , second only to Japan . ”
This fact should n’t be that shocking , but think about it a little more .
While anime has been around for decades in the US and there has always been a small fan community surrounding it , the medium did n’t really “ take off ” over here until the Adult Swim Revolution eight years ago .
Other countries like Germany and France had established their otaku community many years prior to our big awakening .
And yet we have somehow come out as the top overseas market for the Japanese in a relatively short amount of time .
That ’s pretty impressive .
But even with America being the second largest market for the Japanese , can their anime business still survive without us ?
“ Yes , ” she predicts , again , much to my disappoint .
“ We ’d still be able to produce the big series like Haruhi Suzumiya with just the Japanese market alone .
But without that overseas revenue , we would have to cut out all the smaller shows .
Series like Spice and Wolf will just disappear . ”
And without even realizing it , Ms. Tasai brought to my attention the biggest Catch 22 we face as American otaku .
One of the biggest reasons why fans turn to the internet for their anime is to download the smaller shows like Spice and Wolf .
Their justification for doing so is that “ it will never come out in America . ”
But the reason why it wo n’t come out in America is because shows like that do not sell .
The rare instances that such a show does get license , like ADV ’s recent release of Air and Kanon , they bomb in America .
When I first told Gia about my love of moé shows and how I write about its fandom , she told me , “ well , moé does n’t sell in America . ”
And she ’s right .
As much as the internet community loves smaller niche titles and downloads them , they rarely buy the DVD when the time comes .
And as a result , when the American anime DVD market collapses , these niche shows will be the first to disappear in Japan .
My Conclusion
So like I said , these answers were n’t exactly those I were looking for , but I do believe that I had found a very interesting insight into the importance of America in the global anime scene .
Are we just gravy to the Japanese ?
Yes .
Yes we are .
However , a good piece of the anime industry is only gravy as well .
There is the “ meat and potatoes ” of the core business that is mostly funded domestically .
These are the mainstream titles that pay the bills and keeps the industry going .
And then there is the gravy , the fun “ extras ” that is funded by the additional revenue they receive from overseas .
These niche shows might not bring in the big bucks , but they sure make a small part of the vast otaku fandom really happy .
Our money might not mean everything to the Japanese , but it does mean something .
Because a part of every American sale will eventual go back across the Pacific , it is up to us , the second largest anime market in the world , to determine just how much gravy we ’d like in our meal .
And I sure as hell do n’t want to eat my turkey dry . 😉

Kerstin Fritzl , the 19 - year - old whose illness in April alerted the Austrian authorities to a major incest scandal , will make a full recovery , doctors say .
They say the woman , who spent her life as a captive in a cellar , has taken her first steps since waking from a coma .
Ms Fritzl , who was admitted to hospital suffering from major organ failure , has also been reunited with her siblings .
She is the eldest of seven children fathered by Josef Fritzl with his daughter , Elisabeth .
Steady progress
Though her mother visited her regularly , Kerstin finally met other family members on Sunday .
" The family is now very happy to all be together for the first time , " family lawyer Christoph Herbst told a press conference .
Elisabeth and the six surviving children have moved into a house on hospital premises to enable them to live as normal a life as possible while still under hospital care .
" The reunion of Kerstin with her family a few days ago was a moving moment , " hospital director Berthold Kepplinger told a press conference .
Police say Fritzl has admitted imprisoning and raping his daughter
Her medical recovery was a " great relief " , he said , adding that he expected her to recover fully and " develop normally " .
Dr Albert Reiter , who treated Kerstin , said she said made steady progress since being woken from an artificially induced coma .
He said she first greeted him during a morning visit on 1 June .
" I said to Kerstin ' Hello Kerstin ' , and Kerstin tells me ' Hello ' , " he said .
Mr Kepplinger said she could read and write , and was good at communicating .
She told doctors that she would like to travel on a ship and listen to a Robbie Williams concert .
Elisabeth was held captive for 24 years and raped repeatedly by her father .
She and Kerstin and two other children lived in a cellar beneath his house .
Three other children lived with Mr Fritzl , while another died as an infant .
Mr Fritzl , 73 , remains in detention pending charges .

Everybody wants to make a good impression for important guests , but it ’s almost like an episode of “ Extreme Makeover ” here these days .
With a price tag of $ 43 billion , the Summer Games that will open Aug. 8 in Beijing are the most expensive in Olympic history .
The transformation , however , goes far beyond the eye - popping architecture .
The Chinese government also has been trying to create a new , improved population to go along with its spiffed - up capital city .
Migrant workers , beggars and many masseuses and fortune tellers have been sent packing for the Olympic season along with others deemed undesirable by the government .
Since May , restaurants have been required to have no -smoking sections , and this month Beijing ’s food safety administration ordered restaurants to remove dog meat from their menus lest it offend Western sensibilities .

DVD shops have pulled their stocks of pirated Hollywood films .
Western - style toilets have replaced squat models in many locations .
And a group calling itself the Capital Committee to Promote Culture and Ideological Progress recently distributed 50,000 packages of tissues along with a warning that those caught spitting in public were subject to a $ 7 fine .
Almost all Olympics have been a springboard for host cities to reinvent themselves .
Barcelona , Spain , redeveloped its waterfront for the 1992 Games .
Athens , site of the most recent Summer Games , built a new airport , highway and mass - transit system .
Like Beijing , Seoul used the 1988 Olympics as a coming - out party and took the same types of steps toward Westernizing .
But everything taking place in Beijing is , like China itself , outsized .
Beijing ordered up 40 million pots of flowers .
Some varieties were specially bred for the Olympics .
To improve air quality , officials created a forest twice the size of New York ’s Central Park next to the Olympic stadiums .
Factories hundreds of miles away have been closed .

“ This is an extreme , extreme version of what has happened at other Olympics , ” said David Wallechinsky , an Olympic historian .
Costs are running three times those of the 2004 Games in Athens , which , at $ 15 billion , were at the time reported to be the most expensive in Olympic history .
Beijing ’s futuristic new airport terminal designed by British architect Norman Foster cost about $ 3 billion and is said to be one of the largest buildings in the world .
“ It ’s not just the buildings , it is the emotional change in the city that is so profound , ” said Jeff Ruffolo , an Olympic veteran from Los Angeles who is serving as an advisor to the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee .
Since 2001 , when the Chinese capital won the rights to this year ’s Games , Beijingers have been honing their English skills .
Advertisement
At least according to the official website of the Olympic Games , 90,000 Beijing taxi drivers have gone through a special training program .
The city has cleaned up its English - language signage , removing some of the more notorious clunkers -- for example , those near the Olympic stadium that directed visitors to “ Racist Park , ” now properly referred to as the Ethnic Minorities Culture Park .
Etiquette training has been all the rage .
More than 17 million people participated in an online program that offered advice on such fine points as what color socks to wear with a business suit ( dark ones ) .
During a competition televised this month on state - owned CCTV , contestants had to demonstrate how to greet visitors of various nationalities as judges held up cards grading their performance .
“ May I kiss your hand ? ” the winning contestant asked someone playing a married Italian woman before kneeling to do so .
An American male was received with a hearty clasping of the hands and a “ Hey , man , what ’s up ? ”
Not all the measures are popular .
The Geneva - based Center for Housing Rights and Evictions estimates that 1.5 million people have been moved to make way for Olympics - related projects .

Critics see parallels to the 1980 Olympics , when anybody who could remotely be considered a dissident was banished from Moscow .
One Beijing family attracted much publicity in recent weeks by bedecking its house with Olympic and Chinese flags , along with portraits of leaders dating back to Mao Tse-tung , in a colorful protest against the government ’s plans to demolish the property .
The house was demolished anyway Friday .
But public protest has been relatively minimal , in part because of the Chinese government ’s intolerance of dissent , but also because of genuine pride in the Olympics .

“ We are patriotic .
We want China to make a good impression on visitors , ” said Yan Dajie , 42 , whose DVD shop now displays mainly boxed sets of opera and black - and - white classics on its shelves .
( Customers in search of “ Kung Fu Panda ” can get it from a carton hidden behind a sliding bookcase in the backroom . )
“ My husband does n’t spit on the street anymore .
I ’m careful to line up when I take the bus , ” Yan added cheerfully .
Beijing ’s People ’s University sent out students from its Sociology Department to observe people ’s public conduct and concluded that manners had greatly improved .
In a bid to quantify the changes , the university devised a “ civic index , ” which it reported had risen from 65 in 2005 to 72 as of December .
Sha Lianxiang , the sociology professor who led the study , said that China needed to clean up its act so the quality of life could catch up with the exploding economy .
The Olympics merely presented a convenient excuse .
Advertisement
“ The problem is that the market economy happened so suddenly that people got involved in this harsh competition , ” Sha said .
“ China did n’t have time like the Western countries to develop the civility that should go along with a developed economy . ”
Critics wonder whether Beijing is n’t just sweeping its social problems under the rug for the Olympic period to create an illusion of a modern , sanitized China when in fact little has changed .
Wallechinsky , the Olympic historian , recalls staying in Seoul to do some sightseeing after the 1988 Summer Olympics ended .
Advertisement
“ In just one extra day , there were beggars , there were street vendors -- all sorts of things we did n’t know existed during the Olympics , ” Wallechinsky said .
Jing Jun , a sociologist at Beijing ’s Tsinghua University , said that a meaningful change in Chinese society would require far more than refined manners .
“ A lot of people think that manners are a sign of civilization , ” Jing said .
“ But to have a truly harmonious society , that is much deeper and has to do with our political system .
We ca n’t just pretend to be polite and gentle . ”

Los Angeles Times
MOSCOW , July 7 ( Reuters ) - Russian power producers expect coal prices to follow the cost of gas sharply upward in the coming years , and are switching away from coal as much as possible , said the head of one of Russia ’s largest power firms .
Vladimir Khlebnikov , the head of OGK - 1 OGK1 .
MM , the country 's second - largest fossil fuel - run generator , said on Monday the problem had forced his firm to revamp its development plans , converting some coal - run turbines to gas - fired ones .
The reason for the soaring coal prices are twofold , he said .
A lack of transport infrastructure leaves consumers with little choice of supplier , and the available suppliers in each region have strong pricing power .
This has made it very difficult to agree a long - term supply contract for coal , Khlebnikov said .
“ We always try to have open and competitive negotiations ( with coal firms ) , and over the course of the past three years we have failed , ” he said on the sidelines of a news briefing .
The problem is also historically rooted in the Soviet Union , where power stations were linked to one specific coal field for their supplies .
“ Nobody was thinking about competition back then ...
Building coal - based power plants in this atmosphere is insane . ”
Another inheritance from the Soviet Union are Russia ’s state - capped prices for energy and fuel , and one major coal supplier argued that the power sector needed to get used to market - driven prices .
“ Nobody is crazy about oil prices right now but for some reason the power plants think their fuel prices should be governed by a different mechanism than supply - demand , as is the case for oil and gas , ” he said .
He acknowledged , however , that using coal might not make sense for some consumers in the current environment .
“ It ’s realistic that some of the utilities would prefer not to switch to coal . ”
In the sphere of coking coal , which is used by steel mills as opposed to the power sector , Russia ’s competition watchdog has already launched an investigation into price inflation .
“ The inquiry is of the most serious nature , and if violations of anti-trust laws are uncovered , the violators will face harsh sanctions and fines on their income , ” the Federal Antimonopoly Service said in a statement upon opening the investigation in May .
SHIFTING AWAY
Electricity officials say that the situation on the coal market is causing a sector - wide shift away from coal - based power production .
In 2006 , then - President Vladimir Putin approved sweeping changes to the energy sector ’s fuel balance , including a plan to make coal account for 37 percent of the fuel used at power plants by 2015 , up from 28 percent today .
But since the trend of rising prices has become clear , generating firms have protested the changes and are refusing to enact them .
“ Generation companies are cutting down their original programmes of commissioning of new coal - fired generation capacities , ” said Igor Kozhuhovsky , head of the economic policy department at former power monopoly UES , which founded most of Russia ’s generating firms .
Traditionally , coal - run turbines are up to twice as expensive as gas - fired ones , but the relative cheapness of coal made them a good investment in the long - run .
With the price of coal catching up to gas , however , this is not always the case any longer .
Kozhuhovsky was speaking at one of the last public events for UES , or Unified Energy System , before the Soviet - era monopoly was liquidated on July 1 as part of a sweeping reform of the sector .
Instead of putting on line 36.1 gigawatts of new coal - run capacity by 2015 , Kozhuhovsky said that power producers are installing 19.2 gigawatts , cutting the original plan nearly in half .
Moreover , by discouraging power producers from building coal - fired generators , coal companies are hurting future demand for their own product , he said .
“ The new forecast for the growth of coal prices bears witness to the decreasing competitiveness of coal in the long - term view . ”
In the short - term , however , they will be charging much more for the fuel , the cost of which will grow 25 percent in 2008 , the same as the price of natural gas , according to forecasts from the Industry and Energy Ministry .
newswire article commentary united states drug war | government | human & civil rights Montana Supreme Court justice warns Orwell 's 1984 has arrived author : Posted by Declan McCullagh August 5 , 2005 12:13 PM PDT
Believe it or not , it 's perfectly legal for police to rummage through your garbage for incriminating stuff on you -- even if they do n't have a warrant or court approval .
The Supreme Court of Montana ruled last month that police could conduct a warrantless " trash dive " into the trash cans in the alley behind the home of a man named Darrell Pelvit .
The cops discovered pseudoephedrine boxes -- a solvent with uses including the manufacture of methamphetamine -- and Pelvit eventually ended up in prison .
Pelvit 's attorney argued that his client had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his trash , but the court rejected the argument and said the trash was , well , meant to be thrown away .
What 's remarkable is the concurring opinion of Montana Supreme Court Justice James C. Nelson , who reluctantly went along with his colleagues but warned that George Orwell 's 1984 had arrived .
We reproduce his concurring opinion in full :
Justice James C. Nelson concurs .
I have signed our Opinion because we have correctly applied existing legal theory and constitutional jurisprudence to resolve this case on its facts .
I feel the pain of conflict , however .
I fear that , eventually , we are all going to become collateral damage in the war on drugs , or terrorism , or whatever war is in vogue at the moment .
I retain an abiding concern that our Declaration of Rights not be killed by friendly fire .
And , in this day and age , the courts are the last , if not only , bulwark to prevent that from happening .
In truth , though , we are a throw - away society .
My garbage can contains the remains of what I eat and drink .
It may contain discarded credit card receipts along with yesterday 's newspaper and junk mail .
It might hold some personal letters , bills , receipts , vouchers , medical records , photographs and stuff that is imprinted with the multitude of assigned numbers that allow me access to the global economy and vice versa .
My garbage can contains my DNA .
As our Opinion states , what we voluntarily throw away , what we discard -- i.e. , what we abandon -- is fair game for roving animals , scavengers , busybodies , crooks and for those seeking evidence of criminal enterprise .
Yet , as I expect with most people , when I take the day 's trash ( neatly packaged in opaque plastic bags ) to the garbage can each night , I give little consideration to what I am throwing away and less thought , still , to what might become of my refuse .
I do n't necessarily envision that someone or something is going to paw through it looking for a morsel of food , a discarded treasure , a stealable part of my identity or a piece of evidence .
But , I 've seen that happen enough times to understand -- though not graciously accept -- that there is nothing sacred in whatever privacy interest I think I have retained in my trash once it leaves my control -- the Fourth Amendment and Article II , Sections 10 and 11 , notwithstanding .
Like it or not , I live in a society that accepts virtual strip searches at airports ; surveillance cameras ; " discount " cards that record my buying habits ; bar codes ; " cookies " and spywear on my computer ; on - line access to satellite technology that can image my back yard ; and microchip radio frequency identification devices already implanted in the family dog and soon to be integrated into my groceries , my credit cards , my cash and my new underwear .
I know that the notes from the visit to my doctor 's office may be transcribed in some overseas country under an out - sourcing contract by a person who could n't care less about my privacy .
I know that there are all sorts of businesses that have records of what medications I take and why .
I know that information taken from my blood sample may wind up in databases and be put to uses that the boilerplate on the sheaf of papers I sign to get medical treatment does n't even begin to disclose .
I know that my insurance companies and employer know more about me than does my mother .
I know that many aspects of my life are available on the Internet .
Even a black box in my car -- or event data recorder as they are called -- is ready and willing to spill the beans on my driving habits , if I have an event -- and I really trusted that car , too .
And , I also know that my most unwelcome and paternalistic relative , Uncle Sam , is with me from womb to tomb .
Fueled by the paranoia of " ists " and " isms , " Sam has the capability of spying on everything and everybody -- and no doubt is .
But , as Sam says : " It 's for my own good . "
In short , I know that my personal information is recorded in databases , servers , hard drives and file cabinets all over the world .
I know that these portals to the most intimate details of my life are restricted only by the degree of sophistication and goodwill or malevolence of the person , institution , corporation or government that wants access to my data .
I also know that much of my life can be reconstructed from the contents of my garbage can .
I do n't like living in Orwell 's 1984 ; but I do .
And , absent the next extinction event or civil libertarians taking charge of the government ( the former being more likely than the latter ) , the best we can do is try to keep Sam and the sub -Sams on a short leash .
As our Opinion states , search and seizure jurisprudence is centered around privacy expectations and reasonableness considerations .
That is true even under the extended protections afforded by Montana 's Constitution , Article II , Sections 10 . and 11 .
We have ruled within those parameters .
And , as is often the case , we have had to draw a fine line in a gray area .
Justice Cotter and those who have signed the Opinion worked hard at defining that line ; and I am satisfied we 've drawn it correctly on the facts of this case and under the conventional law of abandonment .
That said , if this Opinion is used to justify a sweep of the trash cans of a neighborhood or community ; or if a trash dive for Sudafed boxes and matchbooks results in DNA or fingerprints being added to a forensic database or results in personal or business records , credit card receipts , personal correspondence or other property being archived for some future use unrelated to the case at hand , then , absent a search warrant , I may well reconsider my legal position and approach to these sorts of cases -- even if I have to think outside the garbage can to get there .
I concur .

Red Hat announced today that it has settled a patent dispute with Firestar and DataTern over two patents , including one that covers object - relational database mapping — a technique that is used in Hibernate , a component of the JBoss middleware stack .
Red
Hat says that the terms of the settlement will offer broad protection for upstream developers , all derivatives , and downstream distributors , as well as Red Hat 's customers .
JBoss , which makes an open source Java application server , was acquired by Red Hat in 2006 for $ 350 million and currently operates as a division of the Linux distributor .
Shortly after the completion of the acquisition , Firestar filed a patent suit against Red Hat in the patent - friendly Eastern District of Texas , claiming that Hibernate infringes on US patent # 6101502 .
Firestar later assigned the patent to its partner DataTern , which also joined the lawsuit .
Critics say that the broadly - worded patent potentially covers the entire concept of object - relational mapping .
The financial terms of the settlement have not been disclosed to the public , but Red Hat says that it will protect practically everyone who uses the allegedly infringing code — unlike the controversial patent agreement between Microsoft and Novell , which only guarantees protection for Novell 's customers .
" Typically when a company settles a patent lawsuit , it focuses on getting safety for itself , " said Red Hat vice president and assistant general counsel Rob Tiller in a statement .
" But that was not enough for us .
We wanted broad provisions that covered our customers , who place trust in us , and the open source community , whose considerable efforts benefit our business . "
Although this deal will end all pending litigation against Red Hat by Firestar and DataTern , the company still faces a lawsuit from patent - holding company IP Innovation over a patent on a " user interface with multiple workspaces for sharing display system objects , " which was originally filed by Xerox .
The same patent has also been basis for similar lawsuits against Apple and Novell .
Red Hat , which emphatically states that " software patents impede innovation in the software industry and conflict with open source development and distribution , " clearly went to great lengths to ensure that the terms of the agreement would conform with open source licensing obligations and serve the interests of the broader open source community .
The positive resolution of the litigation with Firestar and DataTern will likely be welcomed by the Hibernate developer community , but in some ways it might also represents a missed opportunity .
A close look at the patent leaves me with the impression that it is very likely not valid , and the fact that Firestar and DataTern were willing to agree to such permissive settlement terms rather than following through with litigation is a pretty good indication that they were looking for a settlement from the start and do n't necessarily have a lot of faith in the patent 's chances in court .
If Red Hat had followed through and gotten the patent invalidated rather than merely settling , it could have prevented future litigation against other open source projects that use similar technology .
Red
Hat probably decided that the settlement it finally reached in this case offered the best compromise in that it incurred less cost and risk than fighting for invalidation while also still providing adequate protection for Hibernate and Hibernate 's community .
Some software freedom advocates are celebrating this patent agreement because they believe that it demonstrates a GPL - compatible approach to patent licensing .
Indeed , it does , but an important point to consider is that the strength of a patent dictates the amount of leverage that a patent - holder has in negotiations .
If the case had involved a much stronger patent that could n't be invalidated , then the patent - holder would almost definitely never have agreed to such permissive terms .
This kind of patent agreement is the best possible outcome short of invalidation , but it is n't going to be consistently achievable .
After the huge response to Richard Porter 's blogs last year about 9/11 Part of the conspiracy ?
I was very keen to get to the bottom of what exactly happened .
For the latest Conspiracy Files programme , on 9/11 - The Third Tower ( Sunday 6 July at 2100 BST on BBC Two ) , I 've been looking in detail at allegations that there was a conspiracy to deliberately demolish a third tower at the World Trade Center .

This third skyscraper was never hit by an aeroplane .
There is little photographic evidence of extensive damage .
Yet seven hours after the Twin Towers collapsed , this 47 - storey building collapsed in a few seconds .
Afterwards the thousands of tonnes of steel from the building were taken away to be melted down in the Far East .
The official explanation is that this third huge tower at the World Trade Center collapsed because of ordinary fires - but that makes this the first and only skyscraper in the world to have collapsed because of fire .
Nearly seven years on the final official report on the building has still not been published .
The report is now promised this month .
World Trade Center Building 7 has become the subject of heated speculation and a host of conspiracy theories suggesting it was brought down by a controlled demolition .
And some people suggest it was not just the government and foreign intelligence , but the police , the fire service , first responders and even the media that were involved .
It is certainly true that on 9/11 the BBC broadcast that WTC7 had collapsed when it was still standing .
Then the satellite transmission seemed to cut out mysteriously when the correspondent was still talking .
Then Richard Porter admitted in his blog last year that the BBC had lost those key tapes of BBC World News output from the day .
So is that proof that we at the BBC are part of a huge sinister conspiracy or is there a simpler explanation ?
The mystery of the missing tapes did n't last that long .
One very experienced film librarian kindly agreed to have another look for us one night .
There are more than a quarter of a million tapes just in the Fast Store basement at Television Centre .
The next morning I got a call to say the tapes had been found .
They 'd just been put back on the wrong shelf - 2002 rather than 2001 .
Not so sinister after all .
What about the incorrect reporting of the collapse of Tower 7 ?
Having talked to key eyewitnesses who were actually at Ground Zero that day it is clear that , as early as midday , the fire service feared that Tower 7 might collapse .
This information then reached reporters on the scene and was eventually picked up by the international media .
The internet movie Loose Change has been viewed by more than 100 million people according to its makers and it asks this question in the latest film release : " Where did CNN and the BBC get their information especially considering the building was still standing directly behind their reporters ? "
It turns out that the respected news agency Reuters picked up an incorrect report and passed it on .
They have issued this statement :
" On 11 September 2001 Reuters incorrectly reported that one of the buildings at the New York World Trade Center , 7WTC , had collapsed before it actually did .
The report was picked up from a local news story and was withdrawn as soon as it emerged that the building had not fallen . "
I put this to the writer and director of Loose Change , Dylan Avery .
I asked whether he believed the BBC was part of the conspiracy .
Given the question his film had posed about the BBC I was surprised by Dylan 's response : " Of course not , that 's ludicrous .
Why would the BBC be part of it ? "
He added candidly : " I did n't really want to put that line in the movie . "
And the reason the interview with the BBC correspondent , Jane Standley , ended so abruptly ?
The satellite feed had an electronic timer , which cut out at 1715 exactly .
We 've done our best to tackle many of the other questions raised about Tower 7 .
I interviewed the lead official investigators , scientists and eyewitnesses who support the official explanation ; but also architects , engineers and others who now question that account .
The final report on 9/11 should be with us soon .
The official investigators are confident they will be able to solve the final mystery of 9/11 .
But I doubt they will ever convince their harshest critics , who believe there was a home - grown conspiracy at work that day .

Why Was JFK Murdered ?
( Saturday , July 19 , 2008 )
President John Fitzgerald Kennedy ( JFK ) was assassinated on Nov. 22 , 1963 , in Dallas , TX , as the result of a conspiracy .
Why did the Shadow Government decide to eliminate him ?
We now know he wanted to get U.S. troops out of South Vietnam .
JFK had also been taking on Wall St. and The Fed .
He threatened to disband the CIA and close tax loopholes beneficial to “ Big Oil ” and the multinationals .
JFK made a lot of powerful enemies -- one too many !
“ Which forces are in control , the public or shadow powers ? ”
-- Peter Dale Scott , author , essayist and poet .
What made John Fitzgerald Kennedy ( JFK ) such a threat to the “ Shadow Government ” that he had to be murdered ?
To begin with , he was an “ American ” in the finest sense of that word ; a student of history and of the classics ; and a lover of the Republic .
JFK represented the best of the post - WWII generation .
He put the U.S. first in all things , particularly in the area of foreign policy .
JFK , unlike that insufferable blockhead currently occupying the White House , was a man of vision , too .
He said that we can “ put a man on the moon , ” and we did .
But , there is much more .
JFK had within his reach the financial resources to get elected , and more than enough money and influence to build a solid political machine to assure himself two terms in office , if he had lived .
In comparison , look at “ Bubba Bill ” Clinton .
He had little or no money of his own when the Wire Pullers “ anointed ” him to be the presidential standard bearer for the Democratic Party , in the 1992 election .
This meant he was totally “ dependent ” on others to get himself elected .
And , after he won , it also meant that the former Arkansas governor “ owed ” the people who put him in office .
Whereas , JFK was n’t beholding to the cunning Wire Pullers .
He was a free agent .
JFK could stand aloof from those contrivers .
He did n’t need them .
JFK was a free agent .
Here ’s why :
His dad , Joe Kennedy , Sr. , had fairly deep pockets , and plenty of rich cronies , too , who could pitch in to help get his son elected , in 1960 .
In addition , JFK had a natural built in electoral constituency - - a voting block -- who favored his candidacy .
He was an intellectual , of Irish descent , Roman Catholic , young and a WWII Veteran , to boot , possessing a hero - like image .
And , for the most part , large segments of the African - American community felt a special kinship with him .
The women loved him also .
He was charming and better looking than most Hollywood stars of that era .
Many , too , in the rank and file of the then feisty Labor Movement were attracted to and inspired by his candidacy for the Oval Office .
The bosses of the Union Movement , with some notable exceptions , like Jimmy Hoffa , were inclined to give JFK the benefit of the doubt .
For all of the above reasons , JFK was a threat to the Shadow Government . [ 1 ]
After he was elected , he alarmed them further by showing a strong streak of independent thinking !
He consistently put America ’s interests first .
This is what gave the members of the sinister cabal the idea to kill him and to make sure that the official inquiry about the “ Crime of the Century ” was subjected to a first class cover - up , which is officially labeled , “ The Warren Commission . ” [ 2 ]
This takes me to Jim Marrs .
He is one of our country ’s finest crime and investigative reporters .
He is also a top - notch author . [ 3 ]
In his latest book : “ The Rise of the Fourth Reich : The Secret Societies That Threaten to Take Over America , ” he sets out his speculations about why JFK was eliminated .
Marrs writes , at p. 221 : “ By mid-1963 , Kennedy was beginning to exert his autonomous influence over the most powerful -- and violent -- groups in U.S. society .
He was threatening to disband the CIA ... withdraw U.S. troops from South Vietnam , close the tax breaks of the oil - depletion allowances ; tighten control over the tax - free foreign assets of U.S. multinational corporations ... and decrease the power of both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve System .
In June , 1963 , Kennedy ordered the printing and release of $ 4.2 billion in United States notes , paper money issued through the Treasury Department ‘ without paying interest ’ to the Federal Reserve System , which is composed of twelve regional banks all controlled by ‘ private banks ’ whose owners often are ‘ non-Americans . ’ ”
Marrs added : “ Obviously persons affected by these moves [ of JFK ] felt something had to be done . ”
Marrs also reports , when speaking of the slaying of JFK , that one conspiracy expert said : “ It had to happen .
The man was ‘ too independent ’ for his own good . ”
To top all of that off , JFK also opposed Israel ’s nuclear weapons scheme .
Author Stephen Green tells us that not long after that Texas politico , Lyndon B. Johnson , succeeded to the presidency , JFK ’s policy towards that controversial Nuke - producing project was reversed .
Green put it this way in his book , LBJ “ saw no Dimona [ Israel ’s Los Alamos ] , heard no Dimona , and spoke no Dimona when the reactor went critical in 1964 . ” [ 4 ]
Peter Dale Scott in his tome , “ Deep Politics and the Death of JFK , ” insisted that JFK clearly wanted a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam , whether military conditions on the ground allowed it or not .
On Oct. 11 , 1963 , JFK issued “ NSAM 263 ” to that effect .
LBJ reversed that directive , too , with “ NSAM 273 . ”
Of all people , Noam Chomsky , attempted to disparage JFK ’s intention with respect to getting out of Vietnam .
Why ?
In the process , Chomsky ended up supporting the position of Leslie Gelb , who earlier was a Pentagon bureaucrat .
What happened to Gelb ?
Oh , he later became President of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Like the hawkish Neocons , he promoted a preemptive attack on Iraq , in March , 2003 . [ 5 ]
Author Scott took Chomsky to task for his flawed analysis by saying that his theory on JFK ’s intentions “ assumes the continuity of a mind - set that he is trying to prove . ”
To further support his position , Scott , re : JFK and withdrawing from Vietnam , offers the fact that Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers fame , a courageous truth teller , had heard from his then Pentagon boss , John McNaughton , in 1964 , that Robert McNamara , the Secretary of Defense , and JFK , had an agreement that they would close out Vietnam by 1965 , “ whether it was in good shape or bad . ”
It ’s also important to consider , with respect to this dispute , the views of James K. Galbraith .
His scholarly and insightful interpretation of JFK ’s actions , and “ NSAM 263 , ” which backs up author Scott , are found in the “ Boston Review , ” entitled , “ Exit Strategy . ” [ 6 ]
As you can see , JFK made plenty of powerful enemies during his presidency of 1,000 days over a whole array of issues .
One can only ponder why he was “ really ” killed .
The Shadow Government , I suspect , ordered his death and then made sure that its tracks were covered - up .
Who is in this secret cabal and exactly why it decided to mark JFK for death , remains a deep mystery .
It is going to be for the next generation of American patriots to solve the case of JFK ’s murder .
Hopefully , they can bring out the full truth about that loathsome crime , and if possible , punish all the vicious evil doers involved .
I leave the last words to the author Scott : “ Slowly , we have watched the emergence [ in the U.S. ] of a new community , still small but undeniably growing , that will not be satisfied with ‘ the old false answers . ’
How far this new community can reform the deep politics of the old society remains unclear .
But in the long perspective of historical time , we see that the communities dedicated to truth , and justice , and decency , tend to outlast those of their vilifiers . ”
Notes :
[ 1 ] .
For the purpose of this commentary , the term “ Shadow Government ” is used to refer to the ultra-criminal entity hidden from public view which orchestrated JFK ’s assassination .
I am convinced , but I ca n’t prove in a court of law , that he was murdered as the result of a conspiracy .
What the nation witnessed , in my opinion , on Nov. 22 , 1963 , in Dallas , TX , was nothing less than a coup d’etat .

An enriched extract of the ' Indian Frankincense ' herb Boswellia serrata has been proven to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis .
Research published today in BioMed Central 's open access journal Arthritis Research & Therapy has shown that patients taking the herbal remedy showed significant improvement in as little as seven days .
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis ; it commonly affects weight - bearing joints such as the knees and hips , along with the hands , wrists , feet and spine .
The symptoms include pain , stiffness and limited movement .
This randomised , double - blinded , placebo - controlled trial of 70 patients will be of great interest to sufferers , especially those who do n't get adequate relief from existing treatments .
The study was led by Siba Raychaudhuri , a faculty member of the University of California , Davis , in the United States .
According to Raychaudhuri , " The high incidence of adverse affects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment " .
The extract the authors used was enriched with 30 % AKBA ( 3 - O - acetyl - 11- keto- beta - boswellic acid ) , which is thought to be the most active ingredient in the plant .
Raychaudhuri said , " AKBA has anti-inflammatory properties , and we have shown that B. serrata enriched with AKBA can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee " .
This is a proprietary product developed by Laila Nutraceuticals .
B. serrata has been used for thousands of years in the Indian system of traditional medicine known as ' Ayurveda ' .
This study is the first to prove that an enriched extract of the plant can be used as a successful treatment .
The same authors have previously tested the safety of their remedy in animal experiments .
They say that , " In this study , the compound was shown to have no major adverse effects in our osteoarthritis patients .
It is safe for human consumption and even for long - term use " .

At the LinuxWorld expo in San Francisco , analyst Jay Lyman of the 451 Group spoke about the potential for enterprise adoption of Ubuntu and the impact that community - driven Linux distributions will have on the market .
Companies are increasingly choosing free community - driven Linux distributions instead of commercial offerings with conventional support options .
Several factors are driving this trend , particularly dissatisfaction with the cost of support services from the major distributors .
Companies that use and deploy Linux internally increasingly have enough in - house expertise to handle all of their technical needs and no longer have to rely on Red Hat or Novell , according to Lyman .
Procurement practices are evolving overseas , especially in Europe , where distributions like CentOS and Ubuntu are gaining more traction in corporate environments and data centers .
" In Europe there is a greater propensity to consider something that is not from a traditional vendor , " Lyman commented .
Although he sees lots of room for free Linux solutions in the market , he does n't believe that there is any danger that the big commercial players will be completely displaced .
Competition will , however , have a very real impact on pricing and could make commercial support more affordable .
He also believes that free Linux adoption is ultimately beneficial for the major vendors , because it attracts people to the platform and creates unique opportunities for market growth .
To demonstrate the symbiotic relationship between the commercial and community Linux ecosystems , Lyman explained how a school district rolled out Fedora on a handful of machines for a small project and ended up liking it so much that they adopted Red Hat 's enterprise Linux distribution across the entire district .
In that scenario , small - scale usage of the free Fedora distro translated directly into a major commercial support contract for Red Hat .
In turn , Red Hat invests its resources in Linux improvements that trickle back down into Fedora .
Many companies , however , go the other direction and drop costly Red Hat contracts in favor of CentOS , a binary - compatible clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
The advantage of CentOS is that it is fully compatible with software stacks that companies are already deploying on their Red Hat servers .
The implications of this are less apparent , but it could reflect a need for more - granular and less - expensive support options from Red Hat .
The problems with Red Hat 's support offerings are very well documented .
When I was listening to Lyman discuss some of the reasons why companies adopt CentOS , I started to think about a blog entry I read last year that was written by SmugMug CEO Don MacAskill .
SmugMug , which has lots of internal Linux expertise , wanted to pay for Red Hat 's updates and software management tools but eschew the costly and unneeded support services .
When Red Hat refused to unbundle the software and commercial support , SmugMug went to CentOS .
SmugMug 's situation is hardly unique , and more companies are starting to see it as the most cost - effective approach .
Lyman also discussed the potential for greater adoption of Ubuntu in commercial contexts .
Ubuntu is a community - driven distribution that is developed with financial backing from Canonical .
According to Lyman , Ubuntu is " not a flash in the pan . "
It has been the favorite of enthusiast users for several years and is getting lots of attention from Dell and other large hardware vendors .
" We think that staying power shows that Ubuntu is for real , " Lyman stated .
He also thinks that Mark Shuttleworth 's dedication to Linux leaves no room for doubt about his commitment to Ubuntu and the open source ecosystem .
" For Shuttleworth , Ubuntu is n't just a business mission , it 's a personal mission , " Lyman opined .
The big challenge he sees for Ubuntu is breaking into the server space where it is often overlooked .
Canonical has been vigorously pursuing the server market , but has seen little adoption there .
This may be a consequence of perception rather than technical issues .
Companies tend to view Ubuntu as a desktop play and often do n't think of it as a possible contender for their server racks .
Canonical has attempted to change that perception through its partnership with Sun and its efforts to get the distro certified for major enterprise applications .
A whole new generation of future system administrators is growing up with Linux and will bring a lot of solid Linux expertise into the IT departments of the companies that eventually employ them .
As the number of people with such skills grows in the industry , it is likely that adoption of free Linux distributions will continue to increase .
This means more opportunities for Ubuntu and CentOS , and it means that Red Hat and Novell will have to continue adapting their business models .
LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE , Virginia ( Reuters ) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates named new top civilian and military leaders for the U.S. Air Force on Monday as part of a shake - up triggered by mistakes in managing America ’s nuclear arsenal .
Senior Pentagon official Michael Donley ( L ) and Gen. Norton Schwartz in a combination image .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday recommended Donley to be secretary of the U.S. Air Force in a shake - up triggered by mistakes in handling nuclear weapons and parts .
Gates also said he recommended Schwartz as the new Air Force chief of staff .

He also halted cuts to the size of the Air Force to ease the stress from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , noting the Army is not the only force under pressure after years of war .
Gates chose Gen. Norton Schwartz , a cargo aircraft pilot with special operations experience , as Air Force chief -- a pick that signals the Pentagon wants the force to focus on supporting the two wars , U.S. officials said .
Gates also selected senior Pentagon official Michael Donley to be secretary of the Air Force , the top civilian official .
President George W. Bush planned to nominate Donley , who would serve as acting secretary beginning June 21 until his appointment is confirmed by the U.S. Senate , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate , Schwartz would be the first Air Force chief of staff not to have served as a fighter or bomber pilot , an Air Force spokeswoman said .
Gates ’ recommendations to Bush came after the Pentagon chief last week forced Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne and Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley to resign over errors in the handling of nuclear weapons and parts .
In announcing the resignations , Gates said two incidents -- the shipment of nuclear missile fuses to Taiwan and the cross-country flight by an Air Force bomber wrongly armed with nuclear weapons -- exposed a systemic problem in the Air Force and an erosion of nuclear standards .
“ There is simply no room for error in this mission , ” Gates told Air Force officers at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia on Monday .
“ Nor is there , unfortunately , any room for second chances , especially when serious questions about the safety and security of our nuclear arsenal have been raised in the minds of the American people and international partners . ”
“ I am confident that Mike Donley , General Schwartz and the new Air Force leadership team have the qualifications , skill and commitment to excellence necessary to guide the Air Force through this transition and beyond , ” Gates said .
CUTBACKS HALTED
Gates cited missions the Air Force has been conducting and noted , to vigorous nods from officers in the audience , that the force has been deployed for 17 years , since the first Gulf War .
In response to that stress , Gates said he would immediately halt an ongoing reduction in the size of the Air Force .
The Air Force was expected to shrink to 316,000 service members by the end of next year , down from 356,000 , a Langley spokesman said .
The choice of Schwartz , who commands the military headquarters responsible for transporting troops and equipment around the world , marks a significant shift for a force typically led by fighter jet or bomber pilots .
The Air Force and Pentagon have been at odds over mission priorities and weapons systems .
Gates , for example , has noted the Air Force ’s top - of - the - line F - 22 fighter jet has not flown a single mission in either Iraq or Afghanistan .
Still , it remains a priority among some senior Air Force generals .
Gates also has voiced frustration with the Air Force ’s reluctance to take pilots off missions in the war zone that could more effectively and safely be done by drones .
“ There must be focus on the wars we are in as well as on building future capabilities , ” Gates said at Langley .
“ It is a matter of balance . ”
Schwartz , who had intended to retire before being nominated as Air Force chief , also has held a series of jobs working closely with other military services and his appointment may signal that Gates wants to see the Air Force take that approach more broadly .
Donley , who would become the top civilian in charge of the Air Force , is currently director of administration and management for the Department of Defense .
He has previously served as both assistant secretary of the Air Force and as acting secretary of the Air Force .
It is becoming increasingly more difficult for America ’s Office Of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) to continue to claim that cannabis is not a valuable and acceptable medicine .
Late Wednesday night Austria ’s parliament placed the country in line with a number of other countries ( i.e. , Canada ) and 12 American states that allow seriously - ill , dying or sense - threatened medical patients who possess a physician ’s recommendation to legally possess and use cannabis medicinally .
VIENNA ( AFP ) – Austria ’s parliament has adopted a new bill allowing the cultivation of cannabis for medical and scientific purposes , under the Health Ministry ’s control .
The bill , approved by parliament during a late - night session Wednesday , will give the health and food safety agency AGES the exclusive right in Austria to grow the plant , which is otherwise categorised as a drug .
Michael Bach , president of the Austrian pain studies association OeSG , welcomed the new legislation , saying : “ Any initiative that makes it possible to develop and provide new drugs for pain therapy is welcome . ”
“ Substances drawn from cannabis have been used for medical purposes more and more in the last few years , ” he added .
Possession of or dealing in cannabis incurs a 6 - month prison sentence in Austria .

The Scientology cult loudly boasts that after 9/11 , its " Volunteer Ministers " were awarded the Fire Department of New York 's highest honor , the " Medal of Valor . "
This is not only a lie , but an insult to the memory all the brave firefighters who died in the line of duty and were awarded this Medal posthumously .
Dozens of Scientology web site and blogs brazenly make this claim , in a continuing effort to legitimize their cult .
Scientology 's " Volunteer Ministers , " or more accurately , " Vulture Ministers , " are a special corps of opportunists who , presenting themselves as mental health counselors , flock to the scene of major tragedies , natural disasters , school shootings , etc. , in order to prevent and obstruct legitimate mental health professionals from reaching victims and others who may have been affected .
( See recent article here : http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/06/26/18511436.php ) .
In the days after September 11 , Vulture Ministers were ordered to converge on the ruins of the World Trade Center not only to " block the psychs , " but to administer " touch assists , " a rather creepy , inappropriate and completely useless sort of light massage , accompanied by Scientology jargon .
In the weeks that followed , when concerns were raised about the effect on rescue workers of Ground Zero 's toxic air quality , the Vulture Ministers steered them to a Scientology - owned business franchise called Narconon .
This company uses a variety of simplistic and ineffective approaches to " detoxify " people , mostly drug addicts , with the goal of making them into Scientologists .
The Vulture Ministers and Narconon took this opportunity to recruit rescue workers into the cult by offering them free treatments at Narconon facilities .
According to the New York times , more than 140 fire - fighters took them up on this .
Three years later in 2004 , on the occasion of the Scientology cult opening a new headquarters in New York City , a Scientologist named Stephan Hittman made the following " proclamation " : + + +" In recognition of the humanitarian efforts of the Volunteer Ministers of the Church of Scientology , and the help they provided to members of the Fire Department of the City of New York , in keeping with the principles developed by L. Ron Hubbard ; and " WHEREAS : FDNY and the 911 PROGRAM recognize this unwavering commitment to firefighters , to paramedics , to other rescue workers , in keeping with our proudest traditions ; and be it known , " THEREFORE :
That FDNY and the 911 PROGRAM officially recognize this dedicated service to the citizens of the City of New York , and hereby bestow upon L. Ron Hubbard and the Volunteer Ministers of the Church of Scientology , the FDNY and the 911 PROGRAM's Medal of Valor and 9 –11 Service Award — on the occasion of the Grand Opening of the New York Church of Scientology . " +
+ + Not only is it preposterous that the Vulture Ministers would be honored in this way , and not the many agencies and organizations that actually helped people , but Hittman was not authorized to make such an award , or even any award , on behalf of the Fire Department of New York .
He had a little administrative job .
Hittman claimed to be an " Honorary Commissioner " of the Fire Department .
This was a lie .
Who is Stephan Hittman ?
He is a guy who grew up in Brooklyn , went to college and became the manager of the Division of Special Education for the New York City Board of Education .
He had that job for a long time .
Evidence shows that he worked in that office from at least as early as 1984 until 1998 , and possibly later .
At some point between 1998 and 2001 he took a job with the New York Fire Department , managing the Department 's program for distance learning , which helps firefighters to take online courses with various colleges across the country .
This educational division is called the " Office of Fire and Life Safety , " which sound rather more exciting than it actually is .
Hittman would work out arrangements with these colleges so that the firemen could take courses that were relevant to their professional interests .
It was a nice , safe , desk job , with very little adventure or heroics involved .
Then came 9/11 .
It has been suggested that Hittman was instrumental in arranging the Narconon sessions for the rescue workers .
It is not clear at this point what happened after that , but evidence suggests that Hittman was asked to resign from his position .
It seems that he may have been giving speeches and presentations on the pretext that he was an emergency services expert and a true hero of the Fire Department .
Here is an account from New York 's Uniformed Fire Officers Association ( UFOA ) :+ + +" After the events of 09/11/01 , this former civilian employee of the Fire Department has masqueraded in the uniform of the FDNY .
He was so bold as to wear the insignia of the Chief of Department and numerous decorations for valor .
Conduct of this nature is absolutely offensive to the members of the FDNY and cannot be tolerated .
During several speaking engagements in which he participated , he characterized his career in the FDNY as being a leader who helped rebuild the FDNY after 09/11/01 .
The facts could not be further from the truth .
When we learned of his activities , the UFOA was able to provide information to a company that was in the process of hiring him for a management position and others contracting with him for future lectures .
Needless to say , job offers and his ability to lecture have stopped .
This past week there have been several newspaper articles that criticized his fund raising and the use of the FDNY uniform .
The Department has also notified DOI and provided documentation regarding Mr. Hittman 's activities . " + + + Indeed , Hittman had been running around the USA giving speeches , and collecting money for the non-existent " 9/11 Foundation , " of which he claimed to be the CEO .
After the UFOA blew the whistle on him and his speaking gigs started drying up , Hittman took his act to Latin America , where he gave talks and collected donations from audiences in Argentina , the Dominican Republic , Peru , and other countries , until the director of Peru 's firefighter training organization started spreading the word that Hittman had no idea what he was talking about and that he was a fraud .
Hittman 's present activities are not known , but he is almost certainly somewhere in the New York City metropolitan area , possibly even at the Scientology offices he helped to dedicate .
But Hittman 's masquerade party is not the only reason that the Medal of Valor could not possibly have been given to Scientology 's Vulture Ministers .
According to the Fire Department , + + + The Fire Department Medal of Valor was first issued by the FDNY in 1911 and is engraved with the City seal .
Shortly after World War II , the Department began issuing this medal to the next of kin of members who had died in the line - of - duty .
Since 1960 , the medal has been awarded posthumously and exclusively for line of duty death .+ + + The medal has been awarded POSTHUMOUSLY and EXCLUSIVELY for line of duty death .
Scientology leaders were well aware that Stephan Hittman was not authorized to award the New York City Fire Department 's Medal of Honor .
They knew it then , and they know it now .
Why , then , does Scientology brag at every possible opportunity that the Fire Department of New York awarded them this Medal ?
Will Scientology return the Medal to the Fire Department , if it is an actual Medal that was misappropriated ?
Will they apologize to the Fire Department , and take down the offensive boasting from their countless web sites ?
Not unless they are forced to do so .
Someone should force them.=========================================See Also : Scientology at Ground ZeroUniformed Fire Officers AssociationEL ESCÁNDALO HITTMANN - Muestra de cómo se fabrica el éxito aparente de CienciologíaHittman el CienciologoNadie Renuncia por Caso HittmanStephan Hittmann Sería FraudeScientologist 's Treatments Lure FirefightersNew York Times , October 4 , 2003

Directed by WH , Rove skips hearing for exotic getaway
While House Democrats fumed over the absence of Karl Rove from hearings investigating his possible interference in the Justice Department , the man himself was well on his way to the Yalta Black Sea resort , Newsweek reported Saturday .
" That 's just extremely contemptuous it shows the disdain that he has for Congress and which he has encouraged in the Bush White House , " said Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee .
Rove had a speaking engagement at the fifth annual conference of the YES Foundation , which Newsweek describes as a " confab of world luminaries bankrolled by billionaire Victor Pinchuk , the Ukrainian steel magnate and son- in - law of the country 's former autocratic president , Leonid Kuchma . "
Rove 's lawyer Robert Luskin defended his actions as justifiable given that White House counsel Fred Fielding instructed Rove not to show up because anything he said was protected by executive privilege .
" What was he supposed to do , sit at home with his lights off ? "
Luskin said in the article .
Luskin added that this " was not something we concocted so he could make money in Yalta . "
Speaking fees for Rove can be as high as $ 40,000 , according to an article describing his controversial presence scheduled for a Texas Associated of Realtor convention this September .
Rove appeared on The O'Reilly Factor Wednesday to discount the Democrats demand for his presence : " They want a circus , " he said .
#
O'REILLY : They gave you a little bit of a hard time , right ?
ROVE : It was n't that hard of a time .
They were mostly polite .
I could tell it was like Satan dropping in at the Southern Baptist Convention , they were n't exactly pleased to see me , but they were a little bit intrigued .
#
After his initial disappearance in early July , the House Judicial Committee voted 7 - 1 to reject the executive privilege Rove claimed protected him from being forced to testify .
Democrats expect judiciary chair Rep. John Conyers to hold Rove in contempt of Congress .

It is generally known that JavaScript supports a functional style of programming .
But because it does not have algebraic data types , the functional programming is usually limited to some simple higher order functions applied to Arrays .
I have often build small libraries that allow working with some aspects of algebraic data types in JavaScript .
This time I thought is was cool enough to write a bit about it :
Algebraic Data Types in JavaScript
It includes :
a very small footprint
unfold , map and fold over any adt
merging ( read deforestation / fusion ) of unfold , map and fold
user defined derived properties ( think derived classes Show , Eq ... )
I also show how to do the Data Types Ã la carte style of Wouter Swierstra with this library .
A commenter posted something in an old post on food stamps that I think is worth sharing :
Clearly a large number of the critics of the food stamp program have never actually lived in conditions which necessitate the program .
I 'm a 19 year old full time college student and my mother and brother rely on the food stamp program .
Without this program , they would literally not be able to afford food .
A little background :
My mother is mentally ill and cognitively impaired .
She suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder , severe depression , and minor brain damage caused by incorrectly administered Electroconvulsive therapy .
My brother is 16 , and my parents share joint custody of him .
They switch off every two weeks .
Between child support and social security , my mother recieves $ 10,000 per year to live off of .
After paying rent , the cost of which is mitigated through a great program known as Section - 8 , and her bills ( power / phone / HEAT ) , she is left with a marginal amount of money for her own use .
I 'm currently living at home for the summer .
This month she has $ 20 to split between gas for her car , which is extremely fuel inefficient , and whatever else may arise .
In the winter she often lets bills pile up in favor of paying for heat , as Vermont winters are frigid .
She receives a base of $ 75 per person in food stamps .
She receives around $ 38 per month for my brother , as he spends half his time at her house , the full $ 75 for herself , and a small amount ( $ 20 ? ) for me , as I 'm only at home during college vacations .
That comes out to $ 133 per month in food stamps .
She has $ 20 in discretionary spending this month .
To the critics of this program : try growing up in that household and then get back to me .
As another insight as to why the poor purchase food that is unhealthy : unhealthy food tends to taste better than healthy food .
Potato chips vs celery .
When you have no pleasures in your life , no luxuries , you 're damn well going to pick the food that tastes better .
I also have a major criticism of this program .
So long as I live at my mom's house while I 'm not at college , I can not feasibly get a job .
If I were to get a job , my mother would loose her food stamps because there would be a " provider " in the household .
I 'm exploring alternate possibilities , but without a job , I do n't even know if I 'll be able to afford to continue my college education .
I 'm literally playing it by ear right now - there is no better option .
I 'll know whether or not I 'll return to college in a few weeks , when I get my new financial aid letter .
How are the poor supposed to rise from poverty if they can't afford an education ?
I think this illuminates several aspects of the debate over food stamps :
1 ) The poor really are not living lives of joyous leisure on their frantabulously lavish benefits .
2 ) People who are cognitively disabled -- mentally ill or retarded -- need more supervision and help from the government , not less .
3 ) As I 've said before , I think the non-cognitively - disabled poor need more wage top-ups and less government decisions about what they should spend their money on .
4 ) The system is set up so that poor people face ludicrously high marginal tax rates -- they can literally exceed 100 % , as benefit loss outweighs the additional income .
People with fabulously expensive and disabling diseases who can't hold down a regular job are barred from doing any work at all , lest they lose their Medicaid , disability , and food stamps .
They also cannot have any assets .
Surely preventing people from cheating the government does not actually require forcing people with obviously debilitating chronic conditions to have less discretionary money per month than most middle class kids get in allowance .
This is one of the reasons I 'm so gung - ho on a negative income tax to replace most benefits -- it does n't have this ugly feature of sudden benefit loss , but it also does n't require us to subsidize a hundred middle class people for every poor person we help .
It wo n't work for people who are disabled , of course , who would need a separate system .
But for most poor people , and for the rest of us , I think it would be a vast improvement .
5 ) His point about potato chips versus celery point was made by Orwell in The Road to Wigan Pier :
The miner ’s family spend only tenpence a week on green vegetables and tenpence half - penny on milk ( remember that one of them is a child less than three years old ) , and nothing on fruit ; but they spend one and nine on sugar ( about eight pounds of sugar , that is ) and a shilling on tea .
The half - crown spent on meat might represent a small joint and the materials for a stew ; probably as often as not it would represent four or five tins of bully beef .
The basis of their diet , therefore , is white bread and margarine , corned beef , sugared tea , and potatoes — an appalling diet .
Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even , like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman , saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw ?
Yes , it would , but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing .
The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots .
And the peculiar evil is this , that the less money you have , the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food .
A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits ; an unemployed man does n’t .
Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play .
When you are unemployed , which is to say when you are underfed , harassed , bored , and miserable , you do n’t want to eat dull wholesome food .
You want something a little bit ‘ tasty ’ .
There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you .
Let ’s have three pennorth of chips !
Run out and buy us a twopenny ice - cream !
Put the kettle on and we ’ll all have a nice cup of tea !
That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level .
White bread - and - marg and sugared tea do n’t nourish you to any extent , but they are nicer ( at least most people think so ) than brown bread - and - dripping and cold water .
Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated , and especially with tea , the English - man ’s opium .
A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread .
I have nothing to add .
AMD is ready to let " Puma " roar .
At the 2008 Computex conference , June 4 in Taipei , Taiwan , AMD will officially unveil its new laptop platform , formally code - named Puma , as the chip maker looks to gain a bigger share of the red - hot notebook market .
Just as it did with its recently released desktop platform , AMD is offering Puma as a complete package that includes the company 's own processor , the dual - core Turion x2 Ultra , 7 - series chip set and ATI Radeon HD 3000 series graphics .
AMD is mainly targeting the platform at consumers , who are continuing to choose notebooks over desktops , which is one reason that IDC predicts that 71 percent of consumer purchases and 66 percent of commercial buys will be laptops by 2011 .
The company also designed the platform to appeal to small and midsize businesses , which are also switching to laptops , and specialized markets such as government and education .
" The notebook provides an opportunity for IT to reduce support and maintenance costs , " said Scott Shutter , a brand manager for AMD .
" In the public sector they tend to have older infrastructure .
However , they can update their client technologies and have the latest client devices and still extend the life of that infrastructure by having modern clients without increasing the complexity of the network . "
AMD Beats Intel to Notebook Market
AMD is releasing Puma at a fortuitous time as the company looks to bounce back from a series of missteps in 2007 .
Before the Computex show kicked off , Intel told its customers that it would delay releasing its Centrino 2 laptop platform after the company discovered problems with the chip set 's integrated graphics .
There were also problems with the licensing of Intel 's WiMax technology in the United States .
This means that AMD will bring its laptop to the market first , which some analysts believe will give it an edge , especially when it comes to back - to - school and holiday sales later this year .
Rob Enderle , an analyst with the Enderle Group , said that Puma , for the first time , gives AMD a chance to compete with Intel in the laptop market .
While Enderle believes that AMD still can not compete against Intel when it comes to power efficiency , he does think that Puma 's graphics , both integrated and discrete , are better than what Intel offers with Centrino .
" Their [ AMD's ] advantage is with graphics , " said Enderle .
" Companies have been specifying that an increasing number of notebooks have discrete graphics .
It 's still not the prevalent way of doing things , but it 's a growing trend so that might indicate that AMD may have an advantage with regard to this trend .
However , most folks are still buying [ integrated graphics ] Intel . "
For the most part , the integrated and discrete Radeon graphics are meant to offer consumers options such as being able to download and watch high - definition video or support Microsoft 's DX10 graphics API .
AMD also packed a number of power - saving features into Puma to appeal to commercial buyers and to try to close the gap with Intel 's offerings .
With all the reporters covering the major presidential candidates , it amazes me no one ever seems to ask the right questions .
For several days now , WND has been hounding Barack Obama 's campaign about a statement he made July 2 in Colorado Springs – a statement that blew my mind , one that has had me scratching my head ever since .
In talking about his plans to double the size of the Peace Corps and nearly quadruple the size of AmeriCorps and the size of the nation 's military services , he made this rather shocking ( and chilling ) pledge : " We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we 've set .
We 've got to have a civilian national security force that 's just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded . "
Now , since I 've never heard anyone inside or out of government use the phrase " civilian national security force " before , I was more than a little curious about what he has in mind .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Is it possible I am the only journalist in America who sought clarification on this campaign promise ?
What does it mean ?
If we 're going to create some kind of national police force as big , powerful and well - funded as our combined U.S. military forces , is n't this rather a big deal ?
I thought Democrats generally believed the U.S. spent too much on the military .
How is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the Army , Navy , Marines and Air Force put together ?
Now , maybe he was misquoted by the Congressional Quarterly and the Chicago Tribune .
I guess it 's possible .
If so , you would think he would want to set the record straight .
Maybe he misspoke .
That has certainly happened before .
Again , why would n't the rest of my colleagues show some curiosity about such a major and , frankly , bone - chilling proposition ?
Are we talking about creating a police state here ?
The U.S. Army alone has nearly 500,000 troops .
That does n't count reserves or National Guard .
In 2007 , the U.S. Defense budget was $ 439 billion .
Is Obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that ?
If not , why did he say it ?
What did he mean ?
So far , despite our attempts to find out , the Obama campaign is not talking .
At this point all I can do is enlist your help – and the help of every other journalist who still thinks the American people have a right to know the specifics about a presidential candidate 's biggest and boldest initiatives before the election .
I also want to ask radio talk - show hosts across America to start asking this same question .
I have a feeling if others join our quest , we might yet get clarification on this proposal from Obama .
Who will Obama appoint to administer this new " civilian national security force " ?
Where will the money come from ?
Where in the Constitution does he see justification for the federal government creating such a domestic army ?
The questions are endless .
But before we can hope to get to the specifics , we need much more in the way of generalizations from Obama .
Certainly there have been initiatives like this elsewhere – Cuba , the Soviet Union , China , Venezuela , North Korea .
But has anything like this ever been proposed in a free country ?
I have a feeling there would be more questions from the press if I myself had proposed the creation of something as preposterous as a " civilian national security force " than there has been about this proposal by the presidential candidate currently leading in most of the polls .
I 'm quite sure I would be hung out to dry as some kind of Nazi thug .
Meanwhile , Obama makes this wild suggestion and it is met with a collective yawn from the watchdogs .
Help me out here .
What am I missing ?
Can I get a hand ?
If you would like to sound off on this issue , participate in today 's WND Poll .
Government ministers responded to news of rising inflation figures with a single message – it ’s time to crack down on wage rises .
Prices for food , fuel and other basics may be going through the roof , but that just means workers must “ tighten their belts ” .
The chancellor Alistair Darling warmed to this theme last week , declaring , “ We can not get ourselves into a position where we allow inflation to take hold because we get into inflationary pay rises . ”
He repeated this message on Sunday , telling the BBC , “ Pay awards in both the private and public sector have to be consistent with our inflation target , which is 2 percent . ”
Darling ’s call was echoed the next day by Andrew Sentance , a member of the Bank of England ’s monetary policy committee , who warned of the need to ensure that wages “ do not pick up in response to a temporary episode of rising headline inflation ” .
Underlying all these calls for wage restraint is the theory of the “ wage - price spiral ” .
The idea is that workers respond to rising prices by pushing for higher wages , and that companies respond to a higher wage bill by jacking up their prices .
According to this theory , inflation should be tackled by workers accepting lower pay rises and companies holding back on price increases .
This discipline is buttressed by high - minded appeals to a “ common good ” .
Spiral
Thus Darling said that getting into an inflationary spiral would be “ disastrous , not just for the country but for each and every one of us ” .
Sentance similarly warned that “ wage and price increases ” would fuel inflation .
But there are problems with this theory and its accompanying ideology of “ we ’re all in it together ” .
For starters , whatever the rhetoric of “ national unity ” , wage levels are negotiated between workers and bosses , while price increases are not .
That means that in practice , most of the burden of “ restraint ” falls upon wages , not on prices .
Pay restraint does not fall equally either .
For the past two years Gordon Brown has insisted on a maximum 2 percent wage rise for public sector workers .
But bonuses and salaries paid to City traders are as extravagant as ever .
Ultimately the “ wage - price spiral ” theory is based on a false equation .
It treats the demands of ordinary working people for the basics in life – food , housing , clothing , fuel – as being on a par with the demands of big business for fat profit margins .
It treats profits as sacrosanct and presents the ruling class ’s insatiable desire for profits as a fact of nature that everyone else must accommodate to .
That is why socialists should reject the argument that wage rises cause inflation , or that wage restraint can hold it back .
The decision to raise prices is a conscious , political decision made by the bosses to protect their profits .
Inflation is ultimately built into the system of capitalists chasing profits .
And workers should not pay for the chaos caused by their system .
Multi-tasking affects the brain 's learning systems , and as a result , we do not learn as well when we are distracted , UCLA psychologists report this week in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Multi - tasking adversely affects how you learn , " said Russell Poldrack , UCLA associate professor of psychology and co-author of the study .
" Even if you learn while multi- tasking , that learning is less flexible and more specialized , so you cannot retrieve the information as easily .
Our study shows that to the degree you can learn while multi-tasking , you will use different brain systems .
" The best thing you can do to improve your memory is to pay attention to the things you want to remember , " Poldrack added .
" Our data support that .
When distractions force you to pay less attention to what you are doing , you do n't learn as well as if you had paid full attention . "
Tasks that require more attention , such as learning calculus or reading Shakespeare , will be particularly adversely affected by multi-tasking , Poldrack said .
The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to examine brain activity and function , a technique that uses magnetic fields to spot active brain areas by telltale increases in blood oxygen .
Participants in the study , who were in their 20s , learned a simple classification task by trial - and - error .
They were asked to make predictions after receiving a set of cues concerning cards that displayed various shapes , and divided the cards into two categories .
With one set of cards , they learned without any distractions .
With a second set of cards , they performed a simultaneous task : listening to high and low beeps through headphones and keeping a mental count of the high - pitch beeps .
While the distraction of the beeps did not reduce the accuracy of the predictions -- people could learn the task either way -- it did reduce the participants ' subsequent knowledge about the task during a follow - up session .
When the subjects were asked questions about the cards afterward , they did much better on the task they learned without the distraction .
On the task they learned with the distraction , they could not extrapolate ; in scientific terms , their knowledge was much less " flexible . "
This result demonstrates a reduced capacity to recall memories when placed in a different context , Poldrack said .
" Our results suggest that learning facts and concepts will be worse if you learn them while you 're distracted , " Poldrack said .
Different forms of memory are processed by separate systems in the brain , he noted .
When you recall what you did last weekend or try to remember someone 's name or your driver 's license number , you are using a type of memory retrieval called declarative memory .
( Patients with Alzheimer disease have damage in these brain areas . )
When you remember how to ride a bicycle or how to play tennis , you are using what is called procedural memory ; this requires a different set of brain areas than those used for learning facts and concepts , which rely on the declarative memory system .
The beeps in the study disrupted declarative memory , said Poldrack , who also studies how the types of memory are related .
The brain 's hippocampus -- a sea- horse - shaped structure that plays critical roles in processing , storing and recalling information -- is necessary for declarative memory , Poldrack said .
For the task learned without distraction , the hippocampus was involved .
However , for the task learned with the distraction of the beeps , the hippocampus was not involved ; but the striatum was , which is the brain system that underlies our ability to learn new skills .
The striatum is the brain system damaged in patients with Parkinson disease , Poldrack noted .
Patients with Parkinson's have trouble learning new motor skills but do not have trouble remembering the past .
" We have shown that multi- tasking makes it more likely you will rely on the striatum to learn , " Poldrack said .
" Our study indicates that multi- tasking changes the way people learn . "
The researchers noted that they are not saying never to multi-task , just do n't multi-task while you are trying to learn something new that you hope to remember .
Listening to music can energize people and increase alertness .
Listening to music while performing certain tasks , such as exercising , can be helpful .
But tasks that distract you while you try to learn something new are likely to adversely affect your learning , Poldrack said .
" Concentrate while you 're studying , " he said .

The research is federally funded by the National Science Foundation ( http://www. nsf. gov/ ) and the Whitehall Foundation ( http://www. whitehall. org / ) .
Poldrack noted that other research shows that talking on the phone badly impairs the ability to drive a car .
