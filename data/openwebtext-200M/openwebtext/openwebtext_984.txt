Hi , all LXDE users ,
After more than two years of development , now LXDE became very active and more and more mature .
Recently , some developers joined us , and many new changes were made in our svn repository .
However , the core and the origin of the desktop , the file manager , PCManFM , did n’t get improved for a period of time .
There are originally some plans , but due to dramtic changes in recent GTK+/glib/gnome/freedesktop.org/HAL , we have a dilemma now .
One thing that I hate Linux most is they are always breaking backward compatibilities and trying to ruin others ’ work .
The volume management parts is now broken due to incompatibility changes in HAL .
Now many modern distros are using PolicyKit and force the use of it with HAL .
Unfortunately , some related things are now GNOME - specific , and more or less depends on gnome .
KDE guys are now trying to develop their own equivalent tools , and its only availble in the latest KDE .
The simple gksu , sudo , or other similar tricks no longer works correctly without gnome stuff .
Thunar and XFCE uses their own libexo and exo-mount along with some xfce libs to handle volumes .
Not sure about how it handle Policy Kit .
So , a gnome - free clean solution to this is not quite possible at this time .
Second , since glib / gio is now extensively used in gtk + itself , the GtkFileChooser ( Open / Save dialog ) now uses gio , too .
So , shifting to gio seems to be a reasonable and inevitabe move .
GTK + already depends on it , so there is no way to prevent the use of gio .
However , though they claimed that gio works without gvfs ( fallback to local filesystem ) , that ’s not the truth .
File copying , HAL - based volume mouting , and even trash bin…etc do n’t work at all without gvfs , which has many dependencies .
Using gio extensively means that you ’ll need gvfs , too .
Current gvfs depends on some gnome stuff , such as gnome - mount and gnome - terminal , gconf…etc , and those parts are “ hard - coded ” in gvfs .
So they are not changable .
Bookmarks in GTK + file dialogs now supports remote URLs .
If we do n’t use gvfs , we will be incompatible with gtk+ itself .
Current PCManFM does n’t recognize those remote URLs , and this causes problems with more recent gtk+ / gnome programs .
No matter you like it or not , gtk + is now depending on gio , which requires gvfs + gnome stuff to be fully functional .
Yes I know it still work without gvfs , but most of the advantages of gio wo n’t be available without gvfs .
Removable devices are not mountable in GTK + file dialogs without gvfs , too .
Besides , some parts of gio are not efficient and uses much more memory in many places .
Hence using gio along with gvfs ( plus its gnome dependencies ) seems to be inevitable in the future .
Another solution will be using thunar - vfs implemented by thunar .
The advantage is quite apparent .
Thunar is very fast and the memory footprint is small .
The APIs are easy to use and provides more sophiticated interface to developers .
I already reviewed its code , and it ’s well written , commented , and optimized .
The quality is very good .
The author of thunar , Benny , is one of the best gtk + programmer I ’ve ever seen in the free world .
However , thunar - vfs depends on several XFCE libs .
Besides , in some distros , it ’s bundled with thunar .
It has no support for remote filesystems , and the compatibliy with gio / gvfs is hence questioned .
In addition , there are some XFCE developers trying to migrate thunar from thunar - vfs to gio .
I think they made a huge mistake since both the design and performance of thunar - vfs are better than gio .
Thunar-vfs , however , does n’t support remote filesystems .
This can be compensated by using FUSE - based implementations .
Originally this is also the plan of PCManFM , and was once tried in 0.4 branch .
Unfortunately , due to lack of good - quality and GUI - friendly FUSE - based remote filesystem implementations , this was removed in 0.5 .
Moreover , using FUSE - based implementation can only provide POSIX interface to programmers , which is a little bit restrictive to desktop applications .
Apart from those two existing vfs implementations , there is no existing equivalence .
Our own vfs implementation in PCManFM is quite primitive and a little bit buggy .
Besides , we ’ll be lagged behind freedesktop.org specs since it ’s mainly controlled by GNOME and KDE guys .
Before this important issue is solved , further development of PCManFM will make the shift to other VFS more difficult .
So a decision should be made here , and we can continue the development of the file manager .
Options are :
1. Shift to GIO + GVFS , and accept the inevitable GNOME dependencies it brings since many gtk + apps also need them , and we can get full support to remote filesystems with good compatibility with gnome / gtk + .
Future breaks in backward compatiblity wo n’t affect us since those dirty works were maintained by GNOME developers .
Then we can focus on the design of desktop environment , not on fixing broken compatibilities .
Since XFCE seems to be shifting to GIO , maybe it ’s inevitable .
2 . Shift to thunar -vfs , and accept the inevitable XFCE dependencies .
Then handle all remote filesystems with FUSE - based solutions .
However , if XFCE adopted GIO / GVFS in the future , we ’ll lose all the supports .
Besides , I ’m not sure if XFCE solutions can be compatible with future GNOME .
Especially when PolicyKit , ConsoleKit , and more things are widely adopted by modern distros , and they are more or less gnome - related .
3 . Copy the code of thunar - vfs , and create our fork .
We can do what we want , and try to minimize XFCE dependencies .
However , it ’s difficult to keep sync with XFCE / thunar , and removing those XFCE dependencies is not quite easy .
Besides , this can make XFCE guys angry since we only steal their code and rename all the libs , then strip their XFCE dependencies .
In addition , our improvement cannot get into XFCE source tree .
So duplicated work will be done by both project , and we ’ll become out of sync grdually .
4 . Keep current work , and try to fix all bugs ( Not quite possible ) .
If freedesktop.org specs changes ( happens frequently ) , we just rewrite our programs to fit them ( a great waste of time and this definitely blocks our development in other areas ) .
This could even make our work totally broken if they change something in the spec or the future versions of gtk+/ gio .
Then we ’ll be busy fixing broken compatability all the time .
So , it ’s a important and difficult decision .
Personally I ’ll suggest adopting GIO / GVFS and accept its deps , then try to keep our program lightweight ( This is still possible ) .
This will make PCManFM heavier and slower than current implementation , but since the current code is buggy and not functioning well … .
It ’s not a fair comparison anyways .
Any thoughts or better ideas ?
While the corporate media is praising Obama 's announcement yesterday to more stringently monitor mountaintop mining , those involved in fighting the massive pollution that results from the practice say it 's nowhere near enough .
One group 's attorney called it " rearranging the bureaucratic deck chairs . "
( Remember how Obama kept talking about " clean coal " ?
This is what it looks like , folks : powerful poison dumped into people 's lives . )
Friday morning , this terrible news :
The pollution is so toxic , so dangerous , that an enemy of the United States -- or a storm or some other disrupting event -- could easily cause them to spill out and lay waste to any area nearby .
Just how bad has the coal ash situation gotten in the United States ?
So bad that the Department of Homeland Security has told Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) that her committee can't publicly disclose the location of coal ash dumps across the country .
And yet , for some reason , it 's perfectly fine when mining companies do it !
Hey , how about that " clean coal " ?
There are 44 sites deemed by the Environmental Protection Agency to be high hazard , but Boxer said she is n't allowed to talk about them other than to senators in the states affected .
" There is a huge muzzle on me and my staff , " she said .
In other words , this is a very urgent problem .
Activists say all Obama has to do is enforce the Clean Water Act that already exists .
If the Obama administration wants to protect the people and mountains of Appalachia , it needs to end the destructive practice of mountaintop mining , not settle for promises of stricter scrutiny of the mining permits , advocates say .
[...]
The White House announced what it described as an “ unprecedented ” agreement among the Environmental Protection Agency , the Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department to better coordinate and tighten the agencies ’ oversight of mountaintop mining and to review the mining existing laws .
In a memorandum of understanding , the agencies promised to :
• Require more stringent environmental reviews for future mountaintop mining permits , including using the Clean Water Act to reduce contamination in streams and watersheds ; • Propose a rule change to stop allowing a type of nationwide permit that does n’t require site - specific reviews for mining operations to dump the mineral - laden debris of former mountaintops into streams ; • Strengthen oversight of state agencies , both in their permitting and enforcement ; • And , if the U.S. District Court vacates the Bush administration ’s 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule as requested , return to the 1983 rules restoring the 100 - foot buffer zone around streams for mining waste .
These are all steps in the right direction , but they are n’t enough , says Willa Mays , Executive Director of Appalachian Voices :
" Their priorities do not take into account that mountains are being blown up today , and until mountaintop removal coal mining is ended , residents will continue to suffer from high disease rates , floods , and poisoned water supplies directly attributable to this mining practice . "
Advocates across Appalachia echoed her concern .
Kentuckians for the Commonwealth member Teri Blanton :
“ It ’s always a good thing to protect people and water , but this announcement is not an end to mountaintop removal .
As Wendell Berry has stated , you ca n’t regulate an abomination . ”
Coal River Mountain Watch Co-Director Vernon Haltom :
" Without a significant change in policy , mining companies will continue to destroy our mountains and bury our streams on the Obama administration ’s watch .
They need to put a stop to this , and they ’re not doing so . "
Kentucky Waterways Alliance Executive Director Judith Petersen :
" By moving to end the Nationwide Permit , the administration is making it harder for coal companies to bury streams and promising tougher enforcement .
But we believe that if fully enforced , the Clean Water Act would prohibit filling streams with mining waste , making mountaintop removal coal mining nearly impossible . "
In the coal - rich mountains stretching from West Virginia to Tennessee , mining companies have flattened more than 1 million acres of Appalachia by razing the trees and then blowing off the mountaintops to get at the coal seams .
Their practice of pushing the mountaintop “ overburden ” into the neighboring valleys has filled more than 700 miles of streams and degraded hundreds of miles more with traces of nickel , lead , cadmium , iron and selenium .
Residents describe how changes to the terrain have exacerbated flooding , and the heavy metals that leach into the streams have poisoned their wells , fish and wildlife .
Two bills currently in Congress would begin to tackle the problem by expressly prohibiting coal companies from dumping their mining waste in streams .
Versions of the Clean Water Protection Act in the House and the Appalachian Restoration Act in the Senate were first offered in 2002 .
So far , though , lawmakers on Capitol Hill have failed to pass them .
The White House does n’t have to wait for Congress to act , says EarthJustice legislative council Joan Mulhern :
The state Senate voted today to require private utilities to get 33 % of their energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind power by the year 2020 , despite complaints from many lawmakers that it will cost ratepayers $ 1.8 billion more annually .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) said the bill , which now goes to the Assembly , would help pave the way to a more environmental friendly future .
" The green economy is the economy of the future , " Steinberg said .
" The environment and the economy go together . "
However , Sen. John Benoit ( R - Palm Desert ) said the mandate will not only hurt residents who are already having trouble paying their bills , but will also drive manufacturing firms out of the state .
" We are going to make ourselves the greenest Third World economy in the world , " Benoit said .
Currently , investor - owned utilities including Southern California Edison , face a requirement that 20 % of the energy they sell come from renewable sources by next year .
Less than a year after California voters rejected a ballot measure to increase the mandate to 50 % by 2025 , Sen.
Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) has authored SB 14 , which would require 33 % by 2020 .
The standard mirrors the level set in an executive order issued by the governor in November .
" We ought to be doing this because it ’s going to clean up the air , " Simitian said during a more than hour - long debate .
" We ought to be doing this because it will address climate change . "
The vote was 21 - 16 with the Republicans joined by Sen. Roderick Wright ( D - Inglewood ) in opposing the measure .
" I 'm concerned that this bill is moving too fast without sufficient scrutiny , " Wright told his colleagues .
" If you require energy companies to purchase something they do n’t really need you increase cost . "

The Point of Pattern Matching in Scala
A Conversation with Martin Odersky , Part IV
by Bill Venners and Frank Sommers
May 25 , 2009

Summary
Martin Odersky talks with Bill Venners and Frank Sommers about the mechanics and purpose of pattern matching in Scala .
Scala is an emerging general - purpose , type - safe language for the Java Platform that combines object - oriented and functional programming .
It is the brainchild of Martin Odersky , a professor at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) .
In this multi-part interview series , Artima 's Bill Venners and Frank Sommers discuss Scala with Martin Odersky .
In Part I , The Origins of Scala , Odersky gives a bit of the history that led to the creation of Scala .
In Part II , The Goals of Scala , he discusses the compromises , goals , innovations , and benefits of Scala 's design .
In Part III , The Purpose of Scala 's Type System , he dives into the design motivations for Scala 's type system .
In this fourth and final installment , Odersky discusses pattern matching .
What is pattern matching ?
Bill Venners : Scala has pattern matching , a functional programming technique that has n't been seen before in mainstream languages .
Can you explain what it is , and why we need it ?
Martin Odersky : Pattern matching is not very new .
It has been in languages from the mid-seventies .
One of the first languages that I know had it is ML , but probably it existed in languages before that .
It is a standard feature of many functional languages , including ML , Caml , Erlang , and Haskell .
So what does pattern matching do ?
It lets you match a value against several cases , sort of like a switch statement in Java .
But instead of just matching numbers , which is what switch statements do , you match what are essentially the creation forms of objects .
For example , a list in Scala is one of two cases : either the empty list , which is written Nil , or a list that consists of a single element , the head of the list , followed by another list , the tail .
In pattern matching , you can ask : given a list , is it the empty list ?
You write case Nil , an arrow ( => ) , and then some expression :
case Nil => // some expression
Or you can ask : is it a non-empty list ?
You write case x :: xs , an arrow , and some expression :
case x :: xs => // some expression
The double colon ( :: ) is the cons operator ; x represents the head of the list , and xs the tail .
So the pattern match will first make a distinction as to whether the list is empty .
But if the list was not empty , it will also name the head of the list x and the tail of the list xs .
These variables can then be used in the expression to the right of the arrow .
( See Listing 1 . )
Listing 1 . A match expression list match { case Nil => " was an empty list " case x :: xs => " head was " + x + " , tail was " + xs }
If list is non-empty , the second case will match and x will be assigned to the head of the list , xs to the tail .
These variables will then be used in the string concatenation expression to the right of the arrow symbol .
For example , if list is List ( " hello " , " world " ) , the result of the match expression will be the string " head was hello , tail was List ( world ) " .
That 's a very simple pattern .
Patterns actually nest , just like expressions nest , so you can have very deep patterns .
Generally the idea is that a pattern looks just like an expression .
It is basically exactly the same sort of thing .
It looks like an expression that constructs a potentially complicated tree of objects , only you leave out the new s .
You do n't need them .
In fact in Scala , when you construct the same objects you do n't need the new s either .
Then you can in some places have variables that are placeholders for what actually is in that tree of objects .
( See Listing 2 . )
Listing 2 . A match expression with a nested pattern object match { case Address ( Name ( first , last ) , street , city , state , zip ) => println ( last + " , " + zip ) case _ => println ( " not an address " ) // the default case }
In the first case , the pattern Name ( first , last ) is nested inside the pattern Address ( ... ) .
The last value , which was passed to the Name constructor , is " extracted " and therefore usable in the expression to the right of the arrow .
The purpose of pattern matching
So why do you need pattern matching ?
We all have complicated data .
If we adhere to a strict object - oriented style , then we do n't want to look inside these trees of data .
Instead , we want to call methods , and let the methods do the right thing .
If we have the ability to do that , we do n't need pattern matching so much , because the methods do what we need .
But there are many situations where the objects do n't have the methods we need , and we can't ( or do n't want to ) add new methods to the objects .
One example is XML .
If you have an XML tree , the tree is just pure data .
It 's either a node , or a sequence of nodes .
XML is a very generic representation .
For instance , a DOM is just essentially an array of nodes , and you do n't know what the nodes are .
Now let 's imagine you translate this XML tree into a richer framework , where you have a list of objects of varying types .
An element of this list could be , say , a phone number , a memo , or an address .
If you want to get at all these things in a statically typed way , you have a problem : you do n't know what the type of each element is .
The only way you can do this in a traditional object - oriented language is have a bunch of instanceof tests , where you ask : is this element an instance of PhoneNumber , or Memo , or something else ?
And when one of those instanceof tests succeeds , you need to do a cast .
This is rather ugly and unwieldy , and pattern matching helps you there .
Pattern matching does the same thing in a much safer and more natural way .
In essence , pattern matching is essential when you have structured object graphs at which you need get from the outside , because you are n't able to add methods to these objects yourself .
And there are several situations where this is the case .
XML is one .
All sorts of parsed data fall into this category .
For example , one standard situation where pattern matching is essential is when working with abstract syntax trees in compilers .
If you do simplification of expressions , you represent these expressions as trees , and you need to get at them with pattern matching .
There are many situations like that .
And when they arise , pattern matching is truly essential .
De-constructing objects
Bill Venners :
You said a pattern looks like an expression , but it seems kind of like a backwards expression .
Instead of plugging values in and getting one result out , you put in one value , and when it matches , a bunch of values pop back out .
Martin Odersky : Yes .
It 's really the exact reversal of construction .
I can construct objects with nested constructors , and maybe I also have some parameters .
Let 's say I have a method that takes some parameters and constructs some complicated object structure from those parameters .
Pattern matching does the reverse .
It takes a complicated object structure and pulls out the parameters that were used to construct the same structure .
Two directions of extensibility
Bill Venners :
It sounds like what you 're saying is that there 's an object - oriented solution to the problem of adding new behavior that involves data inside existing objects .
Ideally you would add methods to all of those subtypes , Memo , Address , and whatever the other types of nodes are .
You would call those methods on the common supertype , and it would do dynamic binding and figure out , well , I 'm a Memo so I 'm going to do this .
But the problem you 're saying is that you can't always easily add those methods .
Martin Odersky : Yes , that 's right .
It 's a question of when can you add methods .
It 's often a question of extensibility .
Take the standard object - oriented example of a graphical user interface .
You have a lot of different components that can all do the same things .
They can display themselves .
They can be hidden .
They can be redrawn .
Things like that .
The protocol with which you interact with these components is fixed , but the number of components that you might come up with is unlimited .
Users invent new graphical user interface components all the time .
In those situations , the object - oriented approach is the right one .
It 's the only right one .
In fact , historically it's not surprising at all that the first object - oriented language was done for simulation .
That was Simula - 67 , which has a very similar usage profile .
And the second object - oriented language , Smalltalk , coincided with the development of the first practical graphical user interface .
So it was really a language that fit a problem : namely , how do I program these graphical user interfaces in an extensible way .
But that 's only one notion of extensibility .
The other notion is where the set of structures is relatively fixed .
You do n't want to change that .
But the set of operations you might want to do on those structures is open .
You want to add new operations all the time .
The typical example for that is a compiler .
Compilers work on syntax trees that represent your programs .
So long as you do n't change your language , the syntax tree will remain constant .
It will be the same tree all of the time .
But what the compiler might want to do with this syntax tree could change every day .
Tomorrow you might think of a new optimization phase that traverses over your trees .
So there again , you want to take an approach where the operations are defined outside of your trees , because otherwise everytime you want to add a new optimization or other behavior to your compiler , you have to go to every tree class you have and add a new method , which is very expensive and cumbersome .
So the right tool for the job really depends on which direction you want to extend .
If you want to extend with new data , you pick the classical object - oriented approach with virtual methods .
If you want to keep the data fixed and extend with new operations , then patterns are a much better fit .
There 's actually a design pattern — not to be confused with pattern matching — in object - oriented programming called the visitor pattern , which can represent some of the things we do with pattern matching in an object - oriented way , based on virtual method dispatch .
But in practical use the visitor pattern is very bulky .
You can't do many of the things that are very easy with pattern matching .
You end up with very heavy visitors .
And it also turns out that with modern VM technology it 's way more innefficient than pattern matching .
For both of these reasons , I think there 's a definite role for pattern matching .

The Iranian Islamic regime is in the throes of the most serious legitimacy crisis since its establishment 30 years ago .
Its handling of the crisis will not only test its ability in ensuring its continuity , it will also determine whether Iran will take a conservative modernist or liberalist modernist Islamist path of change and development or somewhere in between .
The result of the presidential election , whether rigged or not , is now less important than what it has triggered : an intensified factional power struggle within the ruling Islamist elite about the direction that Iran should take .
The conservative Islamist camp , backed by Iran 's powerful Supreme Leader , Aytollah Khamanei , and spearheaded by Ahmadenijad and an array of political , military and security forces , has a vested interested in maintaining their domination of Iran and a traditionalist path of transformation .
This camp essentially ascribes to the Jihadi or revolutionary dimension of the legacy of Ayatollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic regime following the overthrow of the Shah 's pro-Western regime in the revolution of 1978 / 79 .
It wants Iran to be a self - reliant and self - contained modern , powerful Islamic state under a pervasive and cautious Shi¹ite Islamist guardianship .
Hence its authoritarian approach to governance , perennially conservative attitude towards domestic change , and distrust of outside powers , especially the United States and some of its allies .
From their perspective , the Shah 's regime had forged close ties with the West in violation of Iran 's sovereignty and religious distinctiveness .
On the other hand , the reformist / internationalist camp , led by Ahmadenijad 's key challenger in the election , Mir Hossein Mousavi , and aided by the former liberal Islamist President Mohammad Khatami ( 1997 -2005 ) and now by the former pragmatist President Hashemi Rafsanjani , also wants an Islamist transformation of Iran .
But their vision puts less emphasis on political and social control and more stress on market economy and openness to the outside world , especially the United States .
It considers these as significant for improving the living conditions of the Iranian people , meeting some of their political demands for which they instigated the 1978/79 revolution in the first place .
Essentially , the difference between the two camps is over power , approach and style , rather than goals .
Both profess dedication to Khomeini's Islamic legacy , and want the preservation of the Islamic regime and construction of an Iran with influence in regional and world affairs .
Their leaders and most of their operatives come from a similar religious and social background .
They have jointly played a critical role during and after Khomeini , who died in 1989 , in shaping Iran to become what it is today .
True , if it were not for the dominance of the conservative camp the reformists may have been able to open up the space for a wider application of what Khatami has called ' Islamic civil society ' and ' Islamic democracy ' , with the ' dialogue of civilisations ' underpinning the conduct of Iran 's foreign relations .
But beyond this , the reformist camp could not be expected to be much more forthcoming than its conservative counterpart on any issue , including Iran 's nuclear program , which could possibly thwart Iran 's growth as a strong Islamic state .
Within this framework , both camps have managed to build up strong popular bases of support to the extent that today a majority of Iran 's 72 million population is highly polarised .
Whilst the conservative camp has secured a substantial base amongst the urban poor and rural population , the reformist camp has become popular mainly among the educated urban youth , who form more than 50 percent of Iran 's population , and the middle class in general .
The current struggle is basically an in - house one .
If it is not contained it could ultimately threaten the very existence of the Islamic regime and therefore the entire governing Islamist elite .
This may well prompt the leaders of both sides , with Khamanei acting as the final adjudicator and arbitrator , to reach some understanding sooner rather than later .
They have compromised before ; there is no reason that they can not do it again .
One outcome could be a deal under which the reformists will have a greater say , but the conservatives would wield enough power not to let the reformists ' have their cake and eat it too ' .

Great new poster for the upcoming - directed “ ” movie is online .
Check it out below .
“ The Expendables ” is about a team of mercenaries led by Barney Ross ( Stallone ) head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator .
The team consists of Lee Christmas ( ) , Bao ( ) , Gunnar Jensen ( ) , and Emanuel ( ) , who head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator .
“ The Expendables ” written and directed by Stallone and also starsand .
The action movie is due to hit theaters on April 23 , 2010 .
[ Sorry , but the poster has been removed ]
Last month , U.S. Central Command chief Gen. David Petraeus and other American military officials strongly suggested that they were ready to show the public a classified video which they said would largely vindicate a series of deadly American air strikes in western Afghanistan .
Now , a CENTCOM report on the incident has been released .
But the video is nowhere to be seen .
And the report fails to address why massively destructive one - ton bombs and airbursting munitions were used during the fight , when civilians were in the vicinity .
Secretary of State Clinton , President Obama , and other American leaders apologized after American F / A - 18 jets and a B - 1 bomber dropped munitions on suspected Taliban positions during a firefight in the village of Garani .
As many as 97 civilians may have lost their lives , according to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission .
But the U.S. military remained steadfast that the attacks on a set of Garani compounds were justified — and said that footage taken from the B - 1's weapon sight would " prove [ t ] hat the targets of these different strikes were the Taliban , " as Petraeus told NPR .
The video allegedly shows that two groups of fully - grown adults going inside the compounds targeted by the B - 1 .
Additional footage shows women and children streaming into other buildings that were not bombed .
" Are you going to release the video itself ? " NPR 's Steve Inskeep asked the general .
Petraeus answered , " We wo n't give it to you , but I believe that we will show it as part of the press briefing . "
U.S. military spokespersons also said that the armed forces were weighing the release of radio intercepts and other intelligence during that briefing , showing the " Taliban ’s deliberate planning to create a civilian casualty disaster for us . "
For weeks , the military worked to schedule that briefing , while reporters wondered what had become of the Garani evidence .
Originally , the press conference was planned for the Pentagon .
Then , in Kabul , in order to " address the results in the environment in which the incident took place — amongst the people who were affected , " a military official tells Danger Room .
" Several weeks ago , however , senior Afghani and U.S. officials indicated there was n't a desire for a press briefing in Afghanistan .
The issue had run its course , and further public discussion only served to keep alive a painful issue and a difference of opinions in terms of the numbers of civilian casualties . "
So the press roll - out never happened .
Instead , CENTCOM issued an unclassified summary of its report on Friday evening .
Neither the video nor the intercepts were included .
The " video showed elements of our operation that if the enemy were able to view it , it could be easily be used to understand our TTPs [ tactics , techniques , procedures ] , and then to adjust their TTPs , placing ground forces and civilians in jeopardy , " CENTCOM spokesman Capt .
Jack Hanzlik e-mails Danger Room .
But Marc Garlasco , a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch , questions whether security concerns were the only barriers to releasing the footage .
" It makes you wonder if the video is as strong as was indicated , " he writes Danger Room .
According to McClatchy 's Nancy Yousef , " two U.S. military officials [ said ] the video shows that no one checked to see whether any women or children were in the building before it was bombed . "
The report summary also left unanswered key questions about the Garani incident , Garlasco notes .
" While this is a huge positive step for the U.S. ... there is a lot we just do not know . "
For example , the report does n't explain why certain weapons were employed over Garani — and whether such use was appropriate .
The B - 1 dropped three GBU - 38 500 - pound bombs in an " airburst configuration . "
That means the munitions detonated in the sky , instead of on the ground .
Which would have put any nearby civilian in extreme jeopardy .
" You air burst a weapon and it spreads the blast and frag damage significantly .
It is the best way to cause collateral damage , " Garlasco notes .
CENTCOM , for it 's part , claims that " evidence collected by the investigation strongly suggests no civilians were killed in this particular air strike . "
However , CENTCOM admitted in its report that later strikes — particularly a pair of 2,000 - pound bombs , dropped late in the conflict — " may have resulted in civilian casualties " in Garani .
" Neither the ground force commander nor the B - 1B crew could confirm the presence of absence of civilians . "
Garlasco wants to know why U.S. forces were " dropping 2,000 bombs on mud huts when it looks like the battle was done ?
Why not observe and then capture the guys later ? "
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the new U.S. commander in Afghanistan , is taking a hard look at how air power is being employed .
As he hinted in his recent Senate testimony , McChrystal is looking to severely restrict bombing runs when there is even the possibility of civilians in the area .
" When we shoot into a compound , that should only be for the protection of our forces , " he recently told a group of senior officers .
" I want everyone to understand that . "
" We do n't want another Garani , " a senior military official tells the Wall Street Journal .
" The tactical gains simply do n't outweigh the costs . "

When Tabloids Go to Extremes to Get the Story Sarah Jessica Parker 's surrogate is latest victim of extreme tabloid tactics .
June 19 , 2009  --
In what appears to be a case of the tabloids going too far in pursuit of a story , two Ohio police chiefs are under investigation for plotting to break into the home of Sarah Jessica Parker 's surrogate to gather information for a tabloid .
Martins Ferry police chief Barry Carpenter and Bridgeport police chief Chad DoJack are being investigated by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation , according to press reports .
The bureau would not confirm or deny the investigation .
But Phil Wallace , the mayor of Martins Ferry , told ABCNews.com , " There is an investigation and allegations that he 's done something . "
He said the chief remains at work during the probe .
Carpenter , the Martins Ferry chief , told a local television station , " I 'm 100 percent innocent in this and my department is as well . "
Bridgeport police were unavailable for comment .
Meanwhile the expectant parents , Parker and husband Matthew Broderick , released their own statement about the incident .
" Matthew and Sarah Jessica have complete faith in the legal system .
But because it's a criminal investigation -- we will not be making any more comment , " said the statement sent to ABCNews.com .
" What I can say is the entire family looks forward to the healthy delivery of their daughters later on this summer . "
Recently Parker expressed concern about the health and safety of her surrogate , who has been hounded by tabloid reporters and paparazzi since the celebrity couple announced she was carrying their twins .
" The most unsavory things have been done , " she told " Access Hollywood . "
" She 's had her phone hacked , her personal computer information hacked , she 's had threats against her and true harassment .
...
She 's had friends threatened and family threatened and she 's had family of friends threatened .
" It keeps me up every night , " added Parker , who lives in New York City .
" It 's really incredibly upsetting to think of her so far away and me not being able to do something , beyond what I 'm legally allowed to do . "
Parker may be staying within legal limits , but the tabloids , it seems , have been going to extremes to get the scoop on their competition .
Just recently Brooke Shields took the National Enquirer to task after a reporter removed her mother , who suffers from dementia , from a New Jersey nursing home .
At the time , Shields ' lawyer threatened legal action .
" We 're considering it , " Gerald Lefcourt told ABCNews.com .
" There are potentially many claims , criminal and civil . "
Shields also had harsh words for the tabloid .
" My mother Teri Shields has been diagnosed with dementia .
For her safety , she has temporarily been in a senior living facility , a very difficult decision for me , " Shields told People magazine Friday .
" Late Thursday afternoon , I was alerted by Old Tappan Police that my mother had been signed out of the facility by two reporters of the National Enquirer … who falsely claimed they were friends of hers . "
The Enquirer and Shields reached an arrangement last week , in which the tabloid agreed to apologize and make a " generous " donation to further research on dementia .
Shields may be celebrating her victory over the tabloids , but as long as celebrity news sells , you can be sure the tabloids will doggedly pursue stories about them .
ABCNews.com looked at some other cases of tabloids crossing the line :
Farrah Fawcett
Farrah Fawcett set up a trap for the tabloids , which she called as " invasive and malignant as cancer . "
Convinced that her medical information about her cancer was being leaked by hospital employees to the tabloids , she carried out her own sting operation .
When Fawcett 's doctor told her that her cancer had returned in 2007 , she deliberately withheld the news from her friends and family in order to prove that someone from the hospital was leaking information .
" I set it up with the doctor .
I said , ' O.K. , you know and I know . '
And I knew that if it came out , it was coming from UCLA , " Fawcett told the Los Angeles Times .
" I could n't believe how fast it came out — maybe four days . "
Eventually , after months of requests , UCLA gave Fawcett 's lawyers the name of the administrative specialist who had gone through her records , the Los Angeles Times reported .
Just as the hospital moved to fire Lawanda Jackson in July 2007 , she quit , the paper said .
Prosecutors learned that the National Enquirer had paid the employee more than $ 4,600 for the actress 's medical information , beginning in 2006 .
The checks were made out to Jackson 's husband .
Jackson pleaded guilty in December to a felony charge of violating federal medical privacy laws for commercial purposes , but she died in March of cancer before she could be sentenced .
Heath Ledger
In 2008 , a former freelance reporter for People magazine blew the whistle on two tabloid photographers after they allegedly gave Heath Ledger a package of cocaine then secretly videotaped him snorting the drug .
The reporter , referred to in court papers as Jane Doe , filed a lawsuit a few months after Ledger 's death last January .
She claimed that she was the unknowing accomplice to the two photographers , Darren Banks – whom she was dating at the time – and Eric Munn , when she accompanied them in 2006 to the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles where they met Ledger .
In the suit , she accused the British - owned Splash News & Picture Agency , which the photographers worked for , of paying for the cocaine and then profiting on the video of Ledger that was shown just days after the actor 's death .
Her attorney , Douglas Johnson , told British - based The Observer at the time the lawsuit was filed , " This is bad stuff .
You do n't give drug addicts drugs so you can then tape them . "
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie
Last July after the birth of their twins , Pitt and Jolie were visited at the South France estate by two intruders .
Tabloid photographers dressed in camouflage scaled the walls of their estate at night and slipped onto the grounds in an attempt to be the first to photograph twins Vivienne Marcheline and Knox Leon .
Instead they met up with Pitt - Jolie 's armed guards .
Rubina Ali
The 9 - year - old star of " Slumdog Millionaire " was at the center of controversy stirred by a British tabloid reporter who posed as a sheik offering to buy the girl from her father , Rafiq Qureshi .
The British tabloid News of the World ran a story in April about how Qureshi agreed to sell his daughter for the equivalent of $ 400,000 to the undercover reporter , leading to an investigation by Mumbai police .
After he was questioned by police , Qureshi denied the tabloid account to reporters .
According to The Associated Press , he said he had been lured to a fancy Mumbai hotel by someone claiming they were moved by Rubina 's story and wanted to help her .
" We had gone there to meet them in good will , " he said .
" But they have made false allegations about me and tried to frame me . "
He said he was promised cash and " were talking of giving more , too , " if he gave up his daughter .
" But I refused , " he said .
The father was cleared of trying to sell her .
UPDATE : You asked , I ’ll answer .
I ’ve just learned that CBS has demanded that each existing TV show — even the hit ones — reduce their budgets for next year , if renewed .
This may mean smaller writing staffs .
Meanwhile , Hollywood has been speculating about the future of the new CBS feature division .
I ’m told , “ All systems go ” .
Not only are there no layoffs , but there are actually additions as the division heads into production .
Shooting begins April 7th on its first motion picture , a medical drama starring Harrison Ford .
And its second pic , a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez , starts principal photography in May .
The state of Rond�nia in western Brazil is one of the most deforested parts of the Amazon .
In the past three decades , clearing and degradation of the state�s original 51.4 million acres , an area slightly smaller than the state of Kansas has been deforested :
4,200 square kilometers cleared by 1978 ; 30,000 by 1988 ; and 53,300 by 1998 .
By 2003 , an estimated 67,764 square kilometers of rainforest�an area larger than the state of West Virginia �had been cleared .
By the beginning of this decade , the frontier had reached the remote northwest corner of Rond�nia .
Intact forest is deep green , while cleared areas are tan ( bare ground ) or light green ( crops , pasture , or occasionally , second - growth forest ) .
Over the span of eight years , roads and clearings pushed west - northwest from Buritis toward the Jaciparan� River .
The deforested area along the road into Nova Mamor� expanded north - northeast all the way to the BR - 346 highway .

A few days ago , I took a phone call from a friend , a woman in prison .
She is nearing the end of a lengthy sentence and she was very angry .
She said that , during her time inside , she has met dozens , possibly hundreds , of women jailed for benefit fraud .
Many cases involved relatively small amounts of money and were carried out by women in serious financial difficulties .
Women who , for instance , had continued to claim benefit while doing cash - in - hand work as cleaners , child - minders and other black economy jobs .
Again , in most cases , these women used their ill - gotten gains to feed and clothe their families , not to live the high life .
Others have been guilty of " living together " offences ( the second most popular benefit fraud ) claiming single persons benefit while living with a partner who is working .
What was the difference , my friend asked , between these women and the MPs who exploited their expenses system ?
A good question and one which has been on my mind , almost since the first day the expenses earthquake erupted .
They say it takes one to know one .
As a former thief , I also have a question to ask : why is it taking so long to instigate criminal proceedings against those allegedly involved in the worst cases ?
Without naming names – and prejudicing possible future trials – if a person knowingly claims taxpayers ' money against an expense that has expired , or been grossly exaggerated , that represents as plain a prima facie case of fraud as could be imagined .
Yet the word fraud was not mentioned in the first few day of the fuss .
Then , when the notion of criminality – as opposed to over - greedy snouts grubbing deeper into the trough – was mooted , we heard that the police were to meet with the Crown Prosecution Service to discuss the matter .
Today , the police have ruled out a broad inquiry , but say investigations may continue only in a small number of the most extreme cases .
Back to my friend in the slammer .
She says that most of the women benefit cheats she has met there were arrested and charged within days of their offences coming to light .
No lengthy conferences between plods and prosecutors to decide whether there was a case to answer , they were nicked before they knew it .
No surprise either , that so many benefit criminals end up getting caught .
Successive governments have spent millions cracking down on those fiddling the welfare system .
A national network of hotlines encourages , with cash rewards , citizens to grass a neighbour they suspect of breaking benefit rules .
( Was there a hotline in Westminster ? )
And last year 's welfare reform bill introduced telephone lie detector tests to flush out even more fiddlers .
Most benefit fraudsters plead guilty , they knew they were breaking the law but , in the extreme hardship cases , saw no alternative method of providing for their children .
The judges and magistrates who sentence such people invariably proclaim the guilty had " abused " the welfare system .
Not all first - time offenders go to prison – though some do – but for repeat abusers , jail is inevitable .
I wonder how many MPs can claim to be guilty of a singular offence ?
My friend asked what the difference was between those banged up for benefit fraud and the right honourable ladies and gentlemen who have been fleecing the system so dishonourably ?
The answer surely , in most cases , is the difference between need and greed .
UE students , alumni rally behind professors as job cuts loom
Citing their close relationships with faculty , UE students and alumni are rallying behind professors as they call for more say in governing decisions .
Where Are the 9/11 Whistleblowers ?
Answering a Common Objection to Theories That the September 11 Attacks Were an Inside Job
A 9 -11 Research PDF Essay
by Gregg Roberts , Associate Editor
Note :
Since there have actually been many whistleblowers -- just no one who credibly claims to be one of the perpetrators -- the present title is something of a misnomer .
Send suggestions for a better title to gregg ( delete this anti-spam text ) @wtc7.net .
This title does have the virtue that many people do Internet searches about 9/11 whistleblowers , so consider that in your suggestion .
Introduction
In many personal discussions I have had about 9/11 , I am often interrupted long before I can describe much of the evidence that it was an inside job , with the objection that such a large conspiracy could not have been covered up .
" Hundreds , if not thousands , of people would have to have been involved .
Someone would have talked , " as this objection has it , or in common parlance , " someone would have blown the whistle . "
This objection has also been confidently raised on various Internet discussion forums , and in some instances where anyone in the corporate or Left media has bothered to dignify the issue with a response .
Gregg Roberts is a freelance technical writer and business analyst with a bachelor 's degree in psychology , master 's - level study in social work , and earlier education in the " hard " sciences .
His history of peace and justice activism goes back 20 years , including work against US funding for Salvadoran death squads and the contra war in Nicaragua .
He has been investigating the September 11 attacks since December 2003 and has provided extensive editorial assistance to the 9 - 11 Research website family .
He is currently working with webmaster Jim Hoffman on a book based on the site .
The essay I 'm offering below provides a self - contained , easily printed review of the evidence for official complicity in 9/11 :
The immediate identification of Osama bin Laden as the " mastermind " and the almost immediate identification of all 19 alleged hijackers
Scant public evidence supporting the official account
Official statements that lack fundamental credibility , such as that a suicide attack by airliner had never been considered
The unprecedented , unexplained collapses of three steel - framed skyscrapers , allegedly due to fire , while exhibiting all the typical features of controlled demolition , or features that argue for it even more strongly
After the review , I discuss issues that bear on the likelihood of a 9/11 whistleblower coming forward , and of his or her case being widely covered in the mainstream media , including :
The history of " false - flag attacks " and other government operations that were kept secret by hundreds of people for decades
The likely number of insiders in a position to blow the whistle and their relevant personal characteristics
How the government and media have treated whistleblowers who have revealed weaknesses in the handling of national security threats , without claiming any inside knowledge of how 9/11 was carried out ( or even challenging the official story )
The motivations and concerns of whistleblowers
Attitudes and other filtering mechanisms evident in the major media I conclude that the probability of an insider coming forward and widespread coverage being afforded such a person are quite low because of the explosive nature of the issue , the risk / opportunity balance to would - be whistleblowers , and the filtering mechanisms that operate in both the corporate and Left media .

The ICFP Programming Contest has finished .
Our final score was over 4000 , and we placed seventh overall , according to the final ranking at the ICFP .
The git repository for our team , dysfunkycom is on github .
We actually managed to grab the satellites on the surface of the moon , but only sometimes , and after 2e6 seconds so it did n't count .
The changes are destructive but fun on the moon branch .
Our main problem was that we had no experience working together on the same program and a lot of time was wasted because of it .
However , Peter and I had both some experience working with other people before and we started to establish a technical rapport though it was only the second or third time we had met .
When we started at about 11 am on Saturday Tokyo time , we arrived to a great email from Paul with a fantastic VM binary system .
Seeing as this was some of the best code in our final system , it 's a real shame that Paul was too busy with other things to give us more time and the three of us were left to do the rest of the problem .
I got the visualiser up in a few hours .
Unfortunately , I got the sign of the enemy positions the wrong way round so that confused us a lot .
Peter fixed the skeleton up according to endianness and other details , and Peter and I debugged it and got it up and running about three hours after starting .
Peter wrote the submissions system .
Jianshi got the problem 1 jumper out .
Then we got stuck it and took us ages to get to problem 2 .
We were all tired out .
Finally , I bullied Jianshi's jumper into the jump time working about half an hour before the lightning round deadline .
We got a score from running the binary .
I was very excited as we would have made a decent position on the leaderboard .
But the submissions kept coming back as CRASHED .
I had broken the submissions by not zeroing out the thrusts after thrusting .
We got pretty drunk after the lightning round , figured out the problem and sent out the new submissions a few hours after the deadline .
This put us in seventh place if I remember rightly , and as we had n't actually improved the spaceflight since half an hour before the deadline , I feel rather sick about it .
On Sunday I concentrated on building up a lot of infrastructure for letting us cache the exact positions of enemy satellites in the future , caching orbit VM compilation , and running speculative simulations .
Peter wrote a fantastic submission visualiser , so you can watch the actual submission binary in the visualiser , use ( visualise - submission " file " ) .
As the problem 1 binary actually rewarded you for wasting fuel I made an orbit jumper that would actually waste as much fuel as possible .
You can see it with ( visualise - scenario 1001 : controller ' problem-1-controller -superburn ) .
Peter built an awesome ellipse solver with his linear solver and then built a great ellipse jumper which we bullied into working well but we could n't get problem 3 because we did n't have a chaser to adjust our positions to the enemy satellite .
In summary , this day was spent in reducing the technical debt and building stuff for problem 4 .
Watch the video for problem 3002 .
Monday came round and I wrote out the chaser ( using the real future position as calculated from the real VM ) and new brute force time estimator for jumping to the next satellite , and Peter got the refuel system working and started bullying the code into working for problem 4 . Jianshi tried to figure out how to get to the fuel station on the scenario with the reversed angular velocities .
I tried to get us to the moon and managed it but not collecting the satellite on the surface of the moon , as I did n't realise it was so close to the surface .
The chaser was great for problem 3 where we needed to stick with a satellite but as the problem 4 only need to get within 1 km of the satellite it was a waste of fuel , so I made a new touch chaser .
About 6 hours before the end , I rewrote the brute jumper to bisect the jump time and optimize it to the best step .
This let Peter 's system get us most satellites quite reliably .
I was so tired I nearly fell down stairs .
Then we had to move office which took about an hour , and Peter and especially Jianshi did fantastic work hand tuning the problem 4 scenarios for a good score .
Watch the video for problem 4002 .
I went on a mission to fix up the moon problem and after a bit of code bullying got the simulation and visualisation to recenter on the moon , and then saw that the target satellite was actually on it , explaining the crashes .
In the end , I actually got to safely touch the satellite on the surface of the moon by orbiting a little above it and then grabbing it when it was close .
But , unfortunately , the initial jump to get into lunar orbit was unreliable and even when it worked generally took more than 2e6 seconds so the score timelimit was up .
Maybe this could have been improved , but I stupidly did n't realise the timelimit would be a problem .
Basically , I massively screwed up the moon grabbing by not realising what the problems with it were until about half an hour before the submission deadline , so it was waste of time going for it at all .
In terms of improving :
— More planning and thought about the way we were going about solving the problem and spending a few hours to learn a little about orbital mechanics might have kept us out of some blind alleys and given us a much improved attack on problem 4 .
— Some practice working together as a team would have made us massively more efficient .
We duplicated effort and rarely got into the great state of collaboration where the work is discussed , understood , broken up and then the independently developed pieces of the solution all fall into place together .
— If we had got a good function for printing a textual description of the scenario state then maybe we would have caught the visualiser bugs and got out problem 2 faster , and also understood the moon issues more quickly .
I think this would have been really helpful for the problem 4 system as well , as we could have described the state conveniently in our debug output .
— The visualiser was worth the time spent .
But I designed it badly .
I was initially wary of mixing up the visualiser with the simulator .
I should have integrated the visualiser into the simulator more closely ( perhaps via an unobtrusive function pointer called every few steps ) so we could play problems as they were solved , not replaying traces after getting the output of the controller .
That would have sped up our development cycle significantly .
— Having the submission checker was great and maybe we should have written it before .
( Very much in hindsight perhaps . )
In conclusion , we got out reasonable submissions to all the problems so we did okay , especially as we did n't know anything about using our graphics library or orbital mechanics .
Our approach was to brute force optimal wait times to do a Hohmann transfer to the exact target satellite position from a cached run of the simulator ( this was usually suboptimal for the orbital transfer as it took a long time to wait for the jump and stabilising to a circular orbit was costly in fuel ) .
It was great fun , and many thanks to the organisers , to Starling Software for letting us use their office and to all the people on the Haskell team for sharing ideas , to MSI for the paid holiday , and finally to my great teammates .
Update 20090730 — just heard from the organisers that we made the top 10 !
Update 20090905 — updated with our final position from Liyang Hu's photo of the team rankings from the ICFP .
Update 20090919 — described many of the different teams solutions .
Excerpts From the Diary of an App Store Reviewer
Monday May 11
Examined a new e-book reader that hooks up to Project Gutenberg as a content source .
Does n’t ship with any content , but has default suggestions for “ classics ” from F. Scott Fitzgerald and Jules Verne .
Nothing dirty , though .
Spent a few minutes searching and found The Kama Sutra , which is supposed to be dirty .
Closed the office door and started reading .
Monday Afternoon
Not sure what a “ lingam ” is , but if it means what I think it means , just thinking about it is making mine swell .
Jackpot .
Rejected app for inappropriate content .
Tuesday May 12
Author of that dirty e-book app rejected yesterday complains that other e-book apps already in The Store have access to the very same edition of The Kama Sutra .
Ha .
I ’ll respond next week .
Wednesday May 13
Began examining some game submitted a week or two ago .
Slick UI , kind of fun to play .
But : one of the help screen images shows a little icon representing an iPhone .
Rejected the app with this message :

Stopped by Starbucks on way to work .
Long line .
For some reason my mind drifted to a story I saw on TV when I was a kid , about the East German Stasi and how they were the most efficient and creepiest of the Cold War spook agencies .
The KGB and CIA had empires to monitor , with major language and culture barriers .
The Stasi only had to monitor themselves , Germans .
The story was about some West German guy .
Just some regular guy , a salesman or something , with a wife and kids in the 1970s .
One day he gets pulled aside by two Stasi agents and they show him pictures they had taken of him screwing around on his wife with some woman from work .
Pictures they somehow took through a peephole in the wall of a hotel .
The show must have been from around like a year or two after the fall of the Berlin Wall and all that .
They showed some of the photos from the Stasi ’s actual file on the guy .
Pictures of him and his girlfriend arriving together at a hotel .
Pictures of his kids going to school .
I think it was “ 60 Minutes ” , but I ’m not sure .
Maybe it was “ Dateline ” .
What I do remember very clearly , though , is that the program did not actually show any of the photos the Stasi took of the guy shtupping the woman .
I remember wishing very much that they had .
Man , I ’ll bet some of those Stasi guys still have piles of those kind of photos .
I know I would .
Anyway , the thing is , the Stasi never did anything with the guy .
He knew no secrets .
They did n’t ask him to spy on his neighbors .
They just showed him the pictures , told him they ’d be watching him , and said that someday he might hear from them again .
That was it .
But that was enough .
The guy was broken .
He was like 50 or so when they interviewed him for the show , but I swear he looked like 80 , especially his eyes .
He ’d had a total breakdown .
Spent a year in the loony bin , everything .
He said what drove him mad was n’t that he thought he was still being followed , but that he realized that even if he was n’t still being followed , he would never know .
It would never end .
They said one difference between the Stasi and the KGB was that Stasi agents had individual discretion .
Tremendous discretion .
They ’d tell some agent to build up a dossier of West German informants , and that was it .
The rest was up to the agent : who he picked , how he ’d get them to flip , everything .
I always thought that sounded like a cool job , being a secret agent .
Monday May 18
The dude who wrote that game with the iPhone icon seems very upset .
Says that the iPhone image is used to explain that the user must tilt the device in order to play the game , and so how can he show this visually without using an image of an iPhone .
And he has a list of other apps already in the Store which use similar graphics .
I reply with the exact same message as last week , word for word .
Spend the rest of the day playing Flight Control .
Tuesday May 19
Wrote back to the guy with the dirty e-book reader app :
Thank you for submitting [ app name ] to the App Store .

I could read that over and over .
It ’s like the voice of a robot .
The voice of authority .
The voice of authoritative robots .
I feel a surge sending it .
I can imagine that for the developer on the other end the experience must be like that of speaking to a wall .
A monolith .
But it ’s a wall that might actually be listening .
That on the other side of the wall might be — must be , no ? — a human being , an at least reasonably smart late - 20s / early - 30s guy with a B.S. in comp sci who grew up in the same culture , shares the same interests .
Someone who in broad demographic terms is more or less exactly like him .
Someone whom he could not just relate to but reason with .
Someone who , if presented with the simple facts , would surely see the absurdity of the stated reasons behind this app ’s rejection .
Compared to most other competitive fields , it really is easier to get a fair shake in the computer industry , dominated such that it is by Spocks rather than Kirks ( if you will ) , and so the unfair shakes stand out all the more .
Like the other guy this week , the one with the game with the icon that looks like an iPhone , which , he persuasively argues , does n’t seem to even violate the cited guideline regarding Apple - owned graphic symbols and logos insofar as that he commissioned an original graphic from an icon artist , and , further , that numerous other apps already in the Store , including several which his would compete directly against , include similar representations of an iPhone .
I know this already , because I approved several of those apps myself .
I did this deliberately , knowing that if there were , say , two well - known apps available in the Store which violate this dubious ( to say the least ) interpretation of Apple ’s copyright guidelines , it would be far more satisfying to reject only the third such app than it would have been to reject all three .
Rejecting all of them , consistently , would in fact be no good at all .
The feeling of being part of the monolith — of being the monolith — really only surges when I use my position to act capriciously .
To act fairly would be to follow the rules .
To act capriciously is to be the rules .
So , yes , I can imagine what it feels like at the other side of this .
He is hoping there is someone like me reading his plea , an individual who can see the injustice and absurdity of the situation and who could , with the click of a button , make it right .
And in fact his hope is correct .
But he can’t tell , because there is never a name attached to the communication and the language used is so rigid and impersonal .
And so it feels to him like his hope is wrong , that he is just talking to a wall , that this is a very important relationship in his life and it is not going well , and in this particular very important relationship he holds none of the cards and the entity on the other side holds them all , but does not care , and worse , does not even notice .
Wednesday May 20
Began examining new Flickr client app .
Ends up it is surprisingly difficult to find pornographic content on Flickr .
Entire day wasted .
Thursday May 21
The developer of the game submitted a new version where the icon representing the iPhone has been replaced by a simple rectangle .
I reject it again on the same copyright violation grounds .
Friday May 22
Game developer writes back , arguing that it is “ just a rectangle ” and “ Apple has no copyright on rectangles ” .
He wrote , “ If anything , I ’m concerned that users wo n’t even recognize it as an iPhone . ”
I reject it again , with the following explanation :
Thank you for submitting [ app name ] to the App Store .
We ’ve reviewed [ app name ] and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it contains a graphical device representation that is not recognizable as an iPhone or iPod touch .
I should have let it sit for a week , I know , but I could n’t help myself .
From Bloomberg : Option ARMs Threaten U.S. Housing Rebound as 2011 Resets Peak
Shirley Breitmaier took out a $ 315,000 option ARM to refinance a previous loan on her house .
Her payments started at 3/8 of 1 percent , or less than $ 100 a month ...
The 73 - year - old widow may see it jump to $ 3,500 a month in two years ...
She ’ll be required to start paying principal and interest to amortize the debt when the loan reaches 145 percent of the original amount borrowed .
[ CR Note : the 145 % recast level is much higher than normal .
This is now a GMAC loan ]
...
About 1 million option ARMs are estimated to reset higher in the next four years , according to real estate data firm First American CoreLogic of Santa Ana , California .
About three quarters of those loans will adjust next year and in 2011 , with the peak coming in August 2011 when about 54,000 loans recast , the data show .
[ CR Note : recast , not reset .
This article uses the two terms interchangeably ]
...
“ The option ARM recasts will drive up the foreclosure supply , undermining the recovery in the housing market , ” [ Susan Wachter , a professor of real estate finance at the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School in Philadelphia ] said in an interview .
“ The option ARMs will be part of the reason that the path to recovery will be long and slow . ”
“ This loan is a perfect example front to back , bottom to top , of everything that has gone wrong over the last five to seven years , ” [ Cameron Pannabecker , the owner of Cal - Pro Mortgage ] said .
“ The consumer had a product pushed on them that they had no hope of understanding . ”
...
“ The problem is , real estate values went down , ” [ Peter Paul of Paul Financial , the loan orginator ] said .
And compare these two comments : I agree with Pannabecker .
And here is a repeat of the most recent reset / recast chart from Credit Suisse .
Credit Suisse is using recast dates for Option ARMs and reset dates for all other loans .
As Tanta noted : " Reset " refers to a rate change .
" Recast " refers to a payment change .
Resets are not a huge problem as long as interest rates stay low , but recasts could be significant .
There are some questions about how the Wells Fargo pick - a- pay portfolio fits into this chart , since Wells Fargo does n't expect significant recasts until 2012 ( see A Bank Is Survived by Its Loans
No flimping
Advance disclaimer : I am not a linguist , have never studied linguistics , and am sure to get some of the details wrong in this article .
Caveat lector .
There is a standard example in linguistics that is attached to the word " flimp " .
The idea it labels is that certain grammatical operations are restricted in the way they behave , and cannot reach deeply into grammatical structures and rearrange them .
For instance , you can ask " What did you use to see the girl on the hill in the blue dress ? " and I can reply " I used a telescope to see the girl on the hill in the blue dress " .
Here " the girl on the hill in the blue dress " is operating as a single component , which could , in principle , be arbitrarily long .
( " The girl on the hill that was fought over in the war between the two countries that have been at war since the time your mother saw that monkey climb the steeple of the church ... " )
This component can be extracted whole from one sentence and made the object of a new sentence , or the subject of some other sentence .
But certain other structures are not transportable .
For example , in " Bill left all his money to Fred and someone " , one can reach down as far as " Fred and someone " and ask " What did Bill leave to Fred and someone ? " but one cannot reach all the way down to " someone " and ask " Who did Bill leave all his money to Fred and " ?
Under certain linguistic theories of syntax , analogous constraints rule out the existence of certain words .
" Flimped " is the hypothetical nonexistent word which , under these theories , cannot exist .
To flimp is to kiss a girl who is allergic to .
For example , to flimp coconuts is to kiss a girl who is allergic to coconuts .
( The grammatical failure in the last sentence but one illustrates the syntactic problem that supposedly rules out the word " flimped " .
I am not making this up ; for more details ( from someone who , unlike me , may know what he is talking about ) See Word meaning and Montague grammar by David Dowty , p. 236 .
Dowty cites the earlier sources , from 1969 – 1973 who proposed this theory in the first place .
The " flimped " example above is exactly the same as Dowty's , and I believe it is the standard one .
Dowty provides a similar , but different example : there is not , and under this theory there cannot be , a verb " to thork " which means " to lend your uncle and " , so that " John thorked Harry ten dollars " would mean " John lent his uncle and Harry ten dollars " .
I had these examples knocking around in my head for many years .
I used to work for the University of Pennsylvania Computer and Information Sciences department , and from my frequent contacts with various cognitive - science types I acquired a lot of odds and ends of linguistic and computational folklore .
Michael Niv told me this one sometime around 1992 .
The " flimp " thing rattled around my head , surfacing every few months or so , until last week , when I thought of a counterexample : Wank .
The verb " to wank to " means " to rub one 's genitals while considering " , and so seems to provide a countexample to the theory that says that verbs of this type are illegal in English .
When I went to investigate , I found that the theory had pretty much been refuted anyway .
The Dowty book ( published 1979 ) produced another example : " to cuckold " is " to have sexual intercourse with the woman who is married to " .
Some Reddit person recently complained that one of my blog posts had no point .

The carriers will be the Royal Navy 's largest vessels A £ 1bn cost over - run is threatening the future of the publicly - funded project to build Britain 's biggest aircraft carriers , the BBC has learnt .
A memorandum from the lead contractors seen by the BBC suggests there will " be a fight for the programme 's survival " .
The memo also discusses ways to cut costs , including the possibility of 400 to 500 redundancies .
The Ministry of Defence said it was currently re-costing the programme and accounts would be published in July .
Work on the two warships - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales - had been delayed in December but was due to begin soon .
This massive inflation in costs will be widely seen as alarming
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog
They were due to come into service in 2014 and 2016 , as the biggest and most powerful warships the UK has ever built .
Much of the work is due to take place at Scottish shipyards on the Clyde , where 4,000 jobs are dependent on the project .
Costs to soar
The project 's cost is now expected to rise from £ 3.9 bn to around £ 5 bn .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The memo was written for the chief executives of the companies participating in the project and attributed the cost increase to " a combination of direct costs , inflation and accounting adjustments " .
" The MOD [ Ministry of Defence ] will publish its annual report and accounts in July ; these will show £ 1bn of QE Class cost growth and the project will come under severe pressure through the opposition and the media , " the memo said .
" This is a very real fight for the programme 's survival , " it adds .
The memo also suggests the future of the Appledore shipyard in Devon could be under threat and possible measures to reduce costs include " substantial redundancies " of the order of 400 to 500 .
HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH AND HMS PRINCE OF WALES Displacement : 65,000 tonnes Length : 280 m ( 920 ft )
Width ( at flight - deck level ) : 70 m ( 230 ft ) Keel to masthead : 56 m ( 184ft ) Nine decks ( plus flight deck ) Speed : 25 + knots Range : 8,000 - 10,000 miles Aircraft : 36 F - 35 Joint Strike Fighters and four Airborne Early Warning aircraft , plus EH 101 Merlin helicopters Crew : 1,450 ( including air crew )
Weapons : Phalanx close - in weapon systems ; 30 mm and mini-guns Source : Ministry of Defence The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said the increase in costs would be seen as alarming , especially at a time when there are intense pressures on the government to cut public spending .
He added that if the project was scrapped , the knock - on effects would be serious .
For example , some 80,000 tonnes of steel worth £ 65 m has been ordered from Corus , the beleaguered Anglo - Dutch steelmaker .
A consortium of companies are involved in the project including BAE System , VT Group , Babcock and Thales .
BAE Systems said that the delay to the project announced earlier was always expected to lead to an increase in costs .
The work is split between various yards , including Portsmouth , Rosyth , and Hebburn .

Little Leaguer Hits Coach In The Head With Line Drive : Video
This Little League coach was just trying to help this kid out with a nice fat pitch that he could drive up the middle .
He was successful , as the kid drilled a line drive right back at his head .
The kid standing next to the pitcher must be disappointed that this coach ’s fat head got in the way of what could have been a stellar defensive play .

A couple of days ago , I completed my regular check of seeing where my web and blog sites were in the Google page - ranking , number of backlinks , and where they get listed in the Google search pages for particular keyword phrases .
For one of my sites , www.thedigitalarchices.com, I had to look twice !
Was I wearing my glasses ?
Something wrong with my eyesight !
There it was in plain daylight a Google page rank 3 !
But … but … but … the site is only 3 weeks old !
My immediate thoughts : they have made a mistake .
It ’s not April Fools , it is ?
Google would n’t do that would they after all who are we in Googleland ?
I contacted my partner for this particular website .
She could n’t believe it , either !
“ Wonder if it ’s a record ? ” she said .
Just 4 weeks ago , a good friend of mine , Anja Merret ( www.pinkblocks.com fame ) got together and came up with an idea to combine our key skills .
You see , I am not a brilliant writer , whereas Anja is .
And Anja is not at all Internet technical , where as I am .
We had worked together for a while before this though .
I asked Anja to write some blog postings for me and in return I built and updated her blog sites .
It worked well .
It also meant that we were using our key strengths and I could concentrate and use my time on making my own products .
So , as I said , 4 weeks ago we came up with the idea of combining our skills and start offering an Article Writing Service for people like me !
Using Skype messaging , we decided upon the game plan , the process , the products and the website name , www.thedigitalarchives.com.
Within a few days we were ready to knuckle down and start working .
The design , the sales pages , the offers , the prices , the products , the traffic plan were brainstormed and put together in a short period .
Anja writing and writing and writing .
And me , creating websites and backlinks .
And the results , 3 weeks later :
Google Page Rank 3
500 backlinks
Not bad , eh !

The Cisco VPN client , vpnc , enables your Linux workstation to connect to a Cisco 3000 series VPN concentrator PIX firewall .
Until vpnc existed , corporate employees were often relegated to connecting to their company 's network via a Windows machine or with Cisco 's problematic VPN client for Linux .
Thankfully , those days are over , but not without slight configuration effort .
In this article we show you how to get it up and running .
Information You Will Need
Before you can connect , you will likely need to know the following information .
If you do not have it , now is a good time to gather :
IPSEC gateway : the hostname or IP of the VPN server
the hostname or IP of the VPN server IPSEC ID : the groupname
the groupname IPSEC secret : the shared password for the group
the shared password for the group your username
your password
The group name and shared password is the most often used method for connecting to the Cisco IPSEC VPN .
In lieu of certificates , this pre-shared key enables the forming of an IPSEC tunnel based on the shared secret .
Install Options
Depending on your Linux distribution , you will need to install the vpnc program before we can begin .
Fedora , by default , now installs vpnc , so Fedora users can skip to the next section .
Ubuntu users can run apt - get install vpnc as root .
You will likely want to use NetworkManager to enable quick VPN connections with a mouse - click in GNOME .
Fedora 's NetworkManager is already prepared , but in Ubuntu you will need to install the network - manager - vpnc package .
Configuring vpnc Manually
If you are short on time , or the " just make it work " type , this section is optional , so feel free to skip ahead to the NetworkManager section below .
Now that vpnc is installed , you will notice an /etc / vpnc / directory .
This is where we will be working for a bit .
Creating a configuration file is optional , but without it , you will enter all the necessary information manually every time you wish to connect to the VPN .
If you wish to test your IP , group information , and user credentials , go ahead and manually run ' vpnc ' as root .
The configuration file for vpnc is quite simple .
Create a file named after the network you wish to connect to , for example : /etc/vpnc/enp.conf
Inside , you need to enter the information we talked about in the beginning of this article .
Replace the example values with your information :
IPSec gateway : vpn17.example.com
: vpn17.example.com IPSec ID : groupa
: groupa IPSec secret : groupapassword
: groupapassword Xauth username : charlie
: charlie Xauth password : passw0rd
Except , the group password needs to be decoded before handing it to vpnc .
This is the major pain point for most users , and vpnc should automatically do this , but it does not .
Enter the group password you were given by the VPN administrator into this Web page , and use the result as your group password : http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode.
If you enter your username and password into the configuration file , ensure the permissions do not allow world - read access , especially if other user accounts exist on your workstation or laptop .
In fact , you should think twice about storing this password at all , just in case your machine is ever compromised .
If your password is not stored in the configuration file , you will be prompted for it when connecting .
Connecting and Disconnecting
Now that the configuration file exists , you can simply run sudo vpnc enp.conf ( or leave off the .conf ) .
You will now be connected to the VPN .
If everything worked , and you will notice a new ' tun ' interface in the ' ifconfig ' output .
To disconnect from the VPN , simply run sudo vpnc-disconnect
Do note that the default route gets replaced with the VPN router ( so all traffic goes through the VPN ) when you are connected .
See the vpnc man page for help changing this behavior , or simply remember to disconnect from the VPN when you are done .
Pro Tip : if you have established SSH connections , they will drop when you connect to the VPN .
To avoid this , do not let vpnc change your default route .
Configure vpnc to add just the routes to the networks you wish to access via the VPN , ensuring you specify tun0 as the interface .
All your normal traffic will survive VPN connects and disconnects , including your existing SSH sessions ( assuming they are not to IPs within the range of the VPN network ) .
Using NetworkManager
To create a new VPN connection using GNOME 's NetworkManager , click the network icon in the upper - right hand corner of the screen , then select VPN Connections -> Configure VPN .
Click " Add " to create a new VPN connection .
If the NetworkManager vpnc plug - in is installed , you will be able to select the Cisco VPN option .
The next screen will require that you enter the above mentioned information for the VPN connection .
The GUI also presents you with the option to save your password .
After you click Apply , you 're done .
To connect to the VPN , simply select the VPN name you entered via the NetworkManager Gnome applet under VPN Connections , and it will connect automatically .
Google Docs , a hosted suite of office productivity applications , still has a ways to go in its development , but users can expect dramatic changes in the next 12 months .
So said Dave Girouard , president of Google 's Enterprise unit , at the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch 2009 U.S. Technology Conference on Thursday .
After acknowledging that Google has " a lot of work to do " to improve Docs , and that the suite is n't yet a " full on " replacement for Microsoft Office , nor the open - source OpenOffice , Girouard said big improvements are coming .
" In a year , those products will be night and day from what they are today , " he said , referring to the word - processing , spreadsheet and presentation software in Docs .
While Google has always acknowledged that Docs does n't match all of the Microsoft Office features , it also has pointed out that , as Web - hosted software , it offers collaboration capabilities its PC - based competitor can't .
Girouard was n't specific about what Docs features need to improve , but his comments sounded like a general acknowledgement that , even with its collaboration advantages , Docs has to improve its user experience to get people to view it as a more credible alternative to other office suites .
Girouard , whose presentation was webcast , said that Gmail and Calendar are much more mature products and thus drive the decisions of most businesses to adopt the Apps collaboration and communication suite , which also includes Docs .
Apps customers will also see more effort by Google to attract enterprise developers to its App Engine hosted application development environment , which recently gained Java support and became generally available , after a period of limited release .
Google will also continue enhancing the Gmail and Calendar components with improvements aimed at CIOs and IT managers , including the upcoming Apps Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server , he said .
Ironically , the economic downturn and the ensuing reductions in IT budgets have caused a spike in interest in the Premier version of Apps , which can cost between five and 20 times less than Microsoft 's Office and Exchange , he said .
Apps Premier costs US $ 50 per user , per year and , as the most sophisticated version of the suite , is geared toward businesses with more than 50 end - users , which is the maximum for the Standard version , which carries ads in Gmail and is free .
There is also a free Education edition designed for schools and universities .
Most Apps users are small businesses .
While happy with the gradual but steady growth of Apps ' adoption by large enterprises , Girouard acknowledged that security concerns about Web - hosted software remain a big obstacle .
" We 're very early in this thing and most CIOs are still scared to death with the idea of their data being outside of their firewall in someone else 's data centers , " said Girouard , who answered questions from a financial analyst and from audience members .
Google maintains that those concerns are unwarranted , saying data is more secure in one of its data centers than in an organization 's data center .
Another challenge for Apps ' adoption is CIOs ' reluctance to change software that tens of thousands of employees use , Girouard said .
" The thought of moving 50,000 end - users to an entirely new experience for something they use every day is very daunting , " he said .
Every few weeks , a large enterprise with 10,000 end -users or more migrates to Apps , and every time that happens , momentum continues to build , as well as confidence in the suite itself , as well as in the SaaS ( software - as - a - service ) model , he said .
One thing that does n't help CIOs understand SaaS specifically and cloud computing in general is the sudden appropriation of the terms by myriad vendors in order to benefit their marketing efforts , he said .
" It 's interesting that everybody is in cloud computing now .
In most cases , I view it as a re-labeling of what they were doing five years ago , " he said .
Girouard has a particular beef with the term " private clouds " to refer to customer data centers that have been optimized through the use of virtualization technology .
" By no means would I describe that as cloud computing .
I 'd call that more efficient data centers and getting more out of the servers you buy , " he said .
Among the few vendors doing true cloud computing at scale are Google , Salesforce.com and Amazon.com , he said .
" If you 're still selling large up - front buildouts of X , Y or Z , regardless of what virtualization is involved , that 's not in my mind cloud computing , " he said .
Google 's Enterprise unit generates " a few hundred million dollars " in revenue , is profitable and is growing , Girouard said .
Its revenue is just a small fraction of Google 's total revenue , which mostly comes from online advertising , but growing that percentage is n't his focus .
" I 'm not competing with the rest of Google .
I 'm looking to build a very large business over a long period of time , " he said .
The opportunities in IT enterprise search and Web - hosted business software are big .
" We can be a first - tier player in IT , " he said .
" We 're not driving Google 's top or bottom line in 2009 , and probably not in 2010 , for that matter .
Having said that , we can grow for many years in this business and build a very large business over time , " he said .

The men were roommates in Philadelphia , and Young was moving to Phoenix .
Early Thursday , Milledge , who works at Philadelphia International Airport , got a piece of his roommate 's carry - on luggage to the boarding gate without going through security , the FBI said .
Young , meanwhile , took a similar bag through security .
The men switched bags at the gate - Young taking the one containing a 9 mm pistol .
Another passenger noticed the switch and raised concerns , and Flight 1195 was stopped and searched .
Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - AL ) likes the fact that Barack Obama is a better listener than Dubya , but says
“ Some of the men and women I work with in Congress are socialists . ”
Asked to clarify his comments after the breakfast speech at the Trussville Civic Center , Bachus said 17 members of the U.S. House are socialists .
Not 16 , not 18 .
17 .
Which raises a number of questions and concerns .
1 : It ’s a certainty than Bachus does n’t know what the word “ socialist ” means .
I say this for a couple of reasons .
First , I do know what it means , and if there are 17 of them on the Hill I ’ll personally polish Bachus ’s entire collection of Dukes of Hazzard memorabilia with my satiny - smooth nutsack .
Second , Bachus holds degrees from both Auburn and Alabama , schools that are most assuredly not known for the heated rivalry between their debate teams .
What he probably means by “ socialist , ” a word that dumb politicians have used a great deal in recent months when addressing even dumber audiences , is “ someone who is politically to the left of Newt Gingrich .
2 : However , even once we understand that Bachus is merely doing what politicians of a certain stripe do – that is , using highly charged but little understood terms as a cynical tool for whipping the hillbillies into a lather – it ’s not clear that the tactic will be as successful as it once might have been .
Why , you ask ?
Because in a recent poll only 53 % felt that capitalism was better than socialism .
Sweet fancy tap - dancing Lenin – what has Amerika come to ?
3 : It ’s a certainty that the people polled do n’t know what the word “ socialist ” means .
Many probably think it means “ not George Bush , ” although if that were uniformly the cash the pro-socialist numbers should be higher .
So there must be other factors at work .
This is where I remind you that the US “ educational ” system is barely capable of teaching people how to use string .
Helping the average student ( whose eyes begin glazing over when a message exceeds 160 characters , counting spaces ) understand the subtle differences between capitalism , socialism , communism , libertarianism , Zoroastrianism , Mercerism , and pulmonary embolism is like trying to teach meditation to a gerbil on angel dust .
It ’s easy to see why Bachus would want to emulate the late , great Sen .
Joe McCarthy – after all , the guy was an American hero .
But Rep. Bachus is no Joe McCarthy .
On the other hand , no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people .

Ten Terrific Plants with Chartreuse Flowers
Chartreuse , or lime green , is a color that has always appeals to me and so I am drawn to plants that have either chartreuse flowers or chartreuse leaves .
Chartreuse stands out any place and goes with almost every other color so it is easy to use in the garden .
I have written on some of my favorite plants with chartreuse foliage and now I turn to plants with chartreuse flowers .
I have chosen plants of various types and that bloom at different times so that if you like chartreuse flowers you can enjoy them for as long as possible during the gardening season .
In winter , Lenten Rose ( Helleborus orientalis ) blooms with its simple flowers set off by its handsome foliage even when snow covers the ground .
Not all plants of this species have green flowers so you might want to try stinking hellebore ( Helleborus foetidus ) which more reliably has chartreuse flowers but blooms considerably later .
During the spring , snowball viburnum ( V. macrocephala ) present chartreuse heads of flowers that slowly change to white .
A bush covered with lime green flower heads is a magnificent sight !
These flower heads are prized by florists and used extensively in spring bridal work and you may have appreciated them in that role .
Late spring brings the fluffy heads of lady ’s mantle ’s ( Alcmillea mollis ) flowers billowing over soft gray - green foliage .
As beautiful as the color of the flowers is , the plants are worth growing for their foliage alone so this is really a two for one deal .
Stems of Lady ’s Mantle flowers are beautiful in arrangements as well as being a knock out in the garden .
As spring turns into summer cushion spurge ( Eurphobia x martini ‘ Tiny Tim ’ ) produces unusual flowers that are conspicuous because of their chartreuse bracts .
These 12 ” compact , mound forming plants provide color all summer and are handsome at the front of the border .
The hydrangea ( H. paniculata ) ‘ Limelight ’ is a popular shrub with large bushy panicles of chartreuse flowers that slowly change from white to pink and end up burgundy in the fall .
The green color is best in cooler climates but the plant does well in zones 3 - 8 , growing about 6 ′ - 8 ′ tall .
Heads can be dried for winter use .
The green variety of the annual love - lies - bleeding ( Amaranthus viridflora ) is a show stopper !
Its long tassels of tiny chartreuse flowers are like no other .
The plant is quite large and course but the tassels of great assets in the garden , and in arrangements .
This plant has a special place in my heart because I won the admiration of all my coworkers when I showed up at a florist ’s dinner wearing a corsage featuring its flowering tassels .
This is another flower that dries well for fall arrangements .
Another annual with chartreuse flowers zinnia ( Z. elegans ) ‘ Green Envy .
Like many chartreuse flowers , the best color is developed if the plants are grown in partial shade especially where summers are hot .
The 2 ” wide flowers are carried on tall stems up to 30 ” in length and are lovely in arrangements .
The 3 ” wide flowers of perennial coneflower ( Echinacea purpurea ) ‘ Coconut Lime ’ has a brownish - gold cone surrounded by frilled chartreuse petals ringed with backward swept white petals .
Definitely an odd look and maybe not chartreuse enough as the dominant color is white .
The summer blooming bulb Gladiolus ‘ Green Star ’ sends up tall stem ( up to 60 ” ) full of beautiful chartreuse flowers .
It blooms from mid-summer until frost and begins blooming 60 - 100 days after planting .
Glads are always popular as cut flowers providing both height and a spike - like form .
You get a lot o bang for your buck with glads .
Autumn stonecrop ( Sedum ‘ Citrus Twist ’ ) offers good foliage as well as attractive flowers .
It forms bush mounds of waxy green leaves flushed with purple early in the season and 18 ” stems with large colorful heads of chartreuse flowers late in the season .
The flowers attracts butterflies and produce seed heads that give winter interest .
There are many flowers that have a touch of chartreuse or various shades of green .
Others may have chartreuse only at certain times of their development or under certain conditions .
Regardless , flowers with this wonderful color are always useful and fun to have in the garden .
If you do n’t have any , try some ; maybe just one this summer .
You like them .
If you like chartreuse flowers you might like plants with chartreuse foliage .

Lamentable final a la huelga minera en El Cubo
Raúl Calvo Trenado / Ilustración Juan Kalvellido
Después de 46 largos días , los obreros de la mina El Cubo , propiedad de la empresa canadiense Gammol Old aceptaron regresar a la misma bajo unas condiciones leoninas : jornadas de trabajo de 10 horas diarias durante 15 días consecutivos por cinco de descanso y un incremento del salario del 8 % directo y un 3 % en prestaciones .
En efecto , los más de 300 adscritos a la Sección 142 del Sindicato Minero del Cubo decidieron en su mayoría aceptar la propuesta patronal y levantar el paro laboral que ha durado desde el 29 de abril hasta el 16 de junio .
Antes , cuando se perdía una huelga todo era posible pero en la actualidad , increíblemente , aún ganándola acaba uno jodido ... ¿ Charrismo sindical ?
¿ Mineros que se rajaron ?
¿ O que les ganó el hambre ?
En la Constitución Mexicana , artículo 123 leemos : " La duración de la jornada máxima será de ocho horas " y " Por cada seis días de trabajo deberá disfrutar el operario de un día de descanso , cuando menos " .
Dicho en román paladino : se han pasado los derechos constitucionales por el forro de la entrepierna .
Eso sí , hay promesas bonitas : mantenimiento del equipo y herramientas en condiciones adecuadas ( ¿o sea que no lo están ? ) , etc .
¿ Qué es peor , el acuerdo propuesto por la empresa o que los mineros acepten partirse el lomo durante 10 horas seguidas 15 días sin descanso ?
¡ Y luego se sorprende la burguesía cuando en algunas ocasiones a lo largo de la Historia , estos agarran la dinamita de los pozos y realizan huelgas no tan pacíficas !
Says the president of an online MJ community ...
12 Michael Jackson fans have reportedly commit suicide in the wake of The King of Pop 's sudden death last Thursday .
Sky News quotes Gary Taylor , the head of the world 's biggest Michael Jackson online fan club MJJcommunity.com , who says some fans can't cope with the news of the singer 's death .
He said : " I know there has been an increase ( in deaths ) , I now believe the figure is 12 .
It is a serious situation that these people are going through but Michael Jackson would never want this .
He would want them to live .
” Taylor continued : " They can't accept it , they feel in some sort of different reality .
“ I 'm stunned that he 's dead .
One minute he is coming here for concerts and the next he is gone .
“ I think the funeral will be where the reality kicks in that he is gone and wo n't be coming back , there will be a huge depression in the fan community when that happens .
"
The music legend 's close friend , Reverend Jesse Jackson , has also expressed his fears about the mental state of Michael 's loyal fans saying they must pull together instead of taking their lives .
He urged : " This is a time when hearts are heavy .
There is great pain but great cause to celebrate Michael 's life .
It made Michael happy saying ' We Are The World ' .
Do n't self destruct .
" We fall down sometimes , we get back up .
That 's the right thing to do .
In Michael 's name let 's live together as brothers and sisters and not die apart as fools . "
Michael Jackson fans pay vigil to the King of Pop :
When Google representatives recently invited dozens of prominent artists to contribute work to be featured on its new Web browser , the company enthusiastically sold the idea as an opportunity to have artwork shown to millions .
But some , like Gary Taxali , were not impressed .
Mr. Taxali , an illustrator based in Toronto whose work has appeared in publications like Time , Newsweek and Fortune , received a call in April from a member of Google ’s marketing department .
According to Mr. Taxali , the Google representative explained that the project will let users customize Google Chrome pages with artist - designed “ skins ” in their borders .
“ The first question I asked , ” Mr. Taxali said in a recent interview , “ is ‘ What ’s the fee ? ’ ”
Mr. Taxali said that when he was told Google would pay nothing , he declined .
In the ensuing weeks , a tide of indignation toward Google swelled among illustrators , who stay connected through Drawger , a Web site .
Allow ’s check out a couple of reasons many people think saving cash is a hard thing to do .
Saving money for many individuals is a difficult task .
Possibly it ’s because they feel they do n’t make enough money to save yet most of the moment it is merely due to the fact that they have never been taught the correct methods to conserve cash .
If saving money were a straightforward mechanical act , it would most likely be very easy , however no one can state that there are not psychological problems involved when it comes to saving cash .
Nevertheless , the amount of times have you heard the stats concerning reasons for marriage rivalry , with money concerns being among the leading concerns .
The list can continue with reasons for not conserving cash such as family members emergencies , job discharges , legal actions , disease , unimportant costs , you call it .
Nonetheless , most of these scenarios are momentary and also can certainly be a set back in a saving money strategy yet need to not lead you far from a normal saving behavior .
That is the key to making this job , by developing a practice .
Once something comes to be a practice , it ends up being much easier .
Going also beyond that is making it automatic .
That is where you do not also have to think of it and saving money will get done whether you act or otherwise .
Short term vs. long term saving cash strategies .
The majority of us know it is smart to conserve money for those big - ticket things we really wish to buy such as a brand - new tv or vehicle or house .
These would be considered short term conserving goals .
Establishing objectives for all kinds of saving is an important tool for achieving success .
So much money is squandered by the spontaneous getting behaviors much of us use to acquire products .
By intending as well as establishing an objective , we can take advantage of purchasing items , most that we do not need to have right now , in a lot more intelligent fashion .
We can do even more research study concerning which product may be much more fit to our individual situations .
This additionally enables us to time our purchase to benefit from seasonal clearances , liquidate versions , or tax free vacation durations that lots of states have instituted today , thus recognizing large discounts off the cost .
By going for having the cash conserved by a specific day to capitalize on these types of expense savings , we are more probable to adhere to our objective of saving the cash to spend for these purchases .
Long - term prepare for saving money are largely for our retirement desires .
This is without a doubt the most essential conserving goal we can establish as well as a lot of thought and also attention requires to go into establishing a solid strategy to make this work .
We require to analyze what types of programs are available under our circumstances such as company funded strategies or if you are freelance the options offered for businesses .
In this kind of cash cost savings strategy , it is practically vital that an automatic withdrawal and also down payment type circumstance is established so as to make it simple and easy and also regular .
By doing this we adjust our spending around what is left as well as we find out to reside on that amount without much effort .
Establish your conserving money plans and stick to them .
Whether it is your short - term or long - term conserving money objectives , you require to have a plan for completing those objectives .
The short - term strategies could be as basic as tossing your spare adjustment in a container in the house or taking all the solitary dollar bills in your pocket at the end of every day as well as putting them in the bank each month in an interest - bearing account .
The long - term money saving goals nevertheless require a much more sophisticated strategy as well as require to be combined with an investment program that will certainly give the necessary returns on your possessions to fulfill those retirement goals .
I have actually created both a financial savings and also financial investment program that is targeted for nearly any individual who wants to have the ability to understand a constant above typical return on there cash and also still regulate the risk degree .
The cost savings part of the program can even help you locate money to conserve .
Additionally , since most people are really hectic today with work and also family members concerns , and do n’t have time to invest having a tendency to their investment program , the reality that this program only requires a yearly check up as well as minor adjustment fits most individuals to a tee .
Take a look at the link listed below .
Get a couple of 3X5 cards , make a note of both those short and long term cash conserving objectives , and cost full speed ahead to see to it you establish the habits and the plans to make all your dreams happen .
Some Christianist nutjob in the Oklahoma legislature is up to her old tricks again :
Last year , Oklahoma state legislator Sally Kern ( R ) drew well - deserved criticism for an outlandish rant against the gay community , in which she compared homosexuality to “ toe cancer ” and said “ it ’s the biggest threat our nation has , even more so than terrorism or Islam . ”
“ Studies show that no society that has totally embraced homosexuality has lasted more than , you know , a few decades .
So it ’s the death knell of this country . ”
Though activists responded to her comments with protests , Oklahoma conservatives rallied around her , saying that they “ stand with and support Sally . ”
Now , Kern is back , once again sparking controversy for her attacks on the LGBT community .
Kern is now pushing a “ Oklahoma Citizen ’s Proclamation for Morality ” that blames America ’s “ economic woes ” on “ abortion , pornography , same sex marriage , sex trafficking , divorce , illegitimate births , child abuse , and many other forms of debauchery ” :
The U.S. Secret Service is asking for $ 34 million to help upgrade its communication system , and says that without the money the president 's life could be in danger , according to a news report .
The agency says that its communication system is incompatible with the White House communication system , resulting in a " dangerous gap " that could " prevent the attainment of the performance target of 100 percent protection . "
The statements appeared in a 2010 budget request , submitted to Congress this month , according to ABC News .
According to the request , the agency 's " degraded " networks and software are " adversely impacting critical operational missions " and could thwart agents communicating in an emergency .
" USSS ' protective and investigative missions will be functionally unable to respond to the increasing volume of threats without additional investment , " the budget request says .
The agency also indicated that without the multi-million - dollar upgrade , its system was vulnerable to hacker attacks .
A spokesman for the agency told ABC News that the agency is n't currently at risk " at this time . "
" Despite the challenges we are currently facing with an aging IT infrastructure , this will not interfere with our ability to carry out our protective and investigative missions at this time , " the spokesman said .
But in testimony to Congress in March ( .pdf ) , Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said that " the agency 's IT and other mission critical infrastructure cannot sustain the tempo of current operations . "
Sullivan also noted that the agency flunked an NSA security audit last year that was intended to detect intrusions and vulnerabilities .
" While the NSA findings are classified , I can tell you that the results were chilling , " Sullivan testified .
Everyone knows that the purpose of fingerprints is to increase friction and therefore improve our grip .
New research calls this common belief into question – sort of .
The media , and it seems the researchers themselves ( if they are being presented accurately ) are presenting this as scientific evidence debunking a myth – but the real story is more complex .
Dr. Roland Ennos did a number of experiments looking at the friction between a finger pad and a plate of glass .
He found that the friction did not increase by much when the force between the finger and glass increased – less than predicted .
However , the friction did increase in proportion to the surface area of the finger pad that was in contact with the glass .
This means that finger pad skin behaves more like rubber – where friction is mainly a function of surface area , not the force of contact .
What this further means is that the ridges of fingerprints actually decrease the surface area of contact , and therefore decrease friction – rather than increase it , as was expected .
That ’s interesting , and certainly counter - intuitive .
However , that is not the whole story , and it does not mean that fingerprints are not useful for grip .
Ennos only studied smooth surfaces , and it is possible that fingerprints may increase grip with rough surfaces .
Other hypotheses are that fingerprints increase grip when wet – the channels allow for water to be carried away from the finger pads .
Or that they increase sensitivity .
What struck me , and what the article did not mention , is that glass is a very artificial material .
It is unlikely that our ancestors would have encountered such smooth material often in their day - to - day lives .
Therefore there would not have been much selective pressure to develop a good grip on glass or similarly smooth material .
Tree branches , rocks , fur , bones , and other materials that might find their way into the grasp of a hominid or ape are much rougher than glass .
Clearly follow up research is needed .
How do fingerprints behave when applied to other materials , and how does wetness affect their utility ?
What interested me most about this story is how the media channels science news stories into a few themes with which they feel comfortable .
Debunking a commonly held myth is one of those themes .
While this story hold a kernel of that theme – it is more accurate to say , in my opinion , not that the grip hypothesis is wrong but that the story is more complex .
That is a much more useful theme for science reporting – because the story is almost always more complex – more complex than the typical publish understanding , and even of our previous scientific understanding .
Likewise , it is more meaningful in many cases to portray our prior models and theories not as “ wrong ” but as incomplete .
Sometimes they are wrong , but that needs to be distinguished from ideas that are oversimplified and therefore incomplete , but not wrong .
A recent relevant example of this is the New Scientist article on Darwin ’s tree of life .
The theme of the reporting , boldly declared in the headline , was that the tree of life is wrong – a debunked idea .
This was greatly misleading , however , and lead to a misunderstanding and a great deal of mischief at the hands of the boobs over at the Discovery Institute .
The evolutionary tree of life is the basic concept that all life on earth is related through common ancestry and branching descent .
This pattern includes only “ vertical ” genetic transfer – from parent to child .
What the New Scientist article was discussing was emerging information about the extent of horizontal gene transfer – such as the swapping of genes between strains of bacteria .
It turns out there is much more horizontal transfer , even among vertebrates , than was previously known .
Viruses , for example , may act as vectors for carrying genes from one species to another .
This information , however , does not invalidate the tree of life .
Horizontal transfer may be greater than previously known , but it is still a minor factor compared to the branching descent that dominates the tree of life , especially for multi-celled organisms .
The tree of life is not wrong – it is still mostly correct .
It is as correct as saying that the Earth is a sphere .
The spherical Earth theory is very useful , correct for most purposes , and is sufficient for working with other theories , such as gravity and plate tectonics .
But it is not completely accurate – the Earth is really an oblate spheroid and slightly larger in the Southern hemisphere .
Similarly , the tree of life is true enough , and supports the underlying theory of evolution , and is sufficient for most purposes .
But it needs to be tweaked with an understanding of the contribution of horizontal transfer .
Saying the tree of life is “ wrong ” is to profoundly misunderstand the science , which the ID goons happily did .
And New Scientist was lambasted for this botching of science reporting , as they should have been .
The difference between wrong and incomplete is very important to the proper understanding of the history and progress of science .
I wish the science reporting media would getter a better “ grip ” on this idea ( hey , I had to bring it home somehow ) .
In fact , they need to expand and improve their repertoire of science writing themes – so that they more often tell the real story rather than just the story they want to tell .

World record transfer for winger as Ronaldo gets his wish
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Manchester United have given Cristiano Ronaldo permission to speak to Real Madrid after accepting an £ 80 m bid from the Spanish club for the player .
" At Cristiano 's request – who has again expressed his desire to leave – and after discussion with the player 's representatives , United have agreed to give Real Madrid permission to talk to the player , " reads a statement on United 's website .
According to the Premier League champions , a deal is expected to be concluded by 30 June .
Should the deal go through , it will smash the world - record transfer record , which was set earlier this week when Real agreed to pay Milan £ 56 m for the Brazilian Kaka .
One player the Spanish giants appear to have given up on signing , however , is the winger Franck Ribéry .
" Ribéry belongs to Bayern and Bayern do not want to sell , " said Florentino Pérez , the Real president .
" I have to respect that .
If they change their minds , it will be a different matter . "
The club could also miss out on David Villa .
The Spain striker is keen on a move to the Bernabéu but Real have so far been put - off signing him due to the fee being demanded by Villa 's current club , Valencia .
" [ Villa ] is an excellent striker but his price is prohibitive , " said Madrid 's sporting director Jorge Valdano .
" He really interests us , but so long as it is for a reasonable figure . "
Villa 's agent , José Luis Tamargo , is still negotiating with Real , while conversations are on - going between the two clubs .
Madrid want to include Alvaro Negredo in a deal in which they would also offer Valencia £ 30 m .
Should a deal fail to be done , Chelsea is the most likely destination for the player .

June 17 , 2009 marks the 20th anniversary of the death of football player / actor / strongman John Daniel Matuszak , best known to us kids at the time as the forsaken and deformed Lotney ‘ Sloth ’ Fratelli , from the 1985 film The Goonies .
For those of you who do n’t know , Sloth ’s deformity is the result of being dropped by Ma ( the ravishing Anne Ramsey ) several times when he was a baby .
He is friends with Chunk ( see Gunaxin ’s Tribute to Chunk ) .
I was disappointed to learn that Matuszak does n’t really look like that .
It ’s makeup .
To me , that ’s like learning Santa Claus wears a fat suit .
Here are some photos from thegoonies.org that shows Matuszak turning into Sloth :
( I ’m assuming the first three photos are flipped ) The makeup was created by The Burman Studio team .
Here are my five favorite Sloth quotes :
“ Mama , you ’ve been bad . ”
“ Hey , you guys ! ”
“ Rocky Road ?
Heh Heh ! ”
“ Ruth !
Ruth !
Baby ! Ruth ! ”
“ Sloth love Chunk ! ”
Here ’s what Sloth looks like as a cartoon character :
Now , let ’s go shopping for Sloth stuff :
7 ″ Scale Series 1 – Sloth
If you do n’t like the 7 inch version , buy the 12 inch one :
Comic Con 2008 Exclusive 12 Inch Deluxe Figure Sloth
This one comes with a cloth coat and shirt ( with a hidden secret beneath ) , a removable pirate hat , a sword , and of course , a pint of Rocky Road ice cream .
There ’s also a limited edition 12 inch vinyl designer figure for a hell of a lot more money .
But why stop with Sloth when you can get Data , Mickey , Mouth and Chunk , too ?
The Goonies Action Figures Set of 5
And of course , you need to get this :
I Love Sloth Sticker
But if your interested in Goonies stuff other than Sloth ( and why would you be ? ) , find it here : Amazon.com Goonies stuff .
By the way , there are rumors that Goonies II coming out .
No word yet on who plays Sloth .
Now , let ’s watch some of Sloth ’s greatest moments :

Coverage .py v3.0 is done .
There are new docs up , and final kits .
The main change since beta 3 was how the standard library is excluded .
I was being too aggressive , and sometimes excluding all the product code as well , depending on the layout of the project .
Now it behaves much better .
If you have n’t been keeping up with the changes since coverage .

A high - powered group of senior Republicans and Democrats led two missions to China in the final months of the Bush administration for secret backchannel negotiations aimed at securing a deal on joint US - Chinese action on climate change , the Guardian has learned .
The initiative , involving John Holdren , now the White House science adviser , and others who went on to positions in Barack Obama 's administration , produced a draft agreement in March , barely two months after the Democrat assumed the presidency .
The memorandum of understanding was not signed , but those involved in opening up the channel of communications believe it could provide the foundation for a US - Chinese accord to battle climate change , which could be reached as early as this autumn .
" My sense is that we are now working towards something in the fall , " said Bill Chandler , director of the energy and climate programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , and the driving force behind the talks .
" It will be serious .
It will be substantive , and it will happen . "
The secret missions suggest that advisers to Obama came to power firmly focused on getting a US - China understanding in the run-up to the crucial UN meeting in Copenhagen this December , which is aimed at sealing a global deal to slash greenhouse gas emissions .
In her first policy address the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she wanted to recast the broad US - China relationship around the central issue of climate change .
She also stopped in Beijing on her first foreign tour .
The dialogue also challenges the conventional wisdom that George Bush 's decision to pull America out of the Kyoto climate change treaty had led to paralysis in the administration on global warming , and that China was unwilling to contemplate emissions cuts at a time of rapid economic growth .
" There are these two countries that the world blames for doing nothing , and they have a better story to tell , " said Terry Tamminen , who took part in the talks and is an environmental adviser to the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The nations are the top two polluters on Earth .
The first communications , in the autumn of 2007 , were initiated by the Chinese .
Xie Zhenhua , the vice - chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission , the country 's central economic planning body , made the first move by expressing interest in a co-operative effort on carbon capture and storage and other technologies with the US .
The first face - to - face meeting , held over two days at a luxury hotel at the Great Wall of China in July 2008 , got off to a tentative start with Xie falling back on China 's stated policy positions .
" It was sort of like pushing a tape recorder , " said Chandler , " [ but after a short while ] he just cut it off and said we need to get beyond this . "
The two sides began discussing ways to break through the impasse , including the possibility that China would agree to voluntary – but verifiable – reductions of greenhouse gas emissions .
China has rejected the possibility of cuts as it sees that as a risk to its continued economic growth , deemed essential to lift millions out of poverty and advance national status .
Taiya Smith , an adviser on China to Bush 's treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , who was at the first of the two sessions , said : " The thing that came out of it that was priceless was the recognition on both sides that what China was doing to [ reduce ] the effects of climate change were not very well known , " she said .
" After these discussions was a real public campaign by the Chinese government to try to make people aware of what they were doing .
We started to see the Chinese take a different tone which was that ' we are active and engaged in trying to solve the problem ' . "
During the second trip to China by the Americans , Xie suggested a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on joint action on climate change .
Chandler said he and Holdren drew up a three - point memo which envisaged :
• Using existing technologies to produce a 20 % cut in carbon emissions by 2010 .
• Co-operating on new technology including carbon capture and storage and fuel efficiency for cars .
• The US and China signing up to a global climate change deal in Copenhagen .
" We sent it to Xie and he said he agreed , " said Chandler .
The ties were further cemented when Gao Guangsheng , the leading climate official , attended Schwarzenegger 's global meeting on climate in November last year .
Obama , who had been elected president two weeks earlier , addressed the gathering by video .
By the time Xie visited the US in March , the state department 's new climate change envoy , Todd Stern , and his deputy , Jonathan Pershing , were also involved in the dialogue .
But the trip by Xie did not produce the hoped - for agreement .
Both Stern and Holdren declined to comment when asked by the Guardian .
Those involved agree it was premature to expect the Obama administration to enter into a formal agreement so soon in its tenure .
Additional members of the US team included Terry Tamminen ; Jim Green , adviser to Joe Biden , now the vice - president who then headed the Senate foreign relations committee ; Mark Helmke , adviser to Richard Lugar , the ranking Republican on the committee ; and Frank Loy , a former state department negotiator on climate .
Both Green and Loy have been nominated to jobs in the Obama administration .
Chandler and Smith believe the effort will pay off in a more comprehensive deal between the two governments .
" Xie came to visit the US when the administration was still trying to figure out its standing on climate issues and it was without very much staff , " said Smith .
" I do n't see this as a dead issue at all .
I think it 's something you would consider still in process . "
The most comprehensive picture of what goes on inside the secret state of North Korea has emerged from an innovative US project .
The location of extraordinary palaces , labour camps and the mass graves of famine victims have all been identified .
The online operation that has penetrated the world 's last remaining iron curtain is called North Korea Uncovered .
Founded by Curtis Melvin , a postgraduate student at George Mason University , Virginia , it uses Google Earth , photographs , academic and specialist reports and a global network of contributors who have visited or studied the country .
Mr Melvin says the collaborative project is an example of " democratised intelligence " .
He is the first to emphasise that the picture is far from complete , but it is , until the country opens up , the best we have .
Palaces
The palatial residences of the political elite are easy to identify as they are in sharp contrast to the majority of housing in the deeply impoverished state .
Though details about many palaces ' names , occupants and uses are hard to verify , it is known that such buildings are the exclusive domain of Kim Jong - Il , his family and his top political aides .
Kim Jong
- Il is believed to have between 10 and 17 palaces , many of which have been spotted on Google Earth :
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
1 ) Mansion complex near Pyongyang
This may be Kim Jong - Il 's main residence .
His father lived here surrounded by the huge , ornate gardens and carefully designed network of lakes .
Tree - lined paths lead to a swimming pool with a huge water slide , and next to the complex there is a full - size racetrack with a viewing stand and arena .
There is a cluster of other large houses around the mansion , forming an enclosed , elite community .
It appears to be reached via an underground station on a private railway which branches off from the main line .
2 ) Kangdong estate
This lies about 18 miles north - east of Pyongyang and has an elaborate garden , set around many lakes .
There are numerous guest houses , and a banqueting hall , within the security - fenced perimeter .
Kenji Fujimoto , who served as Kim Jong - Il 's cook from 1988 until 2001 , said entertainment at Kangdong included bowling , shooting and roller - skating .
There is also a racetrack next to the complex and Kangdong airfield is just 2.5 miles away .
3 ) Unnamed palace on the banks of the Changsuwon lake
The residence sits across the lake from a couple of other mansions which may house relatives of the current occupant .
One Google Earth tag suggested that this might be the home of Kim Yong Nam , the second - in - command in North Korea 's leadership .
4 ) Jungbangsan or Hwangju palace
An enormous mountain retreat set in manicured gardens with lakes and winding paths .
It allegedly has several entrances to an underground facility within the steep hill next to the mansion .
Google Earth reveals a railway track which runs along the top of the hill then disappears mysteriously into its east side .
5 ) Nampo Mansion
Estate covering a huge area with an unusual chain of dammed lakes .
There are many buildings making up the mansion compound , which probably cater for members of the North Korean leadership .
6 ) Yongpong Mansion
Kim Jong - Il 's residence on the banks of Lake Yongpong , near the city of Anju , which he uses as a private hunting retreat .
According to one defector , Han Young Jin , writing in 2005 , it is known for its lakeside fishing spots and hunting ground , which was completed in 1984 .
The mansion was originally further south and was moved after an enlargement in 1979 .
The estate contains the main house and 10 security and support facility buildings .
7 ) The Wonsan Palace
One of Kim Jong - Il 's favourite holiday destinations , sitting on a peninsula lined with white sand beaches .
Wonsan is where Kim Jong - Il and his relatives enjoy fishing , hunting guillemots , jetskiing and swimming during the winter .
Lee Young Kuk , who worked as one of Kim Jong - Il 's guards from 1979 to 1988 , claimed that Kim also spent time at Wonsan hunting roe deer , pheasants and wild geese .
The palace is conveniently next door to an airfield .
Kim Jong - Il 's enormous private yacht was caught by satellite image at anchor up the coast in Wonsan harbour .
On board the vessel there is a 50 - metre pool with two water slides .
8 ) The Hyangsan Chalet

Large mountain retreat , located on the Horang ridge at an altitude of about 1,000 m .
Han Young Jin described it as a traditional Korean - style building , completed in 1984 , with beautiful views of the Myohyang mountains .
The compound contains three buildings for security and support facilities , and there are reports of several entrances to an underground facility beneath Hyangsan .
The chalet allegedly is where Kim Il - Sung died .
Gulag - style prison camps
North Korean prison camps are split into two main types .
Firstly the kwan li-so , translated as " political penal - labour colonies " .
These camps contain the political prisoners , and often their families , who are imprisoned without trial , usually for life .
Sentences involve slave labour within the camps .
The other type of camp , the kyo - hwa - so , are smaller penal - labour camps .
These usually hold criminal offenders who are subject to a judicial process and fixed sentencing , after which they can be released .
Kyo - hwa - so prisoners are also forced to do hard labour in mining , logging , textile manufacturing and more .
A US Human Rights Committee report in 2006 asserted that there were more than 200,000 prisoners throughout North Korea , a figure that may now have risen to 300,000 .
Estimates claim more than 400,000 have died in the system in 30 years .
What little is known about these camps comes mainly from the testimonies of ex-detainees and ex-prison guards .
Most of their accounts date back to the 1980s and 1990s and little new evidence has since come to light .
1 ) Kyo-hwa-so 1
A labour camp in Gaechun , South Pyongan province .
Lee Soon
Ok , who was imprisoned here until 1994 , described prisoners dying from torture and maltreatment , their bodies dumped on the mountainsides " like animals " .
At the time of her imprisonment from 1986 , around 6,000 people were held within the camp 's high walls and electric fences , and its main industries were clothes and shoe manufacturing .
2 ) Kwan-li-so 14
This is near Kaechon , South Pyongan province , on the north bank of the Taedong River opposite camp 18 .
It measures 25 to 31 miles by 19 miles , and contains about 15,000 prisoners , according to Kim Yong , who was held there from 1995 - 96 .
Kim said the main industries were mining and farming and that many people died due to malnutrition , disease and mining accidents .
3 ) Kwan-li-so 15
This is located at Yodok in South Hamgyong province .
Descriptions of the camp by refugees cover all the years from 1977 to 1999 .
These include Kang Chol Hwan , the author of Aquariums of Pyongyang : Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag , whose small village within camp 15 suffered about 100 deaths every year due to malnutrition and disease .
In the 1990s Yodok held more than 45,000 prisoners , surrounded by a barbed - wire fence up to 4 m high and walls topped with electric wires .
Along the fence were watchtowers patrolled by guards carrying automatic rifles and hand grenades .
In the camp there was a gypsum quarry , textile plants , distilleries and a gold mine , where there were frequent accidents .
Lee Young Kuk , a prisoner until 1999 , witnessed numerous public executions and shootings in the camp .
4 ) Kwan li-so 16
Less is known about this camp at Hwasong , North Hamgyong province than the others .
This could be because it lies adjacent to another highly secret location , the Mount Mantap nuclear testing site , and it is close to the Musudan - ri missile - testing facility .
The camp measures 18 miles by 16 miles and is believed to hold 10,000 prisoners .
5 ) Kwan li-so 18
This camp lies at Bukchang on the south bank of the Taedong River , South Pyongan province .
Kim Yong , who was transferred here in 1996 and escaped in 1998 , said it held approximately 50,000 people , mainly the families of those imprisoned in camp 14 .
Bukchang was less severe than camp 14 , but Kim Yong still witnessed prisoners dying of malnutrition and being shot .
The main industries were coal mining , brick making and cement making .
6 ) Kwan li-so 22
Camp located at Hoeryong in North Hamgyong province , the north - eastern tip of the country .
Former guard Ahn Myong Chol described it as one of the largest prison camps , containing around 50,000 prisoners within an area 31 miles long by 25 miles wide .
Hoeryong is infamous for reports of chemical weapons experiments on humans , and glass gas chambers , revealed in a BBC documentary Axis of Evil in 2004 .
Mass graves
North Korea was hit by a famine in the 1990s that killed a huge number of its people .
Estimates of the death toll between 1995 and 1998 vary from 600,000 to 3.5 million from a population of 22 million .
The US State Department claims two million died of starvation in these years .
While thousands starved , particularly in the north - east , the regime continued to prioritise weapons buying and sent shipments of international aid to politically favoured areas on the west coast .
1 ) Hamhung mass graves
Hamhung city in South Hamgyong province was among the worst affected by famine .
In 1998 a former engineering student told Kyodo News Services that more than 10 per cent of the city 's population , including his mother , had starved to death , while another 10 per cent fled the city to find food .
Google Earth images have revealed mass graves on the hills around the city of Hamhung .
One can see a multitude of distinctive mounds packed on to the slopes .
The graves begin within a well - organised cemetery then spread .
The small mounds consume the entire hill , the hills around it and nearly all the unoccupied land surrounding the city .
One North Korea Uncovered researcher , Joshua Stanton , believes the number of graves exceeds 100,000 , and if the smaller and less dense burial areas are included , the total could be twice that figure .
2 ) Unnamed graves
This is another burial ground just east of the capital , Pyongyang , where the small mounds are again visible on the hillsides .
There are other large , haphazard burial grounds in North Korea .
No date or cause of death relating to these graves can be determined from the satellite images .
But most commentators agree it is unlikely that normal circumstances could produce such a great density of burials .
The concentration of graves would be consistent with published reports filed from Hamhung during the famine .

Could space - time actually be a “ superfluid ” substance , scattered with whirling vortices ?
( Image : Forex / Rex Features )
Cosmology is one of the most creative and bizarre areas of science .
Explore some of the strangest ideas in this exclusive feature
1. Clashing branes
Could our universe be a membrane floating in higher dimensional space , repeatedly smashing into a neighbouring universe ?
According to an offshoot of string theory called braneworld , there are large extra dimensions of space , and while gravity can reach out into them , we are confined to our own “ brane ” universe with only three dimensions .
Neil Turok of Cambridge University in the UK and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University in New Jersey , US , have worked out how the big bang could have been sparked when our universe clashed violently with another .
These clashes repeat , producing a new big bang every now and then – so if the cyclic universe model is right , the cosmos could be immortal .
2. Evolving universes
When matter is compressed to extreme densities at the centre of a black hole , it might bounce back and create a new baby universe .
The laws of physics in the offspring might differ slightly , and at random , from the parent – so universes might evolve , suggests Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Canada .
Universes that make a lot of black holes have a lot of children , so eventually they come to dominate the population of the multiverse .
If we live in a typical universe , then it ought to have physical laws and constants that optimise the production of black holes .
It is not yet known whether our universe fits the bill .

3. Superfluid space - time
One of the most outlandish new theories of cosmology is that space - time is actually a superfluid substance , flowing with zero friction .
Then if the universe is rotating , superfluid spacetime would be scattered with vortices , according to physicists Pawel Mazur of the University of South Carolina and George Chapline at Lawrence Livermore lab in California – and those vortices might have seeded structures such as galaxies .
Mazur suggests that our universe might have been born in a collapsing star , where the combination of stellar matter and superfluid space could spawn dark energy , the repulsive force that is accelerating the expansion of the universe .
4. Goldilocks universe
Why does the universe have properties that are “ just right ” to permit the emergence of life ?
Tinker with a few physical constants and we would end up with no stars , or no matter , or a universe that lasts only for the blink of an eye .
One answer is the anthropic principle : the universe we see has to be hospitable , or we would not be here to observe it .
Recently the idea has gained some strength , because the theory of inflation suggests that there may be an infinity of universes out there , and string theory hints that they might have an almost infinite range of different properties and physical laws .
But many cosmologists dismiss the anthropic principle as being non-science , because it makes no testable predictions .
5. Gravity reaches out
Dark matter might not really be “ stuff ” – it could just be a misleading name for the odd behaviour of gravity .
The theory called MOND ( modified Newtonian dynamics ) , suggests that gravity does not fade away as quickly as current theories predict .
This stronger gravity can fill the role of dark matter , holding together galaxies and clusters that would otherwise fly apart .
A new formulation of MOND , consistent with relativity , has rekindled interest in the idea , although it may not fit the pattern of spots in the cosmic microwave background .
6. Cosmic ghost
Three mysteries of modern cosmology could be wrapped up in one ghostly presence .
After making an adjustment to Einstein ’s general theory of relativity , a team of physicists found a strange substance popping out of their new theory , the “ ghost condensate “ .
It can produce repulsive gravity to drive cosmic inflation in the big bang , while later on it could generate the more sedate acceleration that is ascribed to dark energy .
Moreover , if this slippery substance clumps together , it could form dark matter .
7 . It ’s a small universe
The pattern of spots in the cosmic microwave background has a suspicious deficiency : there are surprisingly few big spots .
One possible explanation is that the universe is small – so small that , back when the microwave background was being produced , it just could not hold those big blobs .
If so , space would have to wrap around on itself somehow .
Possibly the oddest suggestion is that the universe is funnel - shaped , with one narrow end and one flared end like the bell of a trumpet .
The bent - back curvature of space in this model would also stretch out any smaller microwave spots from round blobs into the little ellipses that are indeed observed .
8 . Fast light
Why do opposite sides of the universe look the same ?
It ’s a puzzle because the extremes of today ’s visible universe should never have been in touch .
Even back in the early moments of the big bang , when these areas were much closer together , there was n’t enough time for light – or anything else – to travel from one to another .
There was no time for temperature and density to get evened out ; and yet they are even .
One solution : light used to move much faster .
But to make that work could mean a radical overhaul of Einstein ’s theory of relativity .
9. Sterile neutrinos
Dark matter might be made of the most elusive particles ever imagined – sterile neutrinos .
They are hypothetical heavier cousins of ordinary neutrinos and would interact with other matter only through the force of gravity – making them essentially impossible to detect .
But they might have the right properties to be “ warm ” dark matter , buzzing about at speeds of a few kilometres per second , forming the largish dark matter clumps mapped by recent observations .
Sterile neutrinos could also help stars and black holes to form in the early universe , and give the kicks that send neutron stars speeding around our galaxy .
10 . In the Matrix
Maybe our universe is n’t real .
Philosopher Nick Bostrom has claimed that we are probably living inside a computer simulation .
Assuming it ever becomes possible to simulate consciousness , then presumably future civilisations would try it , probably many times over .
Most perceived universes would be simulated ones – so chances are we are in one of them .
In that case , perhaps all those cosmological oddities such as dark matter and dark energy are simply patches , stuck on to cover up early inconsistencies in our simulation .

Build Your Dog or Cat ’s Mind Power
It may be hard to believe , but you can a change the actual physical aspects of your dog or cat ’sÂ brain — making them more intelligent , and giving their personality added resistance to stress .
These startling claims date back to the 1940 ’s when Canadian psychologist Donald O. Hebb took home a few lab rats and gave them to his children to keep as pets .
The children played with these animals and let them run around and explore much of Hebb ’s family home .
The environments rats were free to explore were very rich and varied .
When the animals were later tested for their learning ability , they proved to be much smarter than littermates raised in cages . Â
Shortly later Hebbâ€™s research associates repeated his experiments using dogs .
They found that dogs raised in the more complex home environment not only learned faster , but seemed to be less fearful and considerably less stressed in lab testing situations .
Over the years researchers have proven that these behavioral changes are the result of actual changes in the physiology of the animal ’s brains .
The brains of animals that have lived in changing and complex environments actually become larger and more complex , just like the brains of humans .
The important aspects of the animal ’s experience which cause these positive changes in their brains involves exposure to a wide variety of interesting places and things that novel , and exciting experiences .
Recent research by psychologist Norton W. Milgram and his associates at the University of Toronto have shown that the benefits of such experiences are not restricted to growing puppies .
Adults and even elderly animals , also benefit from having richer environments and even seem more resistant to the usual decline in mental efficiency seen in older dogs .
For those of us who want to give our pet dogÂ or cat the advantage of a more efficient brain , the trick is simply to keepÂ their mind active , exposing Â them to new experiences , giving Â them new things to learn and puzzles to work out .
Some different experiences can come out of just taking the dog to new places and on different routes on daily walks , or including your dog or cat on day trips , or when out doing various chores .
Remember , you are not only building your relationship with your beloved pet , but actually building Â it a better brain .

After nineteen years on the air , the SCI FI Channel in the U.S. is changing its name .
After nearly 17 years on the air , SCI FI Channel in the United States is changing its name .
So what will the new moniker be ?
What word will help it stand out in the competitive cable market , as a channel that is about more than space ships and time travel ?
Is it something to do with “ Imagination ? ” Or “ Fantasy ? ” Or “ Possibility ? ”
Nope .
The channel is rebranding itself as : Syfy Channel .
The New York Times reports that the network will roll out its new name in its advertiser upfronts tomorrow , and officially make the switch on July 7 .
Gone too is the Saturn logo .
New is the tagline “ Imagine Greater . ”
The network ’s genre - leading Web site , SciFi.com , will also make the switch .
The main reason for the change , according to Bonnie Hammer , former head of the network and now president of NBC Universal Cable Entertainment and Universal Cable Productions , and her successor David Howe , is that the name “ SCI FI ” was too limiting .
“ If you ask people their default perceptions of Sci Fi , they list space , aliens and the future , ” Howe said .
“ That did n’t capture the full landscape of fantasy entertainment : the paranormal , the supernatural , action and adventure , superheroes ” — areas of programming that have becoming increasingly important as the network has found ratings success with shows like Ghost Hunters , ECW : Extreme Championship Wrestling , and Destination Truth .
But network chiefs hope that keeping the phonetically altered “ Syfy ” will also help them keep the fanboys and girls who are looking for traditional science fiction .
SCI FI had 95.2 million subscriber households and an estimated ad revenue of $ 423.9 million in 2008 , according to media research company SNL Kagan , the Times said .
Science fiction news site SyFy Portal recently rebranded itself as Airlock Alpha , possibly a precursor to the network ’s acquisition of the “ Syfy ” name .
The change does allow the network to own the copyright on its own name — which it could n’t do with a word as generic and widely used as “ sci-fi . ”
“ We could n’t own Sci Fi ; it ’s a genre , ” Hammer said .
“ But we can own Syfy . ”
“ If I were texting , this is how I would spell it , ” Howe said .

North Korea ’s Ryugyong Hotel : Ugliest Building on Earth ?
It ’s a rather dubious honor to be considered the ugliest of just about anything at all , but according to many , the 105 - story Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang , North Korea appears to be the winner of the ugly building contest .
The Ryugyong Hotel with its 3,000 rooms has been described as a hideous and distorted version of a fairy - tale castle that dominates the city ’s skyline and is so ugly that it is frequently air - brushed out of publicity shots of the city .
Construction began in 1987 ( although no one knows why ) but stopped in 1992 .
It is unlikely that it will ever be finished due to the fact that North Korea ran out of money and there is no tourist industry in the region .
Ryugyong
Hotel remains an eyesore that should not to be viewed after eating .
There it stands and will for many years to come , unfinished , unwanted , and very , veryâ€¦ ugly !

In Japan some call them herbivores , and on Saturday nights they come out to graze : a perfumed army of preening masculinity .
Groomed and primped , hair teased to peacock - like perfection and bodies wrapped in tight - fitting clothes , their habitat is the crowded city where they live in fear of commitment , and the odd carnivorous female who preys on them .
For much of this decade , the older men who drove this country to the top of the economic league tables have looked on in bewilderment at the foppish antics of the generation below .
Japan 's twenty - and thirtysomething males seem disinterested in careers and apathetic about the rituals of dating , sex and marriage .
They spend almost as much on cosmetics and clothes as women , live with their mums and sit down on the toilet when they pee .
Some have even been known to wear bras .
" What is happening to the nation 's manhood ? " wonders social critic Takuro Morinaga .

Now they have their answer : Japanese males are transforming into grass - eaters .
Coined by columnist Maki Fukasawa , the term soshoku - danshi ( herbivorous male ) has become one of those cultural buzzwords that hijacks the Japanese media every couple of years .
With its implied disdain for vegetarians , the term has been popularised in a bestselling new book called The Herbivorous Ladylike Men ( who ) are Changing Japan by Megumi Ushikubo , president of Tokyo marketing firm Infinity .
Her company claims that roughly two - thirds of all Japanese men aged 20 - 34 are now partial or total grass - eaters , and a very long way from the classic twin stereotypes of 20th - century Japanese masculinity : the fierce , unyielding warrior and the workaholic salary - man .
" I noticed these major changes taking place between my father 's generation , the 58 to 63 - year - olds who are retiring now , and the under - 35s , " she explains .
" This is just a very different breed . "
Ms Ushikubo believes that the post - war corporate samurai is increasingly a carnivorous dinosaur , whose legendary dedication to the company – at the expense of family – is as much a relic as dawn calisthenics on the factory floor .
" Grass - eaters " by contrast , are uncompetitive and uncommitted to work , a symptom of their epic disillusionment with Japan 's troubled economy .
" People who grew up in the bubble era ( of the 1980s ) really feel like they were let down .
They worked so hard and it all came to nothing , " says Ms Ushikubo .
" So the men who came after them have changed . "
Like many all - encompassing buzzwords , " herbivore male " can be laughably imprecise .
Among his other qualities , the herbivore is close to his mum , has a liking for deserts and foreign travel and leans toward platonic relationships with the opposite sex .
He will happily share a night with a woman without laying a hand on her and does n't waste his money on prostitutes .
But the term resonates with a generation struggling to make sense of profound social disruption rooted in economic changes .
Wealth disparities are corroding Japan 's meritocracy and poverty is rising .
A 2007 OECD report showed that relative poverty in Japan is the second worst in the developed world , after the United States .
Business magazine Weekly Diamond recently noted that more than 80 per cent of 35 - year - olds in Japan live on an annual income of two million yen – a key poverty benchmark .
" I do n't think the lives my parents had is an option for us anymore , " laments Kai Ishii , a 26 - year - old broker in Shizuoka Prefecture .
" I want to eventually get married and buy a house .
I just do n't know when I 'll be able to do that , even if I 'm still in a job . "

About one third of the Japanese workforce is now casual or part - time , and confidence in the future is at rock bottom .
For many young men , the post - war dream of lifetime employment , home and family , with all the sacrifices it entailed , is fading .
In response , some have turned their energies elsewhere , toward the once feminised sphere of consumption – or away from life altogether .
Millions remain at home as " parasite singles " , meaning they live with , and off , their parents .
The pressing need to find a partner has been alleviated by the ubiquity of porn , sex toys and virtual sex on bedroom computers – one reason , say analysts , why consumption of condoms has been falling for a decade .
Even those who opt for conventional marriage find their old role of main breadwinner is no longer available : men and woman increasingly share the roles of work and home .
Many of these complex changes are also occurring elsewhere , and are not unwelcome , points out sociologist Yuko Kawanishi .
" Japanese men had it good for a long time .
They were macho and sexist , and neglected their wives , so it 's good that they 're discovering their feminine side , and learning to cooperate . "
Ms Ushikubo also hails the rise of the ojyo - man , or ladylike men .
" My generation expected that sort of traditional man to pay for everything , to get the good job and support us , " the 41 - year - old author recalls .
" But that system put a lot of pressure on men .
They do n't know when they 'll be fired , or restructured .
The idea that they had to carry the burden by themselves is fading and I think we 're seeing more equal relationships . "
While sociologists debate its merits , the herbivore phenomenon has become popular media fodder .
On one discussion show this year , a group of grass - eaters faced their older counterparts like opposing armies across a battlefield .
" Men are turning into women , " lamented critic Mr Morinaga .
The blurring of gender boundaries has been highlighted by stories appearing to demonstrate that once proud alpha-males are being symbolically castrated in the home .
Toilet - maker Matsushita Electric
Works reported a survey this year suggesting that more than 40 per cent of adult men in Japan sit on the toilet when they urinate – a figure that is rising year by year .
Nagging wives are also blamed for the rise of the Tenshi no Hizamakura , or Angel 's Knee Pillow , a kneeling stool with an unfortunate resemblance to a church pew that brings men closer to the bowl when they pee .
Designed to stop splashing around the bowl – women after all still do the vast bulk of household cleaning – the product 's arrival prompted the following headline in one media outlet " Men brought to their knees by angry housewives " .
Marketing experts like Ms Ushikubo , who has also written a book called The Consumption Power of Twenty - something Happy Parasites , have been quick to learn the lessons of the new herbivorous world .
Men are now leading purchasers of hair products , make - up , fashion accessories and manicures .
A Tokyo - based company called WishRoom is even selling men's bras , some to middle - aged salary - men .
" They were the generation we had been told were ' manly ' – they led Japan in the post - war period , " WishRoom president Masayuki Tsuchiya told the Japan Times this month .
He said the company had sold more than 5,000 of the bras to men who are probably reacting against the classic stereotype of stoic , silently enduring male .
" They said wearing a bra just made them feel more calm , relaxed and revived . "
True carnivores sigh in disgust , but could the grass - eaters be merely the latest flowering of an old tradition ?
Japanese culture has long had a strong element of androgyny : During the Tokugawa period ( 1603 - 1868 ) , men played women and women dressed as men for the theatre , while erotic art celebrated bisexualism and transgender role - playing .
The traditions live on in the Takarazuka Review , which features women performers in dress suits playing men , and in Kabuki theatre .
The common element between the Tokugawa era and today , says Osaka - based philosopher Masahiro Morioka , is peace .
" Japan has been free from any form of conflict since the Second World War , and that has liberated men from the need to be manly . "
Not that he or anyone else is advocating a return to war to give men back their symbolic cojones .
" I think the changes among men are mostly healthy and are here to stay , " says Ms Ushikubo .
" Men are nicer to the women in their lives and happier with themselves . "
What can be bad about that ?
You have to hand it to Pentagon securocrats and their corporate cronies , they never miss an opportunity to demonize , vilify or otherwise slander domestic political dissent as “ terrorism . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union reported June 10 that “ Anti-terrorism training materials currently being used by the Department of Defense ( DoD ) teach its personnel that free expression in the form of public protests should be regarded as ‘ low level terrorism ’ . ”
According to the civil liberties ’ watchdog : “ Among the multiple - choice questions included in its Level 1 Antiterrorism Awareness training course , the DoD asks the following : ‘ Which of the following is an example of low - level terrorist activity ? ’
To answer correctly , the examinee must select ‘ protests ’ . ”
Yes , you read that correctly .
The Pentagon has designed a training system that puts you in the crosshairs !
And why not ?
Back in 2003 Mike Van Winkle , the spokesman for the California Anti-Terrorism Information Center ( CATIC ) said of antiwar demonstrators brutally attacked by riot cops at the Port of Oakland during a protest against the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq ,
“ You can make an easy kind of a link that , if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that ’s being fought against is international terrorism , you might have terrorism at that ( protest ) , ” said Van Winkle , of the state Justice Department .
“ You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act . ”
( Ian Hoffman , Sean Holstege and Josh Richman , ( “ Intelligence Agency Does Not Distinguish Between Terrorism and Peace Activism , ” Oakland Tribune , May 18 , 2003 )
Pretty ironic coming from a sprawling bureaucracy currently engaged in two aggressive wars of conquest for whom dropping a proverbial dime on unsuspecting goat herders or wedding parties is a walk in the park !
Not to mention Joint Special Operations Command ’s “ executive assassination ring ” operating out of the former Vice President ’s office , who without so much as a by - your - leave , bumped - off official regime enemies .
This latest outrage follows a consistent pattern by the Pentagon that the ACLU has called “ an egregious insult to constitutional values . ”
As Antifascist Calling revealed in previous reports , the U.S. Army ’s 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team is now deployed inside the United States “ under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the “ service component ” of U.S. Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) .
AFC also reported that since NORTHCOM ’s launch in 2002 , it has been mired in controversy .
Among its more dubious accomplishments were illegal domestic spying operations in conjunction with the Pentagon ’s shadowy Counter Intelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) .
Before being run to ground , like many Defense Department intelligence operations , CIFA was heavily outsourced to security corporations .
More than 900 employees out of a total work force of 1,300 were high - paid contractors .
A veritable honey - pot for defense grifters such as Mitchell Wade , the notorious ex-chairman of MZM Inc. and his sidekick , disgraced former Congressman Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - CA ) , eventually imprisoned when a cash - and - hookers - for - contracts scandal signaled the ( temporary ) eclipse of neoconservative stalwarts in Congress .
Despite CIFA ’s shut - down last year , its TALON database ( Threat and Local Observation Notices ) , which contained hundreds of files on antiwar activists , was shunted over to the FBI for safekeeping in its Guardian database , one component of the Bureau ’s massive Investigative Data Warehouse .
Its a safe bet however , that the illegal collection of intelligence on domestic dissidents continues apace .
Inside the Antiterrorism - Training - Complex
While the ideological mind - set driving domestic counterterrorism policies may not have changed much in the intervening years since Van Winkle ’s provocative statement , security firms and a veritable army of consultants drive America ’s Homeland Security - Industrial - Complex .
As USA Today reported in 2006 , “ the homeland security business is booming , and now it eclipses mature enterprises like movie - making and the music industry in annual revenue . ”
And is likely to continue along that trajectory well into the future as new official enemies , particularly in the heimat come on - line .
“ Specialists ” in this lucrative market are former Special Operations soldiers or retired Military Intelligence , FBI or CIA officers who supplement their pensions by plowing the green pastures of the “ antiterrorism training ” industry .
Indeed , there ’s even an industry association ( one of several ) , the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals ( IACSP ) .
According to a blurb on the group ’s website , IACSP was formed to create a “ center of information and educational services for those concerned about the challenges now facing all free societies ” and “ is open to anyone with a sincere professional interest in understanding the security threat posed by terrorism and related conflicts . ”
The organization conducts seminars and publishes The Journal of Counterterrorism and Homeland Security magazine .
IACSP partners include :
The Institute of Terrorism Research and Response ITRR : Self - described as an “ American and Israeli nonprofit corporation , ” ITRR market “ Israeli and American experts ” who provide “ counter - terrorism training , seminars , and security specialization in dealing with threats such as Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) , suicide bombers , and other forms of international terror striking both the public and private sector . ”
Their American - based “ terror experts ” conduct training seminars “ in dealing with domestic terrorism and eco-terror groups , including the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) and the Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) . ” ITRR ’s Targeted Actionable Monitoring Center ( TAM-C ) was created to provide “ provide accurate and actionable intelligence about potential security threats throughout the world . ”
TAM - C’s Ground Truth Network “ leverages the ITRR ’s international contacts and sources to provide real - time intelligence from the field , ” while keeping “ international corporations apprised of threats to their assets and personnel throughout the world . ”
Partners include among others , The Israel Export & International Cooperation Institute ( IEICI ) , the Perelman Security Group ( PSG ) , and Multi Tier Solutions ( MTS ) , a firm licensed by the Israeli Ministry of Defense , that provides “ specialized consulting , field operations , specialized training , fusion center technology , intelligence management platforms . ”
One shudders to think what activities fall under MTS ’ “ field operations ” brief !
Henley - Putnam University : Describing itself as “ the only online University that specializes exclusively in Intelligence , Management , Terrorism and Counterterrorism Studies , ” Henley - Putnam boasts that their faculty is comprised of “ leaders in tradecraft from organizations such as the FBI , CIA , and Secret Service . ”
Corporate partners include the Vienna , Virginia - based C2 Technologies , a firm specializing in “ strategic human resources management , mission - critical outsourcing and information technology . ”
The Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies ( CI Centre ) : based in Alexandria , Virginia the firm offers “ in - depth and relevant education , training and analysis on counterintelligence , counterterrorism and security . ”
With a staff comprised of veteran Cold Warriors , CI Centre was founded in 1997 by David G. Major , “ a retired , senior FBI Supervisory Special Agent . ”
With tailored “ core competencies ” offered in counterintelligence strategy and tactics , understanding terrorism , economic espionage protection and the like , CI Centre boasts of a staff of instructors who are “ seasoned veterans ” from the FBI , CIA , Defense Department , Military Intelligence , State Department , Department of Justice , Canadian RCMP and Cuban DI . ”
CI Centre is a corporate member of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers ( AFIO ) , an ultra- rightist outfit founded in 1975 by CIA officer David Atlee Phillips .
AFIO was a critical behind - the - scenes player that worked to sabotage Watergate - era investigations of CIA crimes by the Church and Pike Committees .
CTC International Group , Inc. ( CTC ) : Self - described as “ a private intelligence agency for the global business community , ” CTC International “ is staffed primarily by former CIA officers ” that “ acts as a private intelligence organization for the legal and corporate communities . ”
The Performance Institute ( PI : A “ private , nonpartisan think tank , ” PI conducts seminars and on - site training that provides “ intensive , methodology - based courses ” that “ include step - by - step processes to improve organizational management capacity . ”
PI ’s Law Enforcement brief includes training in “ Law Enforcement Management , Use of Force , Homeland Security , Funding , Sex Offender Management , Narcotics , Emergency Preparedness and Technology . ”
IACSP will be sponsoring the 17th Annual Terrorism , Trends & Forecasts Symposium , September 18 , 2009 at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey .
In addition to standard boilerplate on Islamic terrorism and the “ threat ” of illegal immigration to national security , topics will include a presentation on “ National Security and Liberty : A Delicate Balance . ”
Needless to say , readers of Antifascist Calling wo n’t be surprised at how the scales are tipped during this presentation !
Another player in the Antiterrorism - Training - Complex is The Backup Training Corporation .
In 2007 Backup Training was purchased by Blackwater ( now Xe ) , the private military ( mercenary ) corporation .
Backup is now Xe ’s “ digital training division ; ” terms of the deal were not disclosed according to Washington Technology .
The firm ’s law enforcement brief offers dozens of DVDs on diverse topics such as Community Policing , Cultural Diversity (! ) , Domestic Terrorist Groups , Gang Training , a Home Defense webinar , Managing Street Informants , Racial Profiling and Surveillance .
But IACSP and Blackwater are n’t alone in this lucrative field .
St. Petersburg College ’s Florida Regional Community Policing Institute offers an “ Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Awareness Training Program , ” in conjunction with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center ( FLETC ) .
Operating with grants from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security , the course is designed “ to provide training to state and local law enforcement officers in domestic and international terrorism .
The goal is to provide officers with a working knowledge of past and present terrorist / criminal extremist groups and individuals , their activities and tactics , and how to recognize and report potential indicators of terrorism and criminal extremism . ”
There ’s even a module that will help you “ identify the electronic tools and media which international and domestic terrorists use and the best practices identified for properly seizing computer hardware and peripherals . ”
The Institute for Preventive Strategies ( IPS ) : A division of the Center for Rural Development in Somerset , Kentucky , IPS offers a Terrorism Prevention course for “ law enforcement professionals . ”
According to a blurb on the group ’s website , IPS avers that “ Incidents related to homegrown terrorism in the United States are on the rise .
Western Europe has long struggled with homegrown terrorists , but instances of American - born - and - raised citizens acting on Islamic terrorist motivations are a relatively new threat to the U.S. ”
Studiously ignored however , are recent incidents of terrorist violence directed against Americans such as the assassination of women ’s health care provider , Dr. George Tiller , gunned down in his church in Wichita , Kansas on May 31 .
The alleged shooter , Scott Roeder , an associate of the violent antiabortion Army of God and the white separatist Freeman movement , was videotaped gluing the locks on a Kansas City clinic according to Democracy Now !
Although footage was turned over to the FBI days before the murder , the Bureau failed to act .
Which just goes to show , “ terrorism prevention ” is fine when it comes to “ Islamic radicals , ” antiwar activists or “ ecoterrorists . ”
Far - right Christian gangs on the other hand , are treated with kid gloves by the state or even celebrated as “ heroes ” by homegrown clerical fascists .
Indeed , elements of the media such as the despicable Bill O’Reilly and his Fox News cohorts helped set the stage for Tiller ’s murder by labeling him “ guilty of Nazi stuff , ” as Salon reported .
America ’s Orwell Complex
“ Policing ideas , rather than criminal activities ” as the ACLU wrote in a strongly - worded letter to Gail McGinn , Acting Under - Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness , “ runs counter to our nation ’s core principles , undermining the very foundations of a free society . ”
While true as far as it goes , the history of the United States is replete with Orwellian moments such as this , where “ freedom ” is code for buying commodities and keeping your mouth shut–or else .
From the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 , from COINTELPRO to Operation CHAOS , and from the USA PATRIOT
Act to warrantless wiretapping and beyond , the national security state has always had but one purpose : to keep the lid on at home , thus greasing the wheels for corporate resource extraction ( armed theft ) on a planetary scale .
And they call this “ freedom . ”
It has been a really bad week for the climate .
Each day brought depressing news as scientists meeting in Copenhagen told us global warming is taking place more rapidly than expected .
The seas are rising faster than predicted ; the polar ice caps are melting more quickly ; and the Amazon rainforest is doomed unless urgent action is taken .
The main solutions are widely agreed .
The world needs to forge a much tougher treaty this year to replace the failed Kyoto Protocol .
Global emissions of carbon dioxide must be cut by at least half by the middle of the century , much more in industrialised countries .
Using energy more efficiently is essential , as is rapidly increasing it from renewable sources .
Nuclear power and biofuels are much more controversial , but are likely to be used to some extent .
But new , much less familiar solutions are also emerging .

Burnout Paradise developer Criterion reckons that developers who talk about maxing out the potential of a games console are being a bit silly .
" That 's proof that you 're not the best , " technical director Richard Parr told Eurogamer 's Digital Foundry channel .
" It means you 're out of ideas . "
" You always find new ways to do things , the constraints lift .
Not just with a new console generation but with every game you do , " senior engineer Alex Fry added .
" Whether it 's a sequel or whether it 's a new game , you learn to do things differently ... better .
The constraints go away because you learn .
While it 's nice to say you 've maxed something out , there 's not really any point . "
Fry and Parr were speaking to Digital Foundry for today 's Burnout Paradise tech retrospective , which explores the origins and processes behind one of the current generation 's most respectable game engines .
Fry and Parr explain how the team set about constructing a world that performs equally well on PS3 , Xbox 360 and latterly PC despite the difficulties experienced by their colleagues at other studios .
Look out for more from Criterion , including the full interview transcript , on the Digital Foundry channel soon .
" After meeting with the landowners and the Park Service today , I have high hopes that the parties are close to agreement and will be able to reach consensus over the land in the next week so we can keep the memorial on track without using eminent domain , " Salazar said .
" Only if the parties are not able to reach agreement will we have to use the last resort of eminent domain to acquire land . "
This week 's Computex show in Taiwan has thrown the spotlight on new device formats such as netbooks , and the role that Linux hopes to take in those , which suggests Android could ride that wave soon .
And on the other side of the world - at Google 's annual developer conference in California - the message was rammed home , though the head of mobile platforms , Andy Rubin , admitted there was a danger of fragmentation .
In some ways , form factors like netbooks may be a better short term option for an immature system like Android , since it is rather less challenging than a smartphone on the software and multimedia front , but while Sony Ericsson is waiting for a more evolved version of the OS , Google still says there could be as many as 20 Android phones on the market by year end .
Enhancements for Android
Despite the focus on Linux netbooks in Taipei , Google was more engaged in convincing developers its store could rival Apple 's and Nokia's , and its OS could challenge Symbian even in high end smartphones .
Indeed , it refused to confirm reports that it has set up a group to work on Android for netbooks , even though some vendors like Acer are already promising netbooks running the OS .
However , as Sony Ericsson has made clear with its decision to wait until release 2.0 to launch Android phones , we need to see this upgrade and some heavy duty multimedia capabilities before handsets based on the platform will get into the superphone league .
However , the conference saw Google highlighting the enhancements it plans to make Android go head - to - head with Symbian , and becoming more responsive to demands from the broader mobile developer community .
Android 2.0 is codenamed Donut and appears to be targeted at a wider range of devices than the current version , as it will support QVGA , HVGA and WVGA resolutions .
This takes it beyond the 320 x 480 HTC phones and suggests MIDs or tablets that can display an entire web page on a mobile screen – lending further weight to the assumption that Android will soon turn up in netbooks .
Developers were out in droves to hear about Android , and as EETimes points out , one reason for their interest – and a warning signal to Microsoft – is the price .
" You get a solid operating system , browser and GSM stack for free , " said an engineer from Garmin , which plans a navigation - oriented Android phone ( as opposed to $ 8 to $ 15 per handset for a WinMo license ) .
Though Android is very much a work in progress – and contrary to many open source ideals , nearly all the work is being done by a small and tightly controlled Google team of about 65 people – it is already considered more sophisticated than other mobile Linux environments , according to many developer attendees .
Google representatives variously said there would be 16 , 18 or even 20 smartphones this year , and Rubin said that the devices would be made by eight or nine different manufacturers .
Although the US has led the drive to Android so far , with China Mobile about to launch a version of the HTC Magic soon too , Rubin thinks Europe will be the driving force .
He said fierce competition in the region would drive operators to create “ highly distinctive versions ” of the Android phone , emphasizing the way that the software platform supports cellcos ' need to design their own branded user experiences rather than being subservient to the vendors .
Filling up the app store
There are now about 4,900 applications available for Android , and Rubin explained there are three broad models for the app store .
One , vendors can download Android for free and provide access to the apps , but not Google software such as Gmail .
Two , they can sign a distribution agreement to include Google apps on the phone .
And three , the ' Google Experience ' will allow manufacturers to use the Google logo on the phone , but have no say over the applications available .
He said most of the phones set for launch this year would use option two .
To boost the store further , especially as Ovi Store launches ( and gets over its initial and embarrassing technical hitches ) , Google is looking for new ways to lure programmers .
Nokia has run developer contests and all the stores are talking up their particular revenue share deals , but Google has taken a leaf from American Idol and is offering hard cash .
Home Blog Contact Documents Koran Polls Support Dutch English French German Hebrew Italian Norwegiean Russian Swedish Tehran in meltdown as police begin shooting at protesters Martin Fletcher | June 16 TEHRAN is a tinderbox after government paramilitaries started shooting , killing at least one protester , following a huge public rally against last Friday 's disputed re-election of President Ahmadinejad .
Members of the Basij , a force of young Islamic hardliners , Tens of thousands of supporters of defeated presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi defy a government ban by marching in downtown Tehran .
Members of the Basij , a force of young Islamic hardliners , killed one demonstrator and wounded several more when their building was attacked as tens of thousands of protesters dispersed from a rally against election fraud held in defiance of a government ban .
In another incident a witness told The Times how she watched from her car as riot police on six motorbikes opened fire on youths walking under a bridge after the rally .
“ The riot police started shooting them with big guns , ” she said .
“ It was n’t like the films where there is just a small hole — the shooting was blowing off hands , limbs .
It was terrible , terrible . ”
An Iranian photographer , declining to be named , told AFP that the incident in which a man was killed occurred in front of a local base of the Basij volunteer militia , which was set on fire .
The dead man had been shot in the head .
Pictures of the incident showed armed men , wearing helmets and in civilian clothes , pointing guns at the crowds from the rooftop of the base .
The photographer said the protester was killed by shots fired by the armed men .
Gunfire was heard in at least three other districts of the Iranian capital .
The Ministry of the Interior was rumoured to have authorised the use of live ammunition as the regime struggled to maintain control .
Supporters of the defeated candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , fought running battles with the police and Basiji , who have flooded into Tehran .
Mr Mousavi emerged from hiding for the first time since the election results were announced to address the rally .
He told the crowd packed into Azadi ( Freedom ) Square : “ God willing , we will take back our rights . ”
Newly emboldened , the protesters brought out their green ribbons and bandanas and chanted : “ Mousavi we support you ” , and “ We will die , but retrieve our votes ” .
The show of strength boosted Mr Mousavi ’s supporters , who have called for another rally and a general strike today .
Demonstrations have also been reported in the cities of Esfahan , Shiraz , Mashad and Ahvaz
The Iranian regime showed its first sign of alarm when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader , who at the weekend hailed the result as a “ divine assessment ” , instructed the Guardian Council of 12 senior clerics to investigate allegations that the election was rigged .
However , the move was seen widely as a ruse to buy time .
The regime ’s violent response to the biggest political crisis in the Islamic Republic 's 30 - year history has triggered a growing international backlash .
Gordon Brown warned Iran that the way it responded to legitimate protests would affect its relations with the rest of the world .
David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , expressed concern at “ what seems to be state violence against its own people ” .
President Obama said he was “ deeply troubled ” by the violence , and Ban Ki Moon , the UN Secretary - General , urged the regime to respect the “ genuine will ” of the Iranian people .

A class intent on filling its boots with other people 's money .
Outrageous sums nodded through with barely a murmur of dissent from spineless committees .
And suddenly - mutinous voters .
No , not the MP expenses scandal , but another tale of egregious excess – this time in our corporate boardrooms .
The precise details of what Westminster 's finest claimed on expenses may have variously shocked , angered and engrossed the country this month , but compared to what the directors of big companies get up with our politicians are , frankly , amateurs .
Douglas
Hogg may have taken a couple of grand to clean his moat , but Fred Goodwin convinced RBS to buy him an £ 18 m jet – complete with personalised registration .
Duck islands and pipes for tennis courts ?
Messrs Viggers and Letwin should really take a leaf out of John Thain 's book .
The former boss of US bank Merrill Lynch spent $ 35,000 of his company 's money on a commode .
Yes , you read that right : $ 35,000 for a toilet .
There is more to this roll call of excess than prurience .
For a start , the all - expenses - paid lifestyle of the big corporate chiefs serves as an example to others both in other countries – ever the competitive sort , Mr Goodwin would have watched the packages awarded on Wall Street – in smaller companies and even in the public sector .
How else would our parliamentarians have got the idea that £ 64,766 – a wage putting them comfortably in the top 5 % of all single earners – was inadequate unless they had been comparing themselves to those raking in even more ?
This , presumably , is what the free - marketeers meant by the trickle - down effect .
Investors who are seeing their shares sink are finally asking why they should keep indulging the bosses of those companies .
Last week , 59 % of Shell 's shareholders voted down its directors ' pay packages – a huge rise from the 15 or 20 % that might come out against a particularly obscene pay deal just a couple of years ago .
And as we report today , there is disquiet among RBS shareholders over the deals offered to executives at the nationalised bank .
Their complaints about big money tied to vague performance targets sound all too familiar .
But the big question is what took them so long ?
Shareholders may now be angry about the backscratching in the boardrooms of BP , Shell , Next and others – but none of this is new .
And the real risk is that when the recession eases and markets head decisively north once more , the anger will dissipate and the culture of corporate complacency will settle once more , like so much displaced dust .
This must not happen .
Fat - cattery is fat - cattery whether it is in bust or boom .
There are two problems that need to be resolved , one harder than the other .
The first and thornier issue is to do with investors .
This is meant to be a shareholder democracy with ordinary Britons each holding a slither of our biggest businesses .
Yet the pension funds which represent their interests are not bothered in scrutinising the companies , let alone having more of a say in running them , but only in trading their shares .
Nor are they held meaningfully to account by pension - fund trustees .
The second is the nature of company boards and non-executive directors in particular .
Too often members of an old - boy network – " old " and " boy " being the operative words – who are sitting on several other boards at the same time , they are generalists rather than specialists and they tend to like a quiet life rather than standing up to self - indulgent management .
This is an area of corporate life that has been examined time and again , ever since Adrian Cadbury 's report in 1991 .
There have been improvements , but not enough .
Our corporate boards must be made more diverse to rid them of the old stuffiness .
A few workers ' representatives among the non-executives would surely be more inclined to question outsize pay deals .
The only way to reduce fat cats is by having more watchdogs .
An IDF force opened fire at a large group of Palestinian gunmen early Monday morning , hitting and injuring at least four of them .
The gunmen approached the Gaza border near the Karni fuel terminal close to Nahal Oz and shot at the troops , who responded with fire .

Attack helicopters and tanks were alerted to the scene to assist the troops on the ground .
At some point mortar fire was launched from the Palestinian territory in order to help the terror cell escape , and several vehicles arrived at the scene to evacuate the gunmen .
An IDF chopper struck the vehicles .
None of the soldiers was wounded .
Palestinian sources reported that four gunmen have been killed and others have been wounded .
A source from the Gaza Strip said the gunmen killed were part of a cell of 10 suicide bombers .
The source said the cell did not belong to Hamas or the Islamic Jihad , but to the al - Qaeda - affilated Salafi stream .
Following the foiled attack the Karni crossing and the neighboring fuel terminal has been closed and the transfer of goods and fuel to the Strip has been halted .
The issue will be reexamined later Monday .
Army sources believe that the cell was made up of at least 10 members , and also received backup from additional forces inside the Strip .
The gunmen were apparently planning to launch a large - scale attack against the military forces or an Israeli community in the region .
Gaza Division officials said that the incident is the most complex with which the IDF has encountered since the conclusion of Operation Cast Lead .
They noted that despite the relative calm in the area , Palestinian attempts to attack the forces were being recorded regularly , forcing alert level to remain high .

Bran , I do n't understand .
Tiller did not kill babies ?
Nobody knew that he killed babies until Bill O'Rielly told them ?
And if I call you a left - wing idiot , and somebody shoots you , is it going to be my fault ?

Craig Ledbetter said : Bran , I do n't understand .
I 'll take you at your word that you do n't .
So I 'll try to help you .
Tiller did not kill babies ?
No .
That would be murder .
As I 'm sure you know , Tiller practiced for 35 years and was never convicted of breaking any laws .
Unless murder has been made legal in Kansas , then no , he did not " kill babies " .
He did , however , serve as an abortion providers , which is legal , not just in the state of Kansas , but in your entire country .
Nobody knew that he killed babies until Bill O'Rielly told them ?
For a start , he did n't " kill babies " , as I tried to help you understand above .
Secondly , Bill O'Reilly lied when he back - pedaled by saying that all he did was " report " on what anti-choice groups nicknamed Tiller .
If you bother to read the above , actual quotes of Bill O'Reilly 's , you will see that that 's a lie .
He used that nickname himself , over and over again .
Why are you seemingly supporting that lie ?
If you 'd like to support him by saying it 's okay to inflame millions by calling him " Tiller the Killer " , that 's up to you .
But perhaps you could find a shred of intellectual integrity to admit that Bill O'Reilly is now lying about what he did previously ?
Or is that beyond you as well ?
And if I call you a left - wing idiot , and somebody shoots you , is it going to be my fault ?
Nope .
But if you go on the public airwaves , speak to millions of people , night after night after night , on the most - watched show on cable " news " , and compare me to Hilter , al - Qaeda , call me a murderer ( which is not a fact , but a lie ) , tell viewers that I 'm running a death mill and an extermination camp , and that I must be stopped ... well , if someone then follows those instructions and stops me , by putting a bullet through my head in church , do you have any complicity in that ?
I 'll leave that between you and your god .
If you have one .

I have seen countless numbers of O'Reilly 's shows - and he always pointed out that anti-abortion groups were the ones who used the phrase " Tiller the baby killer " .
Media Matters , as usual , is pulling stuff out of their nether regions .
O'Reilly has no complicity in this murder , just as Code Pink and World Ca n't Wait have no complicity in the shooting death in Little Rock .

Thank goodness for facts and video tape !
Bill O and his employer ( Murdoch ) will be sued personally by the Tiller family and publicly by human rights organizations for directly inciting by their languaging and constant calls for criminal behavior the murder of another human being .
Homeland Security and Bush 's Patriot
Act should be all over this right now .
Yesterday Turner went beyond the edge of free speech and was arrested ; it wo n't be long before the " Three Stooges : Glenn , Bill , and Rush " will also be arrested for carrying their hate message beyond free speech and into the category of domestic terrorism .

As an aside , Bill O's lies about his involvement in this crime show us what this man is really made of - he 's a spineless wimp who will not stand behind his commentary .
The tapes ( some 38 +? ) of his inciting people to violence against this man personally will become prima facie evidence in Bill O 's trial .
Maybe the arrest of Turner or the forthcoming arrest of Bill O ( and Rupert ? ) for the actual murder of this man will put this wingnut fringe on serious notice that the american people will no longer tolerate their brand of baseless hatred in our public arena .

I do n't think anyone is saying O'Reilly is responsible for the murder of Tiller .
The link between O'Reilly and other right wing commentators to right wing extremist gunmen is rather obvious .
Pointing out such a link does n't equal responsibility for murder .
But it can explain it .

Do they have no responsibility to do any fact checking ?
How about his column 's syndicator , Creators Syndicate ?
Do they have any responsibility to fact check their authors ' work before they send it out to be published in hundreds of papers around the country ?

With all due respect , Brad , where have you been for the past eight years ?

Learner1
Are you sure its pimple ?
Possibly a boil ?
Have you tried washing w/ an acne wash ?
Maybe see if there are any free clinics in ur area that could help ?
Sorry I couldnt be more helpful !
Good luck Maybe someone else on here will have a little more advice !
All Alone I never even considered a boil !
The dictionary says a boil is : A painful , circumscribed pus-filled inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue usually caused by a local staphylococcal infection .
Also called furuncle .
So does that seem similar to what I posted ?
If so , any ideas on how to get rid of a boil ?
Also , any ideas on the best , most discrete way to go about locating a free clinic in my area ?
Thanks for your help , I appreciate it .
Learner1 Maybe in the phone book there should be some clinics ..
Here is something I also found - Pilonidal cyst : A special kind of abscess that occurs in the crease of the buttocks .
Here 's also some home remedies I found ...
If you are overweight , try to reduce it .
Follow a balanced healthy diet with meat , plenty of fruit and vegetables .
If you are iron deficient , a course of iron tablets may help reduce infection .
1000 mg of Vitamin C daily has also been advocated .
Betel Leaves
Butea
Cumin Seeds
Curry Leaves
Dill
Of course
Id def recommend having it looked at !
Good Luck =)
All Alone
Thanks for the advice .
I 'll go speak to my local pharmacist about a remedy and will look into local free clinics .
Thank you .
All Alone Possibly an ingrown hair , but would that explain the seemingly solid , size - fluxuating mass beneath the skin ?
Leaving now to go see the pharmacist ; will report back .
Thanks .
All Alone
The pharmacist gave me some kind of ' draw out salve ' ointment that I need to apply twice daily ( should be loads of fun at work ) .
When I explained to her that I merely thought it was a boil and was looking for something to get rid of it , this is the ointment she showed me .
When I told her I 've had this thing for about six months , she said I should probably have it looked at as it might need to be drained and lanced ( that just sounds like so much fun , does n't it ? ) .
So I 'll try the ointment first and if that does n't work , I 'll locate a local clinic and subject to myself to the ' drain and lance ' routine .
Thanks for all your help , I appreciate it .
All Alone I will definitely let you know .
Here 's an email I just sent to my friend - since he can find the humor in situations like this , I figured maybe someone here can , too .
Thanks again for all your help ; I 'll keep you posted .
=====================================================
So I just got back to the office from my apartment ...
Earlier today , I went to the pharmacy on my lunch break .
Like I mentioned this morning , I went to some medical website and posted in their forum about the huge growth on my eastern - most gluteal hemisphere .
Someone there suggested it might be a boil , so I went to ask the pharmacist if there was anything I could put on it to get rid of it .
The first time I went to CVS , the girl in the pharmacy - after I 'd explained everything to her - finally told me that the pharmacist would n't be back for another 15 minutes .
But before that , she managed to take me down the Preperation - H aisle and blankly suggest I rub hemmorhoid cream on my ass - pimple .
This was immediately following her question , " Is it [ the boil ] on your foot ? " to which I replied an emphatically discreet " No . "
Holding the bright yellow box of Preperation - H in my hand , I felt I needed to clarify the situation and explain to her that " this thing " was n't in or near my anus , rather it was on the cheek .
That 's when she decided to let me know that she was n't actually the pharmacist and I could come back in 15 minutes .
A quick trip Walgreens where their pharmacist was also out to lunch burned enough time for me to go back to CVS .
Upon arrival back at CVS , I made a limping bee - line for the pharmacy ( Murphy 's Law says that if you have a huge boil - pimple on your ass that hurts when you so much as make a heavy sigh , the place where you 're most likely to seek accurate medical advice will be at the furthest opposite point of entry to that facility ) .
Finally getting to the pharmacist , I explain to her that I have what I think is a boil and request her knowledge on any products I might be able to purchase that could eliminate this derriere nuisance .
We proceed back to the Preperation - H aisle where I tell her , " In case you 're wondering , it 's not on my foot " .
She giggled which , for me , was relieving .
I was dealing with someone who was intelligent and was n't going to be a stick in the mud about the situation .
After all , this was embarrassing enough as it is .
She points out some " boil pain soother " cream but says that 's only for pain .
Then she sees the " Draw Out Salve " , which is some sort of cream that you 're to put on a gauze bandage and apply to the area once or twice daily .
Now a salve is something to ease the " situation " , while the draw out , I assume , is supposed to draw out whatever 's replicating Stone Mountain on my butt .
So I buy the salve and some big band - aids - I 'm not buying gauze and surgical tape , just to have to cut it up and put it on then rip it off once or twice a day .
A band - aid will do the job - and enough damage to any hairy parts of the crack of my ass - well enough .
So I try not to limp back to my car , or the rest of the day in the office .
Because my butt zit is in such a place that sitting is n't so bad , but standing up and walking around irritate the **** out of it .
So the close of business finally comes and I decide to go home and get an early jump on ( hopefully ) remedying this annoying little dermis herpe .
I get home , run the water in the shower and strip down .
With one foot up on the bed , I look like I 'm trying out for a naked version of those new Captain Morgan 's Rum commercials .
I 'm feeling around my butt cheek , ever - so - lightly running the tip of my index finger over the infectuous war zone that is the beginning of the crack of my ass .
Things feel pretty hectic back there .
There 's no bleeding , no pussing , the face of the pimple is glazed over with a thin skin .
I 'm pretty sure this needs to be an " open wound " for the salve to do anything - at least that 's what makes the most sense - so I know what I have to do .
I eyeball the safety pin on the bureau .
Hell no , I 'm not trying that **** again .
So I get in the shower .
My shower is steamy and I use this hot water as a sort of compress against the area in question , hoping the " swelling " will go down .
My attention to the area agitates whatever 's under the skin and I can feel the pimple face bubble up tautly , as if pressurized .
With a heavy sigh ( ouch ! ) , I continue to wash and finally get out .
My towel is , at the same time , my worst enemy but my only salvation .
I dry off and save the crack of my ass for last .
I hold one end of the towel in my right hand , in front of my legs and grab the other end of the towel with my left hand , behind my legs .
The towel is between my legs and can be used as a sort of ' floss ' to dry my taint and surrounding creviced areas .
I do so and finally , slowly , gently , delicately get to the ass - pimple .
The slightest rub of the towel hurts enough to make me yelp like a burning cat .
Still , I know what must be done .
I bring the towel farther up between my legs and use it to apply more pressure to the butt - acne .
And with the courage only a desperate man can muster , I yank the towel through my legs .
The course , wet fabric of the towel combined with the applied pressure is enough to rip open the skin of the pimple and a milky , pink , puss - flooded version of blood begins running from this unsightly hole in my cheek .
A nice reddish stripe is left on the towel after I grand - prixed it through my taint .
I nakedly limp over to the pantry and grab a roll of paper towels .
Ripping one off , I told up and apply it to the bleeding butt pimple .
I remove it and find that it 's soaked with a running , puss - filled , light - colored blood .
I repeat this process until my nerves are so shot , I could smoke a cigarette without having to light it .
Finally , I open the salve and the band - aids and begin preperation .
Not being able to see the area in question will make this challenging .
The box of salve warns not to rub or massage the ointment in the area , but rather apply to a bandage and place the bandage over the area .
So I de -cap the salve and squeeze some ointment onto the bandage .
The ingredients on the back of the tube are mostly unpronouncable save one or two things - namely salt ( ouch ! ) and some sort of " food " coloring , to make the salve white .
But when I squeeze this stuff on the band - aid , it 's black as night .
Let 's hope this works .
I squoze the salve onto the outer most edge of the gauze part of the band - aid , which I then tried my best to align with the bleeding , pussing ****- pimple that had me in this position in the first place .
I think I got it on there , but I wo n't know for sure .
Since my little butt - friend bled out most of my bodily fluid , I feel a little better as there 's not such a huge , painful problem back there .
I 'm looking forward to some positive results from all this , but what I 'm also looking forward to , is going home tonight and ripping that band - aid off my hairy ass - part of which is directly in the crack , so it will undoubtedly pull out a good number of hairs from an otherwise sensitive area .
I hope you 're having a good day .

Where exactly is it ?
Is it right on the fleshy part , or more like in the base of the tailbone , near the butt crack ?

Could be a boil , too , but just wondering .
Google pilonidal cyst to see if it looks anything like that .

This is PRICELESS !
I could n't stop reading .
And I must also give KUDOS for the fact that you not only sought medical advice from the Pharmacist , but a woman none the less !
Most men , my husband included would have just whipped out his pocket knife and gone to town !
He actually sutured his own wound once .
LOL
Who does that ?
Who sits in the bathroom with needle and thread and sews up a gash in their leg ?
MEN DO !
LOL
I honestly can't wait to read you next posting !
Sorry to find such entertainment in what is obviously a very painful " situation " and I do hope the salve does the trick .
I 'm sure that you are feeling a bit better with some of the pressure released , but keep applying the salve since the infection can build right back up again .
And sorry to tell you this , but it very well may rear its ugly head again in the future so you may want to sock away a few bucks here and there to save up for a posible lancing , which I have read many women post about and seems to recall them saying that it tends to run around 150 - 200 bucks to have it done .
Also know that an ER will lance it and then you can make payments to the hospital .
Just a little FYI in case you do " end " up needing it lanced and drained .
Here 's to hoping your stride is smooth and straight today !

You are Great !!!!
I felt like I had entered into your life ... and was sharing your boil !!
Keep the posts coming .
You will find us to be one big happy ( most of the time ) family , and I can't wait to find out how the ointment worked .
Let me just offer this .
I have a family member who has the same exact thing ... and they prescribed her Valtrex ( go figure ???? ) and it gets rid of it .
She has them recurring , so when she feels them coming on , she takes the Valtrex and it prevents them from becoming so bad .
Good luck , and I can't wait to find out about your ass !!
All Alone Wow !!!
After I posted this last night , I went out to dinner with my boss .
While sitting at the bar , trying to ignore the big , generously - adhesived band - aid making a mockery out of my *** hair , I wondered if posting that email was a bit too much .
I 'm so glad everyone found the humor in it .
Thank you for the compliments .
Joanna , I find talking to women - even over male doctors - easier , especially when discussing medical issues .
So when I saw the pharmacist was a female , I was relieved .
Your husband , might I add , has balls of steel .
Most men can't sew at all - but to sew your own wound ?
Priceless .
Who_is_it , the " boil / pimple / whatever " is on my right cheek .
It borders on the beginning of the crack and is pretty far south on the cheek , so when I 'm sitting it 's not so bad , but when I stand up and walk around , the area gets a lot of unwanted attention .
As you folks read , after I put the salve and the band - aid onto my gluteal " area 51 " , I went back to work and then later went out to dinner .
The band - aid took a little getting used to , but sitting down , standing up and walking around was cause for very little if any pain at all ; so , at the moment , I 'm pretty relieved .
This was n't the first time I 've used my towel to rip open my butt - boil - I have a whole set of white towels that all have brown streaks on them from dried blood stains .
And when I 've done it before , the pimple leaked and the pressure was gone .
So at this stage of the game , I do n't know if the salve has had any real effect at all .
I ripped it open for two reasons :
One , to relieve some of the pressure , which would , in turn , ease some of the pain .
And two , because I figured a " draw out " salve would work a lot better on an " open " area .
I 'm assuming I need to play this out for at least a few more days if not a week before I 'll know if it 's working or not .
When I got home from dinner last night , I busied myself with trivialities , trying to forget the inevitable .
Slowly , subconsciously , I found myself removing my clothes in between lighting a cigarette , turning on the television and grabbing a soda .
Eventually , I was naked except for my socks and a big band - aid .
Wanting to get it over with , I once again assumed the Captain Morgan 's rum commercial position and put one foot on the bed and felt around my backside for an edge of the band - aid .
Even after several hours of being in a warm place , dealing with my constant motion , the band - aid was living up to its adhering qualities .
After a few tries on a few different sides - all unsuccessful - I finally pinched the middle of the band - aid and pulled until one of the sides came loose .
After that , I slid my finger under so I could get a grip on it .
I tugged at it slowly and gently - which is the dumbest thing you can do .
I felt each hair being yanked out individually .
I tug a bit more and my heart goes out to all women who tweeze and wax merely for the sake of beauty .
My thumb and index finger get a firm grip on the band - aid and I decide to just go for it , once again mustering the courage only a desperate idiot with no health insurance can muster .
I yank the band - aid off and open my mouth to scream but nothing comes out .
It was a silent cry .
A lone tear escaped my eye as I brought the band - aid around from my *** to have a looksee .
The bandage part of the band - aid looked like a crime scene .
There was a big smudge of black from the ointment , which faded into an equally large smudge of red from the bleed - out .
The adhesive part of the band - aid looked like it was in desperate need of a shave .
My poor ***.
I threw the band - aid away and immediately prepped another one .
I figured the puss - geyser on my *** cheek could use as much ointment attention as possible .
My aim was not so good this time and the adhesive part of the band - aid wound up on my boil .
I attempted to peal the band - aid off with the intention of reapplying it , but the second I pulled out just one more *** hair , I decided I could wait until the morning .
I must get back to work , but I 'll have another update later in the day .
And yes , I am a writer ; an amateur one at that , so your comments are really encouraging .
Thank you .
Adevotee wow , you have me checking this thread at least 3 - 4 times a day to see if you have wrote anymore .
You should really start your own blog , and keep writing in it , this thread is going to fill up fast .
Let us know if you do get a blog and what the addy is so we can keep reading .
All Alone Well , I have a newfound respect for women who wear thongs and g- strings for the viewing pleasure of their significant others .
This band - aid stuck in my crack feels like a disturbing session of gratuitous analingus .
My bowels are telling me to consider a trip to the little boys ' room at some point in the near future - and I need to make room for lunch - but if I go to the bathroom , I 'm going to have take this band - aid off .
And that just does n't seem like an altogether fun idea here at work .
I 'm thinking I 'll just skip lunch today and have hair - ripping pain for dinner tonight when I get home .
Med Help
You need to see a doctor !
What you have described could be a boil , but the ONLY way to know for sure is to see a doctor .
Boils are a Staphylococcal ( STAPH ) skin infection which involves a hair follicle ; often referred to as a boil or a furuncle .
A group of boils is known as a carbuncle .
Symptoms and findings include a tender pea-sized ( or larger ) , red nodule ; may ooze pus or weep .
Treatment includes warm , wet compresses several times a day .

MED HELP INTERNATIONAL

When I logged in this morning and saw there was a posting from MedHelp I was truly worried that it was going to be a scorning for the content of these posts .
I did n't scroll all the way down to the last posting from MedHelp however , I could n't .
I HAD to read the update from All Alone first .
Boy was I relieved to find that MedHelp was simply encouraging him to do the proper thing and seek medical attention .
They are right ya know ?
I hate to see you suffering so much !
And I do believe the stories you could write about the trip to the ER could be just as vivid .
So get your " Butt " down there and get that sucker looked at .
Then get back here toot sweet and tell us how you 're doing .
-- J
All Alone Joanna , you and Med Help are right , I need to get this thing checked out .
The salve seems like it might be working , but my " pain in the ass " is n't completely gone .
I 'll give the salve a little more time , then , if everything 's not okay , I 'll look into finding a free clinic in the area .
More band - aid updates later . :)
Radak
Get yourself to a doctor ASAP anyway .
You 've had this one for 6 months now .
It might go away ; it might not .
Even if it does , the probability of it coming back is high .
You 're going to have to get to the cause of the problem , rather than trying to treat the symptom only .
None of my business , but if you work in an office , why do you not have insurance ?
All Alone " None of my business , but if you work in an office , why do you not have insurance ? "
It 's not a cushy job .
Ironically , back when I worked for an insurance company , I did n't have insurance then either .
All Alone Oceans , I dropped out of college .
Twice .
No health insurance for me at the moment .
This salve seems to have really minimalized the boil , but I 've seen no change in its miniscule size in the last 48 hours and I do n't think I will .
So I will be looking into a free clinic in the area tomorrow .
Besides , ripping out my ass hairs with a band - aid twice a day is getting pretty tired .
I 'll keep everyone posted on how things go .
Thanks again everyone .
mom2girls :) well i hope your boil is getting better :)
i never realized someone 's but boil could be so interesting :)... please let us know how you are doing
as a single mom with no insurance i feel your pain !!!
If you are near a college sometimes they have a clinic on campus ... you might be able to get in there ... they usually cost about 15 bucks ... some colleges you have to be a student to use their clinics but not all :)
Good Luck
Holly
All Alone Holly , thank you .
Being a single mom with two girls , I 'm sure you 're feeling a lot more than I am .
I stopped using the salve days ago and I 've seen no change .
The boil , in its miniscule state , has not enlarged or disappeared since cessation of the salve .
I 'm happy I 'm not ripping huge band - aids from my crack though .
I 'm not looking forward to mooning some nurse or doctor - as I 'm sure that 's not something they look forward to either - but I do n't think I have any other choice .
Thanks again , everyone , for the advice ; I appreciate it .
When I finally get to a clinic , I 'll come back with an update .
Radak Yeah !
Keep us posted on your progress !

Seemingly dead - set on hastening its obsolescence , Washington Post has fired " White House Watch " columnist Dan Froomkin , one of their only unflinching truth - tellers who never stopped telling those truths , even through every dark year of the former oppressive regime when McCarthyesque tactics prevailed , and 99 % of the men and women who held jobs like Froomkin 's failed the nation by pulling their punches and folding to the cynicism of fear and intimidation .
Says Froomkin in response : " I 'm terribly disappointed .
I was told that it had been determined that my White House Watch blog was n't " working " anymore .
But from what I could tell , it was still working very well .
I also thought White House Watch was a great fit with The Washington Post brand , and what its readers reasonably expect from the Post online . "
Ironically , folks like Howard Kurtz and Dana Milbank remain employed by WaPo in the meantime .
So do unapologetic wingnut liars and tools such as Charles Krauthammer , William Kristol , George Will and a bevy of others .
And in more irony , despite the paper 's purge of just about anyone who might have been described as " liberal " or " progressive " ( and yes , Froomkin held Obama feet to the same fire he held Bush 's ) , the still - employed wingnuts will continue to label the hard - right charging WaPo as " the liberal media , " even as the editors and publishers of the paper run out of money , wonder what happened to them , and blame " the Internet " for their own failures in falling for the bait .
" As I 've written elsewhere , " Froomkin said in his statement , " I think that the future success of our business depends on journalists enthusiastically pursuing accountability and calling it like they see it .
That 's what I tried to do every day .
Now I guess I 'll have to try to do it someplace else . "
Glen Greenwald notes in his Froomkin " obituary " ...
Post columnists .
At a time when newspapers are relying more and more on online traffic , the Post just fired the person who , in 2007 , wrote
What makes this firing so bizarre and worthy of inquiry is that , as [ Politico 's Patrick ]
Gavin notes , Froomkin was easily one of the most linked - to and citedcolumnists .
At a time when newspapers are relying more and more on online traffic , thejust fired the person who , in 2007 , wrote 3 out of the top 10 most - trafficked columns
Andrew Sullivan describes Froomkin as " WaPo's Best Blogger " and decries :
WaPo has been co-opted by the neocon right , especially in its editorial pages , is getting more and more disturbing .
This purge will prompt a real revolt in the blogosphere .
And it should .
A simply astounding move by the paper - getting rid of the one blogger , Dan Froomkin , who kept it real and kept it interesting .
Dan 's work on torture may be one reason he is now gone .
The way in which thehas been co-opted by the neocon right , especially in its editorial pages , is getting more and more disturbing .
This purge will prompt a real revolt in the blogosphere .
And it should .
Jane Hamsher helps kickstart that revolt by noting the origins of the fear - based firing , following years of Froomkin getting it right , and even holding WaPo accountable when they did n't ( as they did n't , so much of the time ) :
In the end , the bitter petty people who discredited the entire profession with their coverage of the war and its fallout just did not like the mirror he held up to them .
And an organization that has long felt it could change reality simply by refusing to acknowledge its existence runs true to form once again .
UPDATE : Greenwald adds , in a follow - up today , noting ( with citations ) how far to the right today 's edition alone of WaPo is , even as the pathetically delusional Krauthammer decried on Wednesday that Fox " News " is the " only voice of opposition in the media .
...
And it makes us a lot like Caracas where all the media , except one , are state run " :
The Washington Post does more to advance neoconservative ideology than The Weekly Standard , the American Enterprise Institute and Commentary combined .
But Post columnist Charles Krauthammer --- and so many like him --- fantasize that they 're surrounded by a Liberal Media that oppresses , persecutes and silences them .
Just ponder the levels of delusion and self - pity necessary to believe that .
UPDATE 6/26/09 : Froomkin pens his final column for WaPo , and we share a few more thoughts ...
Here at Sun , the Fallacies of Distributed Computing have long been a much - revered lesson .
Furthermore , I personally think they ’re pretty much spot-on .
But these days , you do n’t often find them coming up in conversations about building big networked systems .
The reason is , I think , that we build almost everything on Web technologies , which lets get away with believing some of them .
1 . The network is reliable · HTTP helps here in a couple of different ways .
Most obviously , connections are brief ; I ’ve never seen much in the way of measurements , but I ’d expect the average connection lifetime to be under a second .
Compared to a traditional networked system with connections whose lifetime approximates that of the application , this moves the likelihood of experiencing a damaging connection breakdown while application code is running from “ essentially always ” to “ rather rarely ” .
Second , the clarity about GET , PUT , and DELETE being idempotent , while POST is n’t , helps hugely .
Most obviously , if a GET gets a network blowup , just do it again .
And if the breakage hits a POST , well , it probably only hits one , and this places very clear boundaries around the repair and recovery that an app needs to handle .
2. Latency is zero ·
The Web actually makes the latency problem worse , because every interchange , on average , requires connection setup / teardown .
Oddly , its population of users has apparently internalized this , and is keenly aware of the difference between the normal single - digit number of seconds it takes for a nicely - functioning server to assemble request results and get them to you , and behavior under overload .
Since it ’s not realistic to expect anything like keystroke - level latency across the Net , the correct engineering solution is to defuse the expectation .
3. Bandwidth is infinite · Once again , the Web has been a wonderful teacher of networking realities to the non-technical .
Time after time , you ’ll see messages , between computing civilians , of the form “ Sorry that this picture is so big ” because they know perfectly well that it ’s going to slow down the experience of seeing it .
4 . The network is secure ·
This is probably the fallacy least - well - addressed by the Web .
True , people have become more aware that There Are Bad Guys out there , and they need to be careful .
But not nearly enough .
Also , let ’s grant that TLS , properly deployed , has been pretty well Good Enough to run apps in a mostly - secure way in a hostile environment .
But who among us would be surprised if someone turned up a catastrophic flaw , perhaps not in TLS itself , but in one or two widely - deployed implementations ?
Who ’s to say that someone has n’t , already ?
Anyhow , the Web technologies mean that application builders can survive even while subject to one or more of The Fallacies .
But not this one .
5 . Topology does n't change ·
By making almost all our apps Web - based , and thus having everyone address everything with URIs , we all agree to share solutions to routing and addressing problems ; solutions provided by the DNS , the network stack , and the Internet backbone operators .
This does n’t mean the solutions are easy or cheap or perfect ; it just means that application builders almost never have to think about the problem .
6 . There is one administrator · Well yeah , there is n’t .
But who cares , any more ?
Web architecture makes addressing decentralized .
Thus when an administrator screws up , or imposes policies that seem good to him or her and insane to you , the damage is limited to that person ’s URI space .
Also ,
Web architecture , which requires that you talk about things in terms of the URIs you use to address them and the data formats you use to transmit them , makes it a whole lot easier to achieve administrative coherence even when there are millions of administrators .
7. Transport cost is zero · ( See # 3 above . )
8 . The network is homogeneous ·
This is perhaps the Web ’s single greatest triumph .
For decades we thought we could extend object models and APIs and lots of other programming concepts over the network .
This was a fool ’s errand , because all you can do with a network is send messages over it .
The Web does n’t do APIs and object models , it ’s just a set of agreements over what messages you ’re going to send and what messages expect back in return .
Which , as a side - effect , makes heterogeneity a non-issue .
History · Did TimBL and Roy Fielding and Marca and those guys think , when they were pasting together the Web , “ We ’re about making those Fallacies of Distributed Computing irrelevant ” ?
I doubt it ; they were just trying to ship hypertext around .
Conclusion ·
If you ’re building Web technology , you have to worry about these things .
But if you ’re building applications on it , mostly you do n’t .
Well , except for security ; please do n’t stop worrying about security .
OK , Now after we have given General Motors billions of dollars to help them fix there structuring and ensure that americans keep their jobs , General Motors is filling for bankruptcy .
After wasting billions of American tax payers money they will protect themselves from further damage .
Now do n’t think that the workers of the factories will see any of this , because they will still be laid off .
Basically what will happen is that the CEO and executives of GM will still receive their high payouts and essentially the filling for bankruptcy will only protect them .
We are trying to fix the economy but all we are doing by allowing companys like GM to pay their CEO ’s 150 Million dollars a year is encouraging all corporations to continue the shady techniques they have been using for years .
This has to come to an end , bankruptcy protection should protect the citizen and hard workers of the company not the select individuals who cant do without their caviar .

Many in Congress Hold Stakes in Health Industry
" Almost 30 key lawmakers helping draft landmark health - care legislation have financial holdings in the industry , totaling nearly $ 11 million worth of personal investments in a sector that could be dramatically reshaped by this summer 's debate , " The Washington Post reports .
The list of members includes " Congress 's most powerful leaders and a bipartisan collection of lawmakers in key committee posts . "
For example , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , " has at least $ 50,000 invested in a health - care index " ( fund ) , and Sen. Judd Gregg , R- NH , " a senior member of the health committee , has between $ 254,000 and $ 560,000 worth of stock holdings in major health - care companies , including Bristol - Myers Squibb and Merck . "
The data was part of a " release of financial disclosure forms for the House and Senate " on Friday .
" While no congressional rules bar members from holding financial stakes in industries they regulate , some ethics experts suggest that it often creates the appearance of a conflict of interest , particularly if there is a chance that the legislation could result in a personal financial boost . "
But at " nearly 20 % " of the national economy , " many legal experts say the health - care industry is so predominant that it is impossible for lawmakers to avoid financial ties to that sector , suggesting that the best antidote is a clear disclosure system that makes every lawmaker 's finances publicly available . "
The 22 - member Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which will consider a " liberal - leaning proposal that includes the creation of a ' public plan ' " on Tuesday , includes " at least eight senators with financial interests in the health care industry worth a minimum of $ 600,000  and potentially worth as much as $ 1.9 million " ( Kane , 6/13 ) .
The New York Times adds that " Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan , the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee , one of three panels in the House with jurisdiction over health care , reported at least tens of thousands of dollars in health - related interests , including the medical technology giant Medtronic , the drug maker Wyeth and the insurance company Aetna . "
But neither Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , and Sen. Charles .
Grassley , R - Iowa , who are " expected to unveil a bipartisan plan " later in the week , have major health - related holdings .
Nancy - Ann DeParle , President Barack Omaba 's chief health care advisor , earned " more than $ 2 million from 2008 to this year " while serving " on the boards of health companies and as director of a private - equity firm with health investments " ( Calmes , 6/13 ) .
The AP reports that the wife of Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , " sits on the boards of four health care companies , " and received more than $ 200,000 in fees and stock options last year .
Sen .
Dodd is filling in for the ailing Sen.
Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , as the " lawmaker in charge of writing the Senate 's bill " for the HELP Committee ( Margasak and Theimer , 6/13 ) .

Chinese legal experts are drawing up proposals for the country 's first animal welfare law , which could criminalise the brutal culling of dogs and other forms of pet maltreatment .
The recommendations , which will be submitted to the government by the end of the year , come after a public backlash against the authorities for slaughtering dogs to prevent the spread of rabies .
Law professors at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have been in discussions since last December with Britain 's RSPCA and the US - based International Fund for Animal Welfare .
The draft proposals are said to borrow ideas from the UK on sterilisation programmes and computer chip implants , but the main focus is on preventing maltreatment of animals .
Currently , only endangered species are protected .
There is no penalty for hurting or killing other animals sold for food or as pets .
Local governments have organised mass killings , including burying dogs alive and beating them to death , to halt the spread of rabies , which is a major cause of human death in China .
In the past month alone , authorities in Hanzhong , Shaanxi province , rounded up and killed 22,000 dogs after eight people died of rabies .
Pet lovers were also up in arms after authorities in Heihe , Heilongjiang province , announced a cull of every dog in the town after an outbreak .
Under the new proposal , the emphasis would be on owners registering and vaccinating their dogs .
Anyone caught severely maltreating pets would be warned , fined , or – in the worst cases – sentenced to prison .
Chang Jiwen , the law professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who heads the drafting team , said there was growing support for animal rights among the public and the government .
" China has begun to be aware of the importance of animal welfare because it touches on the economy , trade , religion , and ethics , " he said when asked about the prospects of the proposal becoming law .
" The future is bright , but the path ahead will be tortuous . "
The Hong Kong - based office of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the drafting of an animal rights document was a positive step , especially if it were enacted .
" We have yet to see the details , but any animal welfare law would be welcome , " said Twiggy Cheung , deputy director of the group 's China Outreach programme .
" On the mainland , you see a lot of animal abuse and torture .
We feel sorry for animals and also for the people , because there is no guideline for what is right and wrong .
That is why a new law is needed . "
She agreed that good regulations could prevent rabies without the mass killings of dogs .
" The law ought to cover animal population control and responsible pet ownership , which means people should vaccinate their animals from rabies and other contagious disease . "
Although Douglas Mezzer ’s housemate had moved out many months ago , there was one recurring reminder of his prior residence : the monthly DSL bill from iiNet .
Though Douglas had been paying on time every month , Douglas thought it ’d be best if the bills came addressed to him instead of his former housemate .
He figured it ’d be a simple change that could all be accomplished through the self - service account management website .
After logging in , however , he ran into a bit of an issue .
While he could change the address , phone number , email address , date of birth , and several other fields , the Firstname and Surname were disabled .
Not a big deal , Douglas figured , they have the customer service number listed right there .
An hour and a half of customer service calls later , he finally got a hold of someone who could help with the name change .
After verifying his date of birth , mother ’s maiden name , and inside leg measurements , the rep cheerfully informed him that they could change the name on the account .
“ Of course , ” the rep added , “ there ’s a small fee of $ 59 , but we ’ll just bill that to your account . ”
“ Wait wait , ” Douglas interrupted , “ $ 59 for a name change ! ? ”
“ Well yes , ” the rep explained , “ it ’s a standard fee .
There ’s a whole process , you understand . ”
Douglas begrudgingly agreed .
After all , he did just tell iiNet that his housemate moved out ; saying “ thanks but no thanks , he ’s actually moving back in now ” did n’t seem so believable .
A couple weeks later , the bill duly arrived with an additional $ 59 “ name change ” fee attached .
Its addressee , however , was still Douglas ’s former housemate .
No big deal , he figured , I ’m sure the next one will come to me .
The next month ’s bill came and it was still not addressed to him .
Okay , fine , he thought , they ’ll waste my time .
They ’ll take my money .
But apparently , making the ten - second change is too hard !?
He had no choice but to call back ; it was now a matter of principle .
When Douglas logged back on to the customer portal to find the appropriate service number , a thought popped into his mind .
What if , he thought to himself , hmmm … what if they were incredibly lazy in putting this web app together ?
Could I just edit the fields myself ?
He loaded up his trusty Firebug plugin and Inspected the Firstname field .
He clicked “ Edit HTML ” , replaced Joe ’s name with his own , and removed the “ disabled ” tag .
He followed suit with the Surname field and clicked Save Changes .
Surely this wo n’t work , he told himself , they ’re an ISP ; they would n’t be that stupid , right ?
To his surprise , there were no errors and the fields now read “ Douglas ” and “ Mezzer ” .
Figuring it was some goofy persistence thing , he logged out and logged back in .
The account still said “ Douglas Mezzer ” .
Could it have actually worked ?
Yes , apparently .
The following month ’s bill was addressed to “ Douglas Mezzer ” and there was n’t a “ name change ” fee to be found .
Though , he did consider them sending them a bill for doing their job .
Update : Niaal Holder , the Comms Manager at iiNet , wrote in to say : " First up - as strange as it might sound , thanks for posting your ' connect betterer ' article .
Our dev team have since fixed the issue raised , so the problem should n't exist any more . "
" What we 're wondering is , " Niaal added , " and you can turn us down if you prefer , would you ask Douglas to get in touch with us regarding his account ?
We 'd like to say thanks to him too for bringing the problem to our attention , and see if we can help him out with his account . "
I forwarded along Niaal 's message , and I 'm sure they 'll work something out .
Thanks , iiNet !
A Word From The Editor :
This interview is for visitor's who are 18 and over only due to the graphic nature of some of the discussions .
Not counting the pros , which represent maybe 0.1 % of all bodybuilders worldwide , most bodybuilders are healthy , successful people who are doctors , businesspeople , mothers , fathers , preachers , etc .
In fact , studies have shown that bodybuilders are usually more successful in life due to the lessons that bodybuilding teaches them , like being disciplined and staying healthy .
But just like every industry or subculture , bodybuilding has it 's share of freaks .
Boxing has Mike Tyson , music has Michael Jackson , pro football has rapists and drug dealers , the world of business has Enronâ€¦ and bodybuilding has Gregg Valentino .
Does he represent what bodybuilding is about and are all bodybuilders like Gregg Valentino ?
Of course not .
So why would we want to interview him ?
Well , like it or not , Gregg has the biggest arms the world has ever seen .
Bodybuilding is about muscle .
People want to learn about the freaks .
In other words , enquiring minds want to know .
Here is your chance ... let the interview begin ...
T. Man Bones : Gregg Valentino is popping up everywhere these days .
Television talk shows , music videos , mainstream magazines .
A lot of people in the bodybuilding community who do n't really know Gregg hate what they think he represents .
Bodybuilding.com has tracked down the man with the world 's largest arms to get his story .
Here he talks about synthol , transsexuals , cake shakes , drug dealing , one - legged women , his two favorite pro bodybuilders and his work with special needs children .
TB : Who are you and why should anyone care ?
GV : Who the f**k am I ?
Who the f**k am I ?
Who the f**k are you talking to ?!
I 'm nobody .
I 'm nobody special .
I 'm just a guy who speaks his mind .
I 'm just a guy who 's been through shit that most people would never have been able to survive or comprehend .
TB : Why , when I open bodybuilding magazines , are you and your retarded looking arms staring back at me ?
GV : I 've been in and around bodybuilding for a long time .
I 'm no Johnny - come - lately .
I was a promoter and competitor in the 70s and 80s .
I 've been at this way before Ronnie Coleman touched his first weight .
That said , I 'm not even a fan of the sport .
I bodybuild for me and my own head .
I got a small man complex . , so if I can't grow taller , I 'm gonna grow wider !
I do n't want to be a pro bodybuilder .
What for ?
I 'm bigger then them now and I get more ass then most of them !
TB : So why is your deformed bald - headed ass always at every friggin ' show I go to ?
GV : People like to talk shit about me , but they always want to know what I 'm up to and what I 'm saying .
When Steve Blechman first hired me people said he was crazy , but he believed in me !
I remember going to dinner with him and sitting in his car .
He was telling me he wanted me to do a column and he did n't care what people thought .
His heart told him I was the right man for the job .
I am totally loyal to him and Muscular Development magazine .
Steve Blechman changed my life from that moment on .
Say what you want about me , but my column is hot and I get a ton of emails each day .
I got guys from prison writing to me , telling me I give them a little bit of peace in their f**ked up situation .
I even had marines in Iraq write to me , telling me that during a mortar strike they were afraid , till one marine said , " Hey , if Valentino was here , what do you think he would be doing ? " and then each marine started saying crazy shit and they all laughed while they were being bombed !
It took their mind off what was going on , yo .
That 's an honor to me .
That 's real shit .
Steve Blechman is laughing now and I give my readers 6 to 8 pages of entertainment .
Say what you want about me but f**k any cunt bag that says shit about Steve Blechman or me .
Keep your barbs aimed at me !
TB : Yes , for some strange reason , your column is the first thing I turn to every month in that mag .
Again , if you 're such a nobody , why do I turn on the TV and I see you on Leno ?
I open the National Enquirer and you 're there .
What the hell is wrong with this country ?
GV : Keep your eyes on FHM again , and the Steve Harvey show , too .
I 'm doing a Kid Rock video that was supposed to be done last October but got pushed off till this spring .
I get this attention cause I 'm a freak and I 'm outrageous .
It freaks people out that I 'm this little guy with huge cannons .
On top of that I like to think I 'm a likeable guy .
I 'm friendly and I 'll talk to people , yo .
I talk a lot about shit that everyone does but not everyone will talk about , like shitting my pants or jerking off .
Guys are all f**ked up .
Just ask any girl ; the difference with me is I talk about it .
TB : We 'll get to your dysfunctional sex life in a minute .
Tell me more about yourself .
GV : You know why these talk shows love me ?
Because I talk .
They tell me the worst guests they get are the ones who stand there and do n't talk .
Besides , I 'm a positive person .
I 've been in hell and I f**ked the devil in his ass and survived .
I liked it too !
It takes a lot to get me down or hurt me .
People only see the freak with the big arms or the guy who shits his pant and jerks off while his girl farts in his face .
But there is a whole other side to me .
I 'm the real deal .
I was in with bad mother f**kers !
I seen shit and been through stuff that would make most people wanna kill themselves .
That which does not kill you makes you stronger .
I 'm unbreakable !
I have one weakness , my kids .
That 's it .
F**k everything else .
I 've seen people killed in front of me .
There is a lot of bad shit in my past , but I 'm at peace now .
My demons died when I got arrested .
My arrest sucked , but it saved my life in a round about way .
My glass is always half full .
I do n't see the half empty side of things .
I get knocked down , but I get up again cause , you can't keep me down !
TB : Very inspirational .
Let 's cut to the chase .
Those arms do n't look right .
GV : Let me explain something to you .
I always , always , always had big arms .
I had twenty - one inch arms before I even started to take steroids .
Guys who know me will tell you that .
I had 18 - inch arms in high school when I was 16 years old at 145 pounds
TB : How tall are you ?
GV : I 'm 5 ' 6 " on a good day .
TB : And you claim to have had 21 - inch arms naturally ?
GV : Yeah .
Plus check out the shoulder width .
TB : How much synthol do you have in your body ?
GV : I 've never heard of that product .
TB : Do n't bullshit us .
GV : Of course I 've heard of it .
At one point my arms were 27 and Â¼ inches .
That was ice cold .
Right now maybe they 're 24 inches , 24 and a half the most .
If my arms were all synthol , why would n't I just keep using synthol and keep them 27 inches all the time ?
By the way , I have n't done a cycle since I was arrested three years ago .
TB : Maybe because synthol and roids are too expensive for you ?
GV : Let me tell you something my friend .
I do n't know what bodybuilding publications you 're used to , but my boss Blechman takes care of me .
Do You Think Gregg Valentino Uses Synthol ?
Yes - I Am 100 % Sure !
No - It 's Just Freakish Genetics .
TB : So how the hell are you three years off shit now and you 're still bigger then any pro in the arm area ?
So really , how much synthol is in those babies ?
GV : Ironically Dave Palumbo just wrote in the new issue of Muscular Development about how synthol , like an MCT oil , only lasts a couple days in your body .
There 's no way it lasts five years in your body .
That 's absurd .
So people who claim I have synthol in my body do n't know what they 're talking about .
TB : No , but really , how many bottles would I need to get my arms to look like yours ?
GV : Listen , guys today would eat dog shit to get big .
If Ronnie Coleman said he eats dog shit , guys would do it .
If synthol was responsible for my arms , there would be other guys with 27 inch arms or bigger .
You 'd have twenty - seven inch arms , you punk .
How big are your arms ?
TB : Cold or warmed up ?
GV : Whatever ?
TB : 15 and Â¼ , baby .
Read it and weep .
GV : You know what guy ?
I feel bad for you .
I 've f**ked fitness athletes with bigger arms than you .
Come to think about it , make that figure athletes .
What it boils down to is I have a great muscle - mind link .
I trained naturally for 23 years before I did my first cycle .
I know how to work my biceps and I know how to get them to respond .
I wish I had that kind of link for my other bodyparts .
TB : Yeah , I hear your cock would really benefit .
GV : Dude , are you okay with me ?
I mean , you 're f**king around with me , right ?
TB : Yeah man .
Just trying to make things interesting .
GV : Because , I mean , if you want to get sticky , we can get sticky .
You know what I mean ?
TB : No , no , man .
I 'm cool .
Just fooling around .
Listen , why do you always reveal your arms but nothing else ?
GV : Because this is what I want you to see !
I 'm the Tom Platz of arms !
Think about it .
Obviously my arms are my thing and I want to attract people 's attention to them .
I do n't want people to be thrown off by anything else .
They 're freaky , and I 'm shoving them in your face .
It 's like Lee Haney once told me , ( mimics Lee 's southern drawl ) " Arnold would always hit biceps shots .
When the judges asked Arnold to hit a lat spread he'd hit one fast and get back to a biceps shot . "
Lee also said , " Tom Platz is stupid .
If I was Tom Platz , I would stand on stage and do nothing but pose my thighs . "
It boggles people 's minds and keeps their focus on what you want them to see !
Your strong point !
Your trademark !
TB : You can say all you want that you 've got no synthol in there , but are n't you worried that one day you might have to get your arms amputated ?
GV : Then I 'd be a real freak , right ?
TB : Would you be willing to go to the doctor and get this verified ?
GV : Sure , if the right amount of money is put up .
I 'm not talking a thousand dollars either .
Let 's put up some money and then I 'll do it .
I have a hole in my right arm from a steroid abscess .
An emergency room doctor went to lance it and he cut half the muscle with his scalpel .
Dr. Nadler said I have a lot of scar tissue in there and the only way to repair it is to sort of spackle it with a plug .
He 's going to open me up and plug the hole .
Muscular Development is going to cover it all .
TB : What if he opens you up and oil spills out everywhere ?
GV : That ai n't going to happen .
Nadler has felt my arms .
He knows they 're real .
Yes , they got some scar tissue .
But that 's it .
I do n't care who believes me .
Why do n't people say shit about the pros who are on stage ?
I 'm not competing .
Why am I such a threat ?
Is n't the pro onstage using synthol , escline , blood doping , doing all kinds of shit , are n't they the ones people should be going after ?
You got all kinds of shit going on on that pro stage : guys got implants in their calves and pecs .
They get their abs etched out through fat suction , yet you fools talk shit about me !
They are competing !
I ain't .
They are cheating .
I 'm just living my life , chasin ' bush .
I know pros who got pec lifts for Christ 's sake .
I got fat nuts in my ball sack .
TB : I do n't really understand what your balls have to do with any of the rest of that , but ...
You 've got big arms .
How much can you curl ?
Check out these pics of me at 14 , 17 , 23 and the last pics of me before I started using steroids .
GV : Nobody is going to believe this .
But in my day , and this is way before I took steroids , I cheat curled three hundred .
I used to train heavy .
I 've benched over five hundred .
One time , on a decline bench , I dropped five hundred and fifty pounds .
It bounced off my chest and rolled on my head .
I actually had a huge welt and the whole side of my head was black and blue .
TB : On one of the Internet chat rooms they said you like to bang trannies .
GV : Let me be honest with you .
I 'm a freak .
I 'm not gay .
I do n't find men attractive .
Men repulse me .
I 'd throw up on a man .
TB : You 're into throwing up on people ?
Those are called Roman showers , right ?
GV : Ball buster .
When people think tranny they think Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie in a wig .
That 's a transvestite .
A transsexual is a person who might have been born in a man 's body , realized they were female inside and had the sexual reassignment surgery to allow them to fulfill their nature .
TB : Why did n't I learn about this in health class ?
GV : They should have taught you because let me tell you something .
When you go to a big club in New York City , when you go to the Sound Factory , there 's all these hot women .
You see all these bodybuilders hooking up with these hot women and you know what ?
Some of these hot women are transsexuals .
They 've got tits .
They 've got vag .
They live as a woman .
You can't even tell .
And if that 's the case , and she 's blowing me , I 'm gonna let her blow me .
I 'm not gonna check her DNA .
TB : I hear you 're banging Lil' Kim .
GV : Yo , Little Kim is my friend .
Let 's leave it at that .
Lil ' Kim looks like Aaron Baker with a wig on her head .
You know I 'm only kiddin ' , Kim .
I meet a lot of women in New York City , I hang out with a lot of celebrity women in NYC , and what really eats guys like you is that they dig me .
TB : Maybe if I was Eddie Murphy I 'd be jealous .
I hear he likes chicks with dicks .
GV : You know , maybe because I 'm not homophobic or maybe because I do n't feel the need to put down other people and their lifestyles people get the wrong idea about me .
I never said I bang trannies .
But I could introduce you to a couple if you 're interested .
TB : ( speechless )
GV : I 'm open about the tranny thing but people do n't realize the amount of tail I get , and I 'm talking 100 % grade - A female .
Trannies are n't my holy grail .
I love a Latin pig .
I really do love Latin women .
I 'm in strip clubs all the time checking them out .
Do you have any idea how many porn stars I 've nailed ?
TB : Me too .
GV : You 've nailed porn stars ?
I 'm not talking about popping a porn in the VCR and jerking off .
That does n't count .
TB : Oh , well , then let me revise that .
Hmm , how many porn stars have I banged ?
( thinks ) None .
GV : That 's what I thought .
Let me tell you a story .
Me and Tommy Tucker ( Shown to right with me in 1983 ) - he 's a childhood friend of mine - used to hang out at a place called the Harmony Burlesque .
They had strippers and porn stars appearing there .
I met a porn star and her name was Jeanie Silver .
They used to call her Long Jean Silver , like the pirate Long John Silver ?
See , she only had one leg .
One leg was a regular leg and the other leg was a prosthesis .
TB : Was she hot ?
GV : Yeah , she was very hot .
She actually looked a lot like Susanne Summers , blonde , which really is n't my type but back then I liked her .
She used to pal around with another porno star named Sue Nero .
Sue was kind of chubby .
Tommy used to f**k around with Sue Nero and I used to f**k around with Jeanie .
That was my first experience with a porno star .
I also used to bang Nellie Gold .
Her real name was Debbie Horowitz .
Her uncle used to own Plato 's Retreat .
TB : Wait , go back to Long Jean Silver .
When you guys were in bed would she have the leg on or off ?
GV : She 'd have it off .
I did n't give a f**k .
I used to kiss it and caress it .
She always wanted to stick it up my can but I never let her .
She did a photo spread once where she f**ked a guy with her stump .
I was afraid of it back then .
TB : Enquiring minds want to know : what 's going on with you and Kim Klein ?
GV : I have a love affair with her ass pipe .
I want to lick it like a carvel cone .
I love her .
She 's a sweetheart .
There 's really nothing going on between us .
I 'm good friends with her and her husband , Rob Klein .
TB : If you were gay , who would you bang first : Tom Prince or Bob Cicherillo ?
GV : I have n't , but I think I would .
I think Cicherillo is such a bitch .
He 's said some nasty things about me to a mutual friend .
He does n't like me .
He judges me on how I look and the rumors he hears about me .
I guess he does n't like me .
I would definitely f**k Tom Prince because I know he would like that .
He would enjoy it .
Who am I to deprive him of a little bit of pleasure ?
TB : So you were a drug dealer once .
What 'd you do , move a couple bottles of test once or twice ?
GV : ( laughs ) A couple bottles .
I moved units , son .
I was definitely a drug dealer .
I was n't small potatoes .
I controlled a lot of things .
That part of my life is gone now .
I 'm a different person since then , but I gotta tell you something â€¦ I 've been through a lot of shit .
TB : What 's the craziest thing you 've seen as a drug dealer ?
GV : I 've seen people shot .
The craziest thing that happened to me is I 've almost been executed a couple of times .
TB : Holy shit .
What happened ?
GV : This guy my partner and I dealt with fronted us about forty thousand dollars worth of shit .
To make a long story short another guy that me and my partner trusted robbed us .
Actually robbed my partner 's house when my partner was n't home .
TB : Did these people have names ?
GV : Yeah , a - hole , but look , that ai n't the issue here .
Anyway , me and my partner go and meet the guy who loaned us the stuff and the guy flipped out .
He drove us to this parking lot near Yankee Stadium and forced us out of the car at gunpoint .
This guy was a nut , a real loose cannon , a made - to - do man if you know what I mean .
Before you know it , I 'm on my knees with my hands behind my head in a parking lot near Yankee Stadium .
He was going to kill us .
TB : What happened ?
GV : Another wise guy was there and bailed us out .
He vouched for us and assumed our debt .
This kind of appeased our supplier and he let us walk away from there .
Within a week we had recouped from street sales and paid back the wise guy who saved our asses .
TB : Sounds like you were going to go out like a punk .
Why did n't you try and fight ?
GV : Look , I 'm on probation .
You want to hear crazy stories of me f**king people upâ€ ¦
I gotta watch what I say .
Wait for the book .
But back to your question : there was no fighting .
If you had made a wrong move , if you had twitched , that sick f**k would have shot ya .
It 's not about going out with a blaze of glory .
People watch Scarface and say , " Look at that ! "
But let me tell you something , when they caught Pablo Escobar he was hiding .
There 's a big difference between Hollywood and real life .
You do n't try and stand there and duke it out with someone who has a gun and that gun is trained on you and the guy holding it is waiting for an excuse to drop a couple on you .
That was n't the last time I had a gun pointed at me either .
TB : Give me another example .
GV : This story involves Julissa .
TB : Julissa is your late girlfriend ?
GV : Yeah .
The love of my life .
TB : The one Tom Prince and others talk shit about ?
GV : Talking shit is exactly right because they did n't know shit about Julissa .
Let me tell you , that girl had heart !
Listen to this .
Julissa and I drive into Washington Heights in New York City .
For people who do n't know , that 's a real shitty neighborhood during the time we 're talking here , the late 90s .
A friend of a friend was hooking me up with a couple of guys for a drug deal .
We get to this three family type of house and Julissa and I are arguing .
She wants to go in with me .
I told her to stay in the car .
Wait the f**k outside .
I 'm just getting a box of shit .
I got a lot of money on me .
She does n't want to wait outside and is giving me a hard time and finally I 'm just like , " Sit in the f**king car . "
Now she knows I keep an extra cannon in the glove compartment .
I go into the house and it's a first floor apartment .
I 've got my jacket on and I 've got a piece in my pocket and I 'm holding the piece in my pocket because I do n't know what I 'm walking into here .
There 's a guy in the apartment and he welcomes me and is all smiley and shit and I should have thought something was up when I saw there was only one guy .
But I was familiar with the neighborhood and like I said , these guys were recommended to me by a friend of a friend .
So I let my guard down and I take my hand out of my pocket and as soon as that happens this f**king guy bursts out of a closet with a shotgun leveled at my chest .
I 'm like , " Oh , shit . "
The other guy , the smiley motherf ** ker , he draws a pistol , frisks me , takes my pistol and my money .
TB : How much did you have on you ?
GV : About ten large .
TB : Damn .
GV : Yeah .
The guy with the pistol is talking to the guy with the shotgun in Spanish and I do n't understand a word they 're saying .
The guy with the pistol , in English , tells me to get on my f**king knees .
" Look , just take the money and ... "
I try and reason with him but he gives a nod to the guy with the shotgun and that motherf ** ker wacks the shotgun off my head .
He clipped me three times .
Three times it took that motherf ** ker to drive me down onto my knees .
But down I go , kneeling there with f**king blood all over my head , face and shoulders .
I look like a real mess and I realize that whatever the f**k is coming next , it ai n't going to be good .
TB : They were going to kill you .
GV : Maybe .
Maybe they just wanted to rob me .
They did n't know me .
I did n't know what the f**k was going to happen .
My head was spinning , my blood was all over the place .
They 're talking to each other and laughing , menacing me with their guns .
The smiley guy counts the f**king money I had on me and he looked happy .
They start laughing , the both of them , but the stupid motherf ** kers never thought to post a look out .
So what happens next ...
TB : Julissa .
GV : Bingo .
All of a sudden , you just hear this loud female Spanish voice screaming in rage .
The two have their backs to the voice and they freeze .
They look at each other .
I know its Julissa and I know they 're considering turning and trying to blast her .
But she did n't wait .
Bang !
Julissa shot the guy with the pistol right in the ass .
He screamed and fell , dropping his pistol .
The guy with the shotgun looked like he was going to shit his pants .
Julissa came up behind him and put her gun - the hand cannon I kept in the glove compartment - up against the back of the guy 's head .
He drops the shotgun .
I get up and Julissa is torn between running to me and covering the two a -holes .
I told her I 'm okay .
" Gregg , look at yourself .
Oh Christ , " and she starts going off in Spanish , upset about me and pissed at the two a -holes .
I take the guns and the money from the pistol guy , and I tell Julissa we gotta go .
" Gregg , " she says , " Do you know what these guys were going to do to you ? "
See , Julissa had been waiting outside the apartment in the hall and she heard this shit going down .
TB : Julissa was a latina ?
GV : At that point I just wanted to get out of there .
So I 'm like , " Julissa , let 's go , " but she do n't want to go !
She wants to stay and f**k with these guys .
Julissa orders the guy on the floor back to his feet and he staggers up .
Her shot hit him in the ass and took most of one buttock off .
It was nasty .
TB : How could you tell ?
Did n't he have pants on ?
GV : Well , what happened is Julissa ordered them both in Spanish to drop their pants and they did .
Neither one of the motherf ** kers were wearing drawers either .
You should have seen that guy 's ass .
He 's lucky the bullet did n't blow out his pelvis .
It looked like it tore out the side of his ass .
So Julissa starts taunting them in Spanish and English : " Look at you !
Look at you !
Typical Dominicans , big dicks and no f**king brains . "
I walked up to the guy who hit me in the head and he 's scared .
You could tell he thought he was going to die .
I patted him on the face a couple of times , " What 's the matter ?
You okay ? " and then - wham ! -
I hit him with everything I had right in his face .
Down he goes .
" Get up . "
He gets up .
Wham !
Again , he goes down .
This time he does n't want to get up .
" He does n't want to get up , Julissa , " I say .
She screams something in Spanish and the dude wobbles , but he gets up .
Wham !
One more time , and this time he 's either unconscious or he 's faking it because the motherf ** ker was n't stirring .
So Julissa and I leave that place , and as we get in the car I 'm just glad to be alive and I 'm so glad I had my baby to watch my back .
TB : Were n't you guys afraid they 'd come after you in the street ?
You know , as soon as you left the apartment ?
That they 'd grab guns and scrambled after you ?
GV : Nah .
We took their pants .
TB : If that 's a true story , that is f**king insane .
GV : True ?
Look man , you have no idea .
And there 's more to it than that .
I gave you the shortened version .
You 're gonna have to wait for the book .
I can't emphasize enough that I was a different person back then .
That 's why I 'm so thankful to the people who have made the change possible .
Like Blechman .
Truth be told , being arrested changed my life .
I might have wound up dead .
Still , I kind of want to watch what I say .
TB : What friggin book do you keep talking about ?
GV : There 's a guy working with me .
A professional writer in NYC .
We 're doing a book .
TB : About your arms ?
GV : No .
About my past life .
About what I went through .
TB : About bodybuilding ?
GV : Bodybuilding plays a part , but it 's not a book for bodybuilders per se .
When I say I was a different person back then , you need to understand that I was what some might call an evil man .
I was involved in some really bad shit .
You 'll have to read about it after the lawyers vet it and we make sure it is n't going to land me in any hot water with anyone .
TB : Is it going to be better than Flex Wheeler 's book ?
GV : What 's the matter with Flex 's book ?
TB : Well , he never talks about being high jacked by the Ninjas on his way to the Olympia .
GV : Trust me .
It 's all in my book .
TB : Okay , so you were a big bad drug dealer and a bodybuilder .
Are a lot of bodybuilders involved in the drug trade ?
GV : Oh yeah .
Oh yeah .
The drug and sex trade .
There ai n't a pro bodybuilder on this planet that is n't going to convince me he never sold roids .
There 's no money in the sport .
Anytime a guy can get shit , people flock to him .
When I was selling roids , I had pros calling me up all the time .
I 'll tell you who I used to deal with .
[ Gregg names several top male and female pros who , for obvious reasons , can't be named here ] .
TB : Holy shit .
GV : Yeah man .
And you know what ?
These guys would hound me for shit .
And they all wanted it for next to nothing .
Nobody ever wanted to pay for anything .
Pro bodybuilders are the worst to deal with because they think , since they 're pro , they do n't have to pay for shit .
I 'd say to 'em , f** k you , you makin ' coins , you should pay more !
TB : They sell ass too ?
Did you sell your ass ?
GV : Hell no !
But let me tell you something , pick up any gay magazine here in New York and look in the back .
You 'll find bodybuilders .
Some you probably know .
Look , some guys will hand you three hundred dollars for letting them look at you nude posing , or if you bend over , spread your cheeks and just show them your a -hole .
These guys beat off , blow their loads , and that 's it : you 're three to five hundred dollars ahead of the game , depending on how good a pro you are .
Bodybuilders do n't want to work and it's an easy way to make money .
How many of them hold down full time jobs ?
Think about it .
And do n't give me no personal training bullshit either .
F**k that shit .
You say that shit to cover the money you 're putting in your account .
TB : You got busted by the cops for dealing ?
GV : Yes I did .
On April 17 , 2001 .
To be honest with you , it was one of the best things that ever happened to me .
I was on a downward spiral .
I had lost touch with reality .
To give you an idea , I had a gym which I lost because I did n't pay attention to it because of all the money I was bringing in from the roids .
I had a wife and family that I lost .
The bust was the turning point in my life that gave me a second chance .
TB : You were able to walk away from the drug scene , but some guys say you rolled away from jail .
GV : That 's bullshit .
Again , guys talking about things they do n't know .
It 's true I did n't get any time in prison , besides the time I spent there when I was first arrested and they would n't give me bail .
But I got five years probation .
Look , the guys I was in with are still in operation .
If I had talked they would n't be .
If I had talked people would be behind bars because of me .
TB : You say you did n't rat , but you did n't do any time behind bars .
How 's that possible ?
GV : The guys who do the time are the guys who get caught dealing not just roids , but the harder drugs : cocaine , K , X. Look , you have pros and amateurs now who have been busted , are out on probation and still compete .
TB : You also have pros and amateurs who were busted , ratted and are competing .
GV : You do , but I 'm not one of them .
I only moved roids .
I never ratted on nobody .
The guys I was in with are still at it today .
TB : Did n't you ever think of getting a real job ?
You know , like firefighter , businessman , teacher ?
GV : I 've had real jobs .
TB : Like what ?
Besides owning gyms ?
GV : Well , for instance , and this is something a lot of people do n't know , I used to drive a school bus .
TB : They let you near children ?
GV : They were retarded children .
TB : Like that makes it better .
GV : This is one of Bob Bonham 's favorite stories .
These kids were great .
One time I was driving them home and I had to take a shit .
TB : Oh boy , here we goâ€ ¦
GV : Back then I was bulking up .
I did n't know about roids so I 'd eat a lot of food .
I created something I called a cake shake .
TB : A cake shake ?
GV : A cake shake .
I 'd take heavy cream and put it in an industrial blender .
I 'd throw sugar , protein powder and three to five whole eggs in there .
On top of that I 'd take a big f**king huge layered slice of Country Epicure - a three layer chocolate cake - and I 'd mix that in a blender and I 'd drink it .
That 's about six thousand calories in that one shake alone .
TB : ( laughs )
GV : You think I 'm kidding ya ?
I was throwing bananas in there , yogurt .
One time I threw a f**king whole cooked chicken in it .
So think about the nuclear explosions that were going on inside me from that shit .
TB : You 're crazy !
GV : But let me show you how good that worked : in one month I gained a pound a day .
I gained thirty pounds in one month .
TB : Yeah , but you must have been a fat bastard .
GV : I was more like a fat f**k .
Anyway , these things would tear my stomach up .
One day I downed one of those before I had to drive my school bus .
And as I was sitting there driving it hit me and I knew I had to go or I would shit the seat of the bus .
But thank God I drove retarded kids .
They were special handicapped kids .
They were n't aware of what was going on ; they would just sit there with their heads bobbing back and forth .
So this one time I pulled the bus over on the side of the road .
I ran in the back of the bus and I put newspaper on the floor .
I kept watching them as I blasted away onto the newspaper .
They had no idea what was going on .
They were just nodding their heads back and forth .
I took the paper , threw it out the window , and went back to driving the kids home .
TB : Could n't you have just found a rest stop or something ?
GV : I never would have made it .
Look , let me tell you something .
I have a ten second window .
Either I shit or that 's it .
A year ago I was on vacation with my two children .
We were at a smorgasbord when a shit bubble hit me .
I told my kids to wait for me outside the bathroom in the parking lot .
It was a race : what was going to happen ?
Either I was going to shit my pants or I was going to make it to the bowl .
So I get into a stall , and I 'm wiggling back and forth doing a shit dance trying to get my pants off .
I kind of bent over and it happened - I blasted !
But I totally missed the toilet and I shit all over the feet of the guy in the stall next to me .
He was an old man .
I heard him scream , " Ahhhh ! " and he punched the side of the stall .
Boom !
I said , " Jesus Christ , I 'm sorry . "
It was like mud , diarrhea pudding .
He jumped up out of the booth and was cursing me , " You son of a bitch ! " .
When I went outside my kids were like , " Dad , did you do something ?
A guy came running out of the bathroom cursing with no shoes or socks on . "
He had thrown his shoes and socks in the garbage .
I told my son , Paul , " You 're not going to believe it , I shit all over that guy 's feet . "
TB : So you 're friends with the owner of the East Coast Mecca , Strong and Shapely 's Bob Bonham ?
GV : Bob is my boy !
Bob showed up when I was arrested with seventy - five grand cash to try and bail me out .
TB : Do you and Bob ever run a train on one of those pigs you guys meet in the clubs ?
You know , a little DP acton ?
GV : You mean like one in the pink and one in the stink ?
TB : Yeah .
GV : Hey , I love Bob , but not in that way .
When two guys are rubbing balls together , that 's too gay for me , even if they 're rubbing balls in some babe .
Why do you ask me that ?
Why do n't you ask Chick and Tom that ?
TB : Just checking .
Did Marky Mark , Mike Tyson and Twisted Sister all really kick your ass ?
GV : I never had a fight with Mike Tyson .
We are friends now .
Bonham and I had a beef with Tyson 's friends and when the brawl broke out at the market diner Tyson ended it real quick .
Dude , I ai n't stupid .
Tyson would have made me his bitch .
But we settled everything and Tyson bought Bonham and I dinner .
Iron Mike is a good guy , he just has issues .
The twisted sister thing was a long , long time ago .
It was over an old girlfriend of mine .
She cheated on me with Mark The Animal , Twisted Sister 's bass player .
When I jumped him to fight him , I had him on the ground punching his face in , and then Dee Synder jumped on me and went crazy !
It was a melee and I ultimately got an ass beating .
TB : What 's the deal with Marky Mark ?
GV : My partner Paul and I were at this nightclub .
Marky Mark and his crew were there too .
Marky Mark starts making all these comments about me and Paul , " juice heads , " " Mr. Steroid , " all that shit .
So we had an argument - what the f**k ?
Am I supposed to be intimidated by some white boy who had a group called the Funky Bunch ?
We had an argument and fists flew .
I took his ass to the floor and his posse were all over me .
Paul jumps in but Marky Mark 's boys are all over us .
Still , I got in a few good shots .
TB : On Marky Mark ?
GV : I like to think so .
It was dark and chaotic and I was just throwing fists .
I hit some people .
I also took a lot of shots .
The bouncers came over and threw me and Paul out .
Marky Mark was a punk .
When I was being pulled away from him , he was trying to kick me in the head .
They were n't even good kicks .
No Jet Li kicks , but kicks like my little daughter would throw .
Scratch that .
My daughter kicks better .
She 's tough .
TB : I heard Howard Stern tried to set up a rematch .
GV : Marky Mark was visiting the Howard Stern show .
I had been on Howard 's show already .
Howard had his people call me and put me on hold .
The idea was that I would talk to Marky Mark when he was in the studio .
Challenge him to a fight on the radio in front of millions of listeners .
Marky Mark showed up late and could only spend like twenty minutes on the show , and he spent that time promoting The Italian Job .
I waited on hold but I never got my chance .
Maybe one day .
TB : Well , this interview has been nothing but enlightening and eye opening .
You seem like a guy with a million stories , all of them more outrageous than the next .
GV : I am and they are .
Read my column .
Keep an eye open for the book .
As much as some people in the bodybuilding community are going to hate to hear this , I ain't going anywhere !
The next wave of Gregg Valentino insanity has n't even started to crest !
Watch for me !

Unbelievable quote from Meir Dagan :
" The reality in Iran is not going to change because of the elections .
The world and we already know [ Iranian President Mahmoud ] Ahmadinejad .
If the reformist candidate [ Mir Hossein ] Mousavi had won , Israel would have had a more serious problem because it would need to explain to the world the danger of the Iranian threat , since Mousavi is perceived internationally arena as a moderate element ...
It is important to remember that he is the one who began Iran 's nuclear program when he was prime minister . "
Sounding too good to be true , the cats at Teamxbox have posted a lengthy piece quoting multiple sources from Redmond and Santa Clara who anonymously spill the beans on what the Zune HD is and is n't .
The " digital entertainment handheld , " dubbed unanimously as product " xYz " by said sources to emphasize its purpose of bridging the Xbox and Zune platforms , is not a phone ( that 's Project Pink ) but a converged " mashup " of devices like the Sony Mylo , PSP , and iPod touch .
The emphasis of the device is not the hardware but the software , services , and entertainment experience if offers while remaining primarily " a portable game console and media player . "
It 's said to link into Microsoft 's Skybox computing services for mobiles and blur the lines between Xbox Live and the Zune and Sky Marketplaces .
Even the Xbox 360's NXE interface will be making its way onto the new Microsoft handheld .
As Teamxbox summarizes :
Buy a song , a movie or a TV show on your Xbox , play the content later on the handheld or the other way around .
Play an Xbox Live Arcade game either on your Xbox or in this handheld .
At the moment , we have no way to authenticate any of this beyond what we 've brought to the table already .
Honestly , having had our hopes crushed by a tepid reaction to market trends from Microsoft in the past makes it difficult to believe all these seemingly fanboi fantasy claims of specs and convergence .
However , if true , if Microsoft finally breaks free from the rigid silos of its own making and delivers an integrated living room , gaming , and portable media experience along with a stable Windows 7 computing environment ... well , wait this just can't be happening .

Bringing minimalism and sanity to the web
werc -
A sane web anti-framework
Werc is a minimalist web anti-framework built following the Unix and Plan 9 tool philosophy of software design .
Werc avoids the pain of managing collections of websites and developing web applications .
Database free , uses files and directories instead .
Written using the rc shell , leveraging the standard Unix / Plan 9 command toolkit .
Minimize tedious work : eg. , no need to ever write HTML , use markdown ( or any other format ) instead .
Very minimalist yet extensible codebase : highly functional core is 150 lines , with extra functionality in modular apps .
Features
Here are some of the features provided by werc :
Good integration with pre-existing content , you can add HTML or plain text files and they will be seamlessly integrated with the rest of the site .
You can use your favorite tools ( text editor , shell , file manager , etc ) to edit , manipulate and manage data stored in werc .
Designed to manage any number of ‘ virtual ’ domains that share a common style and layout from a single werc installation .
Configuration and customization can be at at any level : global , per - domain - group , domain - wide , directory sub - tree , and single file .
Can trivially run multiple ( customized ) versions of werc side by side .
Very simple and flexible user management and permissions system .
Applications can be easily combined : eg. , add comments to your blog or wiki by enabling the ‘ bridge ’ app ; or by enabling the ‘ diridir ’ wiki convert any document tree into a wiki .
Can easily write werc ‘ apps ’ and extensions in any language !
( But of course , rc is recommended ) .
Install Requirements
All you need is some Plan 9 commands ( cat , grep , sed , rc , etc. ) , and an HTTP server with CGI support .
Werc runs on any Unix - like system where Plan 9 from User Space , 9base , or frontport are available ( this includes Linux , * BSD , OS X and Solaris ) , and on Plan 9 .
Werc can use any HTTP server that can handle CGI , and has been tested with at least Apache , Lighttpd , Cherokee , nhttpd , Hiawatha , rc - httpd , cgd , and others .
Werc uses markdown by default ( and the standard Perl markdown is included with the distribution ) , to format documents , but any other formatting system can be used .

The bodies of a man , woman and young boy have been recovered from about 400 ft down Beachy Head in East Sussex .
The coastguard saw two bodies at about 2020 BST on Sunday , but the search did not begin until first light on Monday .
The boy , who was thought to be about five years old , was found inside a rucksack , a coastguard station officer who attended the scene said .
The identities of the three people have not yet been confirmed , but they are not thought to be local .
Sussex Police said the deaths were not being treated as suspicious but they were " keeping an open mind until the full facts have been established " .
The bodies were first spotted by a member of the coastguard who was on a routine patrol with a cliff - top chaplain .
Soft toys Eastbourne Coastguard station officer Stuart McNab , who was one of the first to be winched down the cliff , said he found the child 's body in a rucksack along with a second rucksack filled with toys .
He said : " The bag was closed when I got to it .
I saw what I thought was a doll 's head , but on closer examination it was a child . "
He said the second rucksack contained toys , including a tractor and soft toys .
The bodies were recovered by a coastguard team under the supervision of police officers by 1400 BST .
The area has been cordoned off and coastguards , police and volunteers from the chaplaincy team have remained at the scene .
Ch Insp Dick Coates said that a car , believed to be a Volkswagen or caravanette , had been recovered from the cliff - top car park and was being examined by officers .
The cliffs at Beachy Head reach up to about 600 ft ( 180 m ) high and are a notorious suicide spot .
Mr McNab said an average of 20 people jump from the cliffs at Beachy Head every year .
He added there had been cases of multiple suicides before but they generally tended to involve elderly people .
Beachy Head Chaplaincy
Team was set up in 2004 to try to prevent suicides .

I had planned to cover the local teabaggery for a while , but really only to livetweet it for posterity .
However , after arriving and taking a few pictures and such , they announced via megaphone , " Anyone who'd like to say a few words is welcome to do so . "
Well , they did say anyone ...
I worked my way up to the front ... well , it was n't so much front as it was middle .
It ended up being like a " theater in the round , " with the main action taking place in front of a bust of Andrew Jackson , once the governor of territorial Florida with its capital in Pensacola .
I took lots of pictures and videos there ( some of which I hope to post shortly at Blast Off ! ) , and I was thinking about what I might say if and when I got up there .
Still , I was n't sure I wanted to do it .
People were , well , rather rambunctious in their Obama hatred , and the shouting and craziness was , to be honest , a little unnerving .
But when a couple of my friends showed up , one offered to film my " speech , " so I figured I 'd go for it .
I gave a lot of thought to what I wanted to say , making sure to draw the crowd in so they 'd listen carefully before bringing the rhetorical hammer down .
I guess it worked . :)
After I spoke , the MC of the event calmed everyone down and said , " All opinions are welcome here .
And besides ... he 's half right . "
That helped defuse the situation a bit , as did the next speaker , who started by complimenting me on my hat ( it 's a Baltimore Orioles hat -- I was born in Baltimore and I'm a lifelong O's fan ) .
Anyway , a few , including my girlfriend , have chided me a bit for putting myself in harm 's way .
" Someone could have had a gun , " they say .
Well , that 's true ... but I 've never really been the type to stand around and watch , especially when half - truths and lies are being disseminated with no one to challenge them .
Sometimes we have to take a little bit of risk , I think , in order to accomplish things .
So many people throughout history have taken such risks ... maybe I 'm foolish to do so , but I can only do so much from behind a laptop keyboard .
I 'd like my kids ( 9yo boy , 3 yo girl ) to know that their dad stood up for something important , at least once .
I guess this little impromptu speech is having some positive impact -- I 've been asked to appear on the Richard Hunter radio show today at 4:30 pm CDT , if they ever get back to me -- but mostly I just wanted to show those teabaggers that maybe everything is n't as they get from their constant aural assault by Beck and Limbaugh and Hannity and their ilk .
Maybe they all dismissed me as a crackpot , but maybe I got through to someone .
And at the end , is n't that worth a little risk ?
Thanks for all the kind words on the Open Thread .
Keep fighting the good fight .
P.S. If anyone wants to hire a DFH recovering attorney blogger and university fundraiser ( 12 years ) with some broadcasting experience ( I even did a couple of segments on Sky News in October during their election coverage ) , let me know .
Oh , yeah , I did okay on a game show once , too . ;)
P.P.S. Just confirmed : I will be a guest on the Richard Hunter Show , progressive talk radio out of Dallas , this afternoon at 4:30 pm CENTRAL .
Listen live here .
Hope I do n't suck . ;)
UPDATE ( 12:24 pm CDT 4/16/09 ) :
By popular demand , here 's a transcript of my remarks :
Michelle Obama cuts lettuce with students as they harvest vegetables from her garden at the White House in Washington .

Grapes of wrath
Michelle Obama entertained some fifth - grade students from Washington ’s Bancroft Elementary School at a late lunch Tuesday in the first lady ’s garden .
It was a harvest celebration , with ingredients from the kitchen garden the children helped get started in March , coming back in April to plant the seeds .
Kids , gardens , seeds and organic vegetables would normally make for a pretty safe and innocuous White House event , even given today ’s hothouse atmosphere in the nation ’s capital .
But the symbolic importance of an organic garden on the South Lawn , visible from the iron fence on E Street , has blossomed in ways no one could have expected .
It has not only spurred many to have their own home garden — it has also clearly put a scare into conventional agriculture , which has fought back .

Obama ’s stated purpose — to highlight the importance of a healthful diet for children and how much easier it is to get children to eat from their least favorite food group , vegetables , when produce is just out of the ground — was quickly transposed upon a much larger playing field .
No sooner had the garden been announced than a letter addressed to Mrs. Barack Obama arrived at the East Wing from an organization that represents companies selling chemical pesticides and fertilizers .
The Mid America CropLife Association , an agribusiness media group , urged the first lady to give conventional agriculture equal time .
Referring to chemicals the group euphemistically called “ crop protection products , ” the letter said not only are such nonorganic techniques necessary , but their safety is also “ supported by sound scientific research and innovation . ”
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player .
To be sure that Obama got the message that she should be using synthetic pesticides in the garden , the association began an online letter - writing campaign .
The White House never responded .
But the blogosphere has had a field day with the letter .
And it was nothing compared with the fun Jon Stewart had on “ The Daily Show . ”
Stewart ’s mischievous staff persuaded a spokesman for the American Council on Science and Health , a group that accepts corporate funding from Coca - Cola , Kellogg ’s and PepsiCo and generally sides with industries ’ positions on health and environmental hazards , to be interviewed about the White House garden .
The correspondent : comedian Samantha Bee .
In the recent segment , titled “ Little Crop of Horrors , ” the narrator said that “ this seemingly harmless , 20 - by - 50 - foot token gesture has created a firestorm . ”
Bee interviewed Jeffrey Stier , associate director of the council , who referred to the Obamas as “ organic limousine liberals . ”
“ I think the Obama garden should come with a warning label , ” he continued .
“ It ’s irresponsible to tell people that you should have to eat organic and locally grown food .
Not everyone can afford that .
That ’s a serious public health concern . ”
His reasoning : “ People are going to eat fewer fruits and vegetables .
Cancer rates will go up .
Obesity rates will go up .
I think if we decide to eat only locally grown food , we ’re going to have a lot of starvation . ”
Starvation and obesity simultaneously .
Referring to Alice Waters ’ Edible Schoolyard — a program founded by the famous organic chef that brings gardens to inner-city schools , where children learn to maintain a garden and to cook and eat from it —
Bee sardonically added fuel to the fire : “ Programs like the Edible Schoolyard are already sowing seeds of starvation , obesity . ”
The American Council on Science and Health has its supporters .
But they appear to be outnumbered by people who think a garden might help them save money in bad economic times , who are worried about what the chemicals in food are doing to their children .
People have been planting vegetable gardens in numbers not seen in decades .
A huge spike in home vegetable gardens had already begun in 2007 , and the number increased even more in 2008 .
But after the White House garden was announced , the numbers jumped again , according to Gardener ’s Supply Co. , a company in Burlington , Vt. , that has an extensive online business .
The company saw a 30 percent increase in search engine traffic , with people going to its website and searching for “ how to start a vegetable garden , ” “ planning a garden , ” “ raised - bed gardening ” and “ organic vegetable gardening . ”
The company ’s Kitchen Garden Planner saw a 25 percent increase in unique site visits that same weekend .
Its gardening hot line recorded more than triple its usual volume of 120 calls the week of the announcement .
The following week , there was another spike .
There is considerable anecdotal evidence that accompanies the statistics .
The president of W. Atlee Burpee Seed Co. said that since the garden was announced , he has been fighting off interviewers .
“ Before , I could never get an interview , even by begging , but now I ’ve been interviewed over 100 times , ” said George Ball , who said he stopped counting when he got to 100 .
One of the best parts of gardening is the harvest ; better still is eating it .
On Tuesday , the children helped the first lady harvest camera - ready greens for a salad with honey dressing and sugar - sweet peas that were served with crispy baked chicken and brown rice , followed by cupcakes topped with garden berries .
But then Obama summed up the political importance of the garden and its relationship to health care reform and the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act , which determines what goes into the meals served to children at school .
“ Today is really the culmination of a lot of really hard work , ” Obama told the schoolkids .
“ This is our reward . ”
She also reiterated the importance of healthful food in reducing chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes , which cost the country $ 120 billion a year .
In her efforts to promote healthier eating , FLOTUS said : “ I want you guys to continue to be my little ambassadors . ”

Garden
Every day I get into my car and do a podcast on self - sufficiency during my morning commute called The Survival Podcast .
Over the past few months I have dedicated a great deal of time to the subjects of Agriculture and Permaculture for a very simple reason .
While the prepper community is of course very big on food storage there is a finite limit to how much food any individual or family can store .
Once you stored food runs out in a true long - term emergency you had better have some level of production capacity .
In addition to the limitations of stored food the green movement is huge right now and new gardens are popping up in every corner of the nation .
From those that simply want better quality food to those that actually think carbon footprints matter , it seems millions Americans are putting in gardens in a new back to the land movement .
Many in the media are claiming the recession is driving people to garden , in some ways it is true but the reality is in the first year a garden is often a financial loss .
In my view what is really driving the new gardening revolution is that people are actually becoming aware of the many risks to our food supply .
Consider for a moment the actual cost of starting up a garden in year one .
Most people when starting up a garden will go with the raised bed model for many very good reasons , such as soil quality , productivity , ease of installation , etc .
Additionally given that most new gardens  are started by new gardeners  most wont be starting plants from seeds and will therefore have the expense of plants in addition to the expenses of construction , soil , amendments , and tools .
In the end putting in a few raised beds , providing the necessary soil mixture , getting plants , etc. will often set many back 300500 dollars in initial expenses .
It certainly doesnt have to cost this much but this is quite typical because people choose to spend the money to get into production faster with less physical effort .
In the first year , if you are successful , you may very well grow 300500 dollars worth of food but odds are breaking even is the best you will expect to do .
People feeling the effects of a recession  the way the media describes it , dont make this type of expenditure for a possible output while still paying for necessities day to day .
The individuals putting in gardens today are not thinking solely about todays recession , they are thinking about tomorrows possible depression along with probable future food shortages .
They are thinking long - term and understand that while todays cash outflow is a break - even , next years and subsequent years represent independence from at least some portion of the food system . 
They also realize that long term much of our global agriculture system is in real trouble and it may not be very long before capacity of production becomes heavily eclipsed by the most basic need the global population has , the need to eat every day .
So what are the biggest threats we have to our food supply today ?
They include
Grain production has been maxed out and we have failed to meet global grain demands for 6 of the past 9 years .
Enough U.S. produced grain to feed a half billion people for a year will be converted to ethanol in 2009 .
Many nations are now creating long - term contracts with other nations to lock up the grain being produced by the few remaining large net exporters .
China , India , The U.S. , The UK , Malaysia , South Africa and Japan are now all net importers of food . 
Translation : a combined population of over 2.7 billion can no longer feed themselves without foreign dependence .
Many shallow aquifers have been fully depleted and the largest fossil aquifers in the world are now being depleted .
70 % of global water usage is for agriculture and we are running out of the water used for that purpose .
Companies such as Monsanto are altering food at a genetic level taking massive risks with our food supply by releasing altered genetics into the biosphere via cross pollination .
Crisis Preparedness Ha ... Spigarelli , Jack A. Best Price : $ 1.93 Buy New $ 10.50 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
These six threats are just the beginning ; we have also lost a huge portion of genetic diversity via the practice of monoculture ,  soil is losing fertility faster then it is being replenished and soil erosion is turning previously fertile land fallow .
In short global population and demand for food is rising while the long - term trend of increasing food production is flattening and threatening to soon go into a decline .
This is an area where many modern survivalists are finding common ground with an unlikely ally , those heavily into the eco movement .
The two sides are sill miles apart on many issues ; survivalists tend to be conservatives or libertarians and the eco crowd tends to be quite liberal and tends toward a socialist or statist viewpoint on many issues .
Even on the issues of gardening and permaculture there are often huge differences on why the need exists but what is agreed upon is the need itself .
Hence even some of those of the edges of both movements are finding a common bridge in understanding the need to create individually managed sustainable agriculture .
In other words it doesnt mater if it is global warming  or incompetent politicians  that will be the cause of a coming food shortage ; either way the solution is individual action .
That action is as simple as beginning to produce just a portion of your own food .
The potential production on even small suburban lots is shocking .
One family led by a self - proclaimed agrarian revolutionary  named Jules Dervaes is currently producing about 6,000 lbs of food per year on 1/10th of an acre !
While that is the extreme , if perhaps 30 % of suburban homes would produce even 10 % of what Mr. Dervaes is producing , can you see how large the impact would be ?
( This video of Mr. Dervaes  home is quite inspiring and well worth the 10 minutes required to view it . )
Here is the real beauty in producing some of your own food via sustainable agriculture and long - term permaculture techniques
You can do it now even with containers if you are an apartment dweller
It has an immediate impact on your personal situation
It has a positive impact on your health and property value
It provides insurance against a future shortage of food ( personal or global )
Entering into your second year the savings of cash is significant
It reduces your dependence upon several systems ( agriculture , distribution , etc. )
In short it embodies the primary tenet of the modern survival philosophy ,  Everything You Do Should Improve Your Position in Life Even If Nothing Goes Wrong . 
Additionally unlike so many things that create change no waiting or government action is required .
Developing some level of food production is something anyone who really wants to can just do .
In fact over 10 million Americans have chosen to do so in the past two years .
Emergency Food Storage ...
Peggy Layton Best Price : $ 1.22 Buy New $ 7.42 ( as of 10:35 EST - Details )
In the end we should ask ourselves ,  What is the real difference between a modern survivalist and a permaculturist ? 
The two may often be quite different in social philosophy and politics but their end goal is creating a sustainable and independent life .
I firmly believe that the only way to ensure long - term survival is to create that sustainable life and it is impossible to do so without some level of personal food production capacity .
The good news is getting started can be quite simple and you can slowly phase into it as you get more comfortable with the process .
Id like to leave you with a final thought to make you think about how much opportunity we have to produce more food within the United States .
Consider that what I am about to propose will requite almost no real sacrifice or effort .
Simply ask yourself this question : if we were to replace just 10 % of the ornamental trees planted in our cities and towns with a similar tree that produced some type of food , how much free food could we be producing right now ?
The next time you are in your car just observe how many trees there are planted in our cities , towns , urban and suburban areas that produce nothing edible .
Start counting them and simply think of the production capacity if one in every ten were an apple , pear , pecan , walnut , etc .
In our arrogance instead we have genetically modified pear trees to not produce pears , selected pistachio trees that do not product pistachios and embraced the fruitless mulberry .
Why ?
Because homeowners consider the fruit that falls from these trees to be lawn litter ; only an arrogant people would consider food to be garbage while many others go without a full stomach .
The danger we face if we remain apathetic and arrogant is that one day many of us could be the ones going without a full stomach .

College men nearly as likely as women to report they are victims of unwanted sexual coercion See also , Men 's Reactions to Female Sexual Coercion
Cites there to several studies showing that 24 % of men were coerced into unwanted sex .
The UW survey did not ask victims the gender of the other party in cases where the person being surveyed had been either a victim or a perpetrator of sexual coercion .
Mary Larimer , the lead researcher , wrote this to Stanley Green : " We asked both men and women whether they had both perpetrated and experienced sexual coercion .
We did not specifically ask about the gender of the victim / perpetrator , although in follow - up clinical interviews with some of the men , they uniformly reported the perpetrator was a woman .
I 'd have to imagine that same - sex coercion / assault would be even more underreported than opposite - sex coercion in this population .
As you may know , Cindy Struckman - Johnson has published a fair amount on this topic , I 'd refer you to her articles for more information . "

The stereotypical picture of men as the perpetrators and women as the victims of acquaintance rape and other forms of unwanted sexual contact appears to be slightly out of focus .
Men are almost as likely as women to report unwanted sexual contact and coercion , according to a new study of college students conducted by researchers from the University of Washington 's Addictive Behaviors Research Center .
The study , involving nearly 300 students , appears in the current issue of the journal Sex Roles .
Overall , 34 men ( 21 percent of the male participants ) and 36 women ( 28 percent ) reported being recipients of one or more of five types of unwanted sexual contact listed on a gender - neutral questionnaire used by the researchers .
The study also showed that men who experienced unwanted sexual contact reported more symptoms of depression than the other males in the study , although none met the criteria for clinical depression .
There was no difference in the level of depression symptoms for women who said they were sexually coerced and those who were n't .
Women , however , were more likely to be the victims of having physical force used against them .
The research , funded by the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse , grew out of a larger study looking at alcohol abuse prevention among fraternity and sorority members .
One of the surveys used in the larger study by the UW researchers was a standardized sexual experiences questionnaire that solely pictured women as the recipients of coercion and men as the perpetrators .
" Our participants told us we were missing the boat when it came to sexual coercion , " said Mary Larimer , research assistant professor of psychology and principal investigator on the new study , " so we revised the questionnaire to make it gender neutral . "
The revised survey asked the students - 165 men and 131 women - about their sexual experiences over the previous year .
The students were primarily freshmen and sophomores and were largely white ( 82 percent ) or Asian ( 13 percent ) .
Men were more likely than women to report that they had unwanted sex or were pressured into having sex .
The survey defined unwanted sex as a situation in which an individual 's partner became so sexually aroused that the individual felt it was useless to stop even though he or she did not want to have intercourse .
Fourteen percent of the men and 8 percent of the women said they had unwanted sex .
Being pressured into having sex was described as having intercourse with someone even though you really did n't want to because the other person pressured you with continual arguments .
Eight percent of the men and 6 percent of the women said they had been pressured into having sex .
Physical force was used infrequently .
Just 5 percent of the women and less than 1 percent of the men said some sort of physical force , such as having an arm twisted or being held down , was used on them when they did n't want to have sex , whether or not intercourse actually occurred .
Alcohol and drugs played a significant role in sexual victimization .
Seventeen percent of the women and 9 percent of the men said someone had attempted to have intercourse with them when they did n't want to after giving them alcohol or drugs .
And 6 percent of the women and 4 percent of the men said they had sex when they did n't want to after being given alcohol and drugs .
Overall , nearly half of the students - 48 percent of the women and 47 percent of the men - reported that drinking had gotten them into sexual situations that they later regretted .
In addition , both men and women who reported being sexually coerced in some way listed higher alcohol use and more alcohol related problems than did students who were not coerced .
" Alcohol is clearly a major factor , but not the only one , " said Larimer .
" Alcohol not only impairs the awareness of warning signals about a sexual situation but it also impairs a person 's ability to resist an unwanted sexual advance .
Both men and women reported intentionally using alcohol and drugs to obtain sex . "
She added that the male participants ( and observing researchers ) described attending parties and seeing women waiting around until " guys became drunk and then hitting on them when they were unable to make rational decisions about having sex .
" All of this activity is unacceptable behavior and it is clearly not consensual sex , " Larimer said .
" Both men and women are experiencing unwanted sexual advances and our preliminary indications are that men are suffering from those experiences just as women are .
I was surprised at how guilty and ashamed some of the men were and that we , as researchers , were buying into a cultural myth and did n't think such experiences were the same for men as for women . "
Co-authors of the study are Britt Anderson and Aaron Turner , UW psychology doctoral students , and Amy Lydum , research coordinator .

That 's Alien Being Rebooted

The remakes are coming outta the walls .
They ’re coming outta the goddamn walls !
And in today ’s almost obligatory remake news , Bloody Disgusting has learned that Fox , which is already relaunching the Predator franchise , is now putting together an Alien reboot .
You heard me .
They ’re rebooting Alien .
I know you ’re not surprised , and do n’t act like you ’re not going to see it .
You ’re going to bitch and moan for 12 months , but then Fox will put out an awesome trailer , and we ’ll all be like : Holy Shit !
I am so there .
And then one of us will give it a horrible review , and 80 percent of you will refuse to believe us and be , like , “ It ’s Alien .
How bad can it be . ”
And then you ’ll see it in the theater and walk out weeping .
And then they ’ll make a sequel to the reboot .
And we ’ll see that , too .
We ’re all fucking cinematic masochists .
Can I get an Amen ?!
And no :
This is not a rumor .
It ’s happening .
Tony and Ridley Scott are on board as producers , and they ’ve even dug up a director , Carl Rinsch , who is nobody you ’ve ever heard of .
Word is that ’s it ’s not a remake so much as it is an origins story .
Goddamn : I ’m sick of origins stories .
So the question is : Who is gonna play Ripley ?
Let ’s just all make a pact , folks , as readers and writers of this site , that if they cast Megan Fox , we hold the next Paji - Bacon in L.A .
And we torch the fucking city .
Burn that house down .

In the name of science , eight men and seven women drank alcohol through a straw while lying in an MRI scanner , presumably not all together , to see what would happen .
It went to their heads .
Quickly , the researchers say .
Only 6 minutes after consuming an amount of alcohol equivalent to three beers — leading to a blood alcohol level of 0.05 to 0.06 percent , which impairs driving ability — changes had already taken place in the brain cells .
For one thing , the brain begins to run on the sugar in alcohol instead of using glucose , the normal brain food .
" Our study provides evidence for alternative energy utilization upon alcohol ingestion , " said researcher Armin Biller at Heidelberg University Hospital " The brain uses an alcohol breakdown product instead of glucose for energy demands . "
The concentration of substances such as creatine ( energy metabolism ) , which protect brain cells , decreases as the concentration of alcohol increases .
Choline , a component of cell membranes , was also reduced .
" That probably indicates that alcohol triggers changes in the composition of cell membranes , " Biller said .
Whether there are long - term effects remains to be studied .
" Our follow - ups on the next day showed that the shifts in brain metabolites after moderate consumption of alcohol by healthy persons are completely reversible , " Biller said .
" However , we assume that the brain 's ability to recover from the effect of alcohol decreases or is eliminated as the consumption of alcohol increases .
The acute effects demonstrated in our study could possibly form the basis for the permanent brain damage that is known to occur in alcoholics .
This should be clarified in future studies . "
The findings , announced today , are detailed in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism .
Previous studies of this kind had only been done on animals , the researchers said .
A confidential record of a meeting between President Bush and Tony Blair before the invasion of Iraq , outlining their intention to go to war without a second United Nations resolution , will be an explosive issue for the official inquiry into the UK 's role in toppling Saddam Hussein .
The memo , written on 31 January 2003 , almost two months before the invasion and seen by the Observer , confirms that as the two men became increasingly aware UN inspectors would fail to find weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) they had to contemplate alternative scenarios that might trigger a second resolution legitimising military action .
Bush told Blair the US had drawn up a provocative plan " to fly U2 reconnaissance aircraft painted in UN colours over Iraq with fighter cover " .
Bush said that if Saddam fired at the planes this would put the Iraqi leader in breach of UN resolutions .
The president expressed hopes that an Iraqi defector would be " brought out " to give a public presentation on Saddam 's WMD or that someone might assassinate the Iraqi leader .
However , Bush confirmed even without a second resolution , the US was prepared for military action .
The memo said Blair told Bush he was " solidly with the president " .
The five - page document , written by Blair 's foreign policy adviser , Sir David Manning , and copied to Sir Jeremy Greenstock , the UK ambassador to the UN , Jonathan Powell , Blair 's chief of staff , the chief of the defence staff , Admiral Lord Boyce , and the UK's ambassador to Washington , Sir Christopher Meyer , outlines how Bush told Blair he had decided on a start date for the war .
Paraphrasing Bush 's comments at the meeting , Manning , noted : " The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March .
This was when the bombing would begin . "
Last night an expert on international law who is familar with the memo 's contents said it provided vital evidence into the two men's frames of mind as they considered the invasion and its aftermath and must be presented to the Chilcott inquiry established by Gordon Brown to examine the causes , conduct and consequences of the Iraq war .
Philippe Sands , QC , a professor of law at University College London who is expected to give evidence to the inquiry , said confidential material such as the memo was of national importance , making it vital that the inquiry is not held in private , as Brown originally envisioned .
In today 's Observer , Sands writes : " Documents like this raise issues of national embarrassment , not national security .
The restoration of public confidence requires this new inquiry to be transparent .
Contentious matters should not be kept out of the public domain , even in the run-up to an election . "
The memo notes there had been a shift in the two men's thinking on Iraq by late January 2003 and that preparing for war was now their priority .
" Our diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning , " Manning writes .
This was despite the fact Blair that had yet to receive advice on the legality of the war from the Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith , which did not arrive until 7 March 2003 - 13 days before the bombing campaign started .
In his article today , Sands says the memo raises questions about the selection of the chair of the inquiry .
Sir John Chilcott sat on the 2004 Butler inquiry , which examined the reliability of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war , and would have been privy to the document 's contents - and the doubts about WMD running to the highest levels of the US and UK governments .
Many senior legal experts have expressed dismay that Chilcott has been selected to chair the inquiry as he is considered to be close to the security services after his time spent as a civil servant in Northern Ireland .
Brown had believed that allowing the Chilcott inquiry to hold private hearings would allow witnesses to be candid .
But after bereaved families and antiwar campaigners expressed outrage , the prime minister wrote to Chilcott to say that if the panel can show witnesses and national security issues will not be compromised by public hearings , he will change his stance .
Lord Guthrie , a former chief of the defence staff under Blair , described the memo as " quite shocking " .
He said that it underscored why the Chilcott inquiry must be seen to be a robust investigation : " It 's important that the inquiry is not a whitewash as these inquiries often are . "
This year , the Dutch government launched its own inquiry into its support for the war .
Significantly , the inquiry will see all the intelligence shared with the Dutch intelligence services by MI5 and MI6 .
The inquiry intends to publish its report in November - suggesting that confidential information about the role played by the UK and the US could become public before Chilcott 's inquiry reports next year .

Almost unnoticed , Microsoft announced that in the upcoming Windows 7 will include support for playback of .mov files .
As all “ .mov ” users know , until now that job do Apple QuickTime multimedia player .
In the new Windows 7 operating system , Windows Media Player for Windows 7 will substitute Apple QuickTime multimedia player as support for file format .mov .
But , all functionality of Apple QuickTime will not be replaced .
Still , a large number of users of Apple multimedia devices need to have QuickTime installed because it is necessary to work with iTunes which is not supported with Windows Media Player for Windows 7 .

Ten lenders have been approved by Geithner and Co. to pay back $ 68 bÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth of TARP monies .
An encouraging sign of financial repair you say ?
In little over a month we will witness 2nd Q earnings .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ponder this thought ; historically a banks portfolio is comprised of a rather large portion of short - term US FI product .
What are these financial institutions earnings going to look like given the destruction of the short end of the yield curve over the past 5 - trading sessions ?
Do not even talk about mortgages , they have been harder hit !
For instance , last QÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 3 - yr product yielded 1.11 % and after yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s $ 35 b new 3Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s printed 1.94 % !
It was only last week that BOAÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s CEO Lewis said to an Oppenheimer analyst that the next couple of QÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s would be difficult for them .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not put the cart before the donkey again !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Yesterday the only bit of data that traders could chew on was US wholesale inventories .
The results again exceeded analystÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expectations .
The - 1.4 % decline was larger than originally forecasted ( - 1.1 % ) and followed a revised - 1.8 % decrease in Mar. ( - 1.6 % ) .
The month of April was the 8th - consecutative decline as distributors continue to cut excess inventories in line with the pace of decreasing sales .
Do not expect the pace of the inventory drawdown to have much of a bearing on 2nd Q GDP as they are falling at a slower rate .
With sales falling - 0.4 % , the slowest rate in 4 - years , it would take 1.31 - months for distributors to deplete the amount of goods on hand , compared with 1.32 - months in Mar .
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.34 % , GBP +0.55 % , CHF +0.34 % and higher against JPY - 0.25 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.48 % and AUD + 1.23 % .
The loonie rose yesterday as crude oil advanced and global equities pared some of their deeper losses on speculation the worst of the recession may be easing .
Some risk related bids appeared despite the poor underlying employment report last week .
Already this month , the currency has dropped - 2.2 % vs. its largest trading partner after advancing +9.3 % in May , the most in at least 59 - years !
Last weeks employment report point to a moderately worse domestic environment due to the concentration on full - time job losses ( - 58.7 k ) and cooling of wages levels .
Analysts expect the losses to put further downward pressure on future cash flows and disposable incomes .
If there is no spending then there will be no growth !
The BOC in an unprecedented fashion managed to comment on the state of the loonie by noting that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœif the unprecedentedly rapid rise in the Loonie proves persistent , it could fully offset these positive factorsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The BOC is basically confirming that the appreciation is not linked to fundamentals .
Expect the market to continue to sell CAD on USD pullbacks for now .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s see what this morning Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s trade numbers have in store for us !
Last night , the Australian consumer confidence jumped this month by the most in 22 - years ( + 12.7 % to 100.1 ) after the economy unexpectedly avoided a recession .
This has heightened speculation that the RBA has finished cutting interest rates ( 3.00 ) .
Traders continue to look favorable on the currency because of its yield advantage and its association with commodities .
In the short term look for better buying opportunities on pullbacks as the currency marches upwards ( 0.8108 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 71.37 up +136 c ) .
PrincetonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman provided support for the black - stuff yesterday .
He said that the US recession may end later this year and this has prompted speculation that fuel demand may increase .
A weaker greenback has supported oilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s recovery of late ( doubling its value since Dec. ) .
By default , it has increased the appeal of commodities as a hedge against a drop in the USD .
Oil needs to break the support price of $ 64 to gather any true downward momentum and $ 70 on the topside to get any upward movement .
Fundamentals will tell you the opposite .
We have had elevated prices because of a weakening USD .
The world is awash with oil , demand destruction is intact and 19 - year US record inventories remain .
Even last weeks EIA report reveled that crude inventories climbed + 2.9 m barrels to +366 m vs. an expected loss of - 1.6 m .
Crude stocks gained as imports and refineries increased their operating rates to the highest level in 6 - months .
Refineries are operating at 86.3 % of capacity , up + 1.2 % , w/w .
The true fundamentals do not justify these elevated prices as the 4 - week moving average for US consumption is +18.2 m barrels a day , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s down - 7.7 % , y/y .
Even with both OPEC and Russia raising production last month ( to capture some of their capital gains ) does not support higher prices for too long .
OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s output climbed + 1.5 % to an average +28.15 m barrels while RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s output advanced a 3rd straight month ( +0.t9 % ) .
Many believe that oil has climbed too quickly as the rapid gain has been based on stronger equities and a weaker dollar .
However , the frightening part is that if OPEC complied with its Sept. production cuts ( currently only at 77 % ) , this commodity would be much higher !
The ‘ yellow metal ’ has rebounded from its lowest level in 2 - weeks as the decline in the USD has increased the appeal for precious metal as an alternative investment strategy ( $ 962 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,991 up +204 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,102 up +105 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,483 up +78 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backed up 5 bp yesterday ( 3.87 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries advanced yesterday on speculation that yields trading at a 7 - month high would encourage investor demand at the 2 - remaining government debt sales this week ( 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s and long bonds - $ 30 b ) .
However with global equities aggressively rebounding , traders have been happy in cheapening the curve to take down the remaining issues in the O/N session .
Over the past 4 - trading sessions the market has been prematurely pricing in a Fed tightening .
Rates are expected to remain low for most of this year , unless we have any failed auctions on the horizon !

Deborah Kasak , executive director of the National Forum to Accelerate Middle Grades Reform , said research is showing that all students benefit from mixed - ability classes .
“ We see improvements in student behavior , academic performance and teaching , and all that positively affects school culture , ” she said .

Daria Hall , a director with Education Trust , an advocacy group , said that tracking has worsened the situation by funneling poor and minority students into “ low - level and watered - down courses . ”
“ If all we expect of students is for them to watch movies and fill out worksheets , then that ’s what they will give us , ” she said .
In Stamford , black and Hispanic student performance on state tests has lagged significantly behind that of Asians and whites .
In 2008 , 98 percent of Asian students and 92 percent of white students in grades three to eight passed math , and 93 percent and 88 percent reading , respectively .
Among black students , 63 percent passed math , and 56 percent reading ; among Hispanic students , 74 percent passed math and 60 percent reading .
The district plans to keep a top honors level , but put the majority of students in mixed - ability classes , expanding the new system from sixth grade to seventh and eighth over three years .
While the old system tracked students for all subjects based on math and English scores , the new one will allow students to be designated for honors in one subject but not necessarily another , making more students overall eligible for the upper track .
The staff of Cloonan Middle School decided to experiment with mixed - ability classes for the last eight weeks of this school year .
David Rudolph , Cloonan ’s principal , said that parents have long complained that the tracking numbers assigned to students dictate not only their classes but also their friends and cafeteria cliques .
Every summer , at least a dozen parents lobby Mr. Rudolph to move their children to the top track .
“ The zero group is all about status , ” he said .
Jamiya Richardson , who is 11 and in the twos ’ group , said that students all know their own numbers as well as those of their classmates .
“ I do n’t like being classified because it makes you feel like you ’re not smart , ” she said .
I happen to live in half of a duplex .
For those who do not know what a Duplex is , it is like two houses , pushed up against each other .
Well recently the resident of the other half of the duplex moved out , and that half of the duplex is now on the market .
I have no problem with any of that …what I have a problem with is the idiot put in charge of the now vacant duplex ’s yard work .
Between our two driveways is a small strip of grass .
I ’d say it is maybe 12 - 18 inches across .
Well , the other day I stepped outside , and this is what I saw :
That might be a bit hard to make out , but basically the lazy bastard actually went through the trouble of pushing his probably 20 ″ mower over only 6 - 10 ″ of the strip ?
Back when I had a neighbor , the unspoken deal was whoever was mowing their lawn would just trim the whole strip , it took the exact same amount of gas , time , and effort .
Actually less effort since you did n’t need to try to keep a perfect center line , the mower is wider than the strip .
So whoever the the seller hired to do the mowing , is probably retarded .
I ’ve decided to not mow that center strip ever again so it ’ll just look funnier and funnier .
Or maybe mow stripes in it ?

When dealing with Lawn Mowers , remember :
Be kind , rewind .
THE comments of one senior NRL representative player indicate how difficult it could be to change the sexual behaviour and attitudes of elite league players .
He warned group sex among NRL players would continue regardless of a warnings from chief executive David Gallop that unsavoury sexual acts would put their contracts at risk .
The representative player told the Herald that his colleagues were left stunned by Gallop 's hardline stance when no player had been convicted of sexual assault , adding that the caution would quickly be forgotten .
" It 's fine for David Gallop to come out and say you can't have group sex but the last thing blokes will be thinking about on a Friday night at the club is David Gallop , " said the player , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
" I do n't know how a chief executive can come out and say we can't have group sex if it 's consensual .
It 's like discrimination because that is a person 's private life .
It 's like saying you can't be homosexual , or you can't have such - and - such sexual preferences .
How can he tell us what we can do in our private lives ?
What if there 's more women than guys , is that wrong , too ?
Today marks the first release of YARD in almost a year .
Although technically speaking the new release is n’t that much more featureful than 0.2.2 , this release marks a pretty huge milestone in YARD ’s development .
It turned out to be extremely difficult ( for me ) to keep up development with a full school schedule .
YARD sets out to accomplish a heck of a lot more than one person can handle on a part - time basis , but the fact that it ’s starting to come together is really what is worth celebrating here .
New Parser , Stronger Code
That said , there are still some significant improvements in the 0.2.3 release .
Plenty of stability and performance fixes were added , and a completely new parser for Ruby 1.9 was implemented based on the new Ripper parser that comes with the 1.9 standard library .
Those who have been using YARD know that it has its own homegrown parser built from the ground up .
While I ’m impressed that I was even able to write a Ruby parser that works 80 % of the time , it was quite lacking in both speed and robustness .
Although Natalie Weizenbaum ( of Haml fame ) contributed some great refactoring and quality improvement patches to the parser , it still has some pretty obvious limitations .
The new 1.9 - only parser will be the face of YARD looking forward , especially as people will start migrating to Ruby 1.9 themselves .
The 1.8.x parser is still supported and maintained as far as bug fixes go , though new functionality probably should not be expected .
If you ’re not yet convinced that Ruby 1.9 is worth the trouble for your project , consider these benchmark results of the new ripper parser parsing the YARD codebase twice :
yard ( master ) $ ruby - v ruby 1.9.1p0 ( 2009-01-30 revision 21907 ) [ i386-darwin9.6.0 ] yard ( master ) $ ruby benchmarks/ripper_parser.rb Rehearsal
------------------------------------------------- <strong>rip-parser
1.930000 0.020000 1.950000 ( 2.004864 ) </strong > yard - parser 4.700000 0.020000 4.720000 ( 4.712828 ) ---------------------------------------- total : 6.670000sec user system total real < strong > rip - parser 1.760000 0.000000 1.760000 ( 1.763015 ) </ strong > yard - parser 4.720000 0.020000 4.740000 ( 4.755574 )
The comparison here is between the new parser used when you run YARD in Ruby 1.9 versus my old pure - ruby implementation .
The difference is significant ; a speed improvement of nearly 2.7x .
Realize again that these are both running in 1.9 , so we ’re not even comparing the speed benefit you get from using YARV over MRI .
That result is actually :
yard ( master ) $ ruby - v ruby 1.8.7 ( 2009-01 - 28 patchlevel 99 ) [ i686-darwin9.6.0 ] yard ( master ) $ ruby benchmarks/ripper_parser.rb Rehearsal
------------------------------------------------- yard - parser 7.820000 0.030000 7.850000 ( 7.859455 ) ---------------------------------------- total : 7.850000sec user system total real yard - parser 8.070000 0.020000 8.090000 ( 8.114952 )
Note that I had to modify the benchmark script to ignore the ripper parser here .
So , in Ruby 1.8.x , the fastest YARD can parse its own codebase twice is roughly 8 seconds .
Compare this to running YARD in Ruby 1.9.1 ( previous results ) , which can parse nearly over 4 times faster .
This becomes significant on large projects like Rails , which takes 11 seconds to parse all of code in 1.9 , but roughly 65 seconds under Ruby 1.8.7.
65 seconds is a long time to wait to parse code ; and that does n’t even count HTML generation , which takes an even more significant amount of time .
Plenty of New Documentation
I ’ll be the first to admit , for a documentation tool , YARD is surely lacking in documentation .
I take this seriously , but at the same time , I ’m only one person and there ’s a lot to write about .
I made it a point this time around to spend this entire last week brushing up documentation to make YARD easier to jump into .
YARD now has a great Getting Started guide which should cover the really basic aspects of how to get around .
More importantly , as a developer tool , there is also a hefty Technical Overview guide covering all of the major components of the project and how a developer could take advantage of them .
In this release alone I ’ve written roughly 7,948 new words of documentation , and I ’ve barely scratched the surface .
YARD has tremendous potential and tons of use cases , so writing about it all will take time , but it will happen .
Looking Forward
So in the end , this release was very important .
The parser was something that was on the table for a long time , dating back to my first roadmap to 1.0 post last year .
Now that it ’s complete , we can start looking ahead .
As more of the groundwork is properly laid out , it becomes easier to move forward .
The next release will be focusing on drastically improving the quality of the HTML templates , so expect bigger changes in the coming months .
By the way , if you did n’t notice , YARD got a new site face - lift , so check out the site .
A University of Colorado at Boulder team has uncovered an ancient and previously unknown Maya agricultural system -- a large manioc field intensively cultivated as a staple crop that was buried and exquisitely preserved under a blanket of ash by a volcanic eruption in present - day El Salvador 1,400 years ago .
Evidence shows the manioc field -- at least one - third the size of a football field -- was harvested just days before the eruption of the Loma Caldera volcano near San Salvador in roughly A.D. 600 , said CU - Boulder anthropology Professor Payson Sheets , who is directing excavations at the ancient village of Ceren .
The cultivated field of manioc was discovered adjacent to Ceren , which was buried under 17 feet of ash and is considered the best preserved ancient farming village in all of Latin America .
The ancient planting beds of the carbohydrate - rich tuber are the first and only evidence of an intensive manioc cultivation system at any New World archaeology site , said Sheets .
While two isolated portions of the manioc field were discovered in 2007 following radar work and limited excavation , 18 large test pits dug in spring 2009 -- each measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet -- allowed the archaeologists to estimate the size of the field and assess the related agricultural activity that went on there .
Sheets said manioc pollen has been found at archaeological sites in Belize , Mexico and Panama , but it is not known whether it was cultivated as a major crop or was just remnants of a few garden plants .
" This is the first time we have been able to see how ancient Maya grew and harvested manioc , " said Sheets , who discovered Ceren in 1978 .
Ash hollows in the manioc planting beds at Ceren left by decomposed plant material were cast in dental plaster by the team to preserve their shape and size , said Sheets .
Evidence showed the field was harvested and then replanted with manioc stalk cuttings just a few days before the eruption of the volcano .
A few anthropologists have suspected that manioc tubers -- which can be more than three feet long and as thick as a man 's arm -- were a dietary salvation for ancient , indigenous societies living in large cities in tropical Latin America .
Corn , beans and squash have long been known to be staples of the ancient Maya , but they are sensitive to drought and require fertile soils , said Sheets .

" As ' high anxiety ' crops , they received a lot of attention , including major roles in religious and cosmological activities of the Maya , " said Sheets .
" But manioc , which grows well in poor soils and is highly drought resistant did not .
I like to think of manioc like an old Chevy gathering dust in the garage that does n't get much attention , but it starts right up every time when the need arises . "
Calculations by Sheets indicate the Ceren planting fields would have produced roughly 10 metric tons of manioc annually for the 100 to 200 villagers believed to have lived there .
" The question now is what these people in the village were doing with all that manioc that was harvested all at once , " he said .
" Even if they were gorging themselves , they could not have consumed that much . "
The CU - Boulder team also found the shapes and sizes of individual manioc planting ridges and walkways varied widely .
" This indicates the individual farmers at Ceren had control over their families ' fields and cultivated them they way they wanted , without an external higher authority telling them what to do and how to do it , " he said .
The team also found that the manioc fields and adjacent cornfields at Ceren were oriented 30 degrees east of magnetic north -- the same orientation as the village buildings and the public town center , said Sheets .
" The villagers laid out the agricultural fields and the town structures with the same orientation as the nearby river , showing the importance and reverence the Maya had for water , " he said .
The volcano at Ceren shrouded adobe structures , thatched roofs , house beams , woven baskets , sleeping mats , garden tools and grain caches .
The height of the corn stalks and other evidence indicate the eruption occurred early on an August evening , he said .

Because it is unlikely that the people of Ceren were alone in their intensive cultivation of manioc , Sheets and his colleagues are now investigating chemical and microscopic botanical evidence at other Maya archaeological sites that may be indicators of manioc cultivation and processing .
Sheets said Maya villagers living in the region today have a long tradition of cutting manioc roots into small chunks , drying them eight days , then grinding the chunks into a fine , flour - like powder known as almidón .
Almidón can be stored almost indefinitely , and traditionally was used by indigenous people in the region for making tamales and tortillas and as a thickening agent for stews , he said .
Since indigenous peoples in tropical South America use manioc today to brew alcoholic beverages , including beer , the CU - Boulder team will be testing ceramic vessels recovered from various structures at Ceren for traces of manioc .
To date , 12 structures have been excavated , and others detected by ground - penetrating radar remain buried , he said .
Sheets is particularly interested in vessels from a religious building at Ceren excavated in 1991 .
The structure contained such items as a deer headdress painted red , blue and white ; a large , alligator - shaped painted pot ; the bones of butchered deer ; and evidence that large quantities of food items like meat , corn , beans and squash were prepared on - site and dispensed to villagers from the structure , said Sheets .
Ceren 's residents apparently were participating in a spiritual ceremony in the building when the volcano erupted , and did not return to their adobe homes , which excavations showed were void of people and tied shut from the outside .
" I think there may have been an emergency evacuation from the ceremonial building when the volcano erupted , " he said .
To date , no human remains have been found at Ceren .
The research team also included CU - Boulder doctoral student Christine Dixon , Professor David Letz and graduate student Angie Hood from the University of Cincinnati , University of Costa Rica graduate student George Maloof and University of Central Florida graduate student Andrew Tetlow .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
BEIRUT ( Reuters ) -
An anti-Syrian coalition defeated Hezbollah in Lebanon ’s parliamentary election on Sunday in a blow to Syria and Iran and a boost to the United States .
“ Congratulations to Lebanon , congratulations to democracy , congratulations to freedom , ” the coalition ’s leader Saad al - Hariri said in a victory speech at his mansion in Beirut .
The outcome was also welcome news for Saudi Arabia and Egypt , which back Hariri ’s “ March 14 ” alliance - the date of a 2005 rally against Syria ’s military presence in Lebanon .
“ We have lost the election , ” conceded a senior politician close to the bloc of Shi’ite groups Hezbollah and Amal and Christian ally Michel Aoun .
“ We accept the result as the will of the people . ”
The vote will be viewed as a stinging setback to Aoun , who held the biggest bloc of Christian MPs in the outgoing assembly and had hoped to seal his claim to speak for the Christians .
A source in Hariri ’s campaign predicted a decisive victory , with his bloc taking at least 70 of the assembly ’s 128 seats .
Perhaps 100 of the seats were virtually decided in advance , thanks to sectarian voting patterns and political deals , with Sunni and Shi’ite communities voting solidly on opposing sides .
The real electoral battle centered on Christian areas , where Aoun was up against former President Amin Gemayel ’s Phalange Party , Samir Geagea ’s Lebanese Forces and independents .
Lebanon ’s rival camps are at odds over Hezbollah ’s guerrilla force , which outguns the Lebanese army , and ties with Syria , which dominated Lebanon for three decades until 2005 .
The likeliest outcome of the poll is another “ national unity ” government , analysts say .
SINIORA WINS SEAT
According to unofficial results , Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , who has enjoyed Western and Arab support , won a parliamentary seat in the mainly Sunni southern city of Sidon .

Siniora , 66 , has headed the cabinet since the Hariri - led coalition won the 2005 parliamentary election .
He led the government through 18 months of political conflict with Hezbollah and its allies , but is not expected to keep his post .
Voting was relatively trouble - free across Lebanon , although there were many reports of vote - buying before the poll , with some Lebanese expatriates being offered free air tickets home .
The United States , which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group , has linked future aid to Lebanon to the shape and policies of the next government .
Hezbollah , which says it must keep its arms to deter Israel , is part of the outgoing cabinet .

The anti-Syrian coalition has enjoyed firm backing from many Western countries since the 2005 assassination of Hariri ’s father Rafik al - Hariri .
The coalition took power in an election following Hariri ’s killing , but struggled to govern in the face of a sometimes violent conflict with Hezbollah and its allies .
Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah said any new government had to be based on partnership , not on one side monopolizing power .
“ Whatever the results of the election , we cannot change the standing delicate balances or repeat the experiences of the past which led to catastrophes on Lebanon , ” he told Reuters .
“ Whoever wants political stability , the preservation of national unity and the resurrection of Lebanon will find no choice but to accept the principle of consensus . ”
Hezbollah and its allies insisted on being given veto power in a unity cabinet -- a demand that caused an 18 - month political deadlock until it was granted under a Qatari - brokered deal that followed street fighting in Beirut in May 2008 .
Leading anti-Syrian politician Walid Jumblatt said he opposed the idea of veto power for the opposition .
Asked if they should be in the government , he told Reuters : “ Yes , but I can not decide on my own .
I am part of a coalition and it should be a unanimous decision . ”
Tensions in Lebanon have mostly been kept in check since the Qatari - mediated accord dragged the country back from the brink of civil war .
A thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and Syria has also helped maintain stability in recent months .
Security was tight , with 50,000 troops and police deployed across Lebanon , especially in the most contested districts .
Security sources said one person was wounded by gunfire in the northern city of Tripoli and there were brawls between rival supporters elsewhere , but no reports of serious fighting .
Baroud said preliminary figures showed a turnout of more than 54 percent , a high figure for Lebanon , where hundreds of thousands of the 3.26 million eligible voters live abroad .

Advertisement Prostitutes in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu have begun taking karate lessons to protect themselves from violent customers and pimps .
The women say they were so fed up with abuse that they approached a local community group for help .
The organisers hope the course in the ancient self - defence technique sends a message that violence against sex workers must stop .
India is thought to have nearly three million sex workers .
Most live on the fringes of society and have few legal rights .
Correspondents say that means they often have little or no choice but to put up with violence and harassment .
' I will kick him '
Dressed in white and wearing masks , the first 75 women to take the karate course in the coastal city of Madras ( Chennai ) had to brave intense heat as they practised their moves .
Through karate we can protect ourselves and also save others
Martha , sex worker
They trained together for nearly five hours a day , mostly learning how to fight .
Now the women say they feel more able to protect themselves .
" Even though I may not be able to attack a group of five men when they attack me , I am fully confident now that I can escape , " one sex worker , Santhi ( not her real name ) , told the BBC Tamil service .
" I think I can easily handle one man at any given time .
I face physical abuse on a daily basis and have been abused and been beaten up by my clients many times .
" A thug once stripped me of my clothes and told me to run naked .
From now on , I think nobody can do that to me .
I will kick him . "
The Indian Community Welfare Organisation is providing the training free of charge .
Its founder secretary , AJ Hariharan , said Tamil Nadu state alone was thought to have about 90,000 commercial sex workers .
" Many of them , particularly those who operate individually on the streets face physical abuse on a daily basis - not only from their customers , but also from local thugs and policemen , " he told the BBC Tamil service .
" They attack these commercial sex workers , rob their money and force them into having unprotected sex .
We want to train them in karate so that they can protect themselves from these violent attacks . "
Mr Hariharan said the aim was to build the self esteem and self confidence of the women .
" We are going to train 300 sex workers in the second phase and 500 sex workers after that .
" We are trying to send a loud and clear message to those who abuse these sex workers that they cannot abuse them any more .

The Stock Market Is A Zero-Sum Game
It seems to me that it should be intuitively obvious that the stock market is a zero- sum game , but I guess some people do n't think so .
Maybe they do n't understand what a zero - sum game is .
Or maybe they have some other reason for wanting to believe that the market magically creates wealth .
Professor Lawrence Harris is chairman of the Dept of Finance at the University of Southern California and Chief Economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission , so he knows more about the stock market than probably most brokers ever will .
Unlike the brokers , Harris has no financial conflict of interest in the question .
His seminal paper " The Winners and Losers of the Zero - Sum Game " ( now included as part of his book Trading and Exchanges ) carefully nuances the zero-sum question .
Considered alone , the market is a zero-sum game , but in a wider context certain types of traders derive non-monetary benefit ( such as the thrill of gambling , or the risk management due to time - shifting funds , or just the cost of learning ) from their monetary losses , which makes it positive - sum for those people .
My concern is only the cash - in / cash - out aspects of market trading , which Prof .
Harris assumes to be zero - sum without spending any effort proving it .
I guess it is too obvious to a person of his intellectual caliber .
The " Winners and Losers " paper discusses the title topic in that context .
He 's rather brutal about who the losers are , but he admits that they are necessary for the market to function efficiently , which seems to me a curious way to look at it .
For those with less financial sophistication than Prof .
Harris , I offer the following analysis .
Zero Sum
The NASDAQ glossary defines the term thus :
Zero-Sum Game
A situation in which one participant 's gains result only from another participant 's equivalent losses .
The net change in total wealth among participants is zero ; the wealth is just shifted from one to another .
Checkers is the simplest form of zero sum game , because there is exactly one winner and one loser , and the winner " won " ( the only point is winning , not by how much ) , and the loser " lost " by exactly the same score .
Or else it is a draw with no winner or loser .
Poker is another zero sum game .
Some players come away from an evening at poker with more money than they went in , and for every dollar they won , some other player lost a dollar .
Poker illustrates another important property of zero - sum games , namely that the sum of any number of zero - sum games is still a zero - sum game .
Each poker hand is a zero - sum game with exactly one winner ; everybody else lost , winner takes all .
However , after the evening is over , you can add up every player 's winnings and losses , and the net result is still a zero - sum game : some players won and other players lost , and the total of winnings and losses is zero .
Exactly all the money that came to the game left the game .
There is another property of zero -sum games that the poker game illustrates , which is that the winnings and the losses are all there is to the game .
It does n't matter how much money any one player has in his bank account -- or even in his wallet on game night -- his winnings at the game came from some other player 's losses ( or his losses went to some other player 's winnings .
There is a third property of zero - sum games that we can learn from poker games , which is that the bottom line is the bottom line .
You can win some hands and lose some hands , but when the evening is over , the sum of your winnings and losses is your score for the evening .
If one player starts early in the evening , but gets tired and goes home , and then some other player comes in later and plays until they turn the lights out , it 's still a zero- sum game , with the total winnings of all the players exactly matched by the total losses .
If the early quitter left $ 100 richer than he came , you can be sure that among the rest of the players there were losses adding up to $ 100 .
Maybe the latecomer lost it all , or maybe the players who stuck it out the whole evening lost some of it , but the total is still zero ; no money was left on the table , and none magically came into the game from some other source than the players themselves .
A Ponzi scheme is another form of zero -sum game .
Each player pays in a fixed amount , which is given to the player who recruited him .
That new player then goes out and recruits more players , and thus profits from their buy - in payment .
Every dollar that the early players take away from the scheme is paid into the scheme by some other player .
Who are the losers ?
All the last people to enter the game , when there are no more people to recruit , they lost their entry fee .
Their losses exactly match the profits of the early adopters .
Social Security is an example of a Ponzi scheme , and people are starting to recognize that we are running out of players to ante up the premiums which pay out in benefits to the older people .
Except that Social Security is not strictly a zero-sum game because Uncle Sam will come riding in on his white horse in 2040 and collect some other kind of taxes to pay out the outstanding benefits -- or maybe Uncle Sam wo n't come riding in , and the latecomers really will be losers .
Most everybody younger than 50 sort of expects that .
Stock Market
Leakage
There is another form of leakage in the stocks game that , like the brokerage fees , is usually so small compared to the total trades ( profits and losses ) as to be negligible , and that is the liquidation value when the company is delisted .
Many companies get bought out by other companies in a stock swap .
When that happens , the stockholder 's investment is still in play , but it 's like interrupting a poker hand to merge two games : everything is still in play , but the chances of winning or losing changed .
Many -- probably most , if published figures are to be believed -- companies just go bankrupt and close their doors .
The investors holding stock in those companies are the losers , the final round of Ponzi buy - ins who gave profit to the other players from their own losses .
Sometimes a company is delisted by going private .
That is no different than a single investor buying up all the stock .
That 's exactly what it is : that player put in all the money that any other outstanding players profited from ( if at all ) .
The buyer then can attempt to liquidate the assets , or otherwise try to recover his investment , but it 's off the board .
The sum has already been zeroed .
The company going private is the exact opposite of the initial product offering ( IPO ) , when a private company takes money out of the system that it did not put in .
Somebody else put that money in .
When a company goes private again , the final buyer puts in money that it never gets back out .
These are both leaks in the game .
Virtually all stock transactions are neither IPO purchases nor buyouts .
These normal trades are zero-sum .
There is another form of leakage that is strictly speaking not a part of the stock trading game , so it does not figure in whether it is a zero - sum game , and that is dividends .
Dividends are not included in either the purchase or sale price of the stock , so they are essentially irrelevant to whether the sum is zero .
However , whoever happens to be the owner of record on the day the dividends are announced gets paid .
Like the other leaks in the system , dividends are miniscule compared to the vast majority of stock trades , so their impact on the profits and losses in the market is negligible .
Most people are looking for capital gains profits , not dividends .
Many companies pay no dividends at all .
Stockholders accept that .
Myths
" Zero-sum requires a fixed sum . "
This is easily seen to be false in the poker game .
The pot that the winner takes can be any size , from slightly more than the players ' antes , up to the total wallet of some player plus comparable bets from all the other players still in the game .
In a Ponzi scheme the total pot keeps growing until you run out of players .
Some people try to argue that the value of the stocks reflects the net worth of the underlying companies -- which is often correlated -- while ignoring the fact that none of that stock price ever gets back into ( nor out of ) the company 's bottom line .
Other commentators agree that there is no connection while still arguing that it is not a zero - sum game .
The fact is , the company profitability may go up or down , but the stock is still sold for whatever the next investor is willing to pay for it .
The company net worth may figure in the buyer 's thinking , but the money comes out of the investor 's pocket , not the corporate bank account .
" The stock market creates wealth . "
This is obviously false .
Unlike Social Security , no dollar ever comes out of the market into an investor 's pocket that did n't go into the market from another investor 's pocket .
The underlying companies whose stock is being traded can create wealth , but none of that wealth ever shows up in the stock market -- unless the company buys back its own stock and goes private .
As I pointed out above , this is a rare event .
All the other transactions just move money from one investor to another .
No wealth is created nor destroyed in the process .
Except brokerage fees .
" Total market capitalization increases . "
This may be true , but it has nothing to do with whether it is a zero - sum game or not .
That 's like saying poker is not a zero - sum game because as the evening wears on there are more tables in the saloon playing poker , and the total of all the pots on all the tables is increasing .
True , the slice through one instant of time , across all corporate stocks listed in the market might have a market capitalization greater than the last time you looked , but each company is a zero- sum game , and the sum of many zero - sum games is still a zero - sum game .
The size of the pot on the table during one hand is irrelevant to the question of whether the winnings of the winners equals the losses of the losers .
Notes
Cornell Law School News Service noted that 15 large public companies ( out of 300 ) filed bankruptcy in 1997 .
At 5 % per year , the average lifespan to bankruptcy is 20 years .
Since some companies survive much longer , that means many more must fail sooner to attain that average .
We should remember Ruskin 's famous injunction : " There is no wealth but life . "
In other words , the best architect is n't necessarily the richest , nor the writer , nor the doctor .
Talent and commitment have only a loose connection to salary .
To reduce the intensity of feeling about salaries , you can either pay everyone exactly the same , or try your best to educate people into seeing salary as not especially significant – just as we have fortunately and heroically managed to teach people to see race and religion as incidental to people 's characters .
Highlights
Finally !
Finally we drop the MDI user interface and switch to dockable windows .
They are simpler to use , more flexible , waste less screen space .
Well , you know it yourself .
The new interface also includes the improved hex viewer and stack view .
The new hex view is much easier to use , can display the data in various formats , allows editing in - place .
There is a lot to discover , some screenshots can be checked in the gallery .
Probably the fastest thing to do is to visit the comparison page for more detail about processor modules .
In the endless pursuit to improve the disassembly output , we continue to add new methods , tricks , and heuristic rules to IDA .
This time the biggest changes are in the ARM and PC modules .
The ARM module handles the stack frame , type information , call / jump instructions better than before .
The PC module knows about more code patterns , like switch and position - independent code idioms , detects more exception handlers , etc .
Naturally , after adding Windbg support in v5.4 , we had to add support for crash dumps .
Just specify a crash dump file as the input file and IDA will create a database from it .
The debugger can be ‘ launched ’ to enter the familiar debugger environment with module , thread , and stack windows , where information can be retrieved the usual way .
The only thing you cannot do is to resume the execution , that would be an overkill 😉
The previous addition required a big , hopefully invisible , change in the kernel , because the existing storage method could not handle huge gigabyte segments .
Previous versions of IDA had a hard limit on the addressing space of the program : max 256MBytes in the default configuration .
Modern programs routinely allocate much bigger memories , so we had to find a solution .
Now , if a crash dump segment is bigger than a certain size , IDA automatically chooses the sparse storage method .
Instead of storing information about every single byte of the program , IDA remebers only useful information .
Thus , a 25 MB uninitialized array requires just a few bytes of storage to describe it , not 100 MB as before .
We would also explicitly mention and say ‘ thank you ’ to the users who contributed to this release of IDA .
Bernhard Mueller from SEC Consult GmbH was very kind to investigate why the Symbian debugger was failing on new devices and contributed an improvement .
Robert Krkic generously shared his IDS files for Symbian systems with all IDA users .
Thank you guys , your contributions make IDA better and easier to use !
Do you remember that you can add emulated API functions to the Bochs debugger ?
Just provide an implementation in IDC / Python / C++ and your function is called .
For example , you could provide an implementation of the socket ( ) function that would open a socket on the host system or do something else .
While this possibility is very useful and remains in place , we added more predefined functions .
Now the Visual Studio and Borland C/C++ startup code can be executed without generating exceptions and you can focus on the ‘ real ’ code .
In addition , we also added the ‘ Bochs rc file loader ’ .
It really helps if you already have a bochsrc file and want to debug it with IDA .
Just specify it as the input file and IDA will create a nice database for you .
No need to create a dummy database , populate it with the code from the boot sector , etc .
Other , probably less visible , improvements include the PDB plugin , the type system , more SDK functions ( check out the exec_request_t if you develop multithreaded plugins ) , etc .
The full list is below :

Top 10 Family Outdoor Activities for Great Outdoors Month 2020
The summer solstice marks the astronomical beginning of Summer .
With the changing of the season to warmer temperatures , the sizzling heat gives people a reason to escape the stale indoor air and enjoy healthy fresh air .
Finding outdoor activities for the entire family that everyone will enjoy can be cumbersome .
There are many outdoor activities that can be fun and fit for everyone .
1. Picnics have always been the traditional form of outdoor hobby .
For those that would prefer a more laid back activity , a picnic might be your best choice .
Picnics are generally centered around your food choice .
To even make the picnic extra fun , try having a themed picnic .
Choose your theme around your food choice .
You can even incorporate entertaining lessons into the themed picnic .
For example , if you chose to have Italian food , then come up with topics surrounding Italian lifestyle or history and have discussions or games centered around Italian .
You could maybe even discover new words in that foreign language and use them while you talk about the topics .
Also , not only can picnics be surrounded by food selection , but perhaps also by activity .
For example , you can have a nature trail picnic .
Select picnic areas that have natural trails .
But make sure it is somewhere were you can leave your picnic items because it would not be enjoyable if you had to lug around your picnic basket .
2. Camping is a great outdoor activity .
Camping usually demands a lot of preplanning .
To go camping you would need to choose whether on sleeping in a tent or if you will be renting a cabin .
Also , depending on the length of the camping trip , you will need to decide what things you will need to bring for food preparation .
Building a camp fire can allow fun activities such as weenie roasts and smores .
Camping can incorporate many other activities .
One popular camping activity is fishing .
So , do n’t forget your fishing rods and worms .
3 . If you do n’t have a lot of time on your hand , but would like an outdoor activity that fits your time budget ; visiting your local park might be your choice .
Many towns and cities have a least one park .
If you are fortunate enough to have a choice of parks , it is good to visit the park briefly to determine if it is the park for you .
If you have children , you may want a park with lots of outdoor play equipment .
If you are a pet owner and want to take your pet , it is important that you know what the pet policy is for that park .
A popular park activity is Frisbee tossing .
This is fun for both children and dogs .
Also , kite flying is fun , but only if the park has a good open area with no trees or power lines .
4. Swimming is an activity that is generally popular with most kids .
When the temperatures rise , cooling off in a big swimming pool can be ideal .
There are many options when it comes to swimming .
If you do n’t mind spending money , you can visit a water theme park .
Also , most cities have public pools that you can visit .
If money is tight , you can always purchase above a ground pool and enjoy swimming all summer long .
5 . Volunteer work is a very rewarding activity .
Incorporating volunteer work into an outdoor activity is very simple .
Cleaning up a park is a great outdoor volunteer activity .
If there is not a volunteer group , you can either clean solo or you can form your very own volunteer clean up crew .
This gets others involved and it cleans the environment .
6 . Beaches are the epitome of summer fun .
There are so many things you can do at the beach .
If you are the athletic type , surf boarding or boogie boarding might be your activity of choice .
Also , if you are the adventurous type , you can try wind surfing or parasailing .
For those that would much rather unwind on the beach , reading a good book as the waves crash can be relaxing .
For children , have a sand castle building competition .
7 . Hiking can be another rewarding and healthy outdoor activity .
Hiking can come in all forms .
Whether it is a simple nature walk or a rigorous mountain hike , you can bet that hiking can be interesting .
To make the hiking experience even better , a simple scavenger hunt can be quiet fun .
Prior to the hiking trip , make a list of things that you would see along the hiking trail .
Then as you are hiking , try to find things on your list .
For kids , this can be very educational .
8 . Golfing is great relaxing activity that the whole family can enjoy .
Teaching kids to enjoy golf can be worthwhile .
Golfing is an activity that they will enjoy for the rest of their lives .
Golfing can be a wonderful social activity and it gets you outdoors to breath the fresh air .
9 . Another great outdoor activity is gardening .
Gardening is a fabulous activity for children .
With gardening you can either plant flowers to improve the appearance of your yard or you can plant vegetables .
Growing vegetables can be gratifying for children because they will see the process that vegetables undergo from a seedling all the way to the kitchen table .
Also , keeping a garden is a summer long outdoor activity and requires patience for a successful outcome .
10 .
Astronomy is another great outdoor activity that most people do n’t think about doing .
Astronomy can be a fun and education activity that can be enjoyed by the entire family .
During the dog days of summer when the heat is very excessive , most individuals will remain indoors .
But once the sun sets and the temperatures diminish , this paves the way for an evening of sky viewing .
Visiting planetariums and observatories to brush up on your astronomy may make your astronomy time additionally meaningful .
Whether you are engaging in docile activities such as gardening or picnicking or more vigorous activities such as hiking or surfing ; there will always be great outdoor activities for any individual or family .
Involving your entire family or extending the welcome out to your neighbor or friends can prove to be both socially healthy as well as physically healthy .
Remember to always choose safe activities that everyone will enjoy and always come prepared with water , first aid kit , and / or maps .
If your choice of outdoor activity includes nature , be sure to be aware of poison ivy or oak and insects in order to keep everyone safe .
Put on your outdoor clothes and shoes , grab your family and head outdoors .

Louisiana residents may find themselves paying an extra fee on top of their regular Internet costs if the state 's House of Representatives has its way .
The House voted 81 to 9 in favor of the 15 - cent monthly levy Thursday , with the bill 's sponsors arguing that the money would go towards fighting Internet - related crimes in the state .
The bill now moves to the state 's Senate for a vote , though it faces opposition from Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal .
Under the proposed measure , every resident who gets a bill for Internet access will be charged the fee starting in 2010 ; public schools and libraries are exempt .
The move is expected to raise $ 2.4 million for the " Internet Crimes Investigation Fund " of Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell 's office , which plans to use the money to investigate cases of child pornography , Internet fraud , and other online sex crimes .
According to the text of the bill ( PDF ) , it would also train law enforcement how to properly handle crimes committed against citizens as a result of their having Internet access .
Naturally , the measure is largely being pitched as a way to save the children .
" I do n't think that 15 cents per month is too much to ask for our children 's protection , " Representative Simone Champagne ( D - Jeanerette ) told the House floor , according to WWL - TV .
However , opponents to the legislation are skeptical about the idea of raising money for " every criminal element that 's out there , " not to mention the supposed slippery slope that will come with it .
" Today it 's Internet access .
Tomorrow , what 's it going to be ?
A subscription to DirecTV ? " questioned Rep. Austin Badon ( D - New Orleans ) .
There 's also the small technicality that the " fee " may be interpreted as a tax .
If it 's a tax , it could potentially violate the federal Tax Freedom
Act that was enacted in 1998 and most recently extended in 2007 for seven years ; it bars local governments from levying access taxes on Internet connections , though purchases can be subject to applicable state taxes .
The law is meant to promote Internet usage and facilitate wider - spread adoption of broadband across the US , though once broadband access becomes as common as electricity and water , many lawmakers would like to see the issue revisited , as Internet taxes could prove a lucrative source of funding for state and local governments .
Jindal 's office reiterated in a statement issued yesterday that he opposes raising taxes of any kind on the citizens of Louisiana , while supporting a crackdown on " sex offenders that prey on our children . "
Take the iPod Shuffle .
How could you be expected to guess what that tiny metal box does by looking at it ?
There are no clues to suggest that it might play music .
Like most other digital devices , the Shuffle is ( literally ) an inscrutable box of tricks .
Apple ’s designers conceived the latest model as a subtle joke on the demise of “ form follows ... ”
It is so small , half the size of its predecessor , that they could make it in the same shape as one of those pins that clip on to clothing .
This means the Shuffle ’s form does reflect one of its functions , albeit the very minor one of attaching itself to a jacket , but gives no hint as to its more important role of storing and playing hundreds of songs .
Joking aside , the dislocation of form and function has set a new challenge for designers : how to help us to operate ever more complex digital products .
In ye olden days when form did follow function , you could guess roughly how to use an object from its appearance .
But our ability to work out how to download and play music on a Shuffle is largely determined by the design quality of the software that operates it — the “ user interface ” in geek - speak , or “ U.I . ”
If the “ U.I. ” is well designed , you should be able to use the device so intuitively that you will not have to think about it .
But if it is badly designed , the process will seem so confusing that you will probably blame yourself for doing something wrong .

That is why the first wave of U.I. designs sought to reassure us by using visual references to familiar objects to help us to operate digital ones .
Take the typewriter keyboards on computers , and video game controllers modeled on TV remote control pads .
As our confidence has grown , U.I. design has become more sophisticated , increasingly relating to our physical behavior , rather than objects .
One landmark is Nintendo ’s Wii games system , which is operated by replicating the movements we would make if playing for real : from firing a “ gun , ” to whacking a “ tennis ball ” with a “ racquet . ”
Another is Apple ’s iPhone , which replaced the traditional keyboard with a touch - sensitive screen that achieves a similar effect to the Wii by responding to the natural movements of our hands .
The same goes for the thousands of applications , or “ apps , ” invented for the iPhone , mostly by amateur programmers .
Over a billion apps have been downloaded in the last nine months , and one reason for their popularity is that they feel so instinctive .
An example is “ Brushes , ” the $ 4.99 app with which the artist Jorge Colombo “ drew ” the cover of the June 1 edition of The New Yorker on his iPhone by creating digital layers of “ paint ” with his fingers , just as if he was making brushstrokes on a canvas .
NEWPORT - A
Yachats woman in court for feeding the bears was ordered this morning to leave her property and stay away from neighboring properties for three years .
Judge Thomas Branford ordered Karen Noyes , 61 , to leave her home on Yachats River Road by Aug. 31 , as a special condition of her sentence of three years probation for chasing and harassing wildlife .
Noyes must also stay away from a seven - mile stretch of the road for the duration of her probation .
In sentencing Noyes , Branford spoke for more than 30 minutes , calling her behavior stunning and offensive .
" I could n't agree more with the jury 's verdict , " Branford said .
" I commend you for loving the animals ...
It 's not enough to love .
You have to love the right way and you still have n't .
Bears are not your pets to do with as you please . "
Noyes was cited for feeding the bears last year after she called the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife seeking help in getting rid of the bears .
Witnesses for the state testified that Noyes had been warned to stop feeding the bears as early as 2003 but refused to listen .
During the Noyes trial , neighbors testified they 'd become frightened to walk outside their homes because her feeding had attracted so many animals .
One woman told of awaking to find a bear coming through the dog door .
Another said a bear had wiped out a flock of 60 endangered farm birds .
" I am pleased , " said neighbor Al Green , who had one of the bears shot after it menaced his ex-wife .
" I think it is really great .
I think it will be safer for the neighbors and bears , too .
Hopefully we will not have to kill more bears . "
Noyes said she plans to appeal the conviction .
" I guess I am evicted from my own house for three years , " Noyes said outside of the courtroom .
" I have never been warned about feeding the bears .
Ever .
He is convinced I was .
None of my neighbors ever warned me .
Not once .
That is the truth .
He has his mind made up that what Fish and Game said was true . "
Previous coverage of the case attracted widespread attention .

Since the beginning of modern science we have been solving the great mysteries around us .
Because of recent advances in science and technology we now have the ability to unravel some unknowns like never before .
This list consists of 10 such mysteries which , fortunately , do not render any of our previous “ unsolved mysteries ” lists defunct !
10 Epidaurus Theater Acoustics
The Ancient Theater of Epidaurus near Athens Greece was constructed in the late 4th century BC and is one of the best preserved ancient theaters .
Even in ancient times , the theater was considered to have great acoustics .
The actors can be perfectly heard by all 15,000 spectators without amplification .
To demonstrate the theaters great acoustics tour guides have their groups scattered in the stands and then show them how faint sounds can be heard at center - stage .
How this sound quality was achieved has been the source of academic and amateur speculation for many years .
One of the theories suggested that prevailing winds were carrying the sounds .
It turns out that that answer is in the seats .
In 2007 researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered that the limestone material of the seats provide a filtering effect suppressing low frequencies of voices , thus minimizing background crowd noise so the seats act as natural acoustic traps .
It is still unknown whether the acoustic properties are the result of an accident or the product of advanced design .
Interesting Fact :
The orchestra ( or dancing floor ) has the shape of a perfect circle , with a diameter just above 19,50 meters .
A circular base still preserved at its exact center most probably held an Altar to Dionysos ( The Greek god of wine ) .
You can watch and hear a demonstration of the theaters great acoustics here .
9 Crystal Skulls
Most people are familiar with crystal skulls from the film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
However there are actually many serious crystal skull collectors that claim they are pre-Columbian and were made during the Aztec or Maya civilizations and exhibit paranormal phenomena .
In 2008 a team of British and American researchers using electron microscopy and X - ray crystallography examined skulls from the British Museum and Smithsonian .
A detailed analysis of the skull ’s surface revealed minute rotary scratch marks around the eye sockets , teeth and cranium .
This was clear evidence that the skull was cut and polished with a wheeled instrument – and the Aztecs never used the wheel .
The researchers concluded that the skulls were cut from a piece of Brazilian rock crystal in Europe .
They were then probably sold to collectors as a relic from the ancient Aztec civilization .
Many museums now have removed the skulls from display because of their questionable origins .
Interesting Fact :
For the hardcore crystal skull fans out there I should mention the Mitchell - Hedges Skull which is probably the most famous skull of all .
It was allegedly discovered in 1924 by the adopted daughter of British adventurer author F.A. Mitchell - Hedges .
Hedges claimed that the crystal skull dates back at least 3,600 years .
Detailed examination like the experiments mentioned above have never been done on this skull because the present owner of the skull will not allow testing .
8 New England ’s Dark Day
On May 19 , 1780 an unusual darkening of the day sky was observed over the New England states and parts of Canada .
Since communication of the day was very primitive , some people in New England applied religious interpretations to the event .
Even today New England ’s Dark Day is still regarded by many as a supernatural event .
Different explanations were discussed from volcanic eruptions to celestial cataclysms .
In 2008 Nearly 230 years later , University of Missouri researchers combined written accounts and tree ring records from fire - damaged trees to determine that the dark day was caused by massive wildfires burning in Canada .
During a fire the heat goes through the bark , killing the living tissue then a couple of years later the bark falls off revealing the wood and an injury to the tree .
The researchers studied tree rings from the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and many other locations .
They found evidence that a major fire had burned in that time period that would have affected atmospheric conditions hundred of miles away .
Large smoke columns were created and carried into the upper atmosphere accounting for New England ’s dark day .
Interesting Fact : Accounts of ‘ New England ’s Dark Day ’ include mentions of midday meals by candlelight , night birds coming out to sing , flowers folding their petals and strange behavior from animals .
7 Face on Mars
The Cydonian region on Mars attracted a great deal of attention because one of the hills in that region looked remarkably man made .
The region was first imaged in detail by the Viking 1 orbiter that was launched in 1975 .
Several images were taken by the Viking including one taken in 1976 showing one of Cydonian mesas had the appearance of face .
Scientist dismissed the face as a trick of light and shadow but then a second image also showed the face at a different sun-angle .
This caught the attention of organizations interested in extraterrestrial intelligence and some talk show hosts who believed the Face was a long - lost Martian civilization .
Most scientists still held the belief that the face was just a consequence of viewing conditions .
In 2003 when the European space agency launched Mars Express it was able to combine data from a high resolution stereo camera and create a 3D representation of the “ Face on Mars ” .
The most recent image ( bottom ) I think would silence even the most faithful believers .
The image shows a remnant massif thought to have formed from landslides and an early form of debris apron formation but no face in sight .
Interesting Fact : The Cydonia area is of great interest to planetary scientists because of their location .
The mesas are in a transition zone between cratered highlands to the south and smoother lowland plains to the north .
Some think the northern plains are all that ’s left of an ancient Martian ocean .
6 The Barreleye Fish
The fascinating aspect of the barreleye fish is the tubular eyes which are excellent at collecting light at depths up to 2500 m .
The puzzling part is that the eyes appear to be fixed in place directly above its head .
This had baffled physiologists for decades because it would be almost impossible for the fish to look for food .
Recently scientists using a remotely operated vehicle studied the fish at depths ranging from 600 - 800 meters .
They discovered a previously unknown fact , the tubular eyes exist behind a transparent fluid filled dome and the eyes can rotate within a transparent shield that covers the fish ’s head .
This allows the fish to peer up at potential prey or focus forward to see what it is eating .
The Barreleye Fish was first discovered in 1939 but the transparent nature of the fish was n’t known because when the fish was caught in nets at a different depth of water the see through part is destroyed .
Interesting Fact : Keep in mind when you look at the above picture that the two small holes in front of the fish are not eyes .
The eyes are the two green domes inside the top of the head .
You can see a clip of the barreleye fish swimming around here .
5 Solving Checkers
Checkers ( Draughts ) has been around for more than 400 years and has been enjoyed by millions of players .
Since 1989 computers have worked around the clock to try and decipher the game ’s 500 billion billion possible moves .
In 1992 , a computer was narrowly defeated by world champion Marion Tinsley who is widely regarded as the best human checkers player ever .
Finally in 2007 a computer program called Chinook developed by researchers at the University of Alberta can now play a perfect game of checkers .
In 2007 using between 200 desktop computers at the peak of the project Chinook can recognize every possible move made in a checkers game and determine the correct counter move .
If neither player makes a mistake the game will end in a draw .
Interesting Fact : Checkers is the largest game that has been solved to date , with a search space of 5 ×10 ^ 20 .
The number of calculations involved was 10 ^ 14 and it was done over a period of 18 years .
4 The Unknown Titanic Child
Days after the Titanic sank the body of a baby boy was found and recovered from the North Atlantic .
After the child could not be identified he was buried in Nova Scotia with a tombstone reading simply ‘ The Unknown Child ’ .
In 2001 researchers at Lakeland University in Ontario were granted permission to exhume the body .
By consulting the passenger lists they had narrowed down the possible identity to one of four children : Gosta Paulson , Eino Panula , Eugene Rice and Sidney Goodwin .
Initial tests concluded that the body was Eino Panula .
However in 2007 this was shown to be not true .
More advanced DNA testing was carried out on a tooth from the body and when compared to the DNA of a surviving Goodwin relative it proved an indisputable match .
It confirmed that ‘ the unknown child ’ was Sidney Goodwin .
Sidney was the youngest of six children born to Fred and Augusta Goodwin from Fulham , England and were immigrating to Niagara Falls New York .
( All were onboard ) Neither Sidney ’s parents nor his siblings ’ bodies were ever recovered .
You can see a photo of the rest of the family here .
Interesting Fact :
The sailors aboard the recovery ship were very upset by the discovery of the unknown boy ’s body and paid for his monument .
He was buried on 4 May 1912 with a copper pendant placed in his coffin by recovery sailors that read “ Our Babe ” .
You can see the grave monument here .
3 Ancient Tablet Deciphered
This could be a case of one scientifically solved mystery solving another so I will try and explain the second one under “ Interesting Facts ”
The circular clay tablet shown above was discovered 150 years ago at Nineveh the capital of ancient Assyria , in what is now Iraq .
The tablet shows drawings of constellations and pictogram - based text known as cuneiform which was used by the Sumerians , the earliest known civilization in the world .
For decades scientists have failed to decipher the tablet .
In 2008 two scientists , Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell from Bristol University finally cracked the cuneiform code .
By using a computer program that can reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago .
The two scientists were able to establish the tablet was a night notebook of Sumerian astronomers and refers to the events in the sky before dawn on the 29th of June 3123 BC ( Julian calendar ) .
Interesting Fact :
What makes this discovery even more amazing is the tablet also shows a large object travelling along the constellation of Pisces .
The symbols show the trajectory of the object to an error of one degree to hit Köfels Austria .
Köfels is recognized as the area of the largest rockslide in the crystalline Alps and has given rise to numerous theories about the cause of the rockslide .
There is no crater so to modern eyes it does n’t look as a meteor impact site should look .
However from the information gathered from the tablet , the trajectory explains why there is no crater .
The in - coming angle was very low ( six degrees ) so the scientists theorize that the asteroid clipped a near by mountain called Gamskogel and this caused the asteroid to explode before it reached its final impact point .
To explain how they were able to get this much information from this little tablet is above my pay grade .
You can see a picture of the rockslide area here .
2 Sharks Virgin Birth
In 2001 a Hammerhead shark was born at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska with three potential mothers in the same tank .
All had been in captivity for at least three years .
The birth of the shark baffled scientists for years .
Some scientists thought one of them might have mated before being captured and stored the sperm for fertilization .
Some scientist believed that sharks might be able to reproduce asexually through a rare method known as parthenogenesis ( a direct development without the need of a sperm ) .
Many were skeptical but in late 2007 scientists confirmed this through DNA testing .
After they determined which of the three females was the mother they subtracted the mother ’s contribution from the offspring and in this particular case after the DNA was subtracted there was nothing left .
The researchers were forced to conclude that the pup had no father , making this he first documented case of asexual reproduction of a shark .
Interesting Fact :
In 2008 Scientists confirmed a second virgin birth of a shark at the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center .
A 5 - foot , 94 - pound Atlantic blacktip shark died of stress - related complications related to her unknown pregnancy .
During the necropsy a 10 - inch shark pup was found surprising aquarium officials .
DNA testing on the embryonic pup proved that the pup carried no genetic material from a male .
1 Flight of the Bumblebee
This is at the number one spot because it inspired the list .
As I was growing up I used to hear when you take in consideration a bees wingspan along with the bees weight ratio it is aerodynamically impossible for them to fly .
I also used to hear the only reason a bee can fly is because it thinks it can .
I always thought that was a really cool explanation even though I knew it was probably not true .
Scientists had many theories but were not able to explain exactly how the un-aerodynamic bee was able to fly .
Finally in 2005 with the assistance of high - speed cinematography and mechanical models of the bee ’s wings , scientists were able to put this perplexing mystery to rest .
As it turns out the bee flap its wings an amazing 230 times per second , much faster than smaller insects .
Their analysis revealed sufficient lift was generated by unconventional combination of short , choppy wing strokes , a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction , along with a very fast wing - beat frequency .
Interesting Fact :
In order to understand more how bees fly their heavy little bodies around , the researchers forced them to fly in a small chamber filled with a mixture of oxygen and helium which is less dense than regular air .
( As if the aerodynamically challenged bees did n’t have enough on their plate )
This required the bees to work harder to fly and gave the scientists a chance to observe the bee ’s wings and body under stressful conditions .
You can watch a bee ’s flight in super slow motion here .
+ Bellybutton Lint
The reason for bellybutton lint has been the subject of mystery and speculation for many years .
Now after three years of research and chemical analysis of 503 pieces of lint from his own bellybutton , chemist Georg Steinhauser from Vienna University has revealed the secret .
The pieces of fluff were not made up of only cotton from clothing but there were also flecks of dead skin , fat , sweat and dust .
His observations also showed that abdominal hair often seems to grow in concentric circles around the navel and act like a kind of barbed hooks .
Dr Steinhauser established that shaving one ’s belly will result in a lint - free navel .
Interesting Fact : I should also give credit to another research scientist and radio / TV personality Karl Kruszelnicki ( Dr Karl ) from Australia .
Several years earlier he studied bellybutton lint samples sent to him by almost 5,000 people and found some similar findings and that the typical lint producer was “ a slightly overweight , middle - aged male with a hairy abdomen ” .
The photo above is a 25 year collection of bellybutton lint from another Australian Graham Baker .
This gave him a place in the Guinness Book of Records .
Nearly every state park in the Bay Area — from the towering redwoods at Big Basin to Angel Island , Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo and every state beach from Año Nuevo in San Mateo County to Big Sur — would close as part of budget cuts proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
In all , 220 of California ’s 279 state parks , about 80 percent , would be padlocked starting as soon as Labor Day , under details of a historic closing plan released Thursday night by the state parks department .
“ We ’ve never been in as serious a predicament as we are facing right now .
It is potentially devastating , ” said state parks spokesman Roy Stearns .
Layoffs could hit 1,500 or more of the 2,900 state parks employees , Stearns added .
“ This is a clear indication of the absolute seriousness of the state budget deficit .
We have driven to the cliff and some would argue we are already falling off the cliff . ”
On Tuesday , as part of an effort to close the state ’s $ 24 billion deficit , Schwarzenegger unveiled a series of proposed cuts .
They included a plan to eliminate $ 70 million in state general fund money to parks in the year that ends in June 2010 and $ 143 million of that funding by June 2011 .
The latter number represents 40 percent of the state park system ’s $ 387 million operating budget .
In effect , the plan would phase out all general fund support of parks , leaving them funded only by entry fees , camping fees , and various small taxes , such as a tax on fuel for off - road vehicles .
The proposal still must be approved by the state Legislature .
But Friday , Democratic leaders said the budget hole is so great they expect some parks will close .
The main reason : Sales tax , income tax and other revenues flowing into Sacramento have collapsed during the economic downturn and Republican leaders have said they will not support any increase in taxes or fees .
“ I ’m going to work hard to keep them open , but not at the expense of things like insuring 1 million children in the Healthy Families program , ” said state Sen .
Fran Pavley , D - Santa Monica , who chairs the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee .
Pavley said she will examine raising entry and camping fees , closing some parks in winter , partnerships with nonprofit groups , a new tax checkoff box on state tax forms , and other ideas to help reduce the number of parks closed .
Other parks on the closing list include Henry W. Coe State Park near Morgan Hill , which at 90,000 acres is the second largest state park in California ; Sutters Fort and Marshall Gold Discovery sites ; Humboldt Redwoods ; Anza-Borrego Desert ; Bodie ghost town ; Pfeiffer and Andrew Molera state parks in Big Sur and the popular Lake Tahoe parks of Emerald Bay , Kings Beach and Sugar Pine .
The 59 that would remain open are parks that raise enough revenue to at least break even , such as Hearst Castle or Asilomar , a conference center in Pacific Grove , or places like San Luis Reservoir , Folsom and Oroville , which are supported by fees such as boating taxes .
Environmental groups already have begun to collect signatures on petitions and draft letters to legislators .
A rally is planned at 5:30 p.m. on Monday at Santa Cruz ’s Natural Bridges State Beach — one of the parks slated for closure — by Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks .
“ We are taking this proposal incredibly seriously .
The Legislature and the governor seem completely committed to passing a revised budget by July 1 .
That means we have less than a month , ” said Elizabeth Goldstein , president of the California State Parks Foundation , a nonprofit advocacy group .
Goldstein noted that a study by the University of California - Berkeley found that for every $ 1 in public money spent on state parks , $ 2.35 is returned to the state in taxes from tourism and other revenue they generate .
A basic problem is that is nearly impossible to “ close ” a state park or beach .
“ We ’ve never closed a park .
We only close them at night , ” said Gary Strachan , supervising ranger at Año Nuevo State Reserve near Pescadero .
“ If it means locking bathrooms and closing a gate , I guess that ’s closing a park .
But through 30 years of experience , knowing the public , visitors always try to get into the park . ”
When his park ’s famous elephant seals began arriving in the 1970s , Strachan said , there were no regular rangers .
After a story about the seals ran in Sunset magazine , visitors began descending on the area without supervision .
“ It was a nightmare .
People were getting bitten and chased .
Pups were getting harassed , ” Strachan said .
If the parks close , a small crew of rangers would patrol wide areas , checking in on closed parks .
People still would park on highways and walk to beaches .
But rangers , park managers and legislators are worried that with almost no supervision across 1.5 million acres of parklands , it is almost certain there will be vandalism , animals poached and a high risk of wildfires from trespassers .
Because there are thousands of camping reservations already booked for the summer , Stearns said , parks wo n’t close until after Labor Day .
Public outcry could affect the outcome .
Last year , Schwarzenegger proposed closing 48 parks , then backed off when the public lit up Sacramento switchboards .
“ My office got more calls on the parks closures than any other issue about the budget , ” said John Laird , a retired state legislator who was chairman last year of the Assembly Budget Committee .
Laird wrote a proposal to increase vehicle registration fees by $ 10 a year , which would have raised $ 260 million for state parks .
All California residents would have been given free entry .
Montana has a similar plan already in place .
The idea passed the Assembly , but died when then - Senate President Don Perata killed it in an attempt to find compromise with Republican leaders on wider budget issues .
Laird said environmental groups could put the fee on the 2010 ballot .
“ I think that ’s a very creative idea , and certainly worthy of discussion , ” Pavley said .

In Lincoln Park , Calif .
Michigan , a 17 - year - old called 911 when her father ( recovering at home from brain surgery ) had a seizure .
Her first call did n't go through , so the panicked girl hung up and tried again .
While the phone was still ringing , the girl said " what the fuck . "
Apparently 911 calls are recorded even while the phone is ringing , so the police officer heard her say it .
When the officer answered the call , he was only interested in the fact that the girl said " fuck " and would n't help the girl .
Instead , he swears at her and hangs up .
After the girl places several more calls to 911 trying to explain that her father was about to die , the officer finally called the fire department with a fabricated version of what happened .
Eventually , the girl gets arrested and jailed by the police for a crime that is n't on the books .

“ What are the people of the United States mad about now ? ” he said in a recent interview .
“ It is the same poisonous philosophy that we had here , based on a lack of moral awareness and greed , and people who thought nothing of flying Elton John into Iceland for their 50th birthdays and paying him 70 million Icelandic kronur . ” [ $ 600,000 ]
Within the party , conservative groups have grown stronger absent the emergence of any organized moderate faction .
There is little appetite for compromise on what many see as core issues , and the road to the presidential nomination lies -- as always -- through a series of states where the conservative base holds sway , and where the anger appears to be , if anything , particularly intense .
" There is a sense of rebellion brewing , " said Katon Dawson , the outgoing South Carolina Republican Party chairman , who cited unexpectedly high attendance at anti-tax “ tea parties ” last week .
My first trip to Europe started in Iceland .
Air Iceland would fly you from JFK to Luxembourg , a banking center nestled between Germany , Belgium and France , for $ 100 .
The catch is that you had to stop in Keflavik .
I was delighted ; it was summer and I was out to discover the world .
My girlfriend and I met another couple of adventurous Americans on the plane and the 4 of us decided to rent a car and drive around the island for a week .
If I can remember that far back ( 1969 ) let me ask you to remember a party you probably did n't go to but surely heard about .
It was November , 2005 and the host was notorious war profiteer David H. Brooks who was celebrating his daughter 's bat mitzvah at the Rainbow Room .
The event cost upwards of $ 10 million and featured Aerosmith , Nelly , Tom Petty , the Eagles , Kenny G. and 50 Cent .
Aerosmith was paid $ 1 million and there 's no way on earth Tom Petty or the Eagles would have played for less ; they share the same manager .
Brooks was a big macher ; he had just donated $ 25,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee a couple of month earlier .
So what 's all this got to do with Iceland ?
In this morning ' sit was reported that Iceland had just elected it 's first left - of - center government ... ever .
The bankster crisis hit that country early and hit it hard , very hard .
I was drawn to a quote by Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson ( a former truck driver and geologist who heads the Green Party , a partner in the new ruling coalition ) :
The unrestrained " free market " greed and avarice that swamped Iceland resulted in the toppling of the Republican - like right - wing government and it's replacement with a caretaker government led by Johanna Sigurdardottir , the first openly gay woman to head a national government .
Yesterday 's election gave her party 22 seats , the Greens 13 seats and the right - wing Independent Party 14 seats ( 23 % of the vote ) .
23 % ?
For the political party that has dominated Icelandic politics since independence from Denmark ?
The number sounded familiar and I racked my brain trying to remember ... and then I did .
Going into the 1934 congressional elections we 've written about so many times here at , Republicans found themselves in the minority for the first time in decades .
Two years earlier Franklin Roosevelt had swept to power promising massive change from the reactionary , corporate policies the Republicans had used to bankrupt the country and cause the Great Depression .
About half the Republicans in the House had been defeated , leaving them with just 117 members from mostly hard - core GOP districts .
They had learned nothing from their 1932 drubbing and greeted FDR 's first two years with an unrelenting obstructionism and invective , doing their best to persuade the American people that Roosevelt and his congressional allies were a bunch of socialists .
The result came in the 1934 midterms -- 23 % .
That 's the portion of seats the GOP held onto after they were smashed down by the voters again .
The Republicans lost another 14 seats , for a grand total of 103-- 23.6 % .
This morning Ben Smith and Jonathan Martin athave the worst possible news for the Republican Party .
It 's own base , driven mad by years of hate - filled propaganda , is rebelling against any Republican politicians who move towards the mainstream .
The basethe pre-adolescent , obstructionist behavior radicals and extremists like Limbaugh , Beck , Coulter and Hannity extol to gain cable ratings points .
It works in the ratings game but most Americans hate the extremism and see through the obstructionism .
The far right now utterly dominates the GOP base .
That 's OK in most of the Deep South -- although even there the GOP is on the defensive , losing red congressional seats in Florida , North Carolina , Alabama , Mississippi and Virginia last year -- but it is pure poison north of the Mason - Dixon line and in the West , where states that had supported Bush in 2004 , like Colorado , Nevada and New Mexico , went for Obama in 2008 .
We watched that rebellion on tape 2 weeks ago as Gresham Barrett , a right - wing congressman who had hoped to become South Carolina 's next governor , was mercilessly booed at the Greenville teabagger party .
And Barrett has dedicated his entire political career to far right extremism -- except when it got in the way of his ability to raise " donations " from the now unpopular banksters .
The Republican Party , devoid of respected leadership , and stuck with the flotsam and jetsam of opportunistic hacks like Boehner , Cantor , Ryan , Hensarling , McConnell , Kyl , and Cornyn , has no choice but to embrace the paranoid hate , ignorance and bigotry of its base -- and race towards ... well losing another dozen or two congressional seats in 2010 .

The housing market in California is splintering into various broken segments .
In one area , you have lower priced beaten down homes flying off the market like pancakes .
Yet in these areas , you have to wonder what will happen once the major discounts and inventory run out ?
Next , you have mid-priced areas that are selling in low numbers but at relatively stable prices .
This is the next market to tank because of the large amount of Alt - A and Pay Option ARMs hovering in those markets .
These areas had a stronger buffer because of the structure of the mortgages but make no mistake , they will be coming down .
And finally , you have the higher priced regions stalling out .
What we have here is the systematic dismantling of a decade long housing bubble .
It would be great if we could predict with pinpoint precision how each market would unravel or when the bottom will be reached but when bubbles burst , they usually are messy .
From some of the analysis I have put together for California , we will not be seeing any sign of a bottom until 2011 .
I have been making this argument for nearly a year and now we ’re now seeing the story picked up by others :
“( The Press Democrat ) Over the next three years , about two - thirds of the Alt - A borrowers in Sonoma County will see their payments jump sharply , according to First American CoreLogic .
The trend will peak in the summer of 2011 , the research firm projects . ”
The next major story that is largely being underreported is that of the Alt - A mortgage market .
Why this applies so directly to California is that over 50 percent of the $ 469 billion in toxic Alt - A mortgages are here in the state .
The major problem of course is many of these Alt - A products are Pay Option ARMs that allowed borrowers to make minimum payments that negatively amortized and many now find themselves with higher balances in a state that has seen the median price fall by 50 percent in one year .
We ’ve been hearing how the market is split up into many fragments yet how does this really look in practice ?
Today I want to give you three homes currently on the market in three very different cities here in Los Angeles County .
The purpose is to put an actual face on the three markets currently dominating California real estate .
We will look at the low , mid , and upper priced housing markets all within a thirty - mile radius .
Lower Priced Range – Compton
Compton California has witnessed each side of the housing bubble .
During the boom , some homes in Compton were selling for $ 450,000 with only three bedrooms .
Those days are now long gone .
Our example home above comes from a zip code that has a median price of $ 137,000 .
This median price is a stunning 60 percent drop from only a year ago .
Yet Compton is actually seeing homes sell .
For all three zip codes in the city of Compton we saw 84 homes sell in the month of April .
The above home is 828 square feet and has 3 bedrooms and 1 bath .
This home has been on the market for 404 days .
Its pricing history offers us a glimpse into the subprime bubble boom and bust :
At the peak , this home sold for $ 310,000 so the current list price is 71 percent below the top market price .
The current psychology of the market is such that people are saying , “ what in the world were people thinking ? ”
Yet that psychological thought normally stops in the lower price range .
The same economic fundamentals apply to the mid-priced and upper - priced ranges yet people still have not come to terms with this reality for the higher priced areas .
The Alt - A implosion will make this abundantly clear at the end of 2009 and into 2010 .
So why are homes selling in areas like Compton ?
Because the price is starting to make sense for some .
Take this home for example .
Say you were an investor .
For an investment property loan , all you need is 25 percent down .
Let us run the numbers :
Sale Price : $ 89,000
Down payment : $ 22,500
Mortgage : $ 66,500
PITI : $ 490 ( assuming 30 year fixed at 6 percent )
The going rents in this area are roughly $ 700 to $ 800 for a place like this .
This would make total sense for investors right ?
Well that depends .
First , you need to realize that unemployment in the state is at a record 11 percent and growing .
Some areas are taking the brunt of the economic storm much deeper .
Compton has a median household income of $ 30,000 so a family would actually be okay buying this place .
Some counties in California are seeing unemployment rates rivaling those of the Great Depression :
CA Counties : Unemployment Rate
Imperial : 26.9 %
Sierra : 17.9 %
Stanislaus : 16.8 %
Sutter : 18.5 %
San Joaquin : 15.6 %
Colusa : 19.1 %
Plus , not many people have $ 22,500 laying around .
Many investors do and as we know , many current buyers at the lower end are investors .
This place lists that it needs some “ TLC ” so it is hard to say how much additional capital is needed to get it rent ready .
Either way , this is a perfect example of what is moving at a brisk pace in this current market .
Mid-Priced Range – Mar Vista
Our next home takes us to the Mar Vista community in L.A .
Many people in the Westside , especially professionals look at Mar Vista as a starter home location .
Yet the starter home was largely out of reach for many professionals .
This is where the Alt - A mortgage products stepped in to fill the gap .
A $ 2,000 mortgage payment sure sounds a lot better than a $ 4,000 mortgage .
Plus , by the time you need to sell in 2 or 3 years , the home would be worth so much more that you would n’t need to worry about those nasty toxic mortgage recast payment shocks .
That is , until the appreciation party stopped .
This above home is something that we will be seeing a lot of in the next 6 to 18 months .
The above home is a 958 square foot home with 3 bedrooms and 1.75 baths .
The location is the Palms , Mar Vista community of L.A .
This home has been on the market for 16 days and we have already seen one price reduction from $ 625,000 .
The current asking price is $ 599,000 .
Now I pulled up tax data for the current area and the median household income is approximately $ 82,000 .
So let us run the numbers for someone looking to buy this home today :
Sale Price : $ 599,000
Down payment : $ 119,800
Mortgage : $ 479,200
PITI : $ 3,269 ( 30 year at 5.25 % )
So what is the take home for a household income for someone making $ 82,000 ?
As a rule of thumb , you should n’t spend more than one - third of your gross monthly pay on your total home payment .
So if your gross household income is $ 82,000 , your top monthly payment should be at $ 2,277 .
That is why this rule works with the Compton home above .
The take home gross of $ 30,000 per month is $ 2,500 so they can take on an $ 833 monthly payment .
In some ways , the numbers are starting to workout at the lower end but are completely out of whack in the mid to upper range .
Because of the Alt - A mortgages in these areas , many sellers are hoping to snag another buyer so they can exit .
Yet as you can see from running the numbers , it simply does not make sense .
In fact , you can work yourself backwards from the actual PITI to see what income would need to support this home :
PITI : $ 3,269 x 3 = $ 9,807 or $ 117,684 / annually
This is where the major disconnect occurs .
Ironically , the subprime product actually had a usage in the market .
It was designed for those with a poor credit history to buy a home with a much higher rate .
Now I disagree with subprime loans merely because they were pumped out by unscrupulous lenders but they had a much cleaner design than toxic junk superhero Alt - A mortgage products .
The Alt - A mortgage was purely a mortgage designed to operate in a bubble .
It was crafted for continuously booming home appreciation .
It was never meant to be a long - term mortgage .
It had a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years for the most part ( aside from Wachovia ’s horrendous 10 - year Pick - A - Pay craptasic loans ) .
The bottom line is the mid-range market cannot move at a brisk pace without these toxic mortgages reemerging .
The reason sales are falling in these areas is because no fool is willing to pay the higher price .
Sure , you ’ll have your handful of sales each month but this will largely be gone in the upcoming months with the tsunami of notice of defaults that hit us in Q1 of 2009 .
This assures us more inventory for the next year .
While the lower end is flushing out inventory with sales , the mid to upper range sells a handful of homes while a pipeline is simply building up .
For example , in our area above 13 homes sold in April and prices are off by 28 percent on a year over year basis .
As you can see from our basic math , some sellers are pricing home at bubble level prices .
Until prices fall back in line with local family incomes , this housing downturn will continue to unfold in California .
Upper Priced Range – Santa Monica
Our final stop takes us to a prime location in the Westside , Santa Monica .
Now you need to realize that these areas will always have more buyers than sellers simply because they are in niche locations in very desirable areas of L.A. County .
But that does n’t mean prices wo n’t fall .
Before I discuss the home above , let us look at the pricing action :
Now as you can tell from the above , even in Santa Monica sellers are having to drop their asking price .
This 4 bedroom and 3 baths home is selling for $ 1,395,000 .
It is 1,923 square feet in a desirable area .
Now Santa Monica has very unique income statistics :
Now let us first run the numbers on this home to see what income is needed to support this house payment :
Sale Price : $ 1,395,000
Down payment : $ 279,000
Mortgage : $ 1,111,600
PITI : $ 8,001 ( 30 year fixed jumbo 6.25 % and 20 % down payment )
Now using our 3 times rule we get :
$ 8,001 x 3 = $ 24,003 or $ 288,046 / annually
Take a look at the income stats above .
Of the 45,843 households that currently live in Santa Monica , only 12.8 % make over $ 200,000 .
With this home , we need an annual household income of nearly $ 300,000 .
Here again you see the major discrepancy of the current California market .
Investors buy homes for a few reasons .
You buy for what many call “ CAT ” – cash flow , appreciation , and taxes .
In many other states , investors like myself buy for cash flow where you can buy a home and get it rented and the tenant will cover your mortgage payment and expenses .
This is something unseen in California for over a decade .
We are now seeing a few homes like in Compton and the Inland Empire that are cash flowing .
Yet many of these out of state properties will never appreciate like homes in California .
The final reason is for the tax benefit .
Now you need to remember for this entire decade 90 + percent of California investors bought for appreciation .
No one really cared about the cash flow and the tax benefits never came into the equation because many were selling properties off in a short period .
Now what happens when you have the opposite of appreciation and prices still remain stubbornly high ?
You get our current market .
Yet the lower end was like this in early 2008 and look at where it is now .
The mid range will show significant signs of weakness later this year and finally , you will see drops at the upper range .
With our state budget in a mess and more cuts coming , there is no reason to believe the “ A ” from appreciation will be coming back anytime soon .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) Microsoft Corp is getting ready to unveil a long - anticipated free anti-virus service for personal computers that will compete with products sold by Symantec Corp and McAfee Inc .

The company issued software to fix 31 security flaws in its programs , a single - day record for the company whose products are targeted by hackers because they sit on the vast majority of computers .

A Microsoft spokesman said on Wednesday that the world ’s biggest software maker is testing an early version of the product with its own employees .
Microsoft would “ soon ” make a trial version , or product beta , available via its website , he added , but declined to provide a specific date .
Symantec shares fell 0.5 percent on Nasdaq and McAfee fell 1.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange , while Microsoft was up 2.1 percent .
The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.47 percent .
Investors are closely monitoring the free service , code - named Morro after Brazil ’s Morro de Sao Paolo beach , amid concern it could hurt sales of products from Symantec and McAfee , which generate billions of dollars of revenue a year protecting Windows PCs from attacks by hackers .
“ It ’s a long - term competitive threat , ” said Daniel Ives , an analyst with FBR Capital Markets , though he added that the near - term impact was minimal .
Microsoft has said that Morro will offer basic features for fighting a wide range of viruses , which would likely make it comparable to low - end consumer products from Symantec and McAfee that cost about $ 40 per year .
Their top - selling products are security suites that come with features including encryption , firewalls , password protection , parental controls and data backup .
Three years ago , Microsoft entered that market with Live OneCare , which turned out to be a commercial flop .
It announced plans in November to kill that product suite , saying it would launch the free Morro service by the end of 2009 .
Analysts said they are looking forward to Morro ’s beta to see exactly how its features compare to those in products from competitors .
Microsoft has said it will provide protection from several types of malicious software including viruses , spyware , rootkits and trojans .
Officials with Symantec and McAfee have said they do not see Morro as a threat .
“ Microsoft ’s free product is basically a stripped down version of the OneCare product Microsoft pulled from the shelves , ” said Symantec Consumer division president Janice Chaffin .
“ A full Internet security suite is what consumers require today to stay fully protected . ”
Joris Evers , a spokesman for No. 2 security software maker McAfee , said his company is already enjoying strong growth despite competition from free anti-virus products that are on the market .
“ On a level playing field , we are confident in our ability to compete with anyone who might enter the marketplace , ” he said .
A spokeswoman for Trend Micro Inc , the No. 3 player , declined to comment .

In this picture I believe you can see some five - spot burnets ( Zygaena trifolii ) mating , but it could also be the similar six - spot burnet ( Zygaena filipendulae ) because the spots can be merged .
If anyone is an expert on this please let me know by leaving a comment .
I would also like to know what the flowers are called .
Anyways .
It looks like the insects are having a really good time 😉
Check out my other insect photos .
This was another shot from last fall at Clifty Falls State Park , I got a little different perspective on this one , looking downstream as the sun was rising on the left side of the image .
The light was very warm and pleasant , which gave the image a nice warm glow .
The settings were f/22 , at 1/3 second , iso 200 .
After this image posted a large number of people contacted me to ask about the ghost face in the creek .
I never even noticed this at first , but after viewing the image again and then going back to the org .
raw file there is something definitely there .
I am one that does n’t believe in such things but it definitely makes for good conversation !!

Editor 's note : John Feehery worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress .
He is president of Feehery Group , a Washington - based advocacy firm that has represented clients including News Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and the United States Chamber of Commerce .
He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America .
John Feehery says neither party is representing the growing number of centrists in America .
( CNN ) --
" There 's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos . " -- Jim Hightower
" Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous ; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides . " -- Margaret Thatcher
Despite these warnings from the left and the right , increasingly , the American people are viewing themselves as centrists .
According to the Pew Research Group , fully 39 percent of the American people identify themselves as political independents , the highest percentage in 70 years .
As Andrew Kohut of Pew put it , " Centrism has emerged as a dominant factor in public opinion as the Obama era begins .
...
Republicans and Democrats are even more divided than in the past , while the growing political middle is steadfastly mixed in its beliefs about government , the free market and other values that underlie views on contemporary issues and policies . "
So , who represents the middle of the road ?
Is it Nancy Pelosi , the very liberal speaker of the House , who accuses the CIA of lying , who advocates for abortion on demand and who pushes a radical environmental agenda that will sharply raise taxes on every consumer ?
Is it Rush Limbaugh , who insists that Republicans lost the election because they were n't conservative enough ?
Is it President Obama , who sprinkles every speech with centrist language but who governs from the left on issue after issue ?
I would make the argument that neither political party truly appreciates or values the centrists in their respective caucuses .
The Blue Dogs are more like abused little puppies , kept out of most major party decisions , denied chairmanships and prohibited from offering amendments that would reflect their values
Republican moderates either have already lost , like Gordon Smith in Oregon or Wayne Gilchrist in Maryland , or are getting ready to lose , like Norm Coleman in Minnesota , or are switching parties , like Arlen Specter -- or , like Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe , are roundly despised by conservatives .
In either case , it is more likely that the Cubs will win the World Series than it is that a moderate of either party will rise to the top of their party 's leadership .
No matter how talented a legislator may be , someone like a Tom Davis or Ben Nelson will never lead their congressional party .
Why is it that while centrists make up the majority of the country , they do n't have a seat at the table when it comes to running the country ?
Why do both parties put their leaders through an ideological litmus test before they give them the keys to the car ?
As somebody who worked for one the last great centrist leaders , Bob Michel , the Republican leader from Illinois ; one of the most ideological leaders in either party , Tom DeLay , who was then the majority whip from Texas ; and the longest - serving Republican speaker , Denny Hastert of Illinois , I have gained an unusual perspective about how interest groups , ideology , money and the media play a role in shaping the leadership of either party .
Interest groups : Interest groups like people who support them all the time .
They hate people who support them 70 percent of the time .
From abortion to guns , from taxes to the environment , only those who toe the party line closely get support .
Can you imagine what a world would look like if we reached a legislative consensus on abortion that made most of the country fairly happy ?
Well , I can tell you two groups that would immediately go out of business should such a consensus emerge .
Ideology : Unlike the consensus that came from World War II , which produced leaders like Bob Michel and Howard Baker , our national leaders today are still scarred by the ideological battles of the 1960s .
Democrats like David Obey and George Miller arrived in the class of 1974 , and their philosophies were born of the tumult of that age .
We still speak in the language of that culture war , liberal vs. conservative , socialist vs. fascist .
The deep distrust that sprung from that era lives with the leaders of parties today .
Money :
The most important part of being a congressional leader today is the ability to raise money .
And for the past two decades , only the ideologues have been willing to give it .
Whether it is George Soros on the left or Richard Mellon Scaife on the right , these billionaires give money to fellow travelers and not to deal - makers , and certainly not to centrists .
And it is far harder for a centrist to convince donors that they will become leaders in the party and are thus worthy of financial support , because , well , they are centrists .
Media : Centrists make for bad television and even worse talk radio .
The absolutists on either side make nice foils and better friends .
With the rise of Fox on the right and MSNBC on the left , with Sean Hannity excoriating liberals on his show and with Keith Olbermann doing the same to conservatives on his show , moderates are either attacked as being sell - outs or ignored by both sides .
It is hard to become a respected national figure in today 's media culture .
You are either belittled for being a squish or forgotten because you are not a leader of the party .
So the question that comes to mind is , if moderates can't get any respect from either party , why do n't they form their own ?
Is n't it time to form a third party ?
It 's a good question .
History has not been kind to third parties in America .
The Know - Nothings collapsed into nothingness .
The Bull - Moosers died when Roosevelt lost .
The Dixiecrats eventually became Republicans .
And the Perot - istas ran out of Perot 's money .
America has been throughout its history living a kind of Hegelian dialectic .
One party represents the thesis , the other the antithesis , and from that springs a grand synthesis .
It has been that way with our court system , which is adversarial , with a prosecution and a defense .
It has been that with our politics , with a majority and a minority .
It has been that with race , frankly , with the stark division between black and white .
But as we are finding with race , things are n't always as easy as black and white .
And it might be time for our politics to evolve to include a third party .
I am a Republican and have been all of my life .
But for the Republican Party to prosper , it must appeal to the close to 40 percent who think of themselves as independent and who are personally centrist in their politics .
The next election , like the last one , wo n't be decided by liberal or conservatives .
It will be decided by the vast middle , those centrist voters who see the complexities in life and are unimpressed by ideological absolutists .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery .

Last year , at least the Mac lasted a couple of minutes before it was hacked .
This year , it lasted seconds …
In the annual Pwn2Own at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver , fully patched machines are set up , and you can win one by being first to hack it ( rules ) .
Last year , Charlie Miller hacked the MacBook Air in about two minutes .
This year , as he'd warned beforehand , he pwned a fully patched MacBook in a few seconds , by exploiting a security vulnerability in Apple 's Safari browser , as Ryan Naraine reports at ZD Net .
The drive - by attack also won Miller a $ 10,000 prize .
Given Safari 's security record , it 's not exactly a surprise to see the Mac being first to fall again , though it must be embarrassing for Apple to see its machines get pwned so much more easily than Vista PCs .
Miller 's predictions before the event were as follows :
Safari : hacked by 4 different people .
Easy pickin's as usual .
Android : hacked by 1 person .
Not too tough but no one owns one .
IE8 , Firefox : Survive unscathed .
The bugs to exploit equation is too hard for $ 5 k .
iPhone , Symbian : Survive due to non-executable heap .
Blackberry , Windows Mobile , Chrome : I do n't know enough to say anything intelligent .
That said , they 're probably hard / obscure and so survive
I do n't expect Chrome to survive , but we 'll see ....
They say it ’s because it interferes with the navigation systems .
But it ’s really a government conspiracy to cover up the fact that there is a special frequency of communication which can ONLY be tapped into when ascending or decending ( though NASA and the CIA have developed a machine that can simulate take off and landing for this purpose ) .
This channel , known as the “ X Channel ” is reserved for communicating with extra-terrestrial beings from Rigel 7 .
It all began on July 11 , 1947 , 3 days after the discovery of a crashed UFO at Roswell , New Mexico .
The US Air Force was conducting a test flight from the Groom Lake Air Force base in SW Nevada ( currently known as “ Area 51 ” ) .
They had just moved the alien bodies from Roswell to Groom Lake , and had recovered some rather advanced communications equipment from the crashed spacecraft which seemed to have a much larger range than conventional radio equipment .
The military had discovered a number of these radio devices and had managed to get two of them communicating with each other .
One was flown to a small town outside Paris , and the other was brought to Groom Lake , both were placed on US Air Force planes , one stationed in Groom Lake and the other stationed in a top secret French facility created in the aftermath of WWII .
Both aircraft were sent into flight at exactly 5:17 pm GMT with the hopes that they would be able to communicate with each other .
Seconds after take off , both pilots reported a strange signal coming from the radio and then they heard what was clearly a response to a distress call .
Within a few seconds , they realized that it was the mothership attempting to contact the crashed UFO .
Shortly after their realization , they lost the signal as both craft moved to cruising altitude .
Within 2 months , the military realized they could only communicate on this radio during ascent or descent in an aircraft , and they also realized that their standard electronic equipment was capable of picking up these signals as well .
The military contacted the major airlines and sent personell into the cockpits of many commercial airliners and determined that the radio equipment pilots used could also pick up these signals .
In the meantime , the US government opened channels of communications with these alien beings , and began work on a prototype of a machine which would continuously simulate take off and landing so that the channels of communiation could remain open .
Unfortunately , these aliens have proven to be unfriendly , and have refused to share any of their advanced technology with us , and there is currently a massive diplomatic effort underway to keep Rigel 7 from sending a fleet of war drones to end all life on the planet and rape it for its natural resources .
Since we do n’t have anything really to offer them that they had n’t already figured out on their own , we have very few bargaining chips , and the government does n’t want someone ’s cell phone or iPod to pick up on a transmission where they Rigelians are threatening to kill us , it would cause a great panic , and that panic might be what caused our extinction .
This is because the only reason the Rigelians have allowed us to live for these past 62 years is that they are amused by human suffering … they are responsible for every major epidemic and pandemic we ’ve had in at least the past 50 years … everything from AIDS to Swine Flu has been manufactured and sent here by a drone ( they ’re smart enough to land in the Ozarks and places that have been hugely discredited … they could pretty much park the mother ship in any number of cities in the deep south for a week and a half and the rest of the world would say the reports were the ramblings of drunken rednecks after all ) .
So , if mankind were to panic and start to come together to fight the alien menace , it would simply put be “ less entertaining ” for our unseen overlords and they ’d just be done with us .
So please , please heed your flight attendants ’ warnings , if you know what ’s good for you .
Google promised to deliver something spectacular on the second day of the Google I/O conference , and they did not disappoint .
Google has just announced Google Wave , a new in - browser communication and collaboration tool that is already being hailed by some as the next evolution of email .
Yes , Google Wave is potentially that disruptive .
Created by two of the guys behind Google Maps with a small team in Sydney , the concept behind Google Wave is to " unify " communication on the web .
It 's a hybrid of email , web chat , IM , and project management software .
It features the ability to replay conversations because it records the entire sequence of communication , character by character .
Because of this , discussions are also live in Google Wave : you will see your friends type character - by - character .
The features do n't stop there , either .
Google
Wave also supports the ability to drag attachments from your desktop into Google Wave .
It loads that file and sends it immediately to anyone in the conversation .
It 's also embeddable , so you can embed Google Wave conversations on any blog .
As you can see , it looks very similar to a Gmail inbox , except it 's more focused on your contacts , whose faces you can see in your contacts sidebar on the left .
As for conversations , well , it 's a bit different than anything we 've seen before .
You can reply and add your thoughts anywhere within a message .
Communication within Google Wave is completely shared .
The key to it all is the faster line of communication .
Attaching documents , like you do in email , is unnecessary in Google Wave .
Real - time conversations and collaboration make it an ideal tool for business teams as well .
Imagine an entire office having Google Wave open to quickly share and receive files .
It combines some of people 's favorite aspects of many different web communication tools .
You 're going to have to wait a while though : Google Wave will not be available to the public until later this year .
Right now it 's only available to a select group of developers , who will be able to create their own Wave servers .
It 's also an open - source project with a lot of API integrations , so we can expect a lot of user - driven innovations and extensions for the platform as well .
So , back to the big question : could Google Wave really redefine web communication ?
Clearly it 's too early to tell , but we 're already very impressed with the client and its potential .

The US is " in a good position " to protect its territory from a potential North Korean missile strike , US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said .
His comments came in response to a report that North Korea was considering launching a missile towards Hawaii .
" We do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the West , in the direction of Hawaii , " Mr Gates said .
The US has approved the deployment of missiles and radar to " provide support " in the event of an attack , he added .
Bank warning
North Korea 's nuclear ambitions have long been the focus of international concern .
After a period in which the country appeared to be willing to suspend its programme , North Korea has recently begun to increase its sabre - rattling , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
On 25 May , North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test and has subsequently test - fired a number of short - range missiles .
North Korea has stepped up its missile programme in recent weeks
Our correspondent says the Pentagon is also tracking the movement of a North Korean ship to ensure that it does not break UN sanctions .
And he says that in a separate move , the Obama administration has issued a warning to all US banks that North Korea may try to avoid financial sanctions by engaging in deceptive practices .
The UN Security Council passed tough new sanctions in response to North Korea 's nuclear tests , and Russian and China - the country 's traditional allies - on Thursday called for North Korea to return to the negotiating table .
As John noted , when is someone going to challenge one of these guys when they spew this garbage on these Sunday shows ?

Sorry if it 's expecting just a little too much to think that you might actually consider something like doing your job , and not allowing guests to lie to you if you want to call yourself an anchor on a " news " channel .
Here we go again with another Republican being allowed to repeat the Frank Luntz list of talking points for health care on national television , unchallenged .
Would n't it be nice if we could make them all have to debate Bernie Sanders instead , so the public is not misinformed day after day ?
How many Luntz talking points can you spot in this interview ?
SCHIEFFER : So , is he being straight with us ?
MCCONNELL : Well , let ’s start at the beginning .
They teach every first - semester medical student , “ Do no harm . ”
And what the president did not talk about yesterday is his ambitious plan to have a government insurance plan , in effect , that essentially crowds out of the private market all the competition that we have among insurance companies today to have a national rationing board which would determine what kind of treatments would be available for American citizens .
Those , typically , in single - payer countries like Canada and Britain involve delays in treatment , denial of care , that kind of thing .
All of that really ought to be put aside if we want to get a truly bipartisan proposal .
The Medicare cuts that the president was talking about yesterday were not in the context of making the current program more sustainable , Bob .
We have an unsustainable Medicare and Medicaid now .
The president is talking about looking at those cuts in the context of expanding coverage far beyond what we have .
This is 16 percent of the economy , as we all know .
It ’s an enormously important subject .
We can make incredible improvements in American health care , but I do n’t think having more government ; in effect putting Washington between you and your doctor , is the way to go .
What we ought to be dealing with are things like litigation reform , things like wellness programs .
That ’s one thing I think we can all agree on .
The CEO of Safeway is a very impressive man that we ’ve all heard from who ’s been able to bring the health care costs of his company dramatically down by emphasizing things like obesity control , eliminating smoking , to the maximum extent possible , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , more exercise .
There are a number of things that we can do to improve our health care system .
SCHIEFFER : Let me just start with a couple of things that you ’ve said here .
The president ’s people will tell you that he is not proposing any kind of a rationing board .
They would also say to you that , when he ’s proposing a public insurance option , that is just to give people another option if they do n’t want to go -- that , if they want to keep their private insurance , that ’s OK , and that it ’s not going to crowd any of that out , so ...
MCCONNELL : I know they say that , Bob , but in fact , if the government is in the insurance business , there wo n’t be any other insurers .
It ’s inevitable because the taxpayers will be backing up the program .
We ’ve seen a , kind of , version of that over in the auto takeover .
You ’ve got Ford Motor Company , which makes Ford vehicles in my hometown -- it did n’t take any government money -- now having to compete with a government - controlled General Motors acceptance corporation , trying to finance their cars in competition with the government financing company .
And they ’re having a hard time doing it .
We know that , if the government gets in this business , pretty soon nobody else will be in the business .
SCHIEFFER : Is that a deal - breaker for you and for Republicans ?
Because he seems to be insisting that this public option , which would be very much like Medicare for older people now ; this would be something where the government , you could opt for that rather than private insurance .
SCHIEFFER : But is that a deal - breaker , as far as you ’re concerned ?
MCCONNELL : I think that , for virtually every Republican , a government plan is a non-starter .
There are a whole lot of other things we can agree to do on a bipartisan basis that will dramatically improve our system .
But we already have the best health care in the world .
We know it costs a lot , but we have the best health care in the world .
And I do n’t think many Americans want to start having to , you know , wait in line and start getting government permission for procedures .
We need to be very careful about taking the wrong steps .
SCHIEFFER : What would you feel about taxing existing health - care benefits ?
During the campaign , we remember that candidate Obama criticized John McCain , because he said that ’s what John McCain was trying to do .
We now understand , though , that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Democrat Max Baucus , is including that , that perhaps there would be some tax on some existing health - care benefits .
We ’re also told that the White House says nothing is off the table .
Although this morning Joe Biden , the vice president , said that ’s a bad way to go .
MCCONNELL : Well , the finance committee is beginning to look at how you would pay for this massive expansion of health care .
As I indicated earlier , we ’re having a hard time paying for the health care -- the government health care we already have , Medicare and Medicaid .
Now they ’re trying to grapple with how to pay for the expansions .
It will not be easy .
SCHIEFFER : Would you -- would you encourage that , tapping existing ..
MCCONNELL : Let me tell you what I would do if I were in charge .
I would equalize the tax treatment between companies and individuals .
Right now , if you work for a company that provides you health care , the government allows a tax deduction to the company for providing the care .
If you ’re an employee who does not have health care , it ’s not deductible .
I would equalize the tax treatment , which would be a way of beginning to deal with the problems of the uninsured , which is what has motivated us to tackle this issue in the first place .
And second , I ’m not going back over the whole wellness argument again , but the government needs to be massively incentivizing wellness programs across the country .
That is what we ’re ...
SCHIEFFER : But what about -- what about this taxing increase ?
MCCONNELL : Well , I think how much you might need in terms of revenue depends on what you decide to do .
So I do n’t think know we ought to , at the outset here , be talking about tax increases .
We ought to be talking about how to make the current system we have work better .
Here are those Frank Luntz talking points one more time :
Anyone who has spent time trying to implement an FRP library knows the unsafePerformIO story .
You may use unsafePerformIO as long as you ensure that the result maintains purely functional semantics .
It ’s possible to create impure values with unsafePerformIO .
It is up to you to “ prove ” that you have created a pure one .
Seems like a decent trade - off .
I put “ prove ” in quotes for a reason .
If you ’re doing something nontrivial ( i.e. you ’re not just using unsafePerformIO . return ) , you need an operational semantics for IO to prove this .
But that ’s not all !
You are probably depending on some external state inside the unsafePerformIO , which depends on the time and order in which thunks are evaluated .
But thunks are n’t part of the operational semantics of IO , they are part of the operational semantics of pure values in Haskell — something we quite explicitly do not have .
So you need not only to embrace the ill - definedness of IO , but in fact tie yourself down to a particular operational interpretation of Haskell !
Let ’s say I write an HNF evaluator for Haskell .
Your unsafePerformIO magic will probably not work on this style of evaluator because the meaning of thunks — and the way they are executed — is quite different in this style .
There are more invariants on a Haskell function than purity and referential transparency .
We can of course only implement computable functions .
They have to be monotone and continuous .
And they might be other things , as well , which someone one day will come along and prove by leveraging properties of the type system , exposed primivites , etc. ( see ST for prior art ) .
But they have not accounted for your magic , so their analysis does not include any program using your library .
We are pure functonal programmers .
We have chosen a language which vastly restricts what we are allowed to do , because we understand the benefits we reap as a result .
However , pretending to understand when we are allowed to cheat only buys us the benefits we know about now , but precludes future benefits from work in the field .
By using unsafePerformIO — even in a safe way ( or so you think ) — you avert the exponential growth of our field .
If you find you ca n’t express something you feel you should be able to , I suggest one of two things : ( 1 ) look deeper until you find an incidental limitation of the language , and attempt to solve it at the language level , or ( 2 ) look deeper until you understand why you actually should n’t have been able to do that , revealing the truth from behind the curtain of zealous ignorance .
In my experience , ( 2 ) is much more often successful .
On a more practical note , most of said limitations are about performance , which is not in the semantics ’ domain of discourse .
It makes sense that our languages would n’t be good at such things .
Instead of introducing a hack , why not push the field forward and think about what a language which can talk about such things would look like ?
Each time you run into a limitation , you have a new use case , and thus a new perspective on the problem .
Until that problem is solved , though , your library users might have to pay the price of not having as elegant an interface .
But by restricting yourself thusly , you are protecting yourself from your own ignorance , at least knowing that what you have made should , in fact , be makeable .
In summary : It is never safe to cheat .
Occasionally , I hear reference to a “ five year plan ” ( or sometimes a 10 - year or 15 - year , or maybe an even bigger multiple of five ) .
People talk about how they plan to be mayor of a town , have half a million dollars socked away , get credited in a major motion picture , or otherwise achieve some significant mile - marker in a “ successful ” life , all within five years .
They organize their lives around these five year periods , and sweat blood and bullets trying to make fate conform to their carefully laid plans .
They usually fail , and when they succeed in reaching that goal , they usually regret something about it , but sometimes people hit the jackpot and all is well .
I never really had a five year plan .
What I have right now is a “ keep trying to improve on where I am now ” plan , when it comes to my life in general .
Sometimes , I have a one year plan in mind , or something else along those lines , but that ’s a matter of trying to set goals for getting done with things that I think will help — not for reaching particular plateaus in a stairway to some secular , material heaven later in life .
For instance , I might decide that I ’m going to read all the way through at least one of a particular class of technical book every two months for a year .
I ’ve also had a multi - year plan of sorts that was n’t so much a goal - oriented plan as just a “ Well , this is what I ’ll be doing with my life for a while . ”
That was when I joined the Army .
I knew my contractually obligated term of service in advance , so I knew I ’d be in the Army that long , barring disaster .
That ’s not really anywhere near the same thing as the typical five year plan .
I have a one - twelfth size equivalent to a five year plan in mind now , though .
It ’s not quite the total life goal thing that you hear about in five year plans , of course , but it ’s a significant , goal - oriented pursuit with specific steps along the way .
This five month plan looks a little something like this :
July : I intend to get a Ruger 10 / 22 rifle by the end of June .
It ’s a semi-automatic .22 rifle , suitable for varmint hunting perhaps , shooting beer cans for fun , and general rifle marksmanship practice .
Once I put some Tech - SIGHTS and a USGI sling on it , it ’ll be even more suited to rifle marksmanship practice .
Through the month of July , I intend to practice with it quite a bit .
After more than a decade out of the Army without any notable time behind a rifle , I definitely need the practice .
I want to get back to the point where I can summon that “ zen ” state with a moment ’s notice that let me hit 40 out of 40 targets in rifle marksmanship qualification when I was in the Army .
August : I ’ll keep practicing .
I ’ll save money .
I ’ll get an associate membership with the RWVA , or a similarly qualifying club .
I ’ll submit my order for an M1 Garand rifle from the CMP .
My military service exempts me from having to participate in a formal marksmanship class to qualify for CMP purchases — since I already got a lot of formal marksmanship training in the Army .
September : I ’ll keep practicing .
I ’ll save money .
October : I ’ll keep practicing .
I ’ll save money .
November : I ’ll keep practicing .
The CMP will probably get around to processing my order at some point this month , and they ’ll charge me the money I ’ve been saving .
I ’ll probably get the M1 Garand this month or the next ( December ) .
As soon as I have that M1 Garand , I ’m going to try really hard to hie myself to an Appleseed Project shooting event and get some training ( one can never have enough training ) — and of course shoot the hell out of the Garand for the short time between when it arrives and when I can get to an Appleseed event .
I might go to an Appleseed Project shooting event sooner , but there are n’t any scheduled near enough that I could just drive to it and back each day , so I have to make a Weekend Trip out of it , and that requires real planning .
I figure setting it at the end of the five month plan will give me a reasonable time to get around to it , so that I ’m highly unlikely to wuss out or otherwise fail to make it happen because it ’s “ too soon ” , and “ I do n’t have a long range rifle ” , and so on .
This does n’t preclude the possibility of attending an event sooner , with nothing but my little 10 / 22 or with a borrowed rifle of a more substantial caliber , of course .
This is more of a “ soft ” deadline for attending such an event .
That ’s my plan so far .
It ’s five months long .
I ’ll reassess at some point along the way , figure out whether the plan needs to be altered , and what to do next ( assuming this goes roughly as planned ) .
I ’m open to life , though .
I think it was John Lennon who said that life is what happens to you while you ’re busy making other plans .
As Fred Pearce noted in his greenwash column last week , Dell is banning the export of electronic waste to developing countries .
The move will be welcomed in many quarters .
But an even more positive step would surely be to keep our computers in circulation longer by passing them on to someone else – or so we are often told .
Besides bridging the digital divide , the rationale for donating computers for reuse is that it is supposed to be greener .
Even before a computer is switched on for the first time , as much as 75 % of its lifecycle fossil fuels have already been consumed in manufacturing it , not to mention around 1.7 tonnes of raw materials and water .
With half a million PCs disposed of globally every day and nearly half a billion mobile phones discarded each year , it stands to reason that giving your old laptop to someone who needs it is one sure - fire way to curb emissions , save precious resources and help the developing world in the process .
But in passing on our PCs , we need to also take into account an additional cost that is often overlooked or ignored .
Besides the emissions an individual PC is responsible for , there are the subsequent e-missions – the greenhouse gases incurred by the internet itself .
In 2007 the world 's computers , monitors , telecoms networks , routers and the data centres that keeps the internet running carried a carbon mouse - click of 830 m tonnes of CO2 .
Even by the industry 's own conservative estimates , that 's the equivalent of 2 % of all global greenhouse gas emissions for that year , putting it on a par with the aviation industry .
At the very least this is set to grow by 6 % a year , with the biggest growth coming from the developing world .
At the moment just one in 10 people in China own a PC .
By 2020 this is expected to rise to seven out of 10 , the same as the US .
It 's a similar story in India .
And on a global scale we will go from one in 50 people owning a computer to one in three in the same timeframe .
Meanwhile the number of internet servers required to keep these computers connected will rise from around 18 m to 122m .
Even with energy - efficiency improvements it will result in a tripling of e-missions on 2002 levels taking them to a whopping 259 m tonnes of CO2 in 2020 .
And all this assumes that we maintain the current trend of chucking out our laptops roughly every three to five years .
Yet with shops now offering free computers in exchange for mobile broadband subscriptions , there is a real danger that pretty soon we 'll be following the mobile phone model and upgrading every 12 to 18 months .
This is not to say you should n't donate your old laptops and desktops to charities – there are lots of charitable and humanitarian reasons to do so .
But to claim it is the greenest option is just wrong .
As benevolent and laudable as it may seem donating your PC to someone else , it 's worth bearing in mind that it is also helping to increase the user base of this technology , a user base that will require power , resources and produce its own e-missions .
Ultimately the greenest option is to just hang on to the computer , use thin client services to access the latest software and when the machine eventually packs up try to recycle it in the most responsible way .
Wall Street Journal reports on a fellow in the United States who has spent 14 years behind bars without being charged for anything .
Consider Mr. Chadwick 's case .
In 1994 , during divorce proceedings , a Delaware County judge held Mr. Chadwick in civil contempt for failing to put $ 2.5 million in a court - controlled account .
He says he lost the money in bad investments ; his wife 's attorney claimed he had hidden it offshore .
In April 1995 , Mr. Chadwick was arrested and detained .
Nearly 14 years later , Mr. Chadwick , who suffers from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , is still in jail — even after a retired judge was hired to help locate the money , and failed .
" The money is gone , " says Mr. Chadwick 's lawyer , Michael Malloy .
" The coercive effect of this order is gone ; it has turned into a life sentence . "
The judge who held Mr. Chadwick in contempt in 1994 could n't be reached for comment , but he has said publicly that he does n't believe Mr. Chadwick lacks the funds .

Existentialism has its limits when it comes to seabirds .
It ’s inexpensive , fun to make , non-processed and an all time favourite …. play dough !
Why make your own play dough ?
Aside from being a lot of fun and actively engaging your kids in an activity , traditional Play - doh includes a petroleum - based additive ( that gives it that waxy feel ) .
A petroleum - free homemade play dough is safer and environmentally preferred as petroleum is a finite resource .
Plus , you can opt for more eco-friendly ingredients such as organic flour and tea , in order to minimise the potential dangers of pesticide exposure found in traditional farming practices .
On your next rainy day , ask your kids to help you mix up their own play dough with naturally based colors for hours of sculpture making fun with this easy recipe .
Use cookie cutters , cups , bowls , and kid - safe cutting tools to shape your play dough , and for lighter coloured dough , you can imprint newspapers and non-glossy magazines .
While non-toxic and safe , we do n’t recommend eating it !
To make play dough you will need :
- 3 cups of flour ( organic is best or combine brown rice flour and maize flour to make it gluten free )
- 1.5 cups of salt
- 6 tsp cream of tartar
- 3 tbs oil
- 3 cups chamomile tea
- Optional : flowers , sand , turmeric and essential oils for colour , texture and scent ( see below ) .
Natural Colour suggestions
- Orange : a generous helping of paprika produces a beautiful orange
- Blue : 1 ½ cups of blueberries gives play dough a dark vibrant blue
- Pink / Fuchsia : 1 cup beets or beetroot juice
- Green : mix 1 cup blueberries with 2 tbsp turmeric
Experiment with food and come up with great colours of your own !
Step by step instructions
Dissolve salt in hot tea on the stove or in a microwave oven .
Pour all ingredients into a large pot .
Stir constantly over medium heat until a ball forms , pulling away from the sides .
Knead the dough mixture until smooth .
Add any extra colours , scents or textures you desire .
Store in an airtight container and remoisten if it begins to dry out .
Homemade play dough should last for many months .
Incredibly weird , inch - wide single - celled creatures discovered rolling across the sea floor
It ’s a single cell , it ’s the size of a grape , and it propels itself across the ocean floor : Behold the Bahamian Gromia — one of the strangest beasts yet discovered in the briny deep .
Gromia sphaerica , as the organisms are known , are superbig amoebas , growing up to 1.5 inches in diameter .
They were first discovered in 2000 in the Arabian Sea , and have since been found in various locations around the world .
Then last year a team of biologists were diving near Little San Salvador Island in the Bahamas , when they discovered a new form of Gromia — the “ Bahamian ” Gromia , as they ’re calling it .
The weird thing is , the Bahamanian Gromia were all found at the end of a trail — as if they ’d been somehow pushed or dragged along the seafloor .
This did n’t make sense , because the currents at that depth either were n’t strong enough or were irregular , so they would n’t push the Gromia in single , uniform paths , the way the trails lay .
That left only one possibility : Somehow , these wee blobs are propelling themselves across the ocean floor , at a pace so slow it can not be readily observed .
In a paper published a recent issue of Current Biology — “ Giant Deep - Sea Protist Produces Bilaterian - like Traces ” ( PDF here ) — the scientists argue this is precisely what ’s happening .
As they said in a press release :
“ We watched the video over and over , ” Johnsen said .
The trails could n’t be the result of currents because they went in several directions at the same spot , and sometimes they even changed course .
And they were n’t the result of rolling downhill .
In fact , one trail was found that went down into a small depression and came back up the other side .
“ We argued about it forever , ” Johnsen said .
“ These things ca n’t possibly be moving ! ”
But they are , at a rate too slow to be captured on the sub ’s video .
Johnsen guesses they move maybe an inch a day or less .
Here ’s the even crazier thing :
If these guys are right , this discovery could completely upend our ideas about the “ Cambrian explosion . ”
Remember those tracks the Bahamian Gromia left ?
They ’re found in the pre-Cambrian fossil record .
For years scientists assumed that only organisms with complex body plans that are symmetrical down the middle — “ bilateria , ” as they ’re called — could possibly move in a fashion that would leave such trails .
Thus , biologists have argued that bilateria were around before the Cambrian explosion , which sort of primed the pump for that crazily rapid diversification of bilateria into all the major animal groups we have today .
But now it looks as though all those pre-Cambrian seabed trails could have been left by rolling , grape - sized ameobas .
Maybe — who knows ? — the Cambrian explosion happened even more psychotically quickly than we think .
Maybe bilateria were n’t kicking around for millions of years later than we suspect .
The Rolling Grape That Rocked The Fossil Record .
As I ’ve said before , you ca n’t make this stuff up , and thankfully you do n’t need to .
Check below the jump for pictures of the trails the Bahamian Gromia leave !

Wilfrid Sellars by James R. O’Shea
Daniel Fernandez gets to know Wilfrid Sellars , US Chief of Epistemology .
For the non-sellars - specialist , Robert Brandom ’s recent on - line declaration that “ Wilfrid Sellars is the greatest American philosopher since Charles Sanders Peirce … [ and ] the most profound and systematic epistemological thinker of the 20th Century ” might seem rather baffling .
Even though a quick glance at his disciples reads like a who ’s who of contemporary American philosophers , mentioning Sellars is more likely to evoke images of a certain English actor .
Thankfully this is all set to change , with the publication of four major books in the last four years devoted entirely to Wilfrid Sellars .
Hardly merely the latest in transient academic fads , understanding Sellars instead gives much insight into the paths American philosophy took in the twentieth century .
With his pioneering insights in the philosophy of mind and language and in epistemology , Sellars may also provide a glimpse of where American philosophy is heading .
James R. O’Shea ’s Wilfrid Sellars is a welcome addition to the literature , particularly in its accessibility to undergraduates or those not so well - versed in the nuances of analytic philosophy .
Besides providing an introduction to Sellars ’ philosophy , it also provides a succinct and illuminating biographical sketch of a man raised in an intensely intellectual environment .
Wilfrid Stalker Sellars ( 1912 -1989 ) was the son of Roy Wood Sellars , a seminal naturalist of the first half of the twentieth century .
His mother , Helen Maud Stalker , was a French translator .
The younger Sellars ’ formative years were spent in Paris and Munich , with his formal philosophical training taking place in Michigan , Buffalo , Oxford and eventually Harvard .
What resulted was an insightful and incisive philosopher with a gift for imaginative and witty writing .
Sellars ’ academic career would begin at Iowa , moving on to Minnesota and Yale , before ending up at Pittsburgh , where his legacy is reflected in different ways by Robert Brandom and John McDowell .
Sellars ’ relative obscurity is not entirely due to bad luck : what makes Sellars ’ work so appealing is simultaneously what makes it unappealing to others .
The scope and depth of his work certainly touches on issues of concern to both professional and non-professional philosopher alike .
What is a mind ?
What do we mean by meaning ?
What is knowledge ?
What is the individual ’s relationship to society ?
Sellars provides answers to all these questions , but he does so in an idiom that analytic philosophers have found odd , if not perplexing .
On the one hand , much of his work relies heavily on a more - than - casual acquaintance with the history of philosophy .
On the other , many of his arguments are couched in thought experiments and analogies that require subtlety and close reading to understand .
Yet these qualms are also what makes Sellars such an inventive and exciting thinker .
O’Shea ’s strategy for threading the diverse strands of Sellars ’ corpus is to stress how Sellars sees himself as a systematic philosopher despite his varied interests .
Sellars thought the task of philosophy was to provide a ‘ synoptic ’ view of “ how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest sense of the term . ”
But rather than trying to obliterate common sense with some philosophical wrecking ball , Sellars asks a more difficult question : just where and how does our commonsense outlook fit into our increasingly fine - grained scientific outlook ?
To take a characteristic example , how can we make our perception of a pink ice cube compatible with ‘ colorless ’ particle physics ?
Questions like these express the clash of what Sellars called the manifest and scientific images of man .
And while he ultimately prides himself a scientific realist , a notable feature of Sellars ’ philosophy which distinguishes him from , say , Quine , is the importance placed on the manifest image – that is , how things naturally appear to us .
For according to Sellars , philosophy is at the end of the day about us , about persons .
Throughout his text , O’Shea tries to capture the zeitgeist for both Sellars and our times : he places the philosopher ’s work within the contexts both of his contemporaries and of ours , as if to answer the reader ’s implicit question of why Sellars matters today .
Like today , throughout the early twentieth century philosophers struggled over where and how philosophy fits in with naturalistic science .
The Logical Positivists of the Vienna Circle , for instance , suggested subordinating philosophy to science and of purging philosophy of anything unverifiable .
Although inspired by the Vienna Circle to some degree , Sellars ’ synoptic view presents a richer scientific worldview than logical positivism would allow .
Sellars views our non-scientific ways of thinking as being indispensable not only for knowledge but as the very basis for perception and thought .
Such is the lesson of Sellars ’ famous rejection of the ‘ myth of the given ’ .
Empiricist philosophy says that our ideas come from direct experience of things .
The ‘ myth of the given ’ is that individual pieces of data can be known directly , that is , without any knowledge of associated concepts .
While Sellars broadly defends empiricism he nonetheless identifies something wildly circular about this model .
Consider : How can I say I know what red is from the fact that some things look red to me ?
In Sellars ’ view , in order to say anything ‘ looks red ’ we would already require the concept of ‘ is red ’ .
But having that concept would assume we can already distinguish red from other colors , as well as that we can distinguish color from , say , shapes .
Sellars then is a psychological holist , for whom awareness of anything requires knowledge of many other things as well as requiring the operation of rules of social norms for how all these things hang together mentally .
Figuring out how things ( ie ideas ) hang together also requires figuring out who figures this out and what such a figuring out means .
O’Shea thus offers us an introduction into how Sellars viewed thought and language .
Rather than thoughts being substantial entities identified either with physical brains or immaterial minds , Sellars understands thoughts as having functional roles , requiring some physical system to be instantiated , but perhaps no one particular physical system such as someone ’s brain .
Think of thoughts here like word processing .
Word processing needs some machine to get its work done , but the hardware and software of word processing has changed a great deal since the 1980s .
This view of mind gave birth to what is called functionalism these days .
Functionalism has had a significant impact on cognitive science and the philosophy of artificial intelligence .
Indeed , as O’Shea points out , there are many today ( Daniel Dennett , for instance ) who would go so far as to credit Sellars as the founder of functionalism .
Sellars took a similar approach to language , where the meaning of a word is the role it plays in the economy of the language as a whole .
This circles back to Sellars ’ views on perception and knowledge , where to have a perception or thought is to have mastery not just of a word , but of a whole battery of words .
In other words , thought is modeled on speech for Sellars , instead of the other way around .
Readers of the later Wittgenstein will certainly see affinities here , as will some readers of Hegel .
Of course , this kind of ‘ logical ’ holism is up for as much debate today as when Sellars published Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind in 1956 .
While O’Shea presents the criticisms of Sellars ’ contemporaries , the variety of present - day Sellarsian interpretations and criticisms are given scant attention .
In all fairness , however , such a task is for another book entirely .
O’Shea consistently stresses the importance of Kant to Sellars – a facet that has often been neglected in the recent rushes to make Sellars ’ functionalism one ’s own .
Yet given Sellars ’ occasional and subtle references to Hegel ( especially in the very first sentence of Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind ) , it is disappointing that there is scarce treatment of possible Hegelian influences .
This is unfortunate considering that the Sellarsian renaissance , as it were , is taking place in an age where many philosophy departments think it acceptable to fast forward from Kant right through to Frege .
Sellars ’ approach to ethics and action , barely even mentioned in current conversations of his work , is also given altogether too brief a treatment .
However , O’Shea certainly provides enough of a starting point for those interested in pursuing these topics , and the preceding chapters lay the ground for appreciating Sellars ’ metaethics in the context of his other work .
In the author ’s own prefatory admission , the book is an introductory text , rather than a comprehensive study .
But O’Shea ’s extensive bibliography is as useful as it is thorough , especially in its inclusion of the vast secondary literature .
With Sellars nearly becoming required reading for some of the current debates in philosophy , and despite additional overviews having already arrived , O’Shea ’s text offers a systematic initiation that compels the reader to pursue her own further research .
This seems to be the only cure for those of us who have been “ tempted by the apple of the serpent philosopher ” as Sellars , quoted by O’Shea , called them .
For once one sees philosophy in the vein that Sellars does , once can continue only by “ eating the apple to the core ; for after the first bite , there is no return to innocence . ”

If the past few months have felt like America 's institutions and maybe society itself are falling completely apart , it could be because that 's exactly what 's happening .
History says so .
So does anthropology .
An expert in both disciplines says human civilizations provide a template for those societies that have come together , become steadily more complex , then head almost inexorably toward collapse .
Even the society that has risen up here between the shining seas is well down the same path , according to a widely cited and published historical anthropologist .
Joseph Tainter , who heads the department of environment and society at Utah State University , told the newspaper that the current course of the economy and what some believe is a desperate effort to shore up the complex and almost inscrutable financial sector of the economy are manifestations of at least a partial collapse that invariably follows a society 's boom .
Tainter and his research are included in " Earth 2100 , " the ABC News assessment of how life might be 100 years from now .
He is also a source in " The 11th Hour , " actor Leonardo DiCaprio 's documentary that connects the dots of how our doing ultimately leads to our undoing .
Tainter 's original research is published in the book " The Collapse of Complex Societies . "
Tainter is not a doomsdayer , but his research amounts to a chilling prognostication that the very nature of civilization means that ours , like all the others , is destined to collapse .
" For the past 10,000 years , problem - solving has produced increasing complexity in human societies , " Tainter said , noting that for every extra layer of organization imposed , it takes extra energy of the society to maintain .
" And the more complex a society becomes , the more energy it takes to maintain it and the more it produces diminishing returns . "
To keep growing , societies must keep solving problems as they arise .
Yet success generates a larger population , more specialists , more resources to manage and more information to handle that ultimately provides less bang per buck .
Tainter sees diminishing returns as the underlying reason for the collapse of all ancient civilizations .
Western industrial civilization has become bigger and more complex than any before it by exploiting new sources of energy , notably coal and oil , but these are limited , and constant innovation is needed .
The threat of a coming pandemic that would wipe out everyone rose again and seemed to quickly void , although briefly , the belief that our society has achieved a scale , a complexity and level of innovation that make it immune from collapse .
In fact , the opposite is true , Tainter said .
" Possibilities range from little effect to a mild recession to a major depression to a collapse . "
Looking at a previous society , the Roman Empire , he said as agricultural output slowly declined and population increased , per-capita energy availability dropped .
The Romans " solved " this problem by conquering their neighbors to appropriate their energy surpluses ( metals , grain , slaves , etc. ) .
However , as the empire grew , the cost of maintaining communications , garrisons and civil government grew with it .
Eventually , this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory .
At that point , the empire fragmented into smaller units .
" When some new input to an economic system is brought on line , whether a technical innovation or an energy subsidy , it will often have the potential at least temporarily to raise marginal productivity , " he said .
" Eventually , barring continual conquest of your neighbors — which is always subject to diminishing returns — innovation that increases productivity is in the long run the only way out of the dismal science dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity . "
Tainter avoids conclusions and recommendations , but he believes in replacing the one thing that has allowed the United States to boom — oil — with the one thing that will forestall its collapse — renewable energy .
The complexity / collapse model also would explain the increase in the complexity of the American financial markets , their collapse , and the fragmenting of the banks and the auto industry .

09/15/08$691 billionOne of the biggest calamities of the current recession is the fall of the once highly regarded ( and onetime fourth - largest ) Wall Street investment firm , which was forced to file for bankruptcy protection last September , the largest corporate filing in the history of U.S. bankruptcy court .
As a result , the company 's North American investment banking and trading businesses and New York City headquarters were sold to British bank Barclays .
Some of Lehman's U.S. businesses , including wealth management firm Neuberger - Berman , continue to operate as stand - alone entities under new ownership .
And because of the company 's global reach , its bankruptcy proceedings are complex , ongoing , and have resulted in the closing of 80 of the bank 's smaller subsidiaries .
Manny Ramirez is getting his timing back quickly in Albuquerque and is supposed to rejoin the Dodgers Friday .
In his four rehab games between High - A Inland Empire and AAA Albuquerque , Ramirez is 3 - 8 with a home run .
In Manny ’s first rehab game , I got nervous because he went 0 - 2 against Manny Parra , a recent demotion in Milwaukee .
Seems like everyone is hitting Parra these days , even in the minors .
My fear that Ramirez may need more time to get ready were squashed by a homer on Sunday and being 1 - 1 as of this writing on Monday .
I guess after being off for four weeks , his timing would take a couple of games to get back to speed .
Who loses in LA ?
I think Juan Pierre may be the odd man out despite his stellar fill - in work as a starter in Manny ’s abscence .
Andre Ethier is having too good of a year ( 14 HR’s , 50 RBI ) to bench , and Matt Kemp is batting .310 , so AB ’s may become scarce for Pierre after Thursday night .
Adding Manny ’s big stick back into the equation is going to make the Dodgers an offensive juggernaut for the rest of 2009 and well into the playoffs .

This woman was arrested when police raided a cannabis factory Police have arrested a gardener in Peterborough , Cambridgeshire , who they suspect has been tending drugs .
They believe the illegal migrant was smuggled to the UK by a crime gang who forced her into watering plants at a cannabis factory .
Within minutes of her arrest the 43 - year - old is in the police custody suite at Thorpe Wood station in the city .
When she is led to a cell she blurts out her story and bursts into tears .
She was smuggled here , desperate to earn money to send home to her children and her disabled husband .
She owes £ 6,000 to the traffickers who flew her to Germany and brought her to Britain hidden in a lorry .
Furious banging
Now she cannot pay them , she is in debt and she says she wants to die .
She will probably be jailed and then deported .
Her case provides a snapshot of the pressures facing police dealing with migrants .
Officers must now locate an interpreter and begin the lengthy process of completing the paperwork .
The problem with different nationalities is that it slows everything down
Insp Chip Walker Within minutes two Lithuanians are brought in after police find them allegedly carrying CS spray canisters in their car .
Then an Egyptian arrives .
He has been arrested at a factory .
He pretends he 's a Palestinian in the vain hope to avoid deportation .
Officers have seen it all before and deal with him patiently .
The Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Julie Spence recently made headlines when she spoke out about the huge strain mass migration is placing on existing police resources .
This is a city where you can find interpreters earning more than the Chief Constable .
One translator dealing with Latvian and Lithuanian prisoners picked - up £ 150,000 last year - the tab settled by tax payers .
Court frustration Thorpe Wood police station alone spent £ 500,000 on interpreters last year .
Insp Chip
Walker tells me : " The problem with different nationalities , for people who do n't have English as a first language , is that it slows everything down - while we 've got people here we need to get hold of interpreters by telephone or face to face . "
In 2003 12 % of people arrested in Peterborough were foreign nationals , the force said .
Three years later that figure had risen to 20 % .
Foreign nationals now account for almost half of all drink - drive arrests in the city .
I decide to conduct my own research at Peterborough Magistrates ' Court .
If we have fewer resources the pressures can be just as great as some of the big cities
Julie Spence
Of the 95 cases listed on a daily court list , 75 of them involve migrants .
Most charges relate to motoring offences .
I watch in court as one man from Poland insists - through his interpreter - that he does have a driving licence and insurance , he just does not have the documents on him .
The magistrate contains her frustration as she asks him why he has n't brought them along with him .
It is clear she thinks he 's trying it on .
The case is adjourned .
The bench has 90 similar cases to deal with the next day .
The court is spending about £ 1,500 a day on interpreters - about £ 30,000 a month .
The chief constable has said she will continue pressing the Home Office for more resources , ahead of a meeting with the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith next week .
When asked if she agreed with critics who have suggested the government has a blind spot on migration issues , she said : " There is , I think , a blind spot in the Metropolitan areas , a view that the smaller counties and the rural counties have no problems .
" In fact they can be equally significant .
If we have fewer resources the pressures can be just as great as some of the big cities . "
The Home Office would not be drawn on next week 's meeting between chief constables and the home secretary .
The migration issue is one of many topics being discussed .

Instead of teaching us about the full range of sushi fish and shellfish , as well as the varied tastes and textures of the cuisine , most sushi chefs in the U.S. have neglected the Japanese style of eating and force - fed us simplistic menus that feature the least environmentally friendly — and least healthful — items : at the high end , bluefin tuna ; at the low end , fatty belly cuts from lesser tuna ; along with fatty industrial salmon , and factory - farmed shrimp and eel saturated in sugar .
Until the latter half of the 20th century , none of these was considered suitable fare by connoisseurs of traditional sushi ; none adheres to the Japanese practice of highlighting local , seasonal ingredients .
So imagine my delight when I walked into a sushi bar one evening and found not only a welcoming neighborhood atmosphere , but a chef who explained that he does n’t serve bluefin tuna , because he does n’t want it to go extinct .
And imagine my surprise that this restaurant was in western Massachusetts , and that the chef was a rambunctious American whose ancestors had come not from Asia but from Europe .
At Fin Sushi in Lenox , Nick Macioge jokes with his diners and encourages them to get to know each other .
Like a sushi bar in Japan , Fin is small and dominated by the counter .
It ’s not just the atmosphere .
Macioge also tries to serve a more authentic meal .
Instead of suggesting tuna , for example , he ’ll talk his customers into sampling one of the most traditional sushi fish there is — saba , a mackerel that Macioge lightly marinates in salt and vinegar to bring the fish to the peak of flavor .
Macioge admits that it ’s hard to persuade Americans to try the more traditional fish and shellfish , even though they ’re more flavorful and generally less fatty .
( These sea creatures also live lower on the food chain , they ’re smaller , and they reproduce more quickly , which means they tend to contain less mercury and the catch is more sustainable . )
But his approach has earned the food at Fin Sushi an exceptionally high Zagat rating — 27 out of 30 .
Macioge is one of a growing number of successful non-Asian sushi chefs .
In 2005 , Food & Wine magazine chose as one of its Best New Chefs a Caucasian sushi chef in Texas named Tyson Cole .
A few months later , a San Diego chef named Jerry Warner was picked as California ’s Sushi Master .
Two years ago , one of the most high - profile Japanese restaurants in America , Morimoto , in New York City — operated by Masaharu Morimoto , an “ Iron Chef ” of Food Network fame — chose as its head sushi chef a young Caucasian named Robby Cook .
And this year , one of the most talked - about sushi bars in San Francisco has been Sebo , run by chefs Daniel Dunham and Michael Black .
( Black is half - Japanese and spent the first seven years of his life in Japan . )
These chefs offer sushi fish so traditional that most Americans have never heard of them — which is why Dunham and Black chat across the fish case with customers about what they ’re serving , just like the chefs I remember in Japan .
Mr Lansley 's absence was the subject of much mirth among the panel Filming of BBC One 's Question Time has had to be delayed after Conservative shadow cabinet member Andrew Lansley failed to arrive on time .
The Cambridgeshire South MP turned up for filming in Great Yarmouth just before 2100 BST , almost an hour after the rest of the panel were in place .
The shadow health secretary had his make - up applied hurriedly in front of the laughing audience .
Mr Lansley said he was sorry and blamed the traffic around Ipswich .
A Conservative spokesman said : " Andrew Lansley was late setting off as he had to attend a meeting at the Department of Health with Alan Johnson and Sir Liam Donaldson on the swine flu outbreak .
" We were also very surprised that once we had got to Ipswich it took nearly two more hours to get to Great Yarmouth . "
Question
Time 's production team had said the show , which is pre-recorded as live for a showing later on Thursday evening , would go ahead without the MP , had he not arrived by the 2100 BST final deadline .
Filming had been due to start at 2030 BST .
' Asleep with boredom '
In Mr Lansley 's absence , the panel conducted a prolonged , unrecorded discussion on the subject of sex education in schools to fill time .
Host David Dimbleby repeatedly joked that the shadow minister had driven to Lowestoft , just down the eastern coast of England in Suffolk , by mistake and had no satellite navigation system in his car .
At one point he said : " We are in danger of falling asleep with boredom waiting for him . "
Comedian Frank Skinner , making his debut on the show , replied : " I 've never been so insulted . "
But Mr Lansley , who arrived to large cheers from the audience in Great Yarmouth 's Hippodrome , set the record when he turned up with minutes to spare .
Apologising in case he was sweating , said : " I 'm very sorry to keep you waiting .
I now know how long it can take driving up from Ipswich . "

To high school seniors in Matthew Pesci 's class at Laguna Creek High School in Sacramento , California , Wednesday 's lecture was real life .
The kind with dollars and cents attached : How to avoid overdraft fees .
How to keep from bouncing checks .
How to maintain a savings account .
How to stay out of debt .
The college - bound seniors even practiced writing a check - of $ 1 ( £ 0.68 ) .
The money talk , by two local bank managers , is one of thousands being delivered by bankers to students nationwide .
It 's part of an American Bankers Association effort to reach 1 million students in April , which is Financial Literacy Month .
" They 're getting ready for college .
They 're going away from their parents for the first time .
And they 'll be managing their money alone for the first time , " said Pesci , who teaches in Laguna Creek 's college - prep programme .
Although money management is not part of the required curriculum , Pesci has walked his 17 - and 18 - year - old students through such real - life basics as credit card comparisons and college financial aid .
" Especially with everything you hear about the economy right now , " said Pesci , " I did n't want them to be one of the statistics . "
The struggling economy - which has ripped into jobs , homes and incomes in many families this past year - is driving home the need for financial education .
" This is a unique moment in US history to empower teens with the financial literacy skills that can serve them as adults - skills many of their parents lack and that many schools are unable to provide , " wrote Gary Hickman , president of Junior Achievement , Southern California , in a recent internet posting .
The economy 's impact is affecting teens on many fronts .
According to a financial survey of US students ages 12 - 17 by Junior Achievement and the Allstate Foundation in February , 12 % had been asked to help with the family budget , 15 % had curtailed extracurricular activities , and nearly half ( 49 % ) said their parents had discussed family finances .
Just this week , the Chicago public schools system announced that personal finance instruction will be taught in all of the city 's 116 public high schools , starting this fall .
In California , statewide efforts are a little slower , partly due to the state 's budget crisis .
Only Missouri , Tennessee and Utah require high school students to have a semester of personal finance , according to the Jumpstart Coalition , a national group that promotes youth financial literacy .
Other states require a semester of economics , but not necessarily tied to money skills .
Last week , California assemblyman Ted Lieu , a longtime proponent of financial literacy in schools , got some traction with his bill to establish a " one- stop shop " for financial literacy curriculum - in several languages .
It would concentrate financial literacy resources _ for teachers , parents and consumers - under the state controller 's office .
It will be taken up by the full assembly in May .
" The scale of the financial and mortgage crisis is so large ... and there 's realisation it would have been mitigated if more citizens were financially literate , " he said .
He and others would like to see the state require schools to offer instruction in personal money matters , like how to buy a car , get a mortgage , save and invest .
" No one is taught this information in school , " Lieu added .
" Because of our own economic issues , California is probably not going to see anything mandated in the near term , " said Karen Anderson , president of the California Jumpstart Coalition .
But " awareness is growing " , she added .
" More parents want to be sure their kids do n't get into the same kind of problems they are having with mortgages and credit cards . "
In classrooms like Pesci's , the financial message is spreading .
Warning that " tons of companies will be soliciting you " for credit cards , car loans and other debt vehicles , one of the bank managers advised the students to be careful financially .
" You 're lucky .
You 'll start off with a clean slate , " said Jaena Nakagawa , noting that a credit score can take years to build but only 30 days to destroy .
To stay financially fit , she recommended tallying daily expenses in a checkbook ; saving up for big purchases , rather than running up a credit card balance ; paying bills on time ; and avoiding bank overdraft fees that will cause " a $ 2 bottle of water to eventually cost you $ 40 " .
She also offered a cautionary tale from her bank : a young customer who was so awash in credit card debt he filed for bankruptcy - before he was old enough to drink .
Judging by the hands raised and questions asked , the money management messages are sinking in .
Jasmine Shelmire , 18 , is working at a McDonald 's outlet to help pay for college next fall .
Her takeaway from Wednesday 's session ?
" Do n't be afraid to ask questions and be sure you fully understand the financial product you 're getting , " she said .
For many of these students , the economy 's bigger lessons are playing out right before their eyes .
Talisha Lowe , who plans to study nursing at San Jose State University next fall , says foreclosures in her neighborhood have already forced some neighbors from their homes .
And some friends have the grades - but not the money - to attend a four - year college .
But Lowe , who said her mom's " a great budgeter " and taught her to set aside 10 % of her allowance for savings and 10 % for tithing , feels prepared .
" I want to do things in life , " said Lowe , whose dream is to work in neonatology , " without being held down by debt and credit card problems " .

The global recession is the biggest development in the global system in the year to date .
In the United States , it has become almost dogma that the recession is the worst since the Great Depression .
But this is only one of a wealth of misperceptions about whom the downturn is hurting most , and why .
Let 's begin with some simple numbers .
As one can see in the chart , the U.S. recession at this point is only the worst since 1982 , not the 1930s , and it pales in comparison to what is occurring in the rest of the world .
( Figures for China have not been included , in part because of the unreliability of Chinese statistics , but also because the country 's financial system is so radically different from the rest of the world as to make such comparisons misleading .
For more , read the China section below . )
But did n't the recession begin in the United States ?
That it did , but the American system is far more stable , durable and flexible than most of the other global economies , in large part thanks to the country 's geography .
To understand how place shapes economics , we need to take a giant step back from the gloom and doom of the current moment and examine the long - term picture of why different regions follow different economic paths .
The United States and the Free Market The most important aspect of the United States is not simply its sheer size , but the size of its usable land .
Russia and China may both be similar - sized in absolute terms , but the vast majority of Russian and Chinese land is useless for agriculture , habitation or development .
In contrast , courtesy of the Midwest , the United States boasts the world 's largest contiguous mass of arable land — and that mass does not include the hardly inconsequential chunks of usable territory on both the West and East coasts .
Second is the American maritime transport system .
The Mississippi River , linked as it is to the Red , Missouri , Ohio and Tennessee rivers , comprises the largest interconnected network of navigable rivers in the world .
In the San Francisco Bay , Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound / New York Bay , the United States has three of the world 's largest and best natural harbors .
The series of barrier islands a few miles off the shores of Texas and the East Coast form a water - based highway — an Intracoastal Waterway — that shields American coastal shipping from all but the worst that the elements can throw at ships and ports .
( click image to enlarge )
The real beauty is that the two overlap with near perfect symmetry .
The Intracoastal Waterway and most of the bays link up with agricultural regions and their own local river systems ( such as the series of rivers that descend from the Appalachians to the East Coast ) , while the Greater Mississippi river network is the circulatory system of the Midwest .
Even without the addition of canals , it is possible for ships to reach nearly any part of the Midwest from nearly any part of the Gulf or East coasts .
The result is not just a massive ability to grow a massive amount of crops — and not just the ability to easily and cheaply move the crops to local , regional and global markets — but also the ability to use that same transport network for any other economic purpose without having to worry about food supplies .
The implications of such a confluence are deep and sustained .
Where most countries need to scrape together capital to build roads and rail to establish the very foundation of an economy — transport capability — geography granted the United States a near - perfect system at no cost .
That frees up U.S. capital for other pursuits and almost condemns the United States to be capital - rich .
Any additional infrastructure the United States constructs is icing on the cake .
( The cake itself is free — and , incidentally , the United States had so much free capital that it was able to go on to build one of the best road - and - rail networks anyway , resulting in even greater economic advantages over competitors . )
Third , geography has also ensured that the United States has very little local competition .
To the north , Canada is both much colder and much more mountainous than the United States .
Canada 's only navigable maritime network — the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Seaway — is shared with the United States , and most of its usable land is hard by the American border .
Often this makes it more economically advantageous for Canadian provinces to integrate with their neighbor to the south than with their co-nationals to the east and west .
Similarly , Mexico has only small chunks of land , separated by deserts and mountains , that are useful for much more than subsistence agriculture ; most of Mexican territory is either too dry , too tropical or too mountainous .
And Mexico completely lacks any meaningful river system for maritime transport .
Add in a largely desert border , and Mexico as a country is not a meaningful threat to American security ( which hardly means that there are not serious and ongoing concerns in the American - Mexican relationship ) .
With geography empowering the United States and hindering Canada and Mexico , the United States does not need to maintain a large standing military force to counter either .
The Canadian border is almost completely unguarded , and the Mexican border is no more than a fence in most locations — a far cry from the sort of military standoffs that have marked more adversarial borders in human history .
Not only are Canada and Mexico not major threats , but the U.S. transport network allows the United States the luxury of being able to quickly move a smaller force to deal with occasional problems rather than requiring it to station large static forces on its borders .
Like the transport network , this also helps the U.S. focus its resources on other things .
Taken together , the integrated transport network , large tracts of usable land and lack of a need for a standing military have one critical implication :
The U.S. government tends to take a hands - off approach to economic management , because geography has not cursed the United States with any endemic problems .
This may mean that the United States — and especially its government — comes across as disorganized , but it shifts massive amounts of labor and capital to the private sector , which for the most part allows resources to flow to wherever they will achieve the most efficient and productive results .
Laissez - faire capitalism has its flaws .
Inequality and social stress are just two of many less - than - desirable side effects .
The side effects most relevant to the current situation are , of course , the speculative bubbles that cause recessions when they pop .
But in terms of long - term economic efficiency and growth , a free capital system is unrivaled .
For the United States , the end result has proved clear :
The United States has exited each decade since post - Civil War Reconstruction more powerful than it was when it entered it .
While there are many forces in the modern world that threaten various aspects of U.S. economic standing , there is not one that actually threatens the U.S. base geographic advantages .
Is the United States in recession ?
Of course .
Will it be forever ?
Of course not .
So long as U.S. geographic advantages remain intact , it takes no small amount of paranoia and pessimism to envision anything but long - term economic expansion for such a chunk of territory .
In fact , there are a number of factors hinting that the United States may even be on the cusp of recovery .
Russia and the State If in economic terms the United States has everything going for it geographically , then Russia is just the opposite .
The Russian steppe lies deep in the interior of the Eurasian landmass , and as such is subject to climatic conditions much more hostile to human habitation and agriculture than is the American Midwest .
Even in those blessed good years when crops are abundant in Russia , it has no river network to allow for easy transport of products .
Russia has no good warm - water ports to facilitate international trade ( and has spent much of its history seeking access to one ) .
Russia does have long rivers , but they are not interconnected as the Mississippi is with its tributaries , instead flowing north to the Arctic Ocean , which can support no more than a token population .
The one exception is the Volga , which is critical to Western Russian commerce but flows to the Caspian , a storm - wracked and landlocked sea whose delta freezes in the winter ( along with the entire Volga itself ) .
Developing such unforgiving lands requires a massive outlay of funds simply to build the road and rail networks necessary to achieve the most basic of economic development .
The cost is so extreme that Russia 's first ever intercontinental road was not completed until the 21st century , and it is little more than a two - lane path for much of its length .
Between the lack of ports and the relatively low population densities , little of Russia 's transport system beyond the St. Petersburg / Moscow corridor approaches anything that hints of economic rationality .
Russia also has no meaningful external borders .
It sits on the eastern end of the North European Plain , which stretches all the way to Normandy , France , and Russia 's connections to the Asian steppe flow deep into China .
Because Russia lacks a decent internal transport network that can rapidly move armies from place to place , geography forces Russia to defend itself following two strategies .
First , it requires massive standing armies on all of its borders .
Second , it dictates that Russia continually push its boundaries outward to buffer its core against external threats .
Both strategies compromise Russian economic development even further .
The large standing armies are a continual drain on state coffers and the country 's labor pool ; their cost was a critical economic factor in the Soviet fall .
The expansionist strategy not only absorbs large populations that do not wish to be part of the Russian state and so must constantly be policed — the core rationale for Russia 's robust security services — but also inflates Russia 's infrastructure development costs by increasing the amount of relatively useless territory Moscow is responsible for .
Russia 's labor and capital resources are woefully inadequate to overcome the state 's needs and vulnerabilities , which are legion .
These endemic problems force Russia toward central planning ; the full harnessing of all economic resources available is required if Russia is to achieve even a modicum of security and stability .
One of the many results of this is severe economic inefficiency and a general dearth of an internal consumer market .
Because capital and other resources can be flung forcefully at problems , however , active management can achieve specific national goals more readily than a hands - off , American - style model .
This often gives the impression of significant progress in areas the Kremlin chooses to highlight .
But such achievements are largely limited to wherever the state happens to be directing its attention .
In all other sectors , the lack of attention results in atrophy or criminalization .
This is particularly true in modern Russia , where the ruling elite comprises just a handful of people , starkly limiting the amount of planning and oversight possible .
And unless management is perfect in perception and execution , any mistakes are quickly magnified into national catastrophes .
It is therefore no surprise to STRATFOR that the Russian economy has now fallen the furthest of any major economy during the current recession .
China and Separatism China also faces significant hurdles , albeit none as daunting as Russia 's challenges .
China 's core is the farmland of the Yellow River basin in the north of the country , a river that is not readily navigable and is remarkably flood prone .
Simply avoiding periodic starvation requires a high level of state planning and coordination .
( Wrestling a large river is not the easiest thing one can do . )
Additionally , the southern half of the country has a subtropical climate , riddling it with diseases that the southerners are resistant to but the northerners are not .
This compromises the north 's political control of the south .
Central control is also threatened by China 's maritime geography .
China boasts two other rivers , but they do not link to each other or the Yellow naturally .
And China 's best ports are at the mouths of these two rivers : Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze and Hong Kong / Macau / Guangzhou at the mouth of the Pearl .
The Yellow boasts no significant ocean port .
The end result is that other regional centers can and do develop economic means independent of Beijing .
( click image to enlarge )
With geography complicating northern rule and supporting southern economic independence , Beijing 's age - old problem has been trying to keep China in one piece .
Beijing has to underwrite massive ( and expensive ) development programs to stitch the country together with a common infrastructure , the most visible of which is the Grand Canal that links the Yellow and Yangtze rivers .
The cost of such linkages instantly guarantees that while China may have a shot at being unified , it will always be capital - poor .
Beijing also has to provide its autonomy - minded regions with an economic incentive to remain part of Greater China , and " simple " infrastructure will not cut it .
Modern China has turned to a state - centered finance model for this .
Under the model , all of the scarce capital that is available is funneled to the state , which divvies it out via a handful of large state banks .
These state banks then grant loans to various firms and local governments at below the cost of raising the capital .
This provides a powerful economic stimulus that achieves maximum employment and growth — think of what you could do with a near - endless supply of loans at below 0 percent interest — but comes at the cost of encouraging projects that are loss - making , as no one is ever called to account for failures .
( They can just get a new loan . )
The resultant growth is rapid , but it is also unsustainable .
It is no wonder , then , that the central government has chosen to keep its $ 2 trillion of currency reserves in dollar - based assets ; the rate of return is greater , the value holds over a long period , and Beijing does n't have to worry about the United States seceding .
Because the domestic market is considerably limited by the poor - capital nature of the country , most producers choose to tap export markets to generate income .
In times of plenty this works fairly well , but when Chinese goods are not needed , the entire Chinese system can seize up .
Lack of exports reduces capital availability , which constrains loan availability .
This in turn not only damages the ability of firms to employ China 's legions of citizens , but it also removes the primary reason the disparate Chinese regions pay homage to Beijing .
China 's geography hardwires in a series of economic challenges that weaken the coherence of the state and make China dependent upon uninterrupted access to foreign markets to maintain state unity .
As a result , China has not been a unified entity for the vast majority of its history , but instead a cauldron of competing regions that cleave along many different fault lines : coastal versus interior , Han versus minority , north versus south .
China 's survival technique for the current recession is simple .
Because exports , which account for roughly half of China 's economic activity , have sunk by half , Beijing is throwing the equivalent of the financial kitchen sink at the problem .
China has force - fed more loans through the banks in the first four months of 2009 than it did in the entirety of 2008 .
The long - term result could well bury China beneath a mountain of bad loans — a similar strategy resulted in Japan 's 1991 crash , from which Tokyo has yet to recover .
But for now it is holding the country together .
The bottom line remains , however : China 's recovery is completely dependent upon external demand for its production , and the most it can do on its own is tread water .
Discordant Europe Europe faces an imbroglio somewhat similar to China's .
Europe has a number of rivers that are easily navigable , providing a wealth of trade and development opportunities .
But none of them interlinks with the others , retarding political unification .
Europe has even more good harbors than the United States , but they are not evenly spread throughout the Continent , making some states capital - rich and others capital - poor .
Europe boasts one huge piece of arable land on the North European Plain , but it is long and thin , and so occupied by no fewer than seven distinct ethnic groups .
These groups have constantly struggled — as have the various groups up and down Europe 's seemingly endless list of river valleys — but none has been able to emerge dominant , due to the webwork of mountains and peninsulas that make it nigh impossible to fully root out any particular group .
And Europe 's wealth of islands close to the Continent , with Great Britain being only the most obvious , guarantee constant intervention to ensure that mainland Europe never unifies under a single power .
Every part of Europe has a radically different geography than the other parts , and thus the economic models the Europeans have adopted have little in common .
The United Kingdom , with few immediate security threats and decent rivers and ports , has an almost American - style laissez - faire system .
France , with three unconnected rivers lying wholly in its own territory , is a somewhat self - contained world , making economic nationalism its credo .
Not only do the rivers in Germany not connect , but Berlin has to share them with other states .
The Jutland Peninsula interrupts the coastline of Germany , which finds its sea access limited by the Danes , the Swedes and the British .
Germany must plan in great detail to maximize its resource use to build an infrastructure that can compensate for its geographic deficiencies and link together its good — but disparate — geographic blessings .
The result is a state that somewhat favors free enterprise , but within the limits framed by national needs .
And the list of differences goes on : Spain has long coasts and is arid ; Austria is landlocked and quite wet ; most of Greece is almost too mountainous to build on ; it does n't get flatter than the Netherlands ; tiny Estonia faces frozen seas in the winter ; mammoth Italy has never even seen an icebreaker .
Even if there were a supranational authority in Europe that could tax or regulate the banking sector or plan transnational responses , the propriety of any singular policy would be questionable at best .
Such stark regional differences give rise to such variant policies that many European states have a severe ( and understandable ) trust deficit when it comes to any hint of anything supranational .
We are not simply taking about the European Union here , but rather a general distrust of anything cross - border in nature .
One of the many outcomes of this is a preference for using local banks rather than stock exchanges for raising capital .
After all , local banks tend to use local capital and are subject to local regulations , while stock exchanges tend to be internationalized in all respects .
Spain , Italy , Sweden , Greece and Austria get more than 90 percent of their financing from banks , the United Kingdom 84 percent and Germany 76 percent — while for the United States it is only 40 percent .
And this has proved unfortunate in the extreme for today 's Europe .
The current recession has its roots in a financial crisis that has most dramatically impacted banks , and European banks have proved far from immune .
Until Europe 's banks recover , Europe will remain mired in recession .
And since there cannot be a Pan- European solution , Europe 's recession could well prove to be the worst of all this time around .

Childhood Fears [ soothbrush ]
Thanks to Sarah , who laughs in the face of fear and then calls it a little bitch .
Bacteria can anticipate a future event and prepare for it , according to new research at the Weizmann Institute of Science .
In a paper that appeared today in Nature , Prof. Yitzhak Pilpel , doctoral student Amir Mitchell and research associate Dr. Orna Dahan of the Institute 's Molecular Genetics Department , together with Prof. Martin Kupiec and Gal Romano of Tel Aviv University , examined microorganisms living in environments that change in predictable ways .
Their findings show that these microorganisms ' genetic networks are hard - wired to ' foresee ' what comes next in the sequence of events and begin responding to the new state of affairs before its onset .
E. coli bacteria , for instance , which normally cruise harmlessly down the digestive tract , encounter a number of different environments on their way .
In particular , they find that one type of sugar - lactose - is invariably followed by a second sugar - maltose - soon afterward .
Pilpel and his team of the Molecular Genetics Department , checked the bacterium 's genetic response to lactose , and found that , in addition to the genes that enable it to digest lactose , the gene network for utilizing maltose was partially activated .
When they switched the order of the sugars , giving the bacteria maltose first , there was no corresponding activation of lactose genes , implying that bacteria have naturally ' learned ' to get ready for a serving of maltose after a lactose appetizer .
Another microorganism that experiences consistent changes is wine yeast .
As fermentation progresses , sugar and acidity levels change , alcohol levels rise , and the yeast 's environment heats up .
Although the system was somewhat more complicated that that of E. coli , the scientists found that when the wine yeast feel the heat , they begin activating genes for dealing with the stresses of the next stage .
Further analysis showed that this anticipation and early response is an evolutionary adaptation that increases the organism 's chances of survival .
Ivan Pavlov first demonstrated this type of adaptive anticipation , known as a conditioned response , in dogs in the 1890s .
He trained the dogs to salivate in response to a stimulus by repeatedly ringing a bell before giving them food .
In the microorganisms , says Pilpel , 'evolution over many generations replaces conditioned learning , but the end result is similar . '
' In both evolution and learning , ' says Mitchell , ' the organism adapts its responses to environmental cues , improving its ability to survive . '
Romano : ' This is not a generalized stress response , but one that is precisely geared to an anticipated event . '
To see whether the microorganisms were truly exhibiting a conditioned response , Pilpel and Mitchell devised a further test for the E. coli based on another of Pavlov 's experiments .
When Pavlov stopped giving the dogs food after ringing the bell , the conditioned response faded until they eventually ceased salivating at its sound .
The scientists did something similar , using bacteria grown by Dr. Erez Dekel , in the lab of Prof.
Uri Alon of the Molecular Cell Biology Department , in an environment containing the first sugar , lactose , but not following it up with maltose .
After several months , the bacteria had evolved to stop activating their maltose genes at the taste of lactose , only turning them on when maltose was actually available .
' This showed us that there is a cost to advanced preparation , but that the benefits to the organism outweigh the costs in the right circumstances , ' says Pilpel .
What are those circumstances ?
Based on the experimental evidence , the research team created a sort of cost / benefit model to predict the types of situations in which an organism could increase its chances of survival by evolving to anticipate future events .
They are already planning a number of new tests for their model , as well as different avenues of experimentation based on the insights they have gained .
Pilpel and his team believe that genetic conditioned response may be a widespread means of evolutionary adaptation that enhances survival in many organisms - one that may also take place in the cells of higher organisms , including humans .
These findings could have practical implications , as well .
Genetically engineered microorganisms for fermenting plant materials to produce biofuels , for example , might work more efficiently if they gained the genetic ability to prepare themselves for the next step in the process .

Exclusive deals that lock cool handsets to a single carrier will soon get scrutiny from federal regulators , the acting head of the FCC announced Thursday .
Theannouncement ( .pdf ) comes just a day after a Senate subcommittee heard competing arguments over whether deals like Sprint 's six - month lock on the Palm Pre and AT&T 's long - running U.S. monopoly on the iPhone stifle competition and hurt consumers .
Earlier this week , three Senate Democrats Amy Klobuchar ( Minn. ) , John Kerry ( Mass . ) , Byron Dorgan ( North Dakota ) , along with Roger Wicker ( R - Miss . ) sent a letter to Copps urging the agency to take a close look at the deals ' competitive impact .
Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairman Michael Copps said today ( .pdf ) that the FCC will open a formal proceeding to " determine whether some of these arrangements adversely restrict consumer choice or harm the development of innovative devices .... "
In a Senate hearing yesterday , Penn State professor Robert M. Frieden said 9 of the 10 top selling phones were under exclusive deals with one or more of the nation 's big four carriers , save for the most popular phone the Blackberry Curve .
Frieden said that arrangements for how Americans buy cellphones – the so - called " third screen " – was nothing like how people bought computers and televisions , where service and devices are purchased separately .
Jack Rooney , the CEO of the nation 's fifth largest carrier , US Cellular , said exclusives harmed smaller companies like his own and rural Americans .
" Wireless carriers have hijacked consumers ' access to handsets , " Rooney said .
" These arrangements deny consumers the right to buy the device of their choosing and use it on the network of thier choosing . "
Paul Roth , AT&T 's president of retail sales , defended the practice to lawmakers , saying that the deals drive innovation by guaranteeing device makers that enough will be purchased to make innovation worthwhile .
" Since the iPhone was launched , we have seen the greatest pace of innovoation that we have ever seen in this industry , " Roth said .
" In order to compete , other companies had to partner [...] because AT&T has an exclusive . "
" I think consumers are really benefiting .
We are the envy of the world now . "
But Frieden said that model of exclusive , subsidized phones encourages carriers to cripple their phones and lock them down .
" When you [...] limit the versatility of a device primarily to recover the subsidy , innovation suffers , " Frieden said .

In the last few days , India has dispatched roughly 60,000 troops to its border with China , the scene of enduring territorial disputes between the two countries .
J.J. Singh , the Indian governor of the controversial area , said the move was intended to " meet future security challenges " from China .
Meanwhile , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh claimed , despite cooperative India - China relations , his government would make no concessions to China on territorial disputes .
The tough posture Singh 's new government has taken may win some applause among India 's domestic nationalists .
But it is dangerous if it is based on a false anticipation that China will cave in .
India has long held contradictory views on China .
Another big Asian country , India is frustrated that China 's rise has captured much of the world 's attention .
Proud of its " advanced political system , " India feels superior to China .
However , it faces a disappointing domestic situation which is unstable compared with China's .
India likes to brag about its sustainable development , but worries that it is being left behind by China .
China is seen in India as both a potential threat and a competitor to surpass .
But India can't actually compete with China in a number of areas , like international influence , overall national power and economic scale .
India apparently has not yet realized this .
Indian politicians these days seem to think their country would be doing China a huge favor simply by not joining the " ring around China " established by the US and Japan .
India 's growing power would have a significant impact on the balance of this quation , which has led India to think that fear and gratitude for its restraint will cause China to defer to it on territorial disputes .
But this is wishful thinking , as China wo n't make any compromises in its border disputes with India .
And while China wishes to coexist peacefully with India , this desire is n't born out of fear .
India 's current course can only lead to a rivalry between the two countries .
India needs
to consider whether or not it can afford the consequences of a potential confrontation with China .
It should also be asking itself why it has n't forged the stable and friendly relationship with China that China enjoys with many of India 's neighbors , like Pakistan , Nepal and Sri Lanka .
Any aggressive moves will certainly not aid the development of good relations with China .
India should examine its attitude and preconceptions ; it will need to adjust if it hopes to cooperate with China and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome .

Hugging Chris Young : Fan Runs On Field To Show CY Some Love : Video
To put it bluntly , Chris Young of the Arizona Diamondbacks has had a horrendous season .
At a point in his career when everyone expected him to be steadily improving , he has instead regressed and has become the worst everyday player in baseball .
After the season he has been through so far , including an 0 - for - 3 performance with botched fly - ball tonight against the Giants , Chris Young clearly needs a hug .
And a hug is precisely what he got from a young female fan during the 9th inning .
With Randy
Winn at the plate , a woman ran down on the field , hugged Chris Young , then tried hiding behind him so security guards could n’t get her .
The amused Young held his arms up to let a security guard capture her , and the guard then ran her to the bullpen while holding her by the neck .
The announcers for the Giants on CSN remarked that she will definitely be cited for trespassing , but ignored her true crime : wearing a t - shirt supporting a guy who is hitting .177 and slugging .313 .

One final note : the election does reveal a paradox .
There is strong evidence that Iranians across the board want a better relationship with the United States .
But if Mr. Moussavi were to become president and carry out his campaign promise of seeking improved relations with America , we would probably see a good 30 percent of the Iranian population protesting that he is “ selling out ” to the enemy .
By contrast , support for Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s campaign was rooted in part in his supposed defense of the homeland and national honor in the face of United States aggression .
Americans too - long familiar with the boorish antics of the Iranian president will no doubt be surprised to learn that the best chance for improved relations with the United States perhaps lies with Mr. Ahmadinejad .
But Mr. Ahmadinejad is perceived here as being uniquely able to play the part of an Iranian Nixon by “ traveling to the United States ” and bringing along with him his supporters  and they are not few .
In other words , Iranians believe they face a daunting choice : a disastrous domestic political situation with Mr. Ahmadinejad but an improved foreign policy , or improved domestic leadership under Mr. Moussavi but near impossible challenges in making relations with the United States better .
The truth is , it was n’t supposed to happen this way .
The open - air parties that , for one week , turned Tehran at night into a large - scale civic disco , were an accident .
People gathered by the tens of thousands in public squares , circling around one another on foot , on motorcycle , in their cars .
They showed up around 4 or 5 in the afternoon and stayed together well into the next day , at least 3 or 4 in the morning , laughing , cheering , breaking off to debate , then returning to the fray .
A girl hung off the edge of a car window “ Dukes of Hazzard ” style .
Four boys parked their cars in a circle , the headlights illuminating an impromptu dance floor for them to show off their moves .
Everyone watched everyone else and we wondered how all of this could be happening .
Who were all of these people ?
Where did they come from ?
These were the same people we pass by unknowingly every day .
We saw one another , it feels , for the first time .
Now in the second week , we continue to look at one another as we walk together , in marches and in silent gatherings , toward our common goal of having our vote respected .
No one knew that it would come to this .
Iran is this way .
Anything is possible because very little in politics or social life has been made systematic .
We used to joke that if you leave Tehran for three months you ’ll come back to a new city .
A friend left for France for a few days last week and when he returned the entire capital had turned green .
It was n’t supposed to happen this way .
Until last week , Mr. Moussavi was a nondescript , if competent , politician  as one of his campaign advisers put it to me , he was meant only to be an instrument for making Iran a tiny bit better , nothing more .
Iranians knew that ’s what they were getting when they cast their votes for him .
Now , like us , Mr. Moussavi finds himself caught up in events that were unimaginable , each day ’s march and protest more unthinkable than the one that came before .
Military precision is to precision what Kenny G is to jazz .
So it is that the art of war – known in our command and staff colleges as operational art – has a language so vague that it ’s useless .
Take the term center of gravity .
Everyone concurs that it is a vital concept , but nobody agrees on what it means .
A Marine will tell you there can only be one center of gravity , but that ’s because Marines can only think about one thing at a time ( loving apologies to Staff Sgt. Joe Cleveland ) .
An Air Force pilot will tell you a center of gravity is anything he can bomb , so you need to buy him a lot of expensive bombers so he can bomb everything .
A naval aviator will tell you the center of gravity is always an aircraft carrier , even in land warfare .
If you ask an intelligence officer what a center of gravity is he ’ll tell you it ’s classified so do n’t quote him by name , and if you ask an Army general what a center of gravity is he ’ll start breathing through his mouth .
No wonder the dummies running our woebegone wars can’t find their way out of Iraq or Afghanistan with a map and a flashlight .
Some desk commandos in the Pentagon think the center of gravity in Afghanistan is the Taliban .
Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Mike Mullen says the Afghan people are “ the real centers of gravity . "
Sen .
John Kerry says the strategic center of gravity in Afghanistan is Pakistan , an observation that explains much about his track record at crafting winning strategies .
The 19th - century Prussian general and philosopher Carl von Clausewitz defined " center of gravity " ( Schwerpunkt ) as “ the point against which all our energies should be directed . "
Clausewitz also established that “ war is nothing but the continuation of policy with other means ” and that " the political object " must determine " the military objective to be reached . "
It does n’t take a cosmology major to figure out that an enemy ’s center of gravity is the main obstacle between our objective and us , and that our center of gravity is the asset that will achieve our objective .
Perhaps it ’s understandable that our military and political leaders are so confused about the centers of gravity in the Bananastans .
Clausewitz tells us that “ strategy is the use of the engagement for the purpose of the war " and that " the aim will determine the series of actions intended to achieve it . "
National Security Adviser James Jones and his White House war wonks unveiled our new Bananastan strategy in March , and its " realistic and achievable objectives " are unadulterated delirium .
We ca n’t create " an effective government in Afghanistan " or a " stable constitutional government in Pakistan . "
" Disrupting terrorist networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan " wo n’t " degrade any ability they have to plan and launch international terrorist attacks . "
The only thing today ’s terrorists need to plan and launch international attacks is an iPhone ; they do n’t need to hunker down in a mountaintop cave on the far side of the Khyber Pass to use one of those things .
They have freedom of action to operate from front row center at Bob Redford ’s film festival in the Rockies if they choose to .
" Involving the international community to actively assist in addressing these objectives " wo n’t be of any help .
The Bananastan strategy objectives are so fantastic that the intergalactic community from the Star Trek universe could n’t help us achieve them .
Not even the Vulcans could derive logical centers of gravity from the war aims the Jones gang has dreamed up .
Spock himself would blanch at the thought of crafting measures of effectiveness to determine whether or not we ’re making progress toward achieving such cockamamie goals ; but Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal , our new top Bananastan general , has taken a shot at it .
" The measure of effectiveness will not be enemy killed , " he told the Senate Armed Services Committee at his June 2 confirmation hearing .
" It will be the number of Afghans shielded from violence . "
Not a single member of that committee had sufficient intellect or spine to ask McChrystal how many shielded Afghans , in his opinion , might constitute victory .
Centers of gravity can change over time , space , and levels of war .
That sounds more complex than a double - decker 3 - D chess tournament at first , but it ’s reasonably simple .
Folks who can spell their names correctly will catch on to the time and space model quickly enough .
Next week ’s umpteenth reoccupation of al - Kaboom , for example , will have different centers of gravity than today ’s air raid on the terrorist camp that ’s camouflaged as a Muslim wedding chapel .
The basic levels of war are the tactical , operational , and strategic .
The tactical level is where combat takes place , and the strategic level is where military actions achieve ( or fail to achieve ) a war ’s political aims .
Tactical actions are planned and coordinated to achieve strategic goals at the operational level .
Tactical and operational centers of gravity consist of some type of armed force .
To the U - boat skipper bent on sinking a supply convoy , the enemy center of gravity is the convoy ’s destroyer escort .
An operational center of gravity may be the armored division that blocks us from capturing a major oil field , or an air defense system that thwarts our efforts to bomb key infrastructure .
Strategic centers of gravity are always political leadership .
Common military wisdom deems that popular support or national resources or the media can be strategic centers of gravity , but common military wisdom is all too common and none too wise .
Population , resources , and so on may be critical factors – strengths , weaknesses , or critical vulnerabilities – but they are only important as they affect political leadership .
The obsession of Mullen and McChrystal with the Afghan population is cause for grave concern .
A population may influence leadership with its vote or by storming the palace , but it is your enemy ’s leadership , not its angry mob , that can produce the political behavior you want .
The effect of popular opinion is minimal in oppressive nations , but its influence is overrated even in so - called liberal democracies .
In the last two federal elections , Americans overwhelmingly voted for the antiwar agenda .
For all the good it did us , we all might as well have cast our ballots in Florida .
The overarching strategic importance of political leadership makes you want to think very , very hard before you charge off with a goal of regime - change , as our Mesopotamia mistake so vividly illustrates .
And the puppets we propped up in the Bananastans have n’t done so well either , have they ?
That crazy so - and - so McChrystal told the BBC on Friday that the Bananastan bog - down “ will go on until we achieve the kind of progress we want to achieve .
It wo n’t be short . ”
Of course it wo n’t be short .
No American conflict is short in the long war era , even though the oldest warfare sage available to us , Sun Tzu , famously warned that " no nation ever profited from a long war . "
And as the living sage Pete Seeger famously asks , when will we ever learn ?
The Army has ordered its network managers to give soldiers access to social media sites like Facebook , Flickr , and Twitter , Danger Room has learned .
That move reverses a years - long trend of blocking the web 2.0 locales on military networks .
Army public affairs managers have worked hard to share the service 's stories through social sites like Flickr , Delicious and Vimeo .
Links to those sites featured prominently on the Army.mil homepage .
The Army carefully nurtured a Facebook group tens of thousands strong , and posted more than 4,100 photos to a Flickr account .
Yet the people presumably most interested in these sites – the troops – were prevented from seeing the material .
Many Army bases banned access to the social networks .
An operations order from the Army 's 93rd Signal Brigade to all domestic Directors of Information Management , or DOIMs , aims to correct that .
Issued on May 18th " for official use only , " the document has not been made public until now .
It is " the intent of senior Army leaders to leverage social media as a medium to allow soldiers to ' tell the Army story ' and to facilitate the dissemination of strategic , unclassified information , " says the order , obtained by Danger Room .
Therefore , " the social media sites available from the Army homepage will be made accessible from all campus area networks .
Additionally , all web - based email will be made accessible . "
The operations order ( OPORD ) does n't apply to all GI Bases overseas , or those run by the other armed services , which are n't affected by the decree .
Nor does the order overturn the long - standing , military - wide ban on sites like MySpace , YouTube and Pandora .
And it 's almost certain some Army posts that still block the now - approved web 2.0 networks .
Still , it 's a click in the right direction for the armed service which seems to be making a slow but steady recovery from its lingering hostility towards social media .
The full OPORD , after the jump .

DETROIT / WASHINGTON , June 1 ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp GM.N filed for bankruptcy on Monday , as the Obama administration took the first steps in court to try to revive a failed icon of American industry by extended unprecedented funding and oversight .
The bankruptcy filing was the third - largest in U.S. history and the largest ever in U.S. manufacturing .
[ ID :nN31435926 ]
The decision to push GM into a fast - track bankruptcy and provide $ 30 billion of additional taxpayer funds to restructure the automaker is a huge gamble for the Obama administration .
But in a sign of progress in the government 's high - stakes effort , a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of substantially all of U.S. automaker Chrysler 's assets to a group led by Italy 's Fiat SpA FIA .
MI .
In the wake of its widely anticipated bankruptcy filing , GM stock -- once considered a rock - solid blue chip -- was being removed from the Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI and delisted by the New York Stock Exchange .
" This is proof that GM has failed , " said automotive historian Bob Elton .
" They have been failing for years but have covered it up .
Now they 've come to the end of the line . "
Chrysler 's bankruptcy , also financed by the U.S. Treasury , has been widely seen as a test run for the much bigger and more complex reorganization of GM .
President Barack Obama said on Monday he was confident GM could emerge quickly from bankruptcy , saying the government had been thrust into a reluctant position as controlling shareholder .
" Our goal is to get GM back on its feet , take a hands off approach and get out quickly , " Obama said .
[ ID : nN01474860 ]
The administration 's ambitious plan for GM is for a quick sale process that would allow a much smaller company to emerge from court protection in as little as 60 to 90 days .
In bankruptcy , GM will be divided in two : a leaner " New GM " and " Old GM " -- which will include excess plants and equipment that will eventually be liquidated under court protection .
GM said in a legal filing on Monday that the transaction to create the reorganized company would have to be quick to keep the automaker from losing its best chance to restructure .
" The vicious cycle of frozen credit markets , growing supplier uncertainty and lack of consumer confidence has the potential to unravel the automotive industry and short - circuit the creation of New GM , " Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said in a court filing .
On the first day in bankruptcy court , lawyers for GM said they would ask Judge Robert Gerber to approve its proposed sale of its strongest assets in just 30 days .
[ ID : nN01464220 ]
GOVERNMENT LIFELINE
Since the start of the year , GM has been kept alive by U.S. government funding as a White House - appointed task force vetted plans for a sweeping reorganization that will be undertaken with $ 50 billion in federal financing .
By taking a 60 percent stake in a reorganized GM , the Obama administration is gambling that the automaker can compete with the likes of Toyota after its debt is cut by half and its labor costs are slashed .
The federal government of Canada as well as the province of Ontario agreed to provide another $ 9.5 billion to GM in a late addition to the plans for the bankruptcy .
[ ID : nN31418487 ]
GM plans to close 11 U.S. facilities and idle another three plants .
It has not provided an updated target for job cuts but had been looking to cut 21,000 factory jobs from the 54,000 unionized workers it now employs in the United States .
The GM plant closings will cut between 18,000 and 20,000 UAW workers in the United States .
[ ID :nN01474335 ]
" The GM that many of you knew , the GM that let too many of you down , is history , " said Henderson at a news conference in New York .
" Today marks the beginning of what will be a new company , a new GM dedicated to building the very best cars and trucks , highly fuel - efficient , world - class quality , green technology development . "
The UAW would have a 17.5 percent stake in the New GM .
The Canadian government would own 12 percent and GM bondholders would receive 10 percent .
In its filing , GM also provided an updated list of its major trade creditors including Starcom Mediavest Group and Delphi Corp . [ ID : nN01454108 ]
Kent Kresa , who became GM chairman at the end of March , said he was already interviewing candidates to be directors for the new board at GM and was in contact with Steve Rattner , who heads the White House 's autos task force , as part of that process .
[ ID :nN01485098 ]
RELUCTANT INVESTOR
Officials involved in the planning for GM said the White House was a " reluctant investor " in GM , but had to prevent a liquidation that analysts say would have cost tens of thousands of jobs at a time when the economy is mired in recession .
GM alone employs 92,000 in the United States and is indirectly responsible for 500,000 retirees .
U.S. officials said there was no plan to provide any further funding for GM and insisted that all of the Detroit Three could survive .
Ford Motor Co F.N has not sought emergency federal aid .
In the case of GM , the goal of restructuring is to allow it to return to profitability if U.S. industrywide auto sales recover even slightly to near 10 million units annually .
Until now , to stop losing money , GM had counted on a recovery to the 16 million mark the industry last saw in 2007 , officials said .
GM 's bankruptcy , which was approved by the automaker 's board after a weekend of deliberations , is the most carefully orchestrated Chapter 11 filing in the history of American business .
The automaker 's final descent started with an emergency aid announcement by the administration of President George W. Bush on Dec. 19 .
It accelerated in late March when the new Obama government gave the company 60 days to restructure .
While New GM is expected to emerge quickly from court protection , its shuttered plants , stranded equipment and other spurned assets would be left to liquidation in bankruptcy .
Al Koch , a managing director at advisory firm AlixPartners LLP , will be appointed chief restructuring officer in charge of liquidating those GM assets .
[ ID :nN31395352 ]
A veteran restructuring adviser , Koch has had prominent roles in Kmart Corp 's restructuring and other turnarounds .
Over the weekend , GM won support for the government 's plan from investors representing 54 percent of the company 's $ 27 billion in bondholder debt .
[ ID :nN31329833 ]
Bondholders could take up to 25 percent of GM if it recovers to be worth what it was in 2004 .
Founded in 1908 , GM rose to dominate the U.S. and global auto industries under the stewardship of pioneering Chief Executive Alfred Sloan , who famously pledged that the automaker would deliver " a car for every purse and purpose . "
By the mid-1950s , at the peak of its success , GM had some 514,000 employees .
It accounted for about half of U.S. car production and its sales were twice as large as the No. 2 corporation , Standard Oil .
Technology bellwether Cisco Systems CSCO.O will replace GM on the Dow .
Insurer Travelers Co TRV.N will replace Citigroup Inc C.N .
Dow Jones said the changes will be effective as of June 8 .
GM 's stock fell to a low of 48 cents on Monday , a level last seen during the Great Depression .

A DSL or Domain Specific Language , is a way to represent some domain - specific concept .
For example , I ’m looking for a DSL that can be used to describe date equations such as “ the 2nd business day after the last business day of the month ” .
This information will find itself in various configuration files and database tables .
Unfortunately , all the recommendations I ’ve been getting are for so - called “ Internal DSLs ” .
The problem with that is they are not “ domain - specific ” , they are “ language - specific ” .
You ca n’t use a Ruby ’s Chronic from .NET or T - SQL without building a full Ruby parser .
Nor can you use Java ’s JODA Time or Perl ’s Date : : Manip .
There are all API ’s , not languages .
That is n’t to say there is n’t a DSL hidden in each of these .
They all have some sort of meta - language describing how to format strings that you pass to their Parse methods .
Unfortunately they are mostly undocumented .
Chronic says it “ Parses a string containing a natural language date or time ” , but you are left to guessing what exactly that means from the examples .
Therefore I am moved to propose this definition for a DSL :
A Domain Specific Language is documentation on to how to parse a set of text or symbols in a consistent and repeatable fashion .
Let us turn back to JODA Time .
Can you determine how to parse “ Days d = Days.daysBetween(startDate , endDate ) ; ” from the JODA docs ?
Of course not , you also have to look up the language spec for Java .
Java is the real language here , not JODA Time .
Turning to Date :: Manip , we see that it has a parse complex date patterns such as “ 2nd day of every month [ in 1997 ] " .
0:0:0:1*2,4,6:0:0 every day at at 2:00 , 4:00 , and 6:00
0:0:0:2*12-13:0,30:0 every other day at 12:00 , 12:30 , 13:00 , and 13:30
0:1:0* - 1:0:0:0 the last day of every month * 1990 - 1995 :
12:0:1:0:0:0 Dec 1 in 1990 through 1995
It then goes on to explain exactly how to parse it ( I will refer you to the documentation for details , start with the ParseRecur section for the actual DSL descriptions ) .
I do n’t know anything about Perl , but I do n’t think I ’ll have any problem porting this to .NET or T - SQL .
It is a little unfriendly , more like an AST than an end - user language .
But then again , so are Regular Expressions and they are clearly useful .
New Options Wellness Clinic , a Boulder marijuana dispensary , had a real buzzkill last week when a group of robbers held up the operation and made off with two large tubs of marijuana .
Things are looking up this week , however .
Not only have the police identified four suspects in connection with the robbery ( David Henderson , 40 , of Denver ; Justin St. John , 29 , of Denver ; Walter Carter , 21 , of Aurora ; and Lamar McGee , 22 , of Lakewood ) , but the cops have also apparently obtained the stolen weed -- and at 4 p.m. today , they 're supposed to be giving it back to the dispensary .
" The medical marijuana from the robbery last week at the dispensary is going to be returned to my client at four o'clock this afternoon in Boulder , " reports Warren Edson , a Denver - based medical marijuana legal consultant who represents several Colorado dispensaries .
That 's good news not just for the New Options and their hard - up clients , but also for marijuana activists statewide .
It 's a big day when the cops will hand over that much marijuana -- and so quickly -- especially considering the feds still consider the stuff completely illegal .
With developments like this -- and the fact that a prominent " walk - in dispensary " opened in University Hill yesterday -- Boulder may be positioning itself as the Humboldt County of Colorado .
Then again , as we reported in our February 4 story , " Medical Marijuana Has Become a Growth Industry in Colorado , " similar developments are happening all over the place .
And at least in the People 's Republic of Boulder , the cops seem to be saying that 's A - okay .
Ever wondered how toxic psychoactive drugs that have been shown to be clinically insignificant have been catapulted into multi-billion dollar blockbuster sellers despite the fact that these drugs pose serious safety risks ?
Today ’s USA Today report by Marilyn Elias focuses on Dr. Lisa Cosgrove ’s illuminating study documenting gross and unabashed conflicts of interest by psychiatrists who formulate psychiatry ’s diagnostic and treatment guidelines .
Dr. Cosgrove ’s findings flat out contradict the widely reported pledge by the American Psychiatric Association that it has instituted screening procedures for the 27 members of its DSM - V Task Force , to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest .
The APA called the effort the " most transparent " in the medical industry .
In fact , as Dr. Cosgrove documents , the current roster of psychiatrists on the DSM - V Task Force is overwhelmingly compromised by financial ties to drug makers whose drugs are recommended in psychiatry ’s treatment guidelines .
Dr. Cosgrove documented 68 % of task - force members having economic ties with drug companies — and of those , four out of five are on corporate boards , hold stock or collect money as advisers .
As for psychiatry ’s most influential leaders who formulate treatment guidelines for major depression , bipolar disorder and schizophrenia : 90 % of them had financial ties to firms that make the drugs they recommend for the disorder .
The stakes are high indeed : sales for drugs prescribed for major depression , bipolar and schizophrenia– according to IMS HEALTH , reached $ 24.2 billion – $ 14.6 billion for antipsychotics and $ 9.6 billion for antidepressants .
These mega sales , despite the clinically insignificant effects these drugs produce and the documented , life - shortening adverse effects they induce .
Dr. Cosgrove ’s study has nailed psychiatry as handmaidens of drug manufacturers .
The question that has now been hurled into the public arena is :
Does it matter if most of the experts who are creating definitions of mental disorders , and standards for the best way to treat them , receive substantial amounts of money from pharmaceutical companies ?
As Marilyn Elias says , “ That question cuts to the core of public welfare by making it possible for financial profit to affect decisions about who needs treatment , whether they are prescribed medicine and which ones . ”
Psychiatry ’s leadership is scrambling and fumbling in its effort to explain why it ’s collusion with industry for pay is okay .

Conflicts of interest bedevil psychiatric drug research
By Marilyn Elias
Does it matter if most of the experts who are creating definitions of mental disorders , and standards for the best way to treat them , receive money from pharmaceutical companies ?
That question is hotly debated in scientific journals , but it is n’t just academic .
It also cuts to the core of public welfare by making it possible for financial profit to affect decisions about who needs treatment , whether they are prescribed medicine and which ones , says Lisa Cosgrove , a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts - Boston .
Critics such as Cosgrove say there ’s a damaging conflict of interest in the financial ties between drug companies and leaders who are revising the " bible " of psychiatric diagnoses , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - V ) , as well as guidelines on the best treatments .
About 160 experts appointed by the American Psychiatric Association are doing the heavy lifting on the updated manual , expected in 2012 .
They ’re tops in their field , and because industry pays for two - thirds of research , many of them consult for drug companies or do corporate - funded studies , says Darrel Regier , research director for the group .
" There ’s this assumption that a tie with a company is evidence for bias .
But these people can be objective , " he says .
This is the first time the psychiatry association has required members of 13 working groups on diagnoses , as well as the leadership task force , to publicly disclose all industry ties .
Sixty - eight percent of task - force members report economic ties with drug companies , Cosgrove says .
And of those with links , about four out of five do n’t just get research funding , they ’re on corporate boards , hold stock or collect money as advisers , she says .
She and Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Harold Bursztajn have criticized these ties in The New England Journal of Medicine and Psychiatric Times .
Even small changes in the symptoms for diagnosis of a problem can greatly increase prescriptions for drugs , Cosgrove says , so anyone who could benefit from changes has a potential conflict .
More than half of the members on the 13 working groups also have such ties , according to Cosgrove ’s analysis .
She says no group should have a majority with drug company links .
But Regier argues : " We want the best people .
We do n’t want quotas or an artificial litmus test . "
He says potential conflicts are limited by a rule that panel members can’t receive more than $ 10,000 from drug companies while at work on the new DSM .
The $ 10,000 limit " is not a particularly sensible idea , " says Daniel Carlat , a Tufts psychiatrist who publishes an independent monthly , The Carlat Psychiatry Report , on trends in the field .
" They ’ve had lucrative relationships in the past , and they know they ’re going right back to them . "
Carlat says it ’s unrealistic to exclude people with industry - research funding , but he favors limits on those who give promotional talks on drugs , " the real hired guns , " and others with a direct financial interest in firms .
" Maybe no more than 30 % , maybe no more than 50 % .
These panels should n’t be stacked the way they are now , " he says .
Another flash point : clinical guidelines .
Cosgrove led a study on 20 authors of treatment standards for major depression , bipolar disorder and schizophrenia : 90 % of them had financial ties to firms that make drugs recommended for the disorder .
But the psychiatry group casts a net to hundreds of reviewers for every guideline , says John McIntyre , who chairs the guidelines committee .
The depression and bipolar standards are being updated , " and we ’ve gotten thousands of comments online , " Regier says .
So any bias gets diluted by diverse voices , McIntyre says ; plus , the guidelines are based on evidence .
But there ’s the rub , critics say , because drug company - funded studies consistently come out with more positive results for their drug than do independent studies .
" In psychiatry , many diseases are treated equally well with medication or therapy , " Carlat says .
" But the guidelines tend to be biased toward medication " because it ’s costly to make and study drugs .
Much is at stake .
Antipsychotics , which had $ 14.6 billion in sales last year , were the top - selling class of U.S. medicines ; antidepressants brought in $ 9.6 billion , says IMS HEALTH .
The debate over whether economic self - interest may bias the DSM and treatment guidelines leads to a root issue :
Drug companies pay for gathering evidence , and there ’s no major alternative on the horizon , says Paul Appelbaum , an expert on ethics in psychiatry at Columbia University .
He ’s concerned about potential conflicts .
But other financing suggestions — for example , companies contributing money for studies run independently by the government — have gone nowhere , he says .
" We ’re a capitalist society built on competition , and that has led to many successes , " Appelbaum says .
" But this conflict - of - interest issue shows the side effects of the system we have . "

Depression diagnoses fell after FDA antidepressant warning
By Carla K. Johnson , Associated Press CHICAGO —
A persistent decline in the rate of Americans , especially children , newly diagnosed with depression followed the first federal warning on risks connected with antidepressant drugs , a study suggests .
In 2003 , the Food and Drug Administration first warned about the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in young people taking the drugs .
That action may have helped reverse a five - year trend of rising rates of diagnosis for depression , the researchers found .
The findings , published Monday in the Archives of General Psychiatry , are based on an analysis of eight years of data from nearly 100 managed care plans and more than 55 million patients .
It was already known that antidepressant use among young people had fallen since the drugs began carrying a so - called " black box " warning about risks .
But the data showing an extended decline in the level of depression diagnoses are new .
In some cases , untreated depression can be more dangerous than suicidal feelings when starting antidepressants and a spike in teenage suicides in 2004 worried some experts that could be another unintended result of the FDA warnings .
Then , teen suicides fell slightly the following year , offering hope that the suicide increase was just a blip .
The new research ca n’t explain why diagnosis rates have declined , said lead author Anne Libby of the University of Colorado Denver .
Diagnosis rates for anxiety and bipolar disorder , also sometimes treated with antidepressants , also fell .
" It could be that people who have depression are n’t coming forth and getting diagnosed , " Libby said .
" It could be that providers are increasingly reluctant to diagnose cases of new mental health problems . "
Libby said the FDA " should reopen its discussion about the boxed warning on antidepressants . "
Only two antidepressants , Lexapro and Prozac , are approved for treating children and adolescents with depression , but doctors can legally prescribe others to young patients " off label . "
Prozac , Luvox and Zoloft are approved for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder , said FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh .
Pinning the slumping diagnosis rates on the FDA warning is a leap , said Dr. Peter Lurie of Public Citizen ’s Health Research Group , which has warned of antidepressant risks in kids .
There could be other explanations .
" It ’s possible that the drive toward more diagnosis and treatment had been nearing a point of exhaustion , " Lurie said .
" The data are interesting but the conclusion seems forced . "
Lurie also questioned the authors ’ suggestion that the FDA overreacted .
" Is the implication that patients would be better off kept in the dark ( about risks ) ? " he asked .
Dr. Gregory Simon , a psychiatrist and researcher at Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle , said the findings are " pretty convincing " evidence that the FDA ’s warning had unintended consequences .
" The warning appears to have scared people away from treatment ; whether that ’s doctors or patients is unclear , " Simon said .
Better follow - up care for patients on antidepressants is sorely needed , he said .
Health plans consistently do poorly on quality measures of such follow - up visits , important for avoiding problems when people start taking antidepressants .
The study examined health claims data from July 1999 through June 2007 .
For children , the rate of new depression diagnoses rose from 3.3 per 1,000 patients in 1999 to 5.2 in 2004 .
But by 2007 , the rate had fallen to 3.5 per 1,000 patients .
A lesser downward shift was seen for adults , which the authors said could be a spillover effect of the FDA warnings .
The researchers obtained a license to use the health claims database through funding from Eli Lilly and Co. , maker of Prozac , for an earlier study .
Lilly paid for that license so the researchers could analyze use of another Lilly drug for European regulators .
Libby and her co-authors disclosed receiving past unrestricted research grants from other makers of antidepressants .
But Libby said drug makers were n’t involved in the design , analysis or conclusions of the current research .

Teen who auctioned off her virginity for £ 8,800 reveals details of her first time
Student Alina Percea auctioned off her virginity to the highest bidder on a German website
A teenager who sold her virginity online for £ 8,800 has revealed the details of her tryst with the winning bidder .
Alina Percea , 18 , auctioned her virginity on a website so that she could afford to pay for her computing degree .
The winner of the auction was a 45 - year - old Italian businessman but she had no qualms about going through with the deal .
The businessman from Bologna paid for her to fly to Venice where the couple toured the sights before spending a night in a luxury hotel .
Alina , who underwent two medical examinations to prove her virginity , said : ' I liked the man and got on with him well .
He did n't look 45 , and he seemed much younger .
' We spoke in English as I can't speak Italian and he can't speak Romanian .
He paid me a lot of compliments throughout the day , and he was very funny and charming .
We got on very well , and I was pleased he'd won .
He told me he had a good job , but he did n't say if he was married or had a family , and I did n't ask him . '
Alina left her home town of Caracal , Romania , in January with two cousins , to find work in Mannheim , Germany , but lost her job in a restaurant because her German was too poor .
She was inspired to auction herself on a German erotic website after reading how American woman Natalie Dylan , 22 , from San Diego , had put her virginity up for sale for £ 2.5 million .
The Romanian had hoped to raise as much as £ 50,000 through the controversial sale but still plans to go to university .
' The bidding lasted two weeks , ' she told Closer magazine .
' It started off at 90 p but within a couple of days it was almost at £ 4,400 . '
' The winner was a new bidder , who appeared right at the end of the auction .
' He said he would fly me to Venice to meet him . '
The auction ended at £ 8,800 ( 10,000 euros ) .
Alina Percea was inspired to auction herself on a German erotic website after reading how American woman Natalie Dylan ( pictured ) had put her virginity up for sale for £ 2.5 million
' When the auction ended , I emailed the winner , a 45 - year - old Italian business man , to congratulate him . '
' I hoped I 'd meet a nice man , like in the film Pretty Woman , ' Alina says .
Alina Percea had unprotected sex with her businessman lover
' At the arrivals lounge , a man came over , smiled , handed me a box of chocolates and said : " Welcome to Venice . "
He looked much younger than 45 , short , but nicely dressed , with dark hair , green eyes and a kind smile . '
The two went sightseeing , then to a five - star hotel where they had unprotected sex .
' We kissed , then undressed each other , ' Alina says .
' I 'd never done that before , so I was nervous .
He laid me on the bed and started kissing my body , then we had sex .
I was attracted to him , so I enjoyed it , even though it was quite painful .
' We only had sex once , then fell asleep .
Next morning , we had breakfast together like any other couple , and I took the morning - after pill .
He told me he'd like to see me again , and I agreed . '
But the money raised from the auction was far less than the amount Alina had hoped to make .
' Ten thousand euros is not so much money , even in Romania , ' admitted Alina .
' But it will be enough .
' I hoped I 'd be able to have an apartment in town .
But now I will live with my parents while I go to university .
The auction was hit by controversy three weeks before its culmination when a teacher at Alina 's former school claimed she was not a virgin .
But Alina , who had already undergone a medical examination , was seen by a second doctor , who confirmed at a press conference she 'd never had sex .
' I hoped I 'd meet a nice man , like in the film Pretty Woman , ' Alina said .
The final bid of £ 8,800 was short of the £ 50,000 she needs to pay for her education , but Alina said the experience was not unpleasant
Alina promised in her auction pitch that she would bring documentation proving she was a virgin , and said she would agree to forgo the use of condoms on the condition the winning bidder provided her with certificates proving he was free from STIs .
The teenager , from Caracal in Olt country , posted an advert on German dating website www.gesext.de, saying : ' I am a 108 lbs , 5ft 6in tall , brown - eyed Romanian girl .
' I do n't smoke and own a certificate from a gynaecologist which says I 'm a virgin .
I want my first time to be special and not very abrupt .
' I want to meet a gentle , respectful and generous man . '
It was n't just sex that Alina was after either .
Although her first concern was to raise money for her education , Alina was open to finding more from the transaction , saying that if she should meet her ' happiness and future , then that would be great too ' .
And could it be that Alina has found love after all ?
' I hope to see the man again , ' she says .
' And next time I wo n't make him pay ! '
Lightning photography is both one of the most tricky and one of the most frustrating types of photography .
You get only one chance for the particular situation – it is not like portrait photography where you can go back in the studio if the photos did n’t come out well .
Photographing lightning at night is relatively easy provided you have access to remote areas away from town / city lights .
The results can be exciting but they are also partly based upon luck .
Here are 25 Electrifying Pictures of Lightning Photography .

Of the negotiations between his company and the government in December , he was expected to say that “ people of good intentions , in both the private sector and the government , worked desperately hard in late 2008 to prevent a collapse of the global financial system . ”
Portions of e-mail messages sent among
Fed staff members paint a picture of the strong pressure regulators put on Mr. Lewis ’s company to complete the deal , even after Merrill ’s financial state weakened .
The Fed hired Pimco , the giant bond house , to evaluate the state of the two companies separately , and Pimco concluded that Merrill ’s “ deterioration has been substantially worse than ” Bank of America’s .
Pimco also found that Merrill would not be able to survive on its own without new capital or additional government aid .

The documents obtained by The Times include memorandums prepared by staff members on the House committee , as well as Mr. Lewis ’s planned testimony .
Republican lawmakers on the committee are pressing for another hearing so they can question the two officials who have already been associated publicly with the heated discussions late last year , Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , and Henry M. Paulson , the former secretary of the Treasury .
The documents also included notes taken by Bank of America ’s chief financial officer , suggesting that Lawrence H. Summers , now the president ’s lead economics adviser , and Timothy F. Geithner , the secretary of the Treasury , agreed that Merrill should not be allowed to fail .
A spokesman for Mr. Geithner , who was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said it was not true that he had agreed .
Spokesmen for Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner said neither was involved in discussion about Bank of America at that time .
A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on the documents , which he said he had not seen .
But , Larry Di Rita , the spokesman , said that the deal was working , adding “ we ’re looking forward . ”
The Federal Reserve declined to comment .

It 's the Tor Store !
The ubiquitous science - fiction - and - fantasy imprint " Tor " has launched an online bookstore that will be open to all publishers , in an attempt to circle the wagons against the encroaching , omnivorous incursion of soulless , international technology corporations like Google and Amazon into American publishing .
The Tor Store will sell paperbacks , comics , hardbacks , and ebooks to the last people left who take literature seriously : anti-authoritarian science fiction and fantasy obsessives .
Right now , the store is offering 45,000 or so titles , with many more to come as publishers take advantage of Tor 's clearinghouse for all things fantastic and imaginative .
According to Publisher 's Weekly , the Tor Store will also begin offering ebooks in the next three months .
I wonder if they have a good plan for protecting their shit , since they wo n't be offering a proprietary device for all these ebooks they will be selling .
Hopefully , they are waiting three months for the next generation of tablet PCs to rear their heads , and will be offering persistent online editions of books ( Google 's plan ) instead of books available for " download .
" Hopefully , they will be offering these books at a reasonable , competitive price that will entice poor people .
If I had one of those tablets , I 'd definitely get a Tor account to read disposable fantasy ebooks if they were cheap enough .
With pictures !
The Tor Store is pretty ugly right now , and it definitely seems like it would be well - served to merge further with the actual Tor.com website to provide book reviews and blog content so that the Tor Store does n't seem like just another typical publisher book drive .
And if the store is successful , losing the " Tor " name would be useful if they actually want to attract serious business from competing publishers .
But then again , if they are trying to become the place where " serious " publishers can dump their moneymaking bullshit , why not keep the name and simply transition from an ink - and - paper publisher to the world 's most impressive , dedicated epublisher ?
You will notice on " Pirate Bay " that the only fiction books that anybody bothers to pirate are giant science - fiction and fantasy collections .
The Tor Store will live and die based upon its ability to protect the work of its authors .
However , I tentatively commend this new bookstore .
Tor figures that it knows the market better than anyone because they created it , and it is hard to argue with them .
Tor is going to be goddamned if they let their products be controlled and co-opted by companies that operate exactly like the mad , power - hungry villains in every single one of their books .
If I want to buy a fantastical work of literature online , I shall now hit Tor first and see if they 've got it before I hump over to Powell 's .
You can fool evvvvvvvvverybody else , Googleklar and Red Amazon .
But fooling those die - hard , dice - wielding sharpies who have the enchanted weapons , skill - checks , and experience points necessary to do battle with you in your cave ?
You simply do n't have the charisma high enough to match their wisdom .
In less than 2 years time , former Apple executive Jon Rubenstein went from sipping margaritas on a beach in Mexico to helping Palm deliver what some consider to be a worthy competitor to the iPhone in the form of the Palm Pre .
And now , Rubenstein is poised to assume the CEO position at Palm in just a few days , replacing current CEO Ed Colligan .
Palm issued a press release earlier today stating :
SUNNYVALE , Calif. , Jun 10 , 2009 ( BUSINESS WIRE ) — Palm , Inc. ( Nasdaq : PALM ) today announced that its board of directors has appointed Jon Rubinstein to lead the company as Chairman and CEO upon the departure of Ed Colligan , who is stepping down after sixteen years of leadership at the company .
Rubinstein , who joined Palm as Executive Chairman in October 2007 to help bring innovation back to the company , assumes his role as CEO on June 12 .
Colligan plans to take some time off , then join Elevation Partners .
“ I am very excited about taking on this expanded role at Palm , ” said Rubinstein .
“ Ed and I have worked very hard together the past two years , and I ’m grateful to him for everything he ’s done to help set the company up for success .
With Palm webOS we have ten - plus years of innovation ahead of us , and the Palm Pre is already one of the year ’s hottest new products .
Due in no small part to Ed ’s courageous leadership , we ’re in great shape to get Palm back to continuous growth , and we plan to keep the trajectory going upward . ”
“ I ’m very proud of what Palm has accomplished so far , ” said Colligan .
“ We pioneered two major product categories and I believe we are on our way to defining the standard for the mobile web .
I ’m extremely proud of our team , and grateful to have played a role in turning Palm around .
I know that Jon , the Board and the Palm executive team will do an incredible job driving Palm to new heights . ”
Rubenstein , of course , spent the better part of the last 20 years working closely with Steve Jobs ( first at Next and then at Apple ) , and was an instrumental part of the team that helped develop the original iMac and the first edition iPod .
After retiring from his position as the Senior VP of Apple ’s iPod division in 2006 , he was wooed back to the tech world by Palm in the hopes that he could help save the once proud handheld maker .
If you ’re a fan of Palm , Rubenstein has far exceeded expectations , and he ’s exactly the man you ’d want for the job .

To the delight of legal activists and bloggers who campaigned for her to have a fair trial , the court ruled that Miss Deng should be released after taking into account the fact that she suffered " mood disorders " and had turned herself over to police and co-operated with the investigation , according to a brief report on the official People 's Daily news website .
As the economy continues to shrink , Google continues to crank the dial on its top - secret money machine .
According to the latest stats from AdGooroo - a search marketing consultant that tracks search ads from a network of servers across the globe - Google expanded its ad coverage ( yet again ) during the first three months of the year , despite a decrease in the overall number of advertisers using its AdWords platform .
" An increase in the number of ads coinciding with a decrease in the number of advertisers suggests an artificial change in ad coverage , perhaps in response to sluggish activity , quite different from than the organic growth which fueled revenues in previous quarters , " reads a preliminary draft of AdGooRoo 's quarterly report , due for release on Monday .
Google 's official line is that by expanding coverage , it 's somehow improving the " quality " of the text ads that turn up when you type certain keywords into its search engine .
But the Mountain View Chocolate Factory said the same thing last year when it was actively shrinking coverage .
During the first quarter - a traditionally slow quarter for online advertising - the average number of ads per Google keyword reached a high of 5.25 in February , up from 4.39 in the shopping - happy month of December .
Meanwhile , the number of first - results - page advertisers dropped 1.3 per cent during the quarter .
Typically , AdGooRoo says , an increase in ad coverage results in more revenue :
More ads means more clicks , and more clicks means more dollars .
But considering the decrease in the number of advertisers , the outfit questions whether this will still hold true .
Potentially , there could be cases where expanded ad coverage does not grow revenue .
If Google posts more ads with lower per-click prices , for instance , this could shrink the bottom line by reducing the numbers of clicks on ads with higher prices .
But in the end , Google controls AdWords prices - though it says otherwise .
Advertisers do set the maximum price they wish to pay , but Google 's top - secret algorithms , in tandem with what others are advertisers are bidding , determine how much it actually charges for a particular ad .
Thanks to Google 's " quality score , " ads at the bottom of the page may have higher prices than those at the top .
Google 's ad coverage is limited by the keywords advertisers are bidding and their daily ad budgets .
But because Google controls such a large swath of the search market - more than 60 per cent in the US , according to comScore - advertisers are generally willing to pay for as much traffic as they can get .
" Our experience is advertisers are willing to take all the clicks we can give them at the current CPC [ cost per click ] - even in tough times , " Google senior vice president Jonathan " Perfect Ad " Rosenberg said during the company 's fall earnings call .
" We think that will continue to be true because nobody wants to turn away a customer . "
AdGooroo founder Rich Stokes argues that click - for - click , Yahoo ! and Microsoft are generating better leads than Google .
But advertisers are still more likely to opt for Mountain View .
" There 's some pretty good ROI to be found on Yahoo ! , much better than Google .
But the volume is so much higher on Google , " he tells us .
" It takes just as much effort to manage a Yahoo ! or Microsoft campaign as a Google campaign , so advertisers - many of whom are shorthanded - are going to choose Google . "
Anytime Google wants to expand coverage , it can do so .
Certainly , the company is concerned with so - called ad quality .
But when it wants the extra cash , it can always hedge that commitment in the short term .
The question is whether this latest coverage - leap will boost the bottom line .
Earlier this year , CEO Eric Schmidt admitted that even Google is " not immune " to recession .
" The situation is pretty dire , " he said last month at a San Francisco analysts ' conference , referring to the global economy .
" During this time , what 's happening is that people are using the internet more .
But it obviously will affect the online - advertising markets as well - simply because our systems are so tightly tuned that if customers are buying less it will eventually be reflected in [ cost per advertising click ] ...
" We are not immune - ' we ' Google and ' we ' the online - advertising industry .
But we may be better positioned than other advertisers . "
Pay no attention to the " finely tuned " bit .
AdWords is n't anywhere near as finely tuned as Google would lead you to believe .
And in all likelihood , you can ignore the " not immune " bit too .
Schmidt likes to downplay the power of the money machine .
Google announces its first - quarter earnings next week . ®

Beefed up imagery taken from the hellish surface of Venus nearly 25 years ago is offering new glimpses of that strange landscape .
Don Mitchell of Redmond , Washington is a retired researcher from Bell Labs and Microsoft Research .
He has matched his computer science and image processing skills with a passion to study old Soviet spacecraft data .
One result of this high - tech harmony of interests has been a relook at imagery relayed via twin Venera - 13 and 14 probes that landed on Venus in 1982 .
Mitchell obtained the original data from the two landers with the help of the designer of the Venera cameras , Yuri Gektin .
[ New images : Hills / Landscape ]
Surprising results
Processing of the Venera lander imagery was done in several stages , Mitchell explained .
The biggest task was first taking multiple transmissions — live and from tape — then merging them to produce one very clean master copy of each of four spacecraft cameras .
Venera -13 and 14 each had two cameras .
A new camera calibration function was calculated .
That conversion teased out a lot of the very dark and very light regions caught by Venera cameras , Mitchell said , detail not brought out in the original Russian photo reduction work .
Surprisingly , in the case of Venera - 13 , distant hills hazily seen were clearly revealed .
To produce the images , Mitchell mixed in in special purpose source code , resampling , and other image wizardry , along with knowledge about dimensions of the Venera lander and location of its camera lens .
He was able to preserve the original sharpness of the Venera surface pictures .
A series of projected views were combined in Photoshop .
A few missing spots at the horizon were filled in by duplicated or reversing other portions of the image .

Relations between the Israeli government and the Obama administration have become tense lately over the issue of growing Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
Nearly 300,000 Israelis now live in such settlements , alongside some 2.5 million Palestinians .
The tense disputes over the settlements touch on religious and historical claims , local and international laws , and , of course political disagreements .
The settlements range in size and permanence from " wildcat " outposts made of plywood shacks to established cities of tens of thousands .
The international community views over 100 of the settlements as illegal under international law .
Despite calls from the U.S. for a complete freeze on expansion , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that , though Israel would not build any new settlements and would dismantle unauthorized outposts , it would still allow building within existing settlements to accommodate " natural growth . "
Collected here are some scenes from West Bank settlements over the past few months .

OTTAWA --
The Treasury Board says that the cost of Canada ’s military mission in Afghanistan for the next two years will be $ 1.35 - billion higher than projected a year ago by the Defence Department .
Those revised estimates of the incremental costs of the Canadian Forces mission in Afghanistan are posted on the Treasury Board website .
The Defence Department , citing national security provisions , censored an Access to Information request by the federal NDP that asked for those figures three weeks ago .
The Treasury Board says the military mission will cost $ 822 - million in the fiscal year 2009 - 10 and $ 943 - million in 2010 - 11 .
It also estimates that the mission will cost $ 178 - million in fiscal 2011 - 12 , when Canadian troops are expected to pull out of combat roles in Afghanistan .
It ’s the first time figures for that year have been made available .
“ The left hand and the right hand seem to have different strategies here .
It ’s time they came clean and let the public know what was going on , ” said NDP defence critic Jack Harris .
“ It ’s pretty strange .
You ’ve got secret numbers for national security reasons , then they put them on their website . ”
These latest estimates by Treasury Board are far larger than the Defence Department predicted in April 2008 when it released information to the NDP that showed a $ 261 - million price tag for 2009 - 10 and $ 150 million for 2010 - 11 .
When the NDP asked for those figures again this year , they were rebuffed under Section 15 of the Access to Information
Act which allows an exemption in “ the defence of Canada or any state allied ” in the withholding information .
Mr. Harris said it is also curious that the Treasury Board figures show for the first time an estimate for the fiscal year 2011 - 12 when the combat mission is due to end .
He said that suggests the military has a plan for operations in Afghanistan after the planned withdrawal date .
“ They ’ve got those plans in place .
Let ’s put on the table what they ’re spending that for and have a real debate and discussion [ about ] what we ’re going to be doing there after the troops come back , ” he said .
“ The whole point of asking for these numbers is to get the facts out there so we can have a discussion and debate about that .
They apparently did n’t want that . ”
The fact that the projections have shot up sharply since last year also raises questions about the military ’s ability to plan its future spending , said Mr. Harris .
“ The auditor general has already criticized the government for bad financial management in terms of their ability to actually project numbers and put them forward , ” he said .
“ Now we ’re in a situation where there ’s inconsistent numbers being offered to the public , and it ’s time to come clean . ”
During last fall ’s federal election campaign , Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page released a report that suggested the full cost of the mission could reach $ 18.1 - billion by 2011 .
Mr. Page ’s study took into account the long - term costs of caring for physically and emotionally damaged soldiers .
The NDP has filed a complaint with the information commissioner to force the release of the figures for 2009 - 10 , as well as for 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12 .
The military defines the incremental cost as “ the cost for personnel that would not have been incurred if there was no CF operation .
Specifically , incremental costs include the additional cost to deploy troops and equipment , provide ongoing maintenance and support during the applicable operation and any operation specific training required for the operation . ”
Where are they ?
Two of the most fundamental questions asked by people , and as yet still unanswered by science , are how life emerged on the Earth , and whether we are alone in the cosmos : does life exist in extraterrestrial locations as well ?
These deeply important questions form the core of a new kind of science , one that recently has been rapidly gathering momentum .
Astrobiology is supported by a flood of new information from studies on the origins of terrestrial life , and our deep - space probes and telescopes exploring the Universe around us .
The science incorporates everything from understanding the survival of life in the most extreme environments on Earth and looking for the earliest evidence of cells in the ancient rocks of our planet , to exploring the alien worlds of our solar system to determine if they have ever provided an environment suitable for life of their own .
Within our own solar system , astrobiologists consider several possible habitats for extraterrestrial life .
These include our next - door neighbour planet Mars ( if not now , then at least earlier in its history ) , as well as Jupiter 's moon Europa which is known to have a global ocean of water beneath its icy surface , and perhaps the giant hydrocarbon - soaked moon of Saturn , Titan .
Only one of these locations , the surface of Mars , has ever been tested for life .
This was back in the 1970s with the twin Viking robots , but the results of their biological detection instruments were ambiguous to say the least .
My own research focuses on the surface of Mars and the effects of the radiation from space on any martian life or evidence of its ancient existence .
We will be specifically looking for life on Mars again in the next few years with NASA 's Mars Science Laboratory and the European Space Agency 's ExoMars rover ( which I 'm working on ) .
Another recent development in astrobiology has been the ability to detect planets in other solar systems : new worlds orbiting distant stars in the night sky .
Over 340 of these so - called extrasolar planets , or exoplanets , have been discovered so far ( as of May 2009 ) , and we are now on the brink of being able to detect a terrestrial planet orbiting a sun- like star : a second Earth .
In this article , we 'll look at two aspects of the astrobiology of extrasolar planets : how to spot them , and how to check for signs of life across the gulf of deep space .
Planetary waltzes
One method for detecting distant exoplanets , far too faint to see directly with current telescopes , is to look for their effect on the star they 're orbiting .
We 're taught at school that planets like the Earth orbit around a star like the Sun .
Well , this is n't strictly true .
The planet and the star both orbit around a common centre of mass between them .
Imagine two friends facing each other and holding hands with straight arms .
If they now start whirling around each other they both turn around a point mid-way between the two of them — where their hands are linked .
This point is called their centre of mass .
But if one of the partners were much heavier , say a father twirling round his daughter , then the centre of mass that they both spin around would be pulled closer to him and he would move much less , as the girl spins around him .
A planet and a star both orbit around the centre of mass of their system .

The same is true of stars and planets .
Because a star is so much more massive than a planet ( the Sun , for example , is over a thousand times heavier than Jupiter , the largest planet in our solar system ) the centre of mass that they both orbit around is much closer to the star .
In fact , the centre of mass for the Sun - Jupiter system is actually inside the Sun .
This means that as a planet orbits around its star , the star itself is also wobbling around in a circle due to the gravity of the planet .
These star - wobbles are incredibly subtle , but luckily astronomers have worked out a really clever way of spotting them , using the Doppler shift of the starlight .
The Doppler effect describes how the frequency of waves is compressed as their source moves towards you , and then stretched out as the source passes you and moves away .
You 'll be familiar with this effect from hearing the noisy siren of an ambulance as it races past you .
The siren sound has a higher pitch as the ambulance approaches , and then there is a sudden drop in the pitch as the ambulance overtakes you .
The same happens with the light emitted by a star as it wobbles around an orbiting planet .
Sometimes the star is being tugged slightly towards the Earth and its light appears shifted to the blue end of the spectrum by this motion , and then later the star is being pulled away again and the light is shifted to the red end of the spectrum .
So an orbiting planet produces a cyclic Doppler shift in the starlight which astronomers can measure and so infer the presence of the planet .
Noisy stars
Simply detecting the periodic stretching and squashing of starlight is only the fist step .
The degree of Doppler shift depends on how fast the star is moving towards , or away from , the Earth and so astronomers can calculate the speed of the star 's wobble , called the radial velocity .
If the planet orbits its sun in a perfect circle then the star 's radial velocity varies as a sine curve : the positive peaks of the sine curve correspond to the star moving directly towards us , the negative peaks of the sine curve to the star moving away from us along our line of sight , and the other points of the sine wave correspond to the star being in between the two extremes of its wobble .
But things are rarely that simple !
The Earth 's orbit around the Sun is actually a pretty good approximation of a circle , whereas those of many of the extrasolar planets discovered so far are pretty stretched out in one direction into an elliptical path .
This means that the strength of the planet 's gravitational tug on its star changes during the course of each orbit , which distorts the symmetry of the sine curve of the star 's radial velocity as it wobbles back and forth .
To make things even more complicated , planets are n't thought to form as an only - child around a star , but as siblings in a whole family of orbiting planets .
This means that the radial velocity graph of a star with multiple planets can vary in a very complex pattern .
There is often also a great deal of noise in the recorded data , particularly if your telescope is beneath the churning weather of the Earth 's atmosphere , and the surface of stars themselves are constantly boiling and vibrating like the skin of a drum .
A very fitting curve
So detecting alien planets around distant stars is a far from routine effort , and a lot of statistical mathematics must be used to pull out the signal of the orbiting planet from the noise in the measurements of the starlight .
One particular problem is finding the best solution to fit the measurements of the star 's radial velocity .
" The task of estimating the parameters of a planet 's orbit — the orbital period ( the length of the planet 's year ) , for example — is very tricky , " explains Sreekumar Balan , an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge .
Any number of different sine curves could be fitted to the data , with slightly different amplitudes , or periods , or set to be more or less symmetrical ( depending on how elliptical the planet 's orbit is ) .
" This process gets even more complicated if you try to fit the data with overlapping sine curves of more than one planet , " says Balan .
The radial velocity measurements recorded from a star called HD187085 ( data points with vertical error bars ) and two different orbital solutions calculated by the ExoFit statistical software ( solid and dashed sinusoidal curves ) .
Image courtesy Sreekumar Balan and Ofer Lahav , 2009 , from a paper to appear in MNRAS .
So how do you know which of this infinitely varied class of possible curves fits the data as closely as possible — which is the most probable or optimum orbit of a new planet ?
Sreekumar Balan and Ofer Lahav , at University College London , have designed computer software , called ExoFit , to help with just this conundrum .
" It is based on Bayesian parameter estimation , " explains Balan .
Imagine a graph with orbital period and eccentricity ( how elliptical the orbit is ) along the two axes .
Each ( x , y ) point on this graph corresponds to a particular possible solution to the orbit of the new planet .
" The computer takes a random walk through this parameter space and for each possible solution uses a statistical method called Bayes ' theorem to work out how probable it is . "
From this , Balan and Lahav can find which particular combination of period and eccentricity gives the best orbit of the planet to fit the radial velocity measurements of the star .
The diagram on the left shows the radial velocity measurements recorded from a star called HD187085 ( data points with vertical error bars ) and two different orbital solutions calculated by the ExoFit statistical software ( solid and dashed sinusoidal curves ) .
Winking suns
This radial velocity technique has discovered the vast majority of alien solar systems that we now know to exist .
But detecting a small rocky planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star — the sort of world we think would give life its best chance — is currently beyond the capability of the radial velocity technique .

Another technique , called the transit method , looks for the slight dimming in the brightness of a star as a planet passes in between it and the Earth .
This method is likely to be the first to spot a truly Earth - like planet , and perhaps even within the next few years .
In December 2006 France launched a space telescope called COROT that ought to be able to spot Earth - sized planets , and just this March NASA launched a much larger space telescope called Kepler .
Kepler has the most sensitive digital camera ever sent into deep space and will stare at the same patch of starry sky for over three years , carefully recording any variations in the brightness of more than 100,000 suns that might be planetary transits .
Depending on how common Earth - like planets are in our galaxy , Kepler could discover up to ten or more during its mission .
Water on the rocks
The best results come about if you can combine both radial velocity and transit techniques .
The Doppler shift tells you the mass of the planet , the amount of star - dimming during the transit tells you the diameter of the planet , and by combining this information you can work out the density of the new world .
Calculating the density is very important because it will tell us if the planet is a small rocky body like Earth , or is perhaps a gassy world shrouded in a thick atmosphere that probably would n't provide an environment suitable for life .
Once the orbit of the new world has been determined , and taking into account the kind of star it orbits , it is also possible to work out the likely temperature on its surface , and so whether water would be liquid or not .
Ultimately , the thing that astrobiologists are aching to discover is a wet rock orbiting a sun- like star .
Chemistry of alien atmospheres
Astronomers can go even further than working out the probable climate on a planet .
If they are able to collect light that has come from the planet , either sunlight reflecting off its surface or the infrared glow of the warm planet itself , it is possible to pull off something very exciting indeed .
By studying light from the planet it is possible to actually read the chemical make - up of its atmosphere , from all the way across the gulf of interstellar space without even needing to leave Earth .
This is one of the telescopes that will take part in ESA 's Darwin mission to analyse the atmospheres of possible Earth - like planets .

This trick comes down to a technique called spectroscopy .
If you take sunlight and spread it out into a spectrum you 'll reveal all the colours of the rainbow — Isaac Newton first managed this with a glass prism , but nowadays we use very precise diffraction gratings .
But sunlight is n't actually a smooth continuation of colours ; it has dark gaps missing where something has absorbed light of that particular colour , or wavelength .
Different atoms in the sun absorb light at specific wavelengths , and in fact the element helium was first discovered by the gap its absorption left in the spectrum of sunlight ( its name comes from the Greek word for sun , helios ) .
If you look at longer wavelengths , into the infrared part of the spectrum , the absorption bands are from particular molecules .
So all you need to do to read the chemistry of an alien world is split the light coming from it into a spectrum , and look for wavelengths that have been absorbed by its atmosphere .
Signs of life
Carbon dioxide leaves a very obvious dip in the infrared spectrum , and tells you that the new world does indeed have an atmosphere with a greenhouse effect acting as a planetary blanket to keep the planet cosy and warm .
Water vapour also leaves its mark in the spectrum and would confirm a wet world .
The Earth 's atmosphere contains ozone , protecting it from harmful UV rays .
Image courtesy NASA .
But the most exciting molecular fingerprint by far to find in the infrared spectrum would be that of ozone .
Not only would this mean the planet has an ozone layer protecting it from harmful UV rays from its sun , but the ozone itself is produced from oxygen gas .
Finding a planet with oxygen in its air would be truly ground - breaking , because it would almost certainly have been put there by life : by the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria , algae , or possibly even forests of plants and trees .
But finding both oxygen and a gas like methane in the atmosphere would really clinch the argument for an alien biosphere .
Oxygen and methane react together very rapidly in planetary terms , and so finding them both side by side in an atmosphere means the chemistry of the planet is far from equilibrium .
Something has to be continuously producing both gases in enormous volumes : life .
Intriguingly , plumes of methane gas have already been discovered seeping out of the ground on Mars .
Perhaps these are the waste gases given off by hardy bacteria living deep beneath the freezing martian surface .
Ideally , we'd be able to analyse the spectrum of a distant planet by imaging it directly .
For example , the Hubble Space Telescope can easily photograph the other planets in our own solar system , isolating only the light coming from the planet .
But to do this for an Earth - like planet orbiting another star light years away is far beyond our current state - of - the - art telescopes .
We would need an array of telescopes spread out over hundreds of metres in space , and a mission like this wo n't be launched until at least 2015 .
Astronomers have , however , already been able to detect different molecules in the atmospheres of a few extrasolar planets .
A steamy world

Planets which transit their sun from our point of view periodically pass in front of the star , and then half an orbit later slide behind it and are obscured .
If you record a spectrum of the starlight at these two times you essentially create a before and after snapshot , firstly including light that has streamed through the planet 's atmosphere and secondly containing only starlight when the planet is hidden .
Subtracting one from the other removes the over - powering starlight and leaves only the spectrum of light from the planet itself .
Using this very clever trick astronomers have detected both water vapour and methane in the atmosphere of the same planet , HD 189733 b .
This planet , however , is larger than the gas giant Jupiter and orbits so tightly around its star that its whole year lasts only two Earth - days .
HD 189733 b receives such a roasting from its sun that the temperature of its atmosphere is estimated to be over 900°C , and so this is certainly not the sort of planet we think could support life .
The discovery and characterisation of worlds beyond our solar system , or exoplanetology as the research has come to be known , has certainly come a long way in the fourteen years since the first planet was discovered orbiting another star .
But this is just the beginning , and there is every chance that the first Earth - like extrasolar planet will be announced in the next few years .
After this revolutionary discovery the long , hard slog to get to know this planet and read the chemical make - up of its atmosphere for signs of life will begin .

Robert Mueller , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , never looked wearier or more at a loss than when he tangled last week with 9th District congressman Steve Cohen of Memphis on the issue of whether marijuana can be considered a " gateway " drug , leading to experimentation with harder drugs like cocaine , heroin , and methamphetamnes .
In this CNN video ( below ) of a Judiciary Committee hearing last week , Cohen presses his interrogation of Mueller on the issue of whether use of marijuana — the legalized medical use of which Cohen is a proponent of — leads to dependence on the more dangerous drugs .
Mueller fumbled with the question , acknowledging at one point that he could cite no death attributable to marijuana use .
In the end , Cohen hazarded an answer in the negative to his own question , suggesting ironically that milk leads to beer which in turn leads to the use of bourbon .

Amazon Patents Brick - and - Mortar Storefronts
Amazon has received an unexpected patent for tiny little physical storefronts that will soon be popping up all over America .
Amazon is n't talking about what 's gonna go in these buildings and are letting analysts speculate that they are some kind of " pick up " station that will be bad for business .
From The Street " The company essentially sells commodity items at terrific prices to drive revenue growth and free cash flow , " says Charles Wolf , analyst at Needham & Co . " Physical stores would in no way contribute to this .
" These stores are n't going to be " pick up " stations .
They are either going to be : 1 ) .
Brick - and - mortar Kindle stores that will sell ebook readers and accessories to the masses .
2 ) .
Espresso Book Machine hutches that will let people print Amazon books faster than a photocopy of your face .
You will be able to walk in , demand any book from Amazon 's extensive catalog , and they will print it up for you while you stand there with your gum in your mouth .
The storefronts will probably be both of these .
A company called " Lightning Source " is running a pilot program with On Demand Books , makers of the Espresso Book Machine .
Publishers like W.W. Norton , Macmillan , Hachette Group , McGraw - Hill , and Simon and Schuster are already involved .
From the " On Demand Books " press release about the Lightning Source deal :
" We see the Espresso Book Machine as an innovative and exciting way for publishers to get their books out into the market , " said David Taylor , President of Lightning Source .
" There is clearly a place for the in - store print on demand model in the emerging landscape of globally distributed print . " in 2004 , Lightning Source and Amazon lost a 15 million dollar lawsuit for patent infringement against the On Demand Machine Corporation , which filed for a patent to sell single - books at point - of - sale .
Now they are friends .
Lightning Source already uses Amazon as a print - on - demand distributor .
Neither " Lightning Source " nor " On Demand Books " can afford to buy property .
These three companies are about to go into " business " together to publish and distribute books instantaneously .
On Demand Books provides the machine and the patent .
Amazon provides the clout and the consumer confidence .
Lightning Source provides the publishers until Amazon can steal them away with a better deal .
Pretty soon you are going to be shopping your manuscript around to exactly one company .
And if you piss Amazon off , * DELETE *
Bad news for Canada 's polka kings .
The Recording Academy , which puts on the Grammy Awards , has decided to eliminate the category for best polka album .
" I do n't like to see it happen , " legendary bandleader and three - time Grammy winner Walter Ostanek said Thursday from his home in St. Catharines , Ont .
" There 's room for our music . "
John Gora , who 's been nominated four times in the polka category but has never won , was more blunt .
" That sucks , " he said from Burlington .
" Of course I 'm disappointed . "
In a statement , the academy said polka was scrapped to " ensure the awards process remains representative of the current musical landscape . "
Grammy organizers also split a folk category in two and combined two Latin categories into one .
There will be 109 awards handed out at next year 's Grammys instead of 110 .
The ceremony takes place Jan. 31 , 2010 in Los Angeles .
Polka was by no means the only obscure category at the annual music bash .
Trophies will still be handed out for best packaging , liner notes , surround sound album , classical crossover album , Hawaiian music album and zydeco or Cajun music album .
Gora blamed the polka decision on politics , pointing out that American bandleader Jimmy Sturr has won the category 18 times .
" You can't have a polka guy holding world records , " he said .
`` You can't have Jimmy Sturr winning more Grammys than Quincy Jones , for example . "
But Sturr has long had competition from Ostanek , the undisputed Canadian polka king .
Ostanek 's treks to Los Angeles have practically become an annual Grammy tradition – after all , he 's racked up more than 20 nominations ( his three wins came in consecutive years , from 1992 - 94 ) .
In fact , the gregarious musician was nominated at this year 's show but lost out to – who else ?
– Sturr .
Still , even though his category is gone , Ostanek , 74 , did n't have a bad word to say about his experiences with the glitzy show .
" I personally do n't have any regrets , " he said .
" I 've met a lot of nice people .
The Grammys have treated me good . "

A member of Canada 's Walk of Fame and the Order of Canada , Ostanek has appeared on The Tonight Show and some have speculated that he was the inspiration for SCTV 's famed Shmenge Brothers .
Ostanek , who owns a music shop in St. Catharines , says the Grammys have given him tremendous exposure and lamented that young polka musicians would not receive the same boost .
" I personally have had a good ride and I feel sorry for the future artists coming up , " he said .
" There are fans out there and there will be more fans down the line .
But that 's the way it is . "
Meanwhile , Gora worried about the effect the academy 's decision could have on polka music in general .
" It 's a bad thing ( for polka ) , " he said .
" A Grammy nomination just recognizes you , puts you on another level .
It just recognizes the talent of the local guys that really do n't have the big budget to operate but are still excellent musicians . "
Gora , who plans to begin recording a new CD this weekend , said he intends to submit his recordings in the world music category now .
He certainly is n't giving up on trying to win his first Grammy .
" Why should I ? " he said .
" The guys work hard and we put out good material .
" I even have a new song about the crazy bailout that 's going on with the financial and automotive companies .
We have a new song about it .
It 's just a 2 / 4 beat and why should n't it be heard by others ? "
Ostanek , who diligently collected autographs from his favourite artists during his trips to the Grammys , said the show made him feel special .
" Everybody wants to be a somebody , " he said .
" You 're mingling with Tony Bennett and other people like him on a one - to - one basis .... I 've had a wonderful ride . "
Linux Shell Scripting Tutorial ( LSST ) v1.05r3 Prev Chapter 1 : Introduction : Quick Introduction to Linux Next
Introduction
This tutorial is designed for beginners who wish to learn the basics of shell scripting / programming plus introduction to power tools such as awk , sed , etc .
It is not help or manual for the shell ; while reading this tutorial you can find manual quite useful ( type man bash at $ prompt to see manual pages ) .
Manual contains all necessary information you need , but it wo n't have that much examples , which makes idea more clear .
For this reason , this tutorial contains examples rather than all the features of shell .
Audience for this tutorial
I assumes you have at least working knowledge of Linux i.e. basic commands like how to create , copy , remove files / directories etc or how to use editor like vi or mcedit and login to your system .
But not expects any programming language experience .
If you have access to Linux , this tutorial will provide you an easy - to - follow introduction to shell scripting .
What 's different about this tutorial
Many other tutorial and books on Linux shell scripting are either too basic , or skips important intermediate steps .
But this tutorial , maintained the balance between these two .
It covers the many real life modern example of shell scripting which are almost missed by many other tutorials / documents / books .
I have used a hands - on approach in this tutorial .
The idea is very clear " do it yourself or learn by doing " i.e. trying things yourself is the best way to learn , so examples are presented as complete working shell scripts , which can be typed in and executed
Chapter Organization
Chapter 1 to 4 shows most of the useful and important shell scripting concepts .
Chapter 5 introduction to tools & utilities which can be used while programming the Linux shell smartly .
Chapter 6 and 7 is all about expression and expression mostly used by tools such as sed and awk .
Chapter 8 is loaded with tons of shell scripting examples divided into different categories .
Chapter 9 gives more resources information which can be used while learning the shell scripting like information on Linux file system , common Linux command reference and other resources .
Chapter 1 introduces to basic concepts such as what is Linux , where Linux can used and continue enplaning the shell , shell script and kernel etc .
Chapter 2 shows how to write the shell script and execute them .
It explains many basic concepts which requires to write shell script .
Chapter 3 is all about making decision in shell scripting as well as loops in shell .
It explains what expression are , how shell understands the condition / decisions .
It also shows you nesting concept for if and for loop statement and debugging of shell script .
Chapter 4 introduces the many advanced shell scripting concepts such as function , user interface , File Descriptors , signal handling , Multiple command line arguments etc .
Chapter 5 introduces to powerful utility programs which can be used variety of purpose while programming the shell scripting .
Chapter 6 and 7 gives more information on patterns , filters , expressions , and off course sed and awk is covered in depth .
Chapter 8 contains lot of example of shell scripting divided into various category such as logic development , system administration etc .
Note that indicate advanced shell scripting concepts , you can skip this if are really new to Linux or Programming , though this is not RECOMMENDED by me .
Also not that currently this tutorial is also translated into some other foreign language (s ) ; if you are interested to read it in other language the the English then please visit http://www.nixcraft.com/uniqlinuxfeatures/lsst/.
I hope you get as much pleasure reading this tutorial , as I had writing it .
After reading this tutorial if you are able to write your own powerful shell scripts , then I think the purpose of writing this tutorial is served and finally if you do get time after reading this tutorial drop me an e-mail message about your comment / suggestion and off course bugs ( errors ) of this tutorial .
The battle between Craigslist and South Carolina attorney general Henry McMaster took another turn Wednesday when the online classifieds site sued McMaster for declaratory relief and a restraining order .
The battle between Craigslist and South Carolina attorney general Henry McMaster took another turn Wednesday when the online classifieds site sued McMaster for declaratory relief and a restraining order .
McMaster said earlier this month that he would sue Craigslist within 10 days unless it deleted the South Carolina portion of its " erotic services " section .
A week later , Craigslist said it would dump " erotic services " in favor of a monitored " adult services " section ; all posts would be deleted after their seven - day expiration .
McMaster , however , stuck to the 10 - day timeframe and said on Saturday that he still planned to sue the Web site because South Carolina posts remained .
An incensed Jim Buckmaster , Craigslist 's chief executive , demanded an apology for McMaster 's " unreasonable and unfair " demands .
That apology must still be in the mail .
" Mr. McMaster 's repeated threats of criminal prosecution should we refuse to shut down Craigslist for South Carolina have left us little choice but to seek declaratory relief before the court , " Buckmaster wrote in a Wednesday blog post .
Buckmaster argued that the only way to definitively comply with McMaster 's request is to remove the entire South Carolina section of Craigslist .
That is not an option , he wrote , given that South Carolinians ' usage of the site has " exploded ' in the last two years , with some cities experiencing 2000 percent growth .
" The open architecture of Craigslist , quintessential to the value it provides for users , simply does not allow for the absolute prevention of solicitation or pornography , with respect to any of its categories and functions , " he wrote .
McMaster 's office said the defensive legal action was " good news [ because ] it shows that Craigslist is taking the matter seriously for the first time . "
" More importantly , overnight they have removed the erotic services section from their website , as we asked them to do , " McMaster said .
That statement is slightly misleading .
Craigslist said last week that all existing " erotic services " posts would expire within seven days  which is today .
As a result , " erotic services " has now been removed from all cities , not just those in South Carolina .
" Unfortunately , we had to inform [ Craigslist ] of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response , " McMaster continued .
" We trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised .
This office and the law enforcement agencies of South Carolina will continue to monitor the site to make certain that our laws are respected . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) agreed with Craigslist .
" Buckmaster is exactly right , " EFF staff attorney Matt Zimmerman wrote in a blog post .
" As we and many others have noted , Craigslist was never at risk of incurring criminal liability for material posted by their users because Section 230 of the Communications Decency
Act clearly protects them . "
McMaster and other attorneys general that went after Craigslist over the section " took advantage of Craigslist 's previously demonstrated interest in working with law enforcement to address legitimate concerns and rewarded such voluntary cooperation with even more belligerent posturing . "
I never thought being a divorced father would put me in a special interest group , but in doing marketing research for my
memoir on divorced dadhood
, I came across several "
dads ' rights
" websites , activists , and blogs arguing for
stronger child custody protections
, fighting
media stereotypes
, and even debunking what they consider
domestic violence myths
. The volume of their buzzing reached a new decibel when Lifetime TV announced their intention to air
Deadbeat Dads
, a reality show in which
National Child Support
founder Jim Durham travels about the country , lassoing fathers who refuse to pay child support .
Originally called " Bad Dads , " the idea was floated -- then apparently sunk -- at FOX .
The only real surprise is that it was never called "
P
OPS . "
Of course , one can say hunting deadbeat dads on Lifetime is no different than going after dog beaters on Animal Planet , blowing up gophers on the Golf Channel , or inviting Richard Simmons on The 700 Club .
The audience wants blood .
And deadbeat dads are an easy target , MUCH easier than single moms ever were ( see : D. Quayle vs. M. Brown , 1992 ) .
The problem -- says Fathers & Families , a dad - vocacy group -- is that a strong majority of divorced dads with shared custody pay child support regularly , so such a program paints an unrealistic and demeaning stereotype of divorced fathers .
A much - lauded editorial in The Washington Times calls Deadbeat Dads a cheap shot that ignores " the damage the show can cause children , wives and other family members . "
It also cites a study finding that 77 percent of noncustodial fathers are not able to spend court - ordered time with their children as a result of " visitation interference " by the custodial parent .
Comparing apples to Apple Jacks , the piece concludes , " In short , lousy moms outnumber deadbeat dads 3 - 1 . "
I 'm all against stupid reality television shows that put otherwise decent human beings and their families in a despicable and embarrassing light ( unless said human beings are degrading themselves for prize money ) .
That said , I think the only people substantially stereotyped by images of deadbeat dads are other deadbeat dads .
As a divorced father myself , I do n't feel maligned by a show villifying deadbeat dads any more than I feel maligned by To Catch a Predator simply because I met an ( appropriately - aged ) girlfriend online , or by Bernie Madoff 's atrocities simply because I'm Jewish .
The subliminal association is n't between " deadbeat dads " and " divorced dads " as much as it is between irresponsible and responsible behavior .
But it 's still a show that does no one any good .
If you want to see some really " bad dad " influences , just watch Everybody Loves Raymond or any sitcom featuring a pudgy , buffoonish , sedentary man-childish father with a knockout wife .
Better yet , let 's boycott the majority of Father 's Day cards that emphasize our laziness , our inattentiveness , our proximity to senility , and our love of all things nautical .
Those negative stereotypes of average , law - abiding dads are much more dangerous in my book , because that 's who I am .
And I 'm not into boats .

PHP makes life a lot easier for quick or dirty maintenance scripts , cron jobs or web applications but how does it do for older , not so straight forward problems dealing with bits and bytes ?
I was surprised how easy it was to manipulate bits in a byte with php .
Here is an function that made my life a fair amount easier when having to check for a specific bit in a byte .
This function checks whether a certain bit is set or not given a byte and an index .
It returns true if the chosen bit is set .
It casts the $ value argument to a integer just in case .
The index $n goes from left to right so the most significant bit is bit one and the least significant is bit eight .
This function will only work for integers between 0 and 255 because that was all I needed at the time .
It would be trivial to write either a function to separate bytes in an integer or to increase the amount of bits that this function checks .
I originally had a different function here but the Internet quickly told me that there was an easier way to do this .
<? php function check_bit ( $ value , $n=8 ) { $ value = ( int ) $ value ; if ( $value & ( 1 < < ( 8 - $ n ) ) ) { return true ; } else { return false ; } } //Check Bit Usage Example $ test_byte1 = " 4 " ; if ( check_bit ( $test_byte 1,2 ) ) echo " Bit 2 is set in " .decbin( $test_byte1 ) ; else echo " Bit 2 is not set in " .decbin( $test_byte1 ) ; ?>
Here are the php bitwise operator definitions from the php documentation .
Look like C much ?

Editor 's Note :
This is part of an ongoing series on the global recession and signs indicating how and when the economic recovery will begin .
Click here for The Recession in Japan , Part 1 .
Since the massive collapse of its housing and equities bubble in 1990 , Japan has tried every trick in the book to deal with its economic woes , from lowering interest rates to expanding government spending .
With nothing new at its disposal to effectively fight the current global recession on its own , Japan will have to ride the coattails of its chief external markets -- especially the United States and China -- for any kind of recovery .
But bleak demographics mean Japan 's best days may be behind it .
By the end of the first quarter of 2009 , the global financial and economic crisis had exacted a heavy toll on the Japanese economy .
In the first quarter of the calendar year , 2009 gross domestic product ( GDP ) shrank by an annualized 14.2 percent , after shrinking 13.5 percent the previous quarter .
The Bank of Japan predicts that the economy will shrink by 3 percent overall in 2009 , but others ( such as the International Monetary Fund ) estimate a contraction of more than 6 percent -- far greater than during Japan 's period of economic malaise through the 1990s and early 2000s .
Any way you look at it , Japan is among the hardest hit economies amid the current global recession .
Japan 's latest recession was not triggered by the U.S. - born global financial crisis but began with the global commodity inflation that raged throughout 2007 and 2008 and caused a major increase in import costs .
Lacking natural resources , Japan has always been highly dependent on imports to meet its needs for basic commodities , such as energy and food .
Moreover , although Japan's is a consumer - driven economy ( private consumption accounts for about 55 percent of GDP ) , that consumption is languid and has grown no faster than 1.1 percent each year since 1997 , often not growing at all .
Weak consumption is easily discouraged by high prices .
In 2007 , global inflation caused Japan 's chief imports to rise in price , from mineral fuels such as oil and liquefied natural gas to raw materials like iron ore and foodstuffs like cereals .
Private demand shrank for most of the year .
This trend worsened dramatically in 2008 , when Japan 's energy imports rose by nearly 54 percent and food by 16 percent compared to the year before .
Then came small ( but foreboding ) losses in Japan 's all - important export sector .
While they make up only about 15 percent of GDP , far less than China 's 32 percent and South Korea 's 55 percent , exports are an indispensable contributor to Japan 's economic growth .
In mid-2008 , with global commodity inflation raging , key foreign markets were slowing down , especially in the United States and Europe , hurting Japanese exports ( most notably cars ) .
The combination of fewer export gains and higher import costs led Japan to teeter on the brink of recession , with GDP shrinking in the second quarter of 2008 .
A rare monthly trade deficit in August 2008 signaled that the worst was yet to come .
When the financial crisis erupted in the United States in September 2008 , it had significant negative effects on Japan 's already dysfunctional financial system .
Moreover , as the financial contagion spread and froze up global credit channels , it forced international trade to a virtual standstill , sending Japan 's exports plummeting by 14.6 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and 28.8 percent in the first quarter of 2009 ( seasonally adjusted and compared to the previous quarter ) .
From October through February Japan saw monthly trade deficits , and fiscal year 2008 marked the first yearly deficit since 1980 .
Repeated trade deficits are grim news for a country whose exports are its last leg to stand on in terms of growth .
Export losses accounted for 2.8 percent of the total 3.8 percent contraction in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 4.2 percent of the overall 4 percent GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2009 ( when imports offset exports losses a bit ) .
The problem for Japan 's exporters was compounded by the rapid appreciation of the yen , which global investors sought as a safe haven .
The global carry trade consists of investors who take out low - interest loans in established currencies ( such as Japanese yen or Swiss francs ) and use the money to invest in high interest - yielding emerging - market assets to make a profit on the exchange rate variation .
Throughout 2007 investors scrambled to pay back their debts in yen -- from May 2007 to February 2008 , the yen 's value appreciated by 18 percent .
Between July 2008 and December 2008 , when the financial turmoil spiraled out of control , the yen went on another appreciating streak , strengthening by 17 percent to 90 yen per U.S. dollar .
The yen 's insuppressible rise made Japanese exports even less attractive during a period of rapidly dwindling demand .
Losses in exports quickly translated to pain across the rest of the Japanese economy , stopping output , cutting wages , laying off workers and causing companies to go bankrupt .
Policy Tools
With Japan falling deeper into recession , the government , along with those of other G20 countries , pledged to take drastic fiscal and monetary measures to stabilize the financial system , mitigate the painful losses for households and businesses and stimulate the economy so that it could at least jog in place .
These policies followed a clear sequence .
First and foremost , central banks everywhere set about lowering interest rates to ensure that credit was available to firms caught in the liquidity crisis -- many lowered rates to unprecedented levels to try to stimulate borrowing and new investment .
The next step was for governments to expand their own spending .
With banks and other businesses hoarding cash to patch up their balance sheets , only governments could fill the demand gap by increasing their own spending , though it drove most of them further into deficit territory .
Next , governments directed their spending into stimulus policies that would prop up failing businesses , encourage specific industries and sectors and give funds directly to consumers to induce them to go shopping .
Yet unlike other G - 20 members , Japan had been using these same techniques for over a decade .
Financial stability measures such as capital injections ( of which Japan made 446.2 billion - yen worth in fiscal 2008 , ending in March ) have not come with firm requirements for subsequent restructuring of the failed institutions , so there is no reason to expect the institutions to make wiser choices that bring better returns .
Purchases of stocks off banks ' portfolios will likely result in long - term losses for the government , as has happened in past attempts , due to the long - term decline of Japanese share prices .
In other words , stabilizing Japan 's banking system is a byword for continuing to inject taxpayer money periodically as a form of life support for a system already too sick to be cured .
Interest rates in Japan were already below 1 percent and had been for over a decade when the Bank of Japan set about lowering them in the final months of 2008 .
Shaving off tens of basis points from the discount rate has not , in the past , succeeded in inspiring new borrowing and spending , though it has enabled firms on the verge of failure to roll over their debt and live another day .
Unfortunately for Japan , rates cannot go lower than zero , and the domestic population has long taken for granted the availability of subsidized credit .
So cheaper borrowing costs provide no incentive to borrow for the Japanese public , which is still in a savings mode .
The next policy step , deficit spending , has become so consistently practiced in Japan that the Finance Ministry even includes funds generated from bond sales in the " revenues " section of its general accounting budget .
Thus , deficits in Japan cannot provide a jolt when it is most needed .
Additional government expenditures amounting to 5 percent of GDP will not have nearly as much effect on an economy that is consistently pampered with deficits worth 8 percent of GDP as it will on an economy -- like Germany 's -- that normally does not run deficits at all .
The problem with stimulus packages is related .
Japan 's three fiscal stimulus packages , so far amounting to roughly 25.9 trillion yen ( or 27.4 trillion , depending on the value of the third stimulus package ) , or about 5 percent of GDP , will have some impact in propping up domestic demand , since the public portion of that demand shrank for most of 2008 .
But in general , stimulus is another tool that will not be as effective for Japan as for other countries because it is not new -- few economic stones can be turned over in Japan that do not reveal subsidies of some form or another .
Citizens , municipal and regional governments and major industries have come to rely on government assistance .
Though policymakers rightly hope to allot special grants for sectors that will multiply the potential for Japanese growth in the future -- such as in research and development for electronics , robotics , pharmaceuticals , genetics and environmentally friendly cars -- they must also allocate funds with political considerations and the need to preserve employment in mind .
This means funds will provide not so much stimulus as stilts for failed ( but probably politically connected ) businesses and one - off transfers that will not contribute to sustainable growth .
At the same time , major infrastructure projects can only be performed so many times , and after decades of building government - mandated bridges and roads , infrastructure projects become liabilities , failing to provide enough economic benefits to pay for themselves .
In other words , Tokyo has already worn down to the nub every standard tool that nations use to fight off recessions .
And the economy may take unforeseen twists and turns calling for further action .
But there could be some relief in sight .
While exports to the United States and Europe continued to decrease as of May , the United States appears poised to begin purchasing anew as shrinking inventories of consumer goods spur new orders .
While a revived U.S. market is essential , the Japanese are also looking anxiously to China -- initially for the effects of Beijing 's $ 586 billion stimulus package , which the Japanese hope will translate to higher exports to China , but ultimately for the possibility of tapping into the vast ( and partly mythical ) consumer market that lies hidden within the masses of China 's poor in the interior provinces .
With nothing at its disposal to effectively fight the recession on its own , Tokyo will have to ride the coattails of its chief external markets -- especially the United States and China , since Europe appears to be in for a long correction -- as the sole means of recovery .
As foreign demand revives , the demand for Japanese goods will , too .
Deflation
But even if Japan 's economy starts to grow , it will not likely be strong growth .
Deflation -- Japan 's ever - returning bane -- could be poised for a comeback that would weigh down recovery .
In April 2009 , the consumer price index stood at - 0.1 percent compared to the previous year , and the IMF predicts prices will fall by an average of 1 percent overall in 2009 .
By Japanese standards , that degree of deflation is not unfamiliar , but deflation is self - reinforcing and can lead to a quicksand situation that prolongs a recession , similar to what occurred from 1998 to 2003 .
Consumer prices were weak before the crisis , since Japan did not overcome its latest bout of deflation until 2007 .
And price decreases were expected as part of the disinflation of prices on food and fuel that were irregularly high prior to the recession .
But lower food and fuel prices are beneficial for importers of those goods , like the Japanese .
The real potential problem is that price drops are now occurring in areas like household furniture , medical care , communications , recreation and services , revealing that consumers are shying away from these goods and services , which will drive prices further downward .
While recent statistics show improvements in consumer confidence , job offers are drying up , unemployment is up to 5 percent ( which is high for Japan ) and wages are down by 3 percent , which means that there are more people jobless or short on cash , making consumer spending unlikely to revive any time soon .
Not to mention that all of the aforementioned fiscal actions will fatten Japan 's gargantuan public debt , imposing a still greater burden on the private sector .
The 2009 budget deficit , including budget supplements , is likely to approach 11 percent of GDP -- assuming an optimistic GDP performance and no additional extra-budgetary spending ( which is not a safe assumption ) .
This will be paid for by bond issues .
In terms of the percentage of GDP , Japan is the most debt - laden country in modern history , with total government debt amounting to roughly 173 percent of GDP in 2008 .
By the time the recent supplementary budgets and 2009 deficit have been accounted for , something like 85.6 trillion yen in new debt will have increased total debt to an estimated 916.1 trillion , which could amount to 183 percent of GDP or higher .
The 2009 Elections
With public finances on the rack , Prime Minister Taro Aso recently postponed the country 's deadline for a balanced budget from 2011 to 2019 .
But to balance the budget , Japan will need to eliminate about 42.4 trillion yen from its 2009 budget , which is about 80 percent of the year 's general expenditures and would be tantamount to scrapping allotments for social security , education , national defense , public works , military pensions and economic assistance combined .
To put it another way , balancing the budget by 2019 would require hacking off the equivalent of 2009's total projected national defense expenditures each year ( assuming revenues stay the same ) .
Of course , trying to fix the country 's finances would likely include raising taxes , and it is realistic to think Japan would opt to increase its consumption tax ( perhaps to as high as 15 - 16 percent ) to lighten the enormous burden of debt .
Japanese bureaucrats and politicians are aware that austerity measures eventually will have to be put in place to rein in the debt if the country is to avoid a catastrophic situation in which capital markets become unable to purchase bonds .
But no Japanese politician wants to risk losing power by spearheading these painful changes in such a conservative society .
Attempts by the Hashimoto administration in 1997 to rein in spending notoriously caused the economy to slow down , resulting in reduced tax revenues and increased deficits ( and some have argued that Junichiro Koizumi 's reforms had a similar effect ) .
Even if a leader emerged who was capable of doing so , the Japanese system cannot be easily changed .
Reform initiated at the upper echelons rarely translates to faithful implementation by the government ministries , and businesses expect their share of lucrative government contracts if they are to use their levers to deliver voter support for politicians .
As it happens , 2009 is an election year , and elections for the lower house of Parliament , which must be called by September , when members ' terms expire , will not change any of the towering difficulties Japan faces .
Surprisingly , the elections have become hotly contested for a country that has had a single party dominate its politics for the vast majority of the past 50 years , and some are anticipating a historic change to the status quo .
The gloomy economy has sped up the process by which the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which has been in power almost without interruption since 1955 , loses ground to opposition parties .
In particular , the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) looks set to make sweeping gains , despite a damaging campaign finance scandal that brought its leader down .
The LDP government is hoping that a sudden upturn in export markets and the trickling down of stimulus funds will be enough not only to help the economy but also to generate enough public approval to keep it in power .
More important , the Japanese public may not be willing to hand a full majority to a party like the DPJ , which it sees as relatively lacking in leadership experience and personnel .
But even if the DPJ succeeds in taking over , it will likely only be able to tinker with details on taxes and social programs , and it will not be anxious to jeopardize its hard - won authority by pushing through harsh fiscal reforms .
Thus , the 2009 election is far more likely to reinforce a stalemate in the legislature than to pave the way for sweeping change , regardless of whether the LDP 's domination is broken .

Bikini protest in Ukraine
Posted
Jun 12 - A group of students in Kiev don bikinis and wash their laundry in a city fountain to protest against the summer shut down of hot water supplies .
The planet Mercury is the smallest of the inner planets ( 4,880 km / 3,032 mi in diameter ) , and the closest to the Sun ( 58 million km / 36 million mi - or 3.2 light minutes ) .
It was visited by the Mariner 10 spacecraft twice in the 1970s , and about 45 % of the surface was mapped .
On August 3rd , 2004 , NASA launched a new mission to Mercury , the MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry and Ranging probe ( or MESSENGER ) .
MESSENGER is now in the last stages of multiple gravity - assist flybys of Earth , Venus and Mercury , en route to an insertion into orbit around Mercury in March of 2011 .
In just two flyby encounters , MESSENGER has already greatly increased our knowledge about Mercury 's surface features .
As you look at Mercury in the new images below , keep in mind that it has minimal atmosphere , gravity about 1/3 of Earth's , and surface temperatures ranging from - 183 C ( - 297 F ) in some polar craters to 427 C ( 801 F ) at high noon ( Mercury 's solar day lasting 176 Earth days ) .

Mavic unveils its ultimate climbing wheel
R -Sys Ultimate debuts at Giro d'Italia

Mavic will supply a limited number of sponsored riders at this year 's Giro d'Italia with its most climbing - specific wheel to date - the new R - Sys Ultimate .
As the name suggests , the R - Sys Ultimate employs the same TraComp concept as the original R - Sys with low - tension tubular carbon fibre spokes that operate in both tension and compression for what Mavic claims is a stiffer , lighter , and more responsive wheel .
The ' lighter ' part of that equation was somewhat debatable before but certainly not now as the R - Sys Ultimate is said to weigh just 950g for the pair ( 410g front , 540g rear , without skewers ) .
The shallow 22 mm - deep carbon tubular rims are just 230g each , both front and rear hub shells are nearly 100 percent carbon fibre , and every spoke - not just half and half as on the current R - Sys rear - is tubular carbon fibre at a paltry 5g apiece .
In lieu of weight - adding mechanical connections , the entire structure is co-moulded together so the only metallic bits left are the oversized alloy axles , titanium freehub body , Mavic 's familiar ratchet system , and the cartridge bearings .
Granted , this leaves no provision for at - home truing or repair but unless something actually breaks , there is no reason these should go out of true anyway .
According to Mavic product manager Maxim Brunard , the new R - Sys Ultimate offers 18 percent lower inertia than the company 's already - light Cosmic Carbone Ultimate but also manages to deliver the same lateral stiffness thanks in part to widely - spaced hub flanges .

Durability issues highlighted by the original R - Sys have been addressed with new nine - layer spokes augmented with four spirally wound outer layers plus an extra pin inserted at the nipple end for additional shear strength .
Mavic claims impact resistance has gone up five - fold as a result and torsional strength more than three - fold , bringing the once - fragile carbon spokes more in - line with the bladed Zircal spokes used in its Ksyrium range .
Moreover , Mavic says the new wheel has also passed the UCI 's stringent - and highly unrealistic - impact test .
Either way , interested buyers should n't hold their breath .
As of right now , only 10 sets of these wheels are currently in service and all of them are slated for the Liquigas , Ag2r and Silence - Lotto teams .
Estimated cost is also yet to be determined but based on the construction , we would place it even a tad higher than the current Cosmic Carbon Ultimate , thus putting them around the US $ 3,000 mark - or more than US $ 3 per gram .
Those kinds of numbers wlll be hard to justify to average consumers but that has n't limited sales of other wheel exotica like Lightweight and Lew in the past .
Pros such as Liquigas ' Ivan Basso will only care about the new wheels ' improved performance , though , and we 'll see over the next few weeks just how much difference that will really make .

The Mariner Mars Missions
Mariner 4
Spacecraft Specifications
Mariner 4 images
Detailed Information on the Spacecraft , Experiments , and Data Sets
Introduction
Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to obtain and transmit close range images of Mars .
After its launch on November 28 , 1964 and a journey of hundreds of millions of kilometers , Mariner 4 passed within 9844 kilometers of Mars on July 14 , 1965 .
Beginning at a range of 16,900 km , the probe acquired a surface image composed of 200 lines , consisting of 200 pixels each ( average resolution was about 3 km / pixel ) every 48 seconds until , at a range of 11,900 km , 22 television pictures of the Martian surface had been stored on the spacecraft 's 4 - track tape recorder ( the last 3 of these pictures were beyond the terminator ) .
It took 4 days to transmit the image information to Earth and the spacecraft returned useful data until October 1965 , when the distance from Earth and its antenna orientation temporarily halted the signal acquisition .
Data acquisition resumed in late 1967 and continued until December 20 , 1967 .
Objectives
Mariner 4 was designed with 3 main objectives in mind .
First , the probe was to conduct field and particle experiments in interplanetary space , including measurements of the Martian magnetic field , cosmic dust and cosmic rays , and the solar wind .
Secondly , Mariner 4 was to provide close range images of Mars in order to provide us with the most detailed surface pictures ever obtained of the planet , hopefully revealing geologic and atmospheric processes .
Finally , as interplanetary probes were still a new technology , the mission would provide experience in operational and engineering techniques required for long term interplanetary missions .
An interesting spin -off of the last objective was the development of the radio- occultation experiment which obtained approval only after the spacecraft was already launched .
The experiment took advantage of radio waves from the spacecraft propagating through the Martian atmosphere as the spacecraft passed behind the planet .
Variations in the amplitude , frequency , and phase of the returned signal allowed calculations of atmospheric density , temperature , and scale height as functions of altitude .
Results
Other than some degradation of the plasma probe and a failed Geiger counter , the Mariner 4 mission was a success .
The relayed surface images revealed a cratered and moon - like surface , contrary to even conservative estimates of the Martian topography ( it was later learned that the images were of a geologically older region of the planet ) .
The images covered about 1 % of the surface within a discontinuous band stretching from 40 o S , 96 o W to 40 o N , 187 o W .
It was not conclusively determined whether or not Mars had an intrinsic magnetic field , but to date it is generally accepted that Mars is essentially without an intrinsic magnetic field of any significance .
One of the great achievements of the Mariner 4 mission was the modification of mission plans while the spacecraft was in transit in order to accomodate the radio- occultation experiment .
Not only did the experiment indicate surface pressures of 4.1 to 7.0 mbar ( for comparison Earth has a surface pressure of 1013 mbar ) , but the experiment revealed the benefits of maintaining some flexibility in mission plans even after a spacecraft is launched .
Mariner 6 & 7
Spacecraft Specifications
Detailed information on Mariner 6 Spacecraft , Experiments and Data Sets
Detailed information on Mariner 7 Spacecraft , Experiments and Data Sets
Introduction
Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 were identical spacecraft launched on February 24 , 1969 and March 27 , 1969 respectively , and their missions were entirely devoted to the flyby study of Mars .
The probes passed closest to Mars on July 30 and August 4 of the same year ( Mariner 7 took a more direct path than Mariner 6 and " caught up " to Mariner 6 , arriving only 5 days behind ) .
The spacecraft each acquired a series of far encounter images , composed of 704 lines consisting of 945 pixels each , as they approached the planet and a series of near encounter images ( same numbers of lines and pixels / line ) upon arrival .
The far encounter photos had resolutions ranging from 4 to 43 km per pixel , while the near encounter images had resolutions as good as 300 m per pixel .
In total , 143 far encounter images and 58 near encounter images were transmitted .
Due to advances in technology , Mariner 6 and 7 carried computers that could be reprogrammed from Earth during the mission and the probes were able to transmit data at a rate of almost 2000 times that of Mariner 4 .
These spacecraft were heavier than any planetary probes previously launched by NASA and they were carried into space by the Atlas - Centaur rocket .
Objectives
The probes were designed to concentrate entirely on Mars .
Measurements of atmospheric composition , pressure , density , and temperature were made and the radio- occultation experiment designed during the Mariner 4 mission was once again implemented .
Surface images of greater quality and quantity were hoped to provide a more complete picture of the Martian surface and , when combined with the atmospheric data , to allow planning for future missions in search of life on Mars .
A celestial mechanics experiment was also included in the mission , which , by analysis of the extremely accurate tracking data of the paths of the spacecraft , provided a precise measurement of the mass of Mars .
Finally , as long range interplanetary mission technology was still in its infancy , the missions provided valuable experience in the engineering and mission operations required for long - term flight away from the sun .
Results
In transit to Mars , likely due to a battery rupture , contact was temporarily lost with Mariner 7 on July 30 .
After a 7 - hour silence , contact was restored , but it soon became evident that the instrument responsible for reporting the orientation of the television cameras had been damaged and was no longer functioning .
Without this information the Mariner 7 cameras could not be pointed properly and , with the Mars encounter close at hand , a solution was needed quickly .
On August 1 , manual calibration by ground crews brought Mars into the view of Mariner 7 cameras and , on August 2 , Mariner 7 began to relay far encounter images of Mars .
The restoration of the Mariner 7 imaging system was a prime example of the expertise being developed by mission operators during these early interplanetary missions and the event stood as a testament to the importance of having a reprogammable computer on the spacecraft .
The mission was a complete success .
In total , 201 images of Mars were acquired ; the near encounter images covering about 10 % of the Martian surface .
In the near encounter sequences , the two spacecraft viewed different areas of the planet with Mariner 6 imaging a band from the equator to 10 o S , spanning 60 o W to 320 o W , and Mariner 7 imaging the edge of the polar cap at 60 o S , 0 o W as well as a band from 10 o N to 30 o S , spanning 20 o W to 105 o W .
The images essentially deflated any of the theories proposing the existence of artificial canals on the surface and the images also showed a lack of any correlation between geographical features and the light and dark areas seen by far encounter images and Earth based images .
The images still did not show the widely varied terrain that was hoped for , but later missions revealed the truth about the exciting surface of Mars .
Atmospheric experiments indicated the presence of dust suspended in the atmosphere , carbon dioxide ice and water ice clouds , carbon monoxide , ionized hydrogen , and ionized oxygen .
Among the species not detected were ozone and nitrogen ; both of which would have been beneficial to the existence of life similar to that on Earth .
Surface temperatures as warm as 280- 290K ( 290 K is about 17 o Celsius or 63 o Fahrenheit ) were detected near the equator , and it was found that , as one would expect , the darker areas of lower reflectance were generally warmer than the lighter colored deserts of higher reflectance .
The radio- occultation experiment reinforced the findings of Mariner 4 with atmospheric pressure falling between 3.8 to 7.0 millibars and this experiment also detected an ionosphere on only the sunlit side of the planet .
Mariner 9
Spacecraft Specifications
Detailed Information on the Spacecraft , Experiments , and Data Sets
Introduction
Originally , Mariner 9 was to have an identical companion , Mariner 8 , but on May 8 , 1971 , 365 seconds after launch , Mariner 8 's Centaur main engine shut down and the upper stage of the rocket , along with Mariner 8 , fell into the Atlantic about 560 km north of Puerto Rico .
Mariner 9 was the first of NASA 's Mars orbiters .
The spacecraft , which weighed more than Mariner 6 and 7 combined , was launched on May 30 , 1971 on top of an Atlas - Centaur launch vehicle .
After a journey of more than 600 million kilometers , Mariner 9 arrived in Mars orbit on November 14 , 1971 and began the most ambitious Mars exploration mission yet attempted .
Mariner 9 carried sophisticated instrumentation similar to that of Mariner 6 and 7 , but a larger propulsion system was required for controlling the spacecraft during its time in Mars orbit .
By the end of 349 days in Mars orbit , 7329 images ( including images of Mars ' two moons , Phobos and Deimos ) had been relayed back to Earth and a total of 54 billion bits of data had been transmitted .
Mariner 9 completely revolutionized our view of Mars and the information from this mission would later serve as the foundation for the Viking program .
Objectives
Mariner 9 was designed to provide the most complete view of Mars ever obtained with mission experiments similar to those of Mariner 6 and 7 .
Atmospheric structure , composition , density , and pressure were to be analyzed again using techniques similar to those used on previous Mariner Mars missions .
Mission goals were to map over 70 % of the Martain surface with resolutions ranging from 1 km per pixel to as good as 100 m per pixel during successive Mars orbits from an altitude of about 1,500 km .
The spacecraft would also look for signs of volcanic activity denoted by heat anomalies on the surface using infrared radiometry .
Mars ' two moons , Phobos and Deimos , were also to be analyzed by Mariner 9 .
Mariner 9 was essentially designed to refine the findings of previous missions and to take away the veil of uncertainty which had so far concealed the Martain surface .
Results
Mariner 9 far exceeded its expectations in every way .
Upon its arrival in November , the spacecraft was presented with a Martian atmosphere full of dust which obscured the view of the surface .
The opaqueness , explained as dust storms , of the Martian atmosphere had been previously observed from Earth during Martian southern hemisphere summers and now with Mariner 9 in orbit , the existence of these dust stroms was confirmed .
With a reprogrammable computer on board , Mariner 9 was kept in orbit until the dust began to settle out of the atmosphere and the systematic imaging of the planet 's surface began in January of 1972 .
The 7329 images , covering about 80 % of the planet , revealed the surface and atmosphere of Mars to be as varied as planetary scientists had hoped .
Some of the observed features included ancient river beds , craters , massive extinct volcanoes , canyons , layered polar deposits , evidence of wind - driven deposition and erosion of sediments , weather fronts , ice clouds , localized dust storms , morning fogs and more .
With evidence of flow features , and therefore the possibilty of a time when water was in liquid form on the surface of Mars , the question of the existence of life on Mars was intensified .
It was clear that Mars had brought about many more questions which a lander would be best suited to answer .
In addition to the vast array of images obtained , many other observations were made .
These observations included : a lack of evidence for volcanic activity , irregularities in Mars ' gravity field , properties of the daytime ionosphere , atmospheric pressures ranging from 2.8 to 10.3 mbar , measurements of atmospheric water vapor content , altitude measurements , detection of seasonal upper atmosphere ozone , and an ultraviolet spectrum of Phobos .
In total , 54 billion bits of data were relayed back to Earth by Mariner 9 .
For comparison , this was 27 times the amount of data retrieved by all previous Mariner Mars missions combined .
The results of the Mariner 9 mission paved the way for the Viking program .
Confirmation of atmospheric pressure allowed engineers to design the Viking landers for a safe descent , and the fantastic images and data retrieved fueled the fire for further Mars exploration .
The possibility of life on Mars was an irresistable mystery and , on August 20 , 1975 , the Viking program was launched with a variety of experiments ... including experiments designed to search for signs of Martian life .

Over the last few weeks ( since the passing of my grandmother ) , I ’ve spent a ton of time with my parents , who live about four hours away .
Because of these regular visits , I ’ve been able to see lots of little details about how they ’ve come to live their life since my father has retired .
Here ’s a recap : my parents have never earned a huge income .
While I was growing up , they taught me a lot of lessons about how to live frugally and conserve one ’s income ( lessons that I did n’t pick up on as well as I should have at the time ) , particularly with children .
Now that my father is retired , the two of them live on a fixed income , but they ’re still creative with the ways they save money .
Here are five nifty little ideas I ’ve witnessed over the last month .
Every day is a swap meet .
My parents are constantly giving things away : food , interesting little items they ’ve collected , and so on .
Giving things away ?
That seems like the opposite of being careful with your money .
The reason , though , is simple .
If my parents have something they do n’t really need for themselves , they ’re willing to give it away without hesitation to friends .
The friends see this generosity and know it , and are willing to be generous in return .
Thus , quite often , when my parents need something – their recent need for a crib for the upstairs bedroom is a great example – they just ask the people they know instead of hitting the store .
Sure , most of the exchanges they do are n’t exact , perfect exchanges in value .
I think they tend to give a lot more than they get .
But when you consider that they have no real need for most of the things they give away , it all makes a lot more sense – they get something of real value to them in return when they need it .
These exchanges help fuel their social network and saves them a ton of money over time .
It sounds like a good deal tome , and it ’s one that I try to emulate in my own life when I find good opportunities to do so .
They always cook far more food than they need .
Again , I wondered how this could possibly be frugal .
They cook so much that I often wonder how it does n’t go to waste .
It ’s actually very simple .
Almost every day for lunch and every other night or so for dinner , they simply have a leftover smorgasbord .
They take the things they each like , make a plate out of them , and there ’s the meal .
It goes further than that , though .
Let ’s say my parents are out and about in the middle of the day .
Lunchtime arrives and they ’re both hungry , but the temptation to eat out is much less because they always know there ’s something to eat at home that ’s very quick to prepare .
So , the flexibility of their leftovers reduces their spending on eating out .
It also helps them to be flexible in impromptu social situations .
If one of their grandchildren happens to be there for a meal , it ’s never a problem – there ’s always something on hand .
Often , they ’ll “ edit ” the original food – turning leftover turkey or chicken or pork into salad for sandwiches , using a soup or stew as the basis for a simple casserole , or re-spicing a bland food to make it taste substantially different .
In the end , though , is n’t there still food that goes to waste ?
Very rarely .
My mother does a very good job keeping leftovers appropriately rotated , sticking strongly to the “ three days and out ” rule .
If the food starts to get close to this line , she essentially requires that it be eaten , at the expense of other leftovers .
In other words , they do n’t fear the leftovers .
They embrace them , over and over again , and by embracing them , they find all sorts of ways to make them tasty and interesting .
Who cares what others think ?
To put it simply , my parents have long passed the point where they worry very much about what others think of them .
If someone looks down on them because of their life choices … to put it frankly , they just do n’t care .
This is n’t an excuse for rudeness to others – that ’s just not part of their nature .
Instead , it ’s a freedom to avoid keeping up with the Joneses in any way at all .
For example , every neighbor of theirs owns an ATV – and spends quite a bit of time driving them around , seeming to have quite a bit of fun .
Many of their friends have ATVs as well .
You might think that my father would be interested in having one so that he could drive around with them .
You ’d be wrong .
It does n’t interest him that much ( or my mother , for that matter ) , so , even though many of his friends and neighbors all have nice ATVs to drive around on , they do n’t .
And they do n’t mind at all .
If everyone around me has a shiny new gadget , all I have to do is think about my parents shaking their head at the ATV usage around them , and then simply ask myself if I want one .
In the end , when you ’re falling asleep at night , it ’s not the conscience of your peers that rattles around inside of you .
Invest the windfalls in your life .
My grandmother left behind a life insurance policy with my mother as the beneficiary .
Instead of looking at this windfall as an opportunity to spend , their thoughts immediately look towards investing it in the infrastructure in their life .
The first step is to replace their seriously ailing car with a newer model of the same type , giving them a stable vehicle for their purposes .
Their second step is to pay off a bit of additional debt .
The rest ?
Right in the bank to serve as an emergency fund .
There are no special purchases in the mix at all , aside from an already - scheduled summer vacation with us .
This is actually quite a bit different than how things were when I was growing up .
When I was younger , my parents had a much stronger tendency to just spend any windfalls that came their way .
We went on at least a couple vacations funded by windfalls , and I remember lots of video games and other things purchased by windfalls , too .
What changed ?
I think my parents realized at some point that a stable and healthy day - to - day financial state is better than having a rush of fun when a windfall comes in , followed by worries about personal finances .
Perhaps it coincided with my father ’s retirement , or maybe my perspective as a child was skewed .
Regardless , my parents have provided a living , breathing example of how to maturely use a windfall .
Prepare for the moments you care the most about .
My mother seems to almost live for visits from her grandchildren .
She plans all kinds of little things for my own kids , doing things like bringing out bowls of M&Ms ( my son ’s favorite little treat ) and producing all kinds of little fun things to do .
My mom does this so well because she thinks about it in advance .
She keeps her eyes open for big sales on specific items – M&Ms , bubble solution , and other such things – and picks them up whenever they ’re on sale .
Then she keeps them in her bedroom and waits for moments when the grandchildren are there , bringing them out for a great , enthusiastic surprise .
As busy as my wife and I are – as busy as we all seem to be – it ’s often really easy to just go with the moment .
Unfortunately , doing that often results in a lot of extra expense – and you ’re often lacking the item you wish you had when you need it .
Instead , I ’ve started to look for a handful of specific items myself when they ’re on sale – drawing paper , washable crayons , my son ’s favorite granola bars , V8 Fusion – and simply stock up when the price is really low on those items , without worrying whether or not we already have some on hand .
Why ?
So that on a lazy Saturday afternoon , I can get out a granola bar and a cup of my son ’s favorite juice , spread drawing paper all over the kitchen table , and draw to our heart ’s content .
Those are the moments that I want to share with my children – and by knowing this and preparing in advance , I can save quite a bit of money and also make the moment itself easier .
Here ’s the real message : your life provides you with plenty of great examples for how to live a stable , healthy , and happy financial life .
Look around , keep your eyes open , and listen – and you may discover many , many great ways to live .
Say “ Hawaii ” and most people think beautiful beaches , tropical drinks with paper umbrellas and surfers .
Hawaii is all that , plus some of the most interesting and poignant historical sites found anywhere in America .
The top five historical sites in Hawaii mark both human achievements and human tragedies .
1. USS Arizona Memorial , Honolulu , Oahu
More than 1.5 million people visit the USS Arizona Memorial each year .
The solemn memorial was built over the site where the battleship USS Arizona sank with all its crew in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th , 1941 .
Dedicated in 1962 , the site became a U.S. National Park Service area in 1980 .
The center offers interpretive programs , including a documentary film about the attack and the boat trip to the memorial .
2. Kalaupapa National Historical Park , Moloka’i
Kalaupapa marks two tragedies of Hawaiian history : the forced removal of indigenous people in 1865 and 1895 , and the forced isolation of people suffering from leprosy , also known as Hansen ’s disease .
The first episode broke ties with the land that had existed for 900 years .
The second broke apart both families and the spirits of some sufferers until the arrival of Father Damien ( Joseph De Veuster ) , who restored dignity and worth to Molokai ’s victims .
Established in 1980 , the park provides the physical setting for these stories .
3. Kaloko - Honokohau National Historical Park , Kona Coast , Hawai’i
This park was established in 1978 to preserve and interpret traditional Hawaiian culture and practices .
Some 45,000 visitors annually take in its impressive sights .
Comprised of 1,160 acres , Kaloko - Honokvhau NHP includes the site of an ancient Hawaiian settlement containing parts of four different ahupua`a , or traditional sea to mountain land divisions .
The park protects examples of heiau ( religious site ) , ki`i pvhaku ( petroglyphs ) , hvlua ( stone slide ) , and kahua ( house site platforms ) .
4. Royal Hawaiian residences , Oahu .
Not many people know that Hawaii was once a sovereign nation governed by a royal family .
Iolani Palace State Monument in Honolulu and Queen Emma ’s Summer Palace , just outside of Honolulu , mark this royal past .
Iolani Palace was the official residence of Hawaii ’s last monarch , Queen Liliuokalani , and even served for a time as her prison when the monarchy was overthrown .
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places , Queen Emma ’s Summer Palace is actually a frame Victorian house with a colonnade .
Queen Emma , the wife of Kamehameha IV , inherited the house from her uncle , John Young II .
Her home has been restored to resemble a 19th century with gardens , furnishings and accessories and artifacts of the Hawaiian royal family .
5. Battleship Missouri Memorial , Oahu .
“ The Mighty Mo , ” as she ’s called , has literally carried history on her decks .
Commissioned in 1944 , the Iowa - class Missouri was built for firepower , which she delivered from her massive guns in the battles of Iowa Jima , Okinawa and the Korean War.
Japan surrendered to the United States aboard the Missouri .
She was decommissioned in 1955 , but after extensive refurbishment , the Mighty Mo was brought out of retirement in 1986 .
In 1991 she was deployed in the Persian Gulf , where she launched Tomahawk missiles during Operation Desert Storm .
Her last mission came Dec. 7 , 1991 , when she led a contingent of ships into Pearl Harbor to mark the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack that brought America into World War II .
She was finally retired in 1996 .

Will the creation of a new society be shaped by the example we set in our lives today ?
AT THE Left Forum in New York City in April , anarchist Harjit Singh Gill spoke on a panel on prefigurative politics ( Gill 's presentation can be watched on YouTube ) .
He began by quoting a column I wrote for SocialistWorker.org called " Refusing to be ruled over " :
Anarchism makes the error of believing that the means to achieving a classless , stateless society must prefigure the end result .
Thus , if we want to achieve a society based on free association , without coercion and without bureaucratic centralism , we must build forms of organization today that prefigure the future society .
Mr. Gill followed this up with a comment that drew hearty laughter from the audience :
If you remove the [ word ] " error , " it 's the best definition I 've ever heard of what I think needs to happen , and how we 're actually going to do this .
Because I 'm like , well , wait -- you want to build a bureaucratic , statist system built on coercion to get to one that is n't ?
To make his point , Gill noted that parents who want their children to behave in a certain way must be models of that behavior , because as everyone knows , " Do as I say , not as I do " does n't work very well .
" Why would it work any differently in politics ? "
Columnist : Paul D’Amato Paul D'Amato is managing editor of the International Socialist Review and author of The Meaning of Marxism , a lively and accessible introduction to the ideas of Karl Marx and the tradition he founded .
Paul can be contacted at [ email protected ] .
According to Gill , the starting point for determining what kind of activity we should engage in must be these questions :
What would we like anarchism to look like ?
What do we want our classless future society to look like ?
He adds , " We 're ultimately trying to build this world we want to see . "
To be fair to myself , I wrote more on this question than that :
One does not expect the plow to prefigure the wheat ; nor should we expect our methods of organizing to fight for a better world to prefigure or look exactly like the world we plan to achieve .
The confusion comes in believing that a new society is established by the example we set by how we live today , whereas in reality , a new society must be built by millions of people engaged in struggle before such a new world can be erected .
Frederick Engels , writing in the late 1870s during a battle in the First International with the followers of anarchist Mikhail Bakunin , criticized the idea that the International should " be the nucleus of the future human society " :
Just now , when we have to defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal , the proletariat is told to organize not in accordance with the requirements of the struggle it is daily and hourly compelled to wage , but according to the vague notions of a future society entertained by some dreamers .
Let us try to imagine what our own German organization would look like according to this pattern .
Instead of fighting the government and the bourgeoisie , it would meditate on whether each paragraph of our General Rules and each resolution passed by the Congress represented the true image of a future society .
Belief in the absolute freedom of each and every member of the International would lead to reactionary and dangerous results , argued Engels .
According to the principle of no hierarchy or authority , the Prussian police could enter the organization in order to wreck it , but any attempt to expel them would amount to authoritarian and hierarchical heresy .
In reading this , I am reminded of Victor Serge 's account in Revolution in Danger of the anarchist group in the Russian city of Petrograd in 1919 , which found counterrevolutionary
White infiltrators in its ranks , intent on blowing them all up , and ended up releasing them .
The veteran anarchist who let them go did so because , by Serge 's account , he was horrified by the idea that he , who had spent his life in prison fighting authority , would have to imprison or execute anyone else .
" If it had occurred at all frequently , " Serge writes , " such magnanimity would have meant the suicide of the revolution . "
Clearly , in revolution its participants are forced to engage in certain behavior that in no way resembles " the world we want to see . "
GILL EXPLAINS that he came to prefigurative politics through John Holloway , author of Change the World Without Taking Power .
To get a sense of what Gill and Holloway mean by prefigurative politics , I 'll quote Holloway himself :
It has been said that the transition from capitalism to communism , as opposed to the transition from feudalism to capitalism , would not be able to develop in the interstices of the old society ; that there was no way in which communism could grow inside the structure of capitalism .
This idea was based on the concept of the revolution as a Great Event ...
This ignores the fact that the revolution is inconceivable unless what not yet exists already exists , and exists , in contradictory and antagonistic form , in the alternative sociability that is so deeply rooted in the routines of our lives , in the love , in the friendship , in the solidarity , in a million forms of cooperation , in everything that we have learned of what the Zapatistas call Dignity .
The elaboration of these embryonic forms of direct sociability constitutes the process of the revolution .
Revolution is , according to Holloway , creating in the " interstices " of the system alternative ways of living and relating to each other .
It would be far more pleasant not to have to " deal with capital on capital 's own terms " ( to quote Holloway again ) , but sadly , this is impossible .
In the end , the capitalist system must be reckoned with , that is challenged , not by piecemeal experiments , but in and through a revolutionary " event . "
Such an event does n't emerge out of nowhere , but comes as the culmination of a series of partial struggles in which workers develop the confidence and consciousness to pose an alternative to the social crises of the system .
The solidarity of the working class and the oppressed , born of struggle , is a key component in the success of the struggle , and in the shape of any future society .
But this is not the same as seeing " alternative sociability " as a way to resist capitalism .
In the course of class and social struggles , there are definite actions that working - class and social movements must take that do not prefigure the future society .
On the most basic level , workers ' struggles require some lying and subterfuge toward employers and the state that defends them .
There will be no chance that Wal - Mart will ever be unionized without the ability of workers , for example , to work clandestinely , which must involve lying .
The success of the Flint sit - down strike hinged upon creating a decoy that deceived GM management and the police about which plant was about to be occupied .
Without this lying and deception , the strike would have failed .
The same holds true for another non-prefigurative means -- violence .
Flint workers ' use of metal hinges and frozen water to defend themselves against police efforts to break their factory occupation had a role in their eventual victory .
Our history is full of examples of workers being forced to defend themselves with whatever weapons were on hand against the armed attacks of company thugs , private guards , police , militia and troops .
The same goes for the struggle for racial equality .
Leon Trotsky , the Marxist that anarchists love to hate , put it well :
That the aim of socialism is the elimination of force , first in its crudest and bloodiest forms , and then in other more covert ones , is indisputable .
But here we are dealing not with the manners and morals of a future communist society , but with the concrete paths and methods of struggle against capitalist force .
When fascists disrupt a strike , seize a newspaper 's editorial offices and its safe , and beat up and kill workers ' deputies , while the police encircle the thugs with a protective ring , then only the most corrupt hypocrite would advise workers not to reply blow for blow , on the pretext that force would have no place in a communist system .
Obviously , in each particular case , it is necessary to decide , with respect to the whole situation how to answer the enemy 's force , and just how far to go in one 's retaliation .
But that is a matter of tactical expediency which has nothing to do with the acknowledgement or denial of force in principle .
THERE CERTAINLY must be a thread that connects the current struggle with its final goal .
For example , an elected strike committee can , in certain circumstances , develop into a mass , democratic organ of control when it unites with other committees and forms a system of workers ' councils ( as happened in Russia in 1917 , Germany in 1919 and Hungary in 1956 , among other examples ) .
And in general , mass struggle helps to create in people the capacity to run society , by building their confidence and breaking down the divisions of racism , sexism and nationalism .
But it would be suicidal to forget that the old order cannot simply be wished away or presented with organizations that prefigure the future society , for such organizations would be incapable of mounting a challenge to capitalism .
For Marxists , the means must lead to the desired end .
As such , forms of organization that tend to weaken , divide or treat the working class as a passive stage army are to be rejected .
Hence , socialists reject individual terrorism or any acts by small groups that substitute themselves for the mass action of workers themselves .
Trotsky put it this way :
When we say that the end justifies the means , then for us , the conclusion follows that the great revolutionary end spurns those base means and ways which set one part of the working class against other parts , or attempt to make the masses happy without their participation ; or lower the faith of the masses in themselves and their organization , replacing it by worship for the " leaders . "
Primarily and irreconcilably , revolutionary morality rejects servility in relation to the bourgeoisie and haughtiness in relation to the toilers -- that is , those characteristics in which petty bourgeois pedants and moralists are thoroughly steeped .
There is some contradiction between means and ends in the struggle because we are attempting to move from a society founded on exploitation and violence to one with neither .
Therefore , transitional forms of action and organization are necessary that must at least in some way mirror what we are fighting against rather than what we are fighting for .
As Trotsky once noted , to inflict blows on each other 's opposing armies must have some symmetry .
The end of slavery as a result of the American Civil War was not prefigured by the weaponry of the North , which was almost identical to the weaponry of the South .
That does not mean , of course , that means cannot come to overshadow and defeat the ends they were meant to achieve .
Certainly , the plow is necessary to grow wheat .
But if the plow is too big and the soil too rough , the wheat may not grow .
If the violence and coercion common to all revolutions is not subordinated to mass institutions of democratic control from below , a revolution can come to grief , as the Russian Revolution showed most clearly .
To quote the late British Marxist Tony Cliff , " the plow alone will not produce the wheat . "

How to create a sliding popup like the one used at SitePoint using jQuery .
Background
This week , our web ninja needed to add to advertise a survey on the main Uniblue site .
Not wanting to have an annoying popup ( which would most likely be blocked or ignored ) or an overlay ( which would interrupt the user ) , she decided to go for a sliding popup , which is about as unobtrusive as you can get while still being visible .
The script she located and used had some problems ; IE6 detection was not working properly , and while the script was supposed to set itself so it would not be shown more than once to a given user , this was not actually happening .
Finally , it was blowing up when used in conjunction with other scripts in the page .
While she did manage to fix all these items , the script itself was pretty overcomplicated for what it does .
This post deals with building a similar feature using jQuery .
Linking jQuery
Like most javascript frameworks , jQuery can be pretty hefty .
Google have kindly decided to host a number of such frameworks though , so you can actually link to them .
Not only will this save you bandwidth , but it also means that the framework is probably already cached somewhere handy .
This means that it gets served to the user much more quickly .
To link to Google ’s hosted framework , you can use the URL http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.1/jquery.min.js.
Visit http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/ for details of other hosted frameworks .
Calling the popup
We need to call the popup at some point if we want to display it .
A good place for this is in the ready ( ) hook provided by jQuery :
1 : $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { 2 : CreatePopup ( " popup.html " , 200 , 1500 , " testpopup " , 5 ) ; 3 : } ) ;
The first argument is the url to the file containing the … um … contents of the popup .
The second specifies the height of the popup when the popup is fully open , while the third specifies the amount of time , in milliseconds , that it will take the popup to extend completely .
In this case , 1500 means that it will take the popup 1.5 seconds to open to its full size .
The last two arguments are related to the cookie which the popup sets .
We ’re creating one so that we do n’t keep showing the popup every time the user goes into the page .
Instead , we store a cookie for a number or days , so that a popup would only ever be shown once .
The fourth argument , above , will be the name of the cookie , while the last one is the number of days we will allow the cookie to live .
In other words , we ’re going to set a cookie called “ testpopup ” for 5 days .
The popup
The popup will need to be displayed from various pages , since there can be multiple entry points to a site .
For this reason , it will be stored in a separate html document , which we will reference from our script .
We can do this using jQuery ’s get ( url , callback ) function , which lets us make a request , and fire a callback when that request is received
Creating the popup
The popup is created by inserting an div element at the end of the body , and positioning it under the visible area of the page using fixed css positioning .
By specifying a negative value for bottom , we place the element just beneath the visible area .
We use –height , so the top of the div is just below the fold :
Script
1 : var popup = $ ( " < div > " + data + " </div > " ) 2 : .attr({ " id " : " sliding_popup " }) 3 : .css ({ " bottom " : - 1 * height} ) 4 : .height ( height ) 5 : .hide ( ) 6 : .appendTo( " body " ) ;
CSS
1 : #sliding_popup { 2 : position : fixed ; 3 : left : 0 px ; 4 : display : block ; 5 : width : 100 % ; 6 : padding : 0 px ; 7 : margin : 0 px ; 8 : }
We can then use the animate ( ) method in jQuery to alter the value to 0 , which brings the bottom of the div flush with the bottom of the visible area :
1 : popup.show ( ) .animate ( { bottom : 0 } , duration ) ;
Removing the popup
We want the user to be able to close the popup .
To do this , we provide a function which hides the div , and then removes it from the DOM :
1 : $ ( " #sliding_popup " ) .animate ( { 2 : bottom : $ ( " #sliding_popup " ) . height ( ) * - 1 3 : } , 4 : duration , 5 : function ( ) { 6 : $ ( " #sliding_popup " ) .remove ( ) ; 7 : } ) ;
We ’re calling the DOM removal from the callback to the animate function .
This lets us wait until the animation is finished before we actually remove the element .
This function can be called from within the popup itself by accessing the parent object , like so :
1 : DestroyPopup( 1000 ) ;
IE6 ?
I see no IE6 !
As any designer , developer , and their pets will tell you , IE6 is not so much a browser as a royal pain in the wotzits .
Sure , it ’s an improvement over IE4 , but that was way back before the earth cooled down and the dinosaurs died out .
Today , we expect a little bit more cooperation from our browsers .
No , I do n’t like IE6 very much .
In fact , the script does not support it , period .
I can live with that because few of the people who read this blog actually use IE6 ( precisely 5 people , according to Google Analytics – you know who you are . )
Since uniblue.com is a front facing website , our friend was n’t so lucky and had to try and hammer the script into compliance – not a pretty sight .
Eventually , she settled for a standard popup for IE6 , and the nice slidy animated one for real browsers .
Given that the percentage of IE6 users is fairly low there , this is a reasonable compromise – it gets the job done , and does n’t involve drawing magic circles in goat blood and urine all over your nice clean office floor .
If you want to pull a similar trick with this script ( or make it work with IE6 ) you can always check for it using the IsUnsupported Browser function and handle accordingly .
Kitchens to Go
Art Basel attendees might want to check out Dornbracht ‘s Global Street Food exhibition on display through Friday at the Vitra Design Museum .
First shown at IMM Cologne last January , the exhibition presents improvised portable kitchens from around the world , including a Vietnamese market boat , a Sudanese tea stand , and an Argentinian charcuterie cart ( yum ) made from a bulletin board balanced on a shopping cart ( hmm ) .
It was curated by Mike Meiré , the Berlin - based art director of 032c magazine ( of “ the new ugly ” movement ) and Dornbracht ’s creative and brand director .
In a press release , Meire asks , “ Can we manage to create a complete kitchen in two square meters ? ”
Looks like it !

Researchers Find Massive Botnet On Nearly 2 Million Infected Consumer , Business , Government PCs
More than 70 government - owned domains hit , and nearly half of the overall infections are in the U.S .
Researchers have discovered a major botnet operating out of the Ukraine that has infected 1.9 million machines , including large corporate and government PCs mainly in the U.S .
The botnet , which appears to be larger than the infamous Storm botnet was in its heyday , has infected machines from some 77 government - owned domains -- 51 of which are U.S. government ones , according to Ophir Shalitin , marketing director of Finjan , which recently found the botnet .
Shalitin says the botnet is controlled by six individuals and is hosted in Ukraine .
Aside from its massive size and scope , what is also striking about the botnet is what its malware can do to an infected machine .
The malware lets an attacker read the victim 's email , communicate via HTTP in the botnet , inject code into other processes , visit Websites without the user knowing , and register as a background service on the infected machine , for instance .
The bots communicate with their command and control systems via HTTP .
Botnet expert Joe Stewart says it appears to be similar to other downloader - type botnets .
" It looks a lot like other downloader bots out there , " says Stewart , director of malware research for SecureWorks .
" It has a system for installing other malware and getting paid for it .
The first stage is to get the bot piece onto the machine , and then they get paid to install other malware . "
Finjan says victims are infected when visiting legitimate Websites containing a Trojan that the company says is detected by only four of 39 anti-malware tools , according to a VirusTotal report run by Finjan researchers .
" We do n't have our hands on the actual [ stolen ] data , but we can tell a lot of what they [ may be ] doing with it by the malware , " Shalitin says .
" They can use it for spam , [ stealing data ] , and almost almost anything . "
Around 45 percent of the bots are in the U.S. , and the machines are Windows XP .
Nearly 80 percent run Internet Explorer ; 15 percent , Firefox ; 3 percent , Opera ; and 1 percent Safari .
Finjan says the bots were found in banks and large corporations , as well as consumer machines .
Shalitin says it appears that the botnet operators may be buying and selling bots or portions of their botnet based on a communique Finjan discovered on an underground black - hat hacker forum in Russia .

BAGHDAD  A suicide truck bomb exploded in a volatile region of northern Iraq on Saturday , killing at least 68 people and wounding nearly 200 more , even as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki pledged that attacks like it would not stop or slow the withdrawal of American troops .
Also on Saturday , the British government said the bodies of two men , believed to be among five Britons kidnapped by Shiite militants in 2007 , had been turned over to British authorities in Baghdad .
The truck bombing , the worst single attack this year in Iraq , occurred shortly after noon prayers in a residential neighborhood near a mosque in Taza , a town south of Kirkuk , the capital of an oil - rich region that lies on the tense ethnic fault line between Iraq ’s Arabs and Kurds , according to officials and witnesses .
The force of the blast gouged a crater in the ground and badly damaged dozens of homes , burying victims in the rubble , people and officials at the scene said , expressing fear that the death toll would rise even more .
“ Who the hell is interupting my kung fu ? ! ”
One side benefit of the busy , slightly weird and somewhat fouled - up time I ’ve been having at the Los Angeles Film Festival is that I ’ve only had time to watch films I ’ve especially wanted to see .
That ’s prevented the joy ( so far ) of making an unexpected discovery , which is definitely part of the fun of film festivals .
On the other hand , I ’ve liked all the films I ’ve seen ( so far ) .
“ Black Dynamite , ” a spoof of the seventies blaxsploitation genre , is one I ’ve been wanting to see since the filmmakers ’ commendably aggressive PR people sent me a trailer — and a very cool ( but inexpensively seventies - esque ) t- shirt — a couple of years back via my personal blog .
Fortunately , the wait , the slog through Hollywood traffic on the somewhat spooky evening of Michael Jackson ’s death ( not as bad as it could have been , actually ) , and even some technical problems on the first attempt to run through the film all proved to be very much worth it .
Directed by Scott Sanders and co-written with actor and martial artist Michael Jai White ( “ Spawn , ” “ The Dark Knight “ ) , this is just your basic story of a superhuman ex-CIA agent , able to take out a roomful of bad guys and satisfy a roomful of women , who sets out to avenge the death of his brother , stop the scourge of hard drugs at orphanages , and also deal with a brand of malt liquor that turns out to have a truly disturbing side effect .
The brilliance of Sanders and White ’s approach here is the faithfulness they maintain to their source material while sending it up shamelessly .
It happily exaggerates the cinematic flaws of actual blaxsploitation and its often unbelievable plots and absurd dialogue , taking several increasingly silly turns as the film unspools , but always with a completely straight face and an apparent complete lack of irony .
The approach propels the comedy far further than less disciplined spoofs .
In a video interview conducted with writer David Poland after its debut at Sundance , Scott Sanders said he and White approached it not so much as a movie starring Michael Jai White as Black Dynamite and directed by Sanders , but a movie featuring Michael Jai White playing seventies - era ex-football player Ferante Jones playing Black Dynamite , and directed by Sanders “ playing ” a seventies director .
We know we ’re in good hands early on , when a ghetto criminal type is accused of being a mole , and denies his subterfuge in a theatrical quasi-English accent , sealing his doom .
A bit later , a boom mike falls into frame “ Dolemite ” style .
White / Jones / Dynamite , we slowly realize , is trying a bit too hard to ignore the mistake and finally can’t resist checking on the mike out of the corner of his eye — and no one ’s yelling “ cut . ”
Lest you think this is in any way subtle , the silliness level increases exponentially as the action continues and arguably goes one ( still funny ) bridge too far in the final action sequence — but the dead serious attitude winds up fueling the almost Mel Brooksian frequency of the jokes , even while some in - jokes may fly by the uninitiated .
I ’m sure I missed some of the deeper blaxsploitation references , since I ’m still a fairly casual fan of the genre .
I definitely caught a running gag that non-Angelenos may miss , relating to the venerable L.A. soul food chain , Roscoe ’s Chicken and Waffles and its fictional precursor , Roscoe ’s Chili and Donuts .
The film is competent in very much the same ways as many of the films of the period — and perhaps just a bit more than some , particularly in terms of fight choreography .
Anyone whose seen
White ’s deleted fight with the late David Carradine from “ Kill Bill : Volume 2 ” knows the massively proportioned actor is also a first - rate martial artist , and White — giving the kind of make - or - break comic / mock serious performance that should be Oscar nominated but never , ever will be — and Sanders do a superb job of making his skill serve the comedy rather than distracting from it .
All in all , this is first rate movie spoofery that I hope will appeal to a fairly wide audience , but will obviously hold a special charm for film dorks .
It may not hit the same mass appeal notes as “ Airplane , ” but this is probably the closest and most successful comic recreation of a bygone movie style since Mel Brooks captured the look and feeling of classic - era Universal monster movies so beautifully in “ Young Frankenstein . ”
I could go on about this , but I fear I ’m not really conveying how this actually works .
What you see below might do better .
1 . Save the script which adds the keys for all your PPA repos :
2. Chmod the script to 775 .
To do this , navigate to where the script was extracted and paste this in a terminal :
chmod 775 launchpad-update
3. Create a new file , " /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05 ppa " ( file 05 ppa which should be located in /etc/ apt / apt.conf.d ) and put this in it :
APT :: Update :: Pre-Invoke { " if [ - x /usr/local/bin/launchpad-update ] ; then /usr/local/bin/launchpad-update ; fi " ; } ;
This will help you get rid of errors such as :

This will help you get rid of errors such as :
Some time ago we wrote about a script to automatically install launchpad PPA GPG keys for all your repositories but you needed to run that script each time you would add a new PPA repository .
But now thanks to a SourceGuru tip , you can have this script run automatically each time you do an update ( apt - get update ) .
Download it , extract and put it in / usr / local / bin ( or any other place , it 's just an example but if you do n't place it there , be sure to also modify the path in the next steps ) .
Obama Still Inactive on Gay Rights
By Ben Cohen
Andrew Sullivan and Anderson Cooper discuss President Obama 's tortoise like movement on Gay Rights :
I especially enjoy how the author cries about being persecuted for his beliefs while calling Kirk Cameron a loon out of the other side of his mouth .
Listening to the Atheist community whine about how they are treated rings kind of hollow after reading internet message boards where they relentlessly attack christian beliefs .
The whole thing makes me want to go back to church , but they 're just saying the same stupid stuff about atheists .
Point taken .
Indeed , I 'm pretty wary of the mock - the - Christians genre of atheist blog posts myself ( not that I am totally innocent of this ) .
So perhaps it 's not fair to call him a loon , or ( hypothetically ) malicious , deceptive , or stupid .
Christians are self - righteous morons .
Vjack is an arrogant imbecile who should not be allowed to blog at all .
There has long been disagreement among atheists about how best to balance our criticism of religion with our desire to end anti-atheist bigotry .
On the surface , it seems like we are trying to have it both ways ( i.e. , we get to criticize religion but you can't insult atheism without being called a bigot ) .
Yet , we do not have to dig far beneath the surface to expose this as a false dichotomy .
The crux of the matter was recently summarized by a commenter , Eric , on Paul Fidalgo 's blog as follows : Essentially , Paul was taken to task for expressing opposition to anti-atheist bigotry while criticizing Kirk Cameron 's idiocy .
However , Eric also raised the larger and more important question of how atheists can oppose bigotry directed at themselves while apparently engaging in the same directed at Christian beliefs .
Paul acknowledged Eric 's point and took a swipe at those of us who regularly make a point out of mocking absurd beliefs , Christian or otherwise :
He then made an important distinction between criticizing one 's beliefs and " outright persecution or dehumanization . "
He correctly notes that there is a world of difference between his reference to Kirk Cameron as a " loon " and what Cameron and other Christian extremists seek to accomplish .
However , Paul then loses me completely when he says , Paul has been criticized for this post .
Personally , I see pointing out the problems associated with irrational belief to be both a right and a responsibility .
When Cameron introduces gibberish into the discourse , he deserves to be called on it .
Paul agrees with this but says that the line should be drawn at mockery .
I 'd argue that if the statements warrant mockery , they should receive it .
Regardless , it seems that atheists are saying that they should be immune to mockery while the religious are fair game .
But is this really what atheists are saying ?
Remember that bigotry involves two components : falsehood and unwarranted generalization .
Describing Kirk Cameron as a " loon " is not a generalization at all ( I 'd argue that it is also not a falsehood , but let 's set that aside for now ) .
On the other hand , statements along the lines of " All Christians are ... " necessarily involve a generalization .
Take this for a test drive .
Here we have an untrue generalization and thus bigotry .
I may not like this , but it is not a generalization of any sort and thus does not qualify as bigotry .
Criticism ?
Sure .
Personal insult ?
Absolutely .
But not bigotry .
If we in the atheist community are saying that we should not be criticized , then we are certainly trying to have it both ways because we have been very critical of Christian beliefs .
However , this is not at all what I see us doing .
I see us opposing anti-atheist bigotry and discrimination .
What I do not see us doing , at least not most of us , is engaging in anti-Christian bigotry or discrimination .
This is an entirely different statement with little actual relevance to the present discussion .
I suspect that some atheists would agree with this statement .
I cannot begin to tell you how many times I 've been told something about flies , honey , and vinegar .
Frankly , I do n't care for any of these things .
But seriously , this is a different discussion and not one that should be mixed up with terms such as " bigotry " or " discrimination . "
OTTAWA – Programming on the Internet or on mobile devices has again escaped federal regulation .
The Canadian Radio- Television and Telecommunication Commission ruled today that it will not regulate new media broadcasts , upholding a decision from 1999 .
In other words , no Canadian content rules for the web , no new funds for Canadian productions , and no need to license the companies that distribute these programs .
The commission said it simply sees no need to encourage Canadian creation on the Internet .
It said new media broadcasting has still not produced a solid business model that would support government rules .
" While broadcasting in new media is growing in importance , we do not believe that regulatory intervention is necessary at this time , " said commission chairman Konrad von Finckenstein .
" We found that the Internet and mobile services are acting in a complementary fashion to the traditional broadcasting system .
Any intervention on our part would only get in the way of innovation . "
The creative end of the broadcasting biz – actors , directors and independent producers – had pressed for regulations , arguing that without them Canadian content would be swamped on the Internet .
They lobbied for the creation of a new media fund , paid for with levies from the cable and telephone companies .
Heritage Minister James Moore acknowledged the concerns earlier this spring when he unveiled the new $ 134 - million Canadian Media Fund , putting television and new media productions in the same envelope for the first time .
The regulator , though , did not see the need for another fund .
Ken Englehart , vice - president of regulatory affairs for Rogers Communications , said he was pleased with the ruling .
" The reason the Internet has been so powerful and changed so much of our lives is because it has n't been regulated and has n't been taxed , and it 's been allowed to grow and develop in ways that users wanted it to grow , " Englehart said .
" Government regulation and taxation would slow us down . "
Although the commission is steering away from regulations , it is taking some related action .
It will ask the Federal Court of Appeals to rule on whether new media broadcasts fall under the Broadcasting Act .
And it will begin asking Internet broadcasters to provide regular information on their operations .
How exactly that will happen will be the subject of another consultation .
There will be no re-examination of the new media issue for five years .
Commissioner Timothy Denton submitted a lengthy concurring opinion , saying the agency should abandon the whole issue of Internet regulation .
" The rights of Canadians to talk and communicate across the Internet are vastly too important to be subjected to a scheme of government licensing , " wrote Fenton , a former lawyer for the Canadian Association of Internet Providers .

" If more Canadians were aware how close their communications have come to being regulated by this commission , not by our will , but because we administer an obsolete statute ( the Broadcasting Act ) , they would be rightly concerned . "
The regulators supported an idea floated by the National Film Board and others for a national digital strategy .
With society more and more of dependent on digital devices and digital signals , the commission said the implications in areas such as copyright , privacy , taxation and spectrum management are so important they need to be part of a comprehensive government approach .
Producers and performers have already struggled with broadcasters over the subject of digital rights – what happens when their work is retransmitted over the Internet .
Creating what will no doubt be a future inductee to out Tribute to Fallen Sodas , World Of Warcraft and Mountain Dew have finally teamed up for a pair of soft drink variants .
The announcement for these new sodas actually came out a while back , however you can now find the new drinks in stores .
The highly caffeinated soft drink is being released in two special WoW themed flavors : Alliance Blue ( otherwise known as a wild fruit flavor ) and Horde Red ( basically a citrus cherry flavor ) .
Early reports are that the duo are pretty tasty , although the Horde Red variant comes across a lot like the Halo Game Fuel version of the soda .
Yeah , this is probably little more than a different sticker on a rehashed bottle of soda .
But if your account has n’t been hacked and you ’re still playing WoW , it ’s a tasty beverage to have handy .
And even if you ’re not a World of Warcraft fan , you might want to check these out .
I know I ’m going to buy a case of these and save them to drink for when The Old Republic comes out .
And I can identify at least one other fan of the drinks :
In the epic battle between Man and Nature , Neko Case ’s allegiance is clear .
On her 2004 live album , The Tigers Have Spoken , she sings on the title track about a captured tiger : “ They shot the tiger on his chain / in the field behind the cages / he walked in circles ’ til he was crazy / and he lived that way forever . ”
On 2006 ’s Fox Confessor Brings The Flood , Case tries to save a bird from certain death in “ Maybe Sparrow . ”
The empathy continues on the new Middle Cyclone , both for man-eaters on “ People Got A Lot Of Nerve ” —
“ You know they call them ‘ killer ’ whales / but you seemed surprised when it pinned you down to the bottom of the tank ” — and nature in general on “ This Tornado Loves You . ”
It all goes to show that Case is fascinated by what ca n’t be tamed , which her own rootless life has undoubtedly influenced .
She moved around as a child , and has called a few places home over the past decade — Seattle , Chicago , Tucson .
Even now that she ’s purchased a 100 - acre farm in Vermont — where she spent time as a child — Case remains unfettered :
She ’ll spend most of the next two years on the road .
She recently spoke to The A.V. Club about making her new album , and how dream dictionaries are bullshit .

The A.V. Club : How much did Fox Confessor raise your profile ?
It seems like you ’re playing bigger venues on this upcoming tour .
Neko Case : I think that ’s pretty much the difference .
I do n’t think I ’ve noticed anything else .
I mean , everything is kind of the same to me .
It ’s all the same job .
There ’s the same things to worry about .
It ’s just there are more people , which is nice .
I mean , that ’s ultimately the goal .
Advertisement
AVC : Confessor sold significantly more than your previous records , right ?
NC : Yeah , I think so .
I ’m guessing .
I do n’t really pay attention to that stuff very much .
I ’m kind of bad for questions like that .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you ever listen to the earlier records ?
NC : Very rarely .
AVC : Can you listen to yourself comfortably ?
NC : Not usually , no .
AVC : Do you just hear the mistakes , or what could ’ve been ?
NC : Well , yeah .
I mean , hopefully when you ’re making records , you develop , and so you hear the things you want to move away from .
It stings a little , but you know , you gotta own it too .
You ’ve got to just go , “ You know , I was n’t afraid to learn in front of people , so I give myself a little credit for not being afraid of anything . ”
Advertisement
AVC : How much do you usually write in the studio ?
Are the songs usually pretty close to being done when you come in ?
NC : This time they were pretty close to being done when we came in , because we actually rehearsed as an entire band for these tracks for the first time ever .
So a lot of them were actually pretty close to being done , and they were n’t any easier to get down .
They were fully formed in our minds , at least .
We had the parts better , so when we were overdubbing things , it was easier .
Advertisement
AVC : You started working on Middle Cyclone last January .
How was the schedule broken up ?
NC : It was rehearsal , so we were working on it really hard , but nothing had gone to tape yet .
We did n’t put anything to tape ’ til March .
We worked on it on and off all year between touring for both Fox Confessor and for The New Pornographers — “ we ” being me and the band .
I know I sound like the Queen of England , but I always mean my bandmates .
Advertisement
AVC : Is it good to take frequent breaks like that , or does it kill momentum ?
NC : No , no , no , there ’s no such thing as momentum after two weeks .
It ’s just soupy after two weeks .
It ’s good to change your perspective , and playing with The New Pornographers is really great , because I ’m still practicing and singing , but I ’m doing completely different things .
It ’s like you ’re still exercising , but you ’re not doing the triathlon every single day , if that makes sense .
Could there be a sexier metaphor ?
Advertisement
AVC : You ’ve always championed the happy accidents that make albums .
What were some of the ones on this record ?
NC : There were a lot of times where there would be too much going on , and I would just think , “ Well , let ’s just take everything out and see what that does , ” and then that would really work .
Things like space .
Sounds like to have space sometimes .
It ’s good to give yourself a variety , or you just fatigue your ear .
Like if somebody sings in the same register all the time , or if it ’s got the same feel the whole way through , I just find I get fatigued , so it ’s nice to break it up .
Advertisement
AVC : Your records have all been known for their airiness and atmosphere , but you also have eight pianos at one point on this one , too .
NC : Well that one was one of the instances where more was better .
Sometimes it ’s good to overdo it , and sometimes it ’s good to understate it .
I guess just figuring out the difference sometimes is as different as night and day .
You ’ll be thinking about it for four months , like “ Why is this not working ? ” and then you suddenly one day are eating a scone , and you go , “ Oh , I know what to do . ”
And it ’s that easy .
Advertisement
AVC : How do you avoid fatigue in that situation ?
It seems like , as you said , it would just sound soupy .
NC : Well , that ’s when you just get up and leave , and you come back later .
I would kind of tag - team with Darryl [ Neudorf , co-producer ] .
Sometimes I would just say , “ You know what , I ’m not coming in today .
I ’m going to the movies . ”
And he would go , “ No problem , I ’ll work on all these crazy noises we have to get rid of from the cable hitting the mic stand , ” or whatever .
Advertisement
AVC : All the minutiae sound excruciating .
NC : Unless you ’re Darryl .
He loves minutiae .
That ’s why it ’s so great to have a partner when you ’re doing something like that , because I ca n’t imagine mixing an entire record alone .
I do n’t even like writing songs by myself , necessarily .
I get lonely .
I want input .
I want to make sure that I ’m not making the wrong decision , so it ’s really great to have somebody be a sounding board .
I have weird , crazy ideas , and he has weird , crazy technical ideas that I do n’t know about , so we come together with extra ideas .
It ’s nice .

[ pagebreak ]
AVC : Do you ever feel like you ’re done ?
NC : It ’s really hard to let go — really , really , really hard .
But there ’s a certain point where your brain …
For example , we had some problems with the mastering , which had nothing to do with the mastering job that we ’d done .
There was an edition of it that I heard that was recorded on something that made it like six dB too quiet , and Paul [ Rigby , guitarist ] was like “ God , it ’s so quiet .
There ’s something wrong with the mastering . ”
Luckily we figured out what was wrong , and we fixed it .
But when I finally heard it at the right level and heard everything Peter [ Moore ] had done to it mastering - wise , it was like , “ Yes , that sounds right .
Okay , that ’s what we were working for . ”
’ Cause there ’s this weird thing where it just clicks over , and it sounds like a song to you , and you ’re not hearing all the little tiny parts sticking out .
You can actually hear it as a song — that gives you that little butterfly feeling in your stomach , and then you ’re like , “ Okay ! ”
Advertisement
There ’s not like a science to it , necessarily , but I ’m also the kind of person who spends a long time in the studio .
I will spend my entire advance just getting it done , which is probably stupid , but I do n’t have extravagant taste .
I mean , I paid for it , so there you go .
Why not ?
The recording process is also very fun to me , and I get to be with a lot of people I do n’t get to see as much as I ’d like to .
We go out and have dinner and hang around with each other , and it becomes a time in your life .
It ’s not just like , “ We ’ve got to get this job done ! ” , like you ’re working for the Pony Express or something .
“ I gotta get this to Abilene today ! ”
AVC : When we spoke to you for Fox Confessor , you talked about how “ Hold On , Hold On ” was your first real autobiographical song .
Are there any like that on this record ?
Advertisement
NC : I know that I ’m in a lot of them .
I do n’t think they ’re really about me , necessarily , or about anyone in particular — maybe “ Next Time You Say Forever ” a little bit .
But there are n’t particular stories about other people , and the love songs are n’t songs about me being in love with people , necessarily .
They ’re more songs that are love songs between a tornado and a person .
But my own experiences are in there .
I ca n’t deny that , because mine ’s the only experience I have , so I do n’t have any choice .
That ’s all I got !
AVC : You ’ve spoken a lot in interviews about the love songs on this record , but “ People Got A Lotta Nerve , ” “ The Tigers Have Spoken , ” even “ Maybe Sparrow ” all speak to the theme of taming what ca n’t be tamed .
Advertisement
NC : Or not taming what ca n’t be tamed .
AVC : Exactly , and a general empathy for animals .
Why do you think you revisit that so much ?
Advertisement
NC : I think I just have an empathy for nature in general , which I think is why I ’ve kind of branched out into not just animals , but also weather .
[ Laughs . ]
Getting into weather these days , you know , tornadoes .
I think that the more human you realize you are , the more of an animal you realize you are — meaning that it ’s okay to not have all the answers .
It ’s a very Faustian kind of thing — like when Faust asks the minion of the devil to tell him the meaning of life and love , and the devil and the minion go , “ Well , Faust , I could tell you that , but your human brain is so small that you would n’t get it , so I ’m not going to waste my time . ”
That seems like a really terrible thing , but it ’s actually a huge relief .
It makes you more forgiving of mankind , and I think it really opens the floodgates of compassion .
AVC : This album talks about dreams , too .
Have you ever looked at a dream dictionary ?
Advertisement
NC : Dream dictionaries are so disappointing .
They ’re so limited , and I think they ’re just total bullshit .
I really do .
I do n’t know much about the Freudian theory of dreams ; it ’s probably more interesting than your average hippie dream dictionary , but it ’s got to be a lot deeper than that .
It ca n’t all be about sex all the time , so I do n’t know if Freud is right either .
AVC : Those dictionaries will be like , “ A tornado signifies unrest or disruption . ”
Oh , thanks for that .
I could n’t figure that one out on my own .
Advertisement
NC : Yeah , that ’s not completely obvious or anything .
AVC : You ’ve always moved around a lot .
How much of an adjustment was it to put money down and buy a hundred acres of land with a farm and say , “ Okay , this is a home base ? ”
Advertisement
NC : Well , I had been looking for that for a really long time , and I ’d always wanted to go back to Vermont , so that felt really right , actually .
Having bought this house in Tucson for my mom , basically , that makes it easy .
Because once you buy a house , you go , “ What the fuck was I doing , giving rent away all this time ? ”
But I could n’t have bought a house any earlier than I did , and I could n’t have bought a house at any other time than I did in Tucson , because it was really cheap at the time .
I think I was here in the last six months , and you could buy a house for less than $ 100,000 .
I had looked in Chicago ; I wanted to stay in Chicago , but it was like half a million dollars for a house .
So I was like , “ Fuck it , I gotta go . ”
Then I chose Tucson because I have some friends here , and I record here all the time , and I do n’t know , it ’s just an easier pace .
I did n’t want to spend my two weeks off on tour , even though I love Humboldt Park [ in Chicago ] , trying to get to the drugstore , digging my van out of the snow .
It takes like an hour and a half to get all those things done , and then you come back , and then you ’ve got to find a parking spot because some asshole stuck a chair in the spot that you just dug out .
I just did n’t have that much free time .
I needed some rest , and it was good for me .
AVC : It ’s a quality - of - life thing , too .
Those everyday hassles eat away at you over time .
Advertisement
NC : They do .
I was a little tired of getting my car broken into constantly .
The shit people would steal — my grandmother ’s dishes that she got from like the grocery store in the ’50s that were n’t worth anything .
It ’s like , “ Man , really , give me a break already . ”
What can I say : if there is a series that always repeats itself , with no thrills or continual stylistic variations this surely is n’t Karma Kula !
After the first two episodes full of swordfighting and the third chapter with an horror / mysticism setting , on June the Bellord family and all the crew that made the live action project annihilates any possible expectation by releasing another surprise , a sort of hallucinated journey among strange characters and situations that are far beyond the boundary of insane humour .
This time too there is no fight , just to be clear , but entertainment remains : during his journey toward the temple of monk - killing cult worshippers introduced in the third episode , in BOGI YOGI the Karma Kula runs into a bath house fallen in disgrace .
Earlier the business was flourishing , but because of the demoniac cult the monks disappeared with the other customers too , and what remains now is a holy man smoking marijuana all the time and a hallucinated atmosphere due to the aforementioned smokes .
Once established that at the heart of the new chapter ’s plot there is marijuana ( and the Ninjai Gang cares to specify this on YouTube too ) , all the other bizarre gimmicks shown on the screen seem perfectly coherent and understandable .
The bathouse owner is realistically ridiculous in his attempt to silence the holy man which says he has seen the worshippers at work with his own eyes , the digital effects are appropriate and the chasing between the hallucinated bath owner and the holy man ( with some occasional martial arts blows just to avoid betraying the main theme of the series ) is bizarrely funny .
Not so much lucid and pointless but surely funny 😀
The hallucinated journey in this doped atmosphere ends up with our hero asking to have a bath , for the owner ’s joy and … the joy of the holy man in a state of eternal joy 😀
The next Karma Kula chapter as well , on - line by the next 8th of July , will be set in the bathouse , and frankly I do n’t dare to imagine any more what the Ninjai Gang arranged to continue a series that has eclecticism as its mostly distinctive trait .

Well , it was really more like 17 weeks , but who 's counting . ;)
First , I 'll give the punchline .
Chad , you were skinny !
Why diet ?
High school : 140 pounds
College : 150 pounds
Grad school : 160 pounds
After four years at IMVU in delicious downtown Palo Alto : 180 pounds
At my height , 180 lbs. is n't terrible , but the trajectory is obviously wrong .
Without adjustments to my lifestyle , you can see what would happen .
So I started paying attention .
In February , Laura and I got iPhones .
Shortly after , I discovered Lose It ! , a calorie - counting and weight - tracking app .
I knew my eat - box - of - cheez - its - when - bored habit was bad , so I began simply tracking calories with Lose It ! , hoping to break some bad habits .
After all , if you give an engineer some data , he 'll optimize it .
A few weeks later , I ended up reading The Hacker 's Diet .
It 's a quick , educational , and inspirational read .
John
Walker 's thesis is that anyone can lose weight if they correct the flawed feedback mechanisms causing them to eat more than they consume every day .
See , our bodies are complicated machines .
We can't entirely understand them , so we use models ( created by people smarter than me ) to help us predict how our bodies will behave under various inputs .
Thus , there are tons of weight loss plans , and I 'm sure they 've all worked for someone : all raw , low - carb , no -carb , low - calorie , intense exercise , glass of red wine every night , protein shakes in the morning , seven snacks a day , etc. etc .
All of that is too complicated for me , so I chose the simplest model I knew : Calories In , Calories Out .
It goes something like this :
The Hacker 's Diet ( Theory )
( I am not an expert !
This is what worked for me .
Consult your nutritionist and physician .
Do n't starve yourself .
Take your vitamins .
Etc. )
1 lb. of body fat = 3500 calories Calories stored = calories eaten - calories burned Every day , I eat X calories Every day , I burn ~2500 calories
If X > 2500 , you will gain weight at ( X - 2500 ) /3500 pounds per day .
If X < 2500 , you will lose weight at ( 2500 - X ) /3500 pounds per day .
Thus , if you eat 500 calories less than you burn every day , you will lose one pound per week .
Key insight : this is not difficult !
For example , a strawberry milkshake from In - n - Out is 700 calories .
A 6 oz . frozen yogurt with strawberries and mangos from Fraiche is 200 calories .
That 's 500 calories saved right there !
Sounds great !
How do I deal with this on a day - to - day basis ?
The Hacker 's Diet ( Practice )
My mother once told me " Chad , be very careful with drugs and alcohol .
You have an obsessive personality . "
She was absolutely right about the obsessive personality ; fortunately , I 've learned to channel my obsessions productively .
( Although I did spend a year and hundreds of dollars on Travian ... )
Here 's how calorie - counting with Lose It ! works in practice :
Keep track of everything you eat .
This is pretty easy because their database contains most common foods .
If it 's not in the database , just enter it yourself .
Record it right before or after you eat so you do n't forget .
Estimate your daily caloric burn .
There are standard estimation formulae , but the exact amount does n't matter a great deal .
If you are losing weight faster than you expected , increase your burn .
If you are losing weight slower than you expected , decrease your burn .
I started at 2500 calories / day , but shortly realized my actual burn was 2300 calories / day .
* cough *
Stay within your daily calorie budget !
Treat it as a hard limit so that , if you screw up and eat a Double Double and Shake ( 1400 calories total ) for lunch , you 'll be very sad at dinner when you can't eat anything else . :(
You wo n't make that mistake again .
Drink water .
Take vitamins .
Sleep .
Take care of yourself if you get sick .
Weigh yourself every day .
Watch the mostly - linear progress !
That 's all there is to it !
Time + calorie deficit = easy weight loss !
Really ?
Surely there 's more to it ...
Unexpected Side Effects
The first couple weeks after I reduced my caloric intake to ~1800 , I got hungry .
Then tired .
REALLY TIRED .
I started sleeping 10 hours a night .
It turns out that your body is good at noticing " Hey , where 'd the energy go ?
Time to slow the engine down . "
I suspect this is the part where most people quit , especially if they do n't see immediate progress .
Remember : this effect is annoying , but temporary .
Your body will adjust to the reduced intake and before you know it you 'll feel great again .
My headaches are GONE !
I used to get very frequent headaches related to low blood sugar .
Maybe burning fat means I have a more even supply of energy through the day ?
Maybe eating less means my blood sugar does n't spike ?
Who knows , but I 'll take it !
Body fat is an inert material .
For years , it quietly stores all kinds of chemicals and toxins .
Burning fat means those chemicals go into your bloodstream .
Some of those chemicals reek .
Thus , you will randomly smell like holy hell for a week or so .
You can't predict when either .
I thought John Walker was exaggerating ... but it 's true :
As your body chemistry adjusts , other curious things may happen .
One day , trapped in a tedious meeting , I began to emit an odor evocative of a roadkill skunk marinated in ratpiss .
My esteemed colleagues were either too polite to remark upon this phenomenon , or ( more likely ) unsure of the culprit , so I managed to escape to the open air unfingered as the malodorous miscreant .
This situation persisted for about two weeks , after which it disappeared for good as suddenly as its onset .
Optimizing for fullness per calorie has unexpected effects .
Pizza is actually low - calorie when you consider that two slices of pepperoni is only 600 calories and filling .
Fruit is also great : 100 calories for a pear .
Alcohol is full of calories .
80 for a shot of whiskey . :x
Turns out I 'd rather eat some bread than have a beer .
It 's way too easy to blow your budget on soda and juice .
Switch to diet soda , iced tea , black coffee , and water .
Liquid calories are n't worth it .
Speaking of , caffeine is awesome .
Suppresses appetite and gives you energy .
Body weight is noisy .
On any given day , you may be 4 pounds heavier or lighter than the day before .
( You can try this at home : drink two bottles of water before weighing yourself . )
Some weeks , it will look like you 've made no progress .
It 's infuriating , but hang in there .
In the end , your weight graph will be linear .
When it comes to nutrition , everyone 's an expert .
" Are you exercising ? " No .
" Are you eating healthy food ? "
Do pizza , burritos , and frozen White Castle count ?
Dieting is hard enough by itself .
Actively avoid being too ambitious .
It 's much easier to cut calories if you can still eat things you love .
Worry about the low - order bits after you hit your target weight .
I used to love the feeling of a full stomach .
Now it 's unpleasant .
I 've finally defeated that post - great - depression " EAT EVERYTHING ON YOUR PLATE OR YOU'RE GROUNDED ! " instinct .
Getting Through Rough Days
Let 's face it .
Some days you 'll screw up and eat too much for breakfast or lunch .
At 11:00 p.m. you can't sleep because you 're too hungry .
How do you take the edge off without blowing your calorie budget ?
Tomatoes . 35 calories PER !
If you like 'em , chow down .
Cantaloupe. 35 calories per 1/8 melon .
Hot chicken broth in a mug .
Warm , tasty , and 50 calories .
Strawberries .
8 calories per delicious berry !
Low - calorie yogurt .
60 calories .
String cheese . 70 calories .
Pickles .
ZERO .
Water .
ZERO .
Somehow , drinking water can make you less hungry !
Also , if you still want crackers or cookies , 100 calorie packs are pretty common these days .
And finally , my secret weapon ...
Trader Joe 's Whole Wheat Bread .
I can't remember its exact name , but it comes in half - rounds and has three ingredients : whole wheat , water , salt .
200 calories , 16g of protein and 16g of fiber per EXTREMELY FILLING slice .
You can eat this stuff until your jaw hurts .
It 's epic .
However , keep in mind that 16g of fiber is a ton .
Stay near a bathroom .
What About Exercise ?
Remember the basic equation :
Calories stored = Calories eaten - Calories burned
You can lose weight with exercise , but it 's harder than you 'd think .
Exercising tends to make me hungry , causing me to eat more than I would normally .
Plus , it takes a lot of exercise to burn off a significant number of calories .
If you vigorously lifted weights for an hour , you 'd only burn ~400 calories , less than a single cheeseburger !
You'd have to keep that up every single day without increasing your diet to lose a less than a pound per week .
I decided it 's easier to simply eat less .
Note that I 'm not saying that exercise is not valuable .
Exercise has great health , happiness , and life extension benefits .
I just do n't think it 's an efficient way for me to lose weight .
What Next ?
What next ?
I think I 'm going to try to drive my weight down a bit further and then replace the pounds of fat lost with muscle .
Or maybe I 'll get myself to floss every day .
We 'll see !
I always thought weight loss was hard because I 'd witnessed people throw themselves at it hardcore and then fail just as hard .
In contrast , I chose an easy , long - term , data - driven plan and stuck with it .
Small changes over a long time make a big difference .

Section 1 : Funding Opportunity Description 1.1 Authority
This program guidance and financial assistance announcement pertains to FRA 's new High - Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program ( ``HSIPR '' ) , which consolidates the following recently - authorized and closely - related programs : The High - Speed Rail Corridor Development program , authorized under Section 501 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 ( ``PRIIA , '' Division B of Pub .
L. 110-432 , October 16 , 2008 , codified at 49 U.S.C. 26106 ) ; The Intercity Passenger Rail Service Corridor Capital Assistance program , authorized under Section 301 of PRIIA ( codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 244 ) ; The Congestion Grants program , authorized under Section 302 of PRIIA ( codified at 49 U.S.C. 24105 ) ; The Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2009 Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Rail Service program , authorized and funded under the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act , 2009 ( ``FY 2009 DOT Appropriations Act , '' Title I of Division I of Pub .
L. 111-8 , March 11 , 2009 ) ; and The FY 2008 Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Rail Service program , authorized and funded under the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act , 2008 ( ``FY 2008 DOT Appropriations Act , '' Title I of Division K of Pub .
L. 110 - 161 , December 26 , 2007 ) .
This document incorporates both ( i ) interim guidance required for this program pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ``ARRA , '' Pub .
L. 111-5 , February 17 , 2009 ) ; and ( ii ) interim guidance required pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 24402( a ) ( 2 ) .
The funding made available under this financial assistance announcement was appropriated under ARRA , and the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations Act .
The funding opportunities described in this guidance are available under Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) numbers 20.317 and 20.319 .
1.2 Program Description and Legislative History
This program guidance and funding opportunity announcement represents the second major milestone in the implementation of the new HSIPR Program .
It follows and builds upon Vision for High - Speed Rail in America , the Administration 's April 2009 high - speed rail strategic plan for the implementation of this program ( available at http:// www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/31).
As one of President Obama 's foremost transportation priorities , the HSIPR Program helps to address the nation 's transportation challenges by investing in an efficient High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail network that connects communities across America .
Congress established the framework for the program through the passage of three key pieces of legislation : Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Rail Service -- In the FY 2008 DOT Appropriations Act , Congress established a new pilot program for joint Federal - State intercity passenger rail capital investment , known as Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Rail Service .
Under this program , $ 30 million in Federal funding was made available to States on a competitive basis to fund up to 50 percent of the capital cost of improving Intercity Passenger Rail service ; up to 10 percent of the $ 30 million was available for rail corridor planning grants .
An additional $ 90 million was appropriated under similar terms as part of the FY 2009 DOT Appropriations Act. Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 ( PRIIA ) -- Enacted in October 2008 , PRIIA represents the most sweeping Congressional action on intercity passenger rail since those that created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ( Amtrak ) and the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project during the 1970s .
In addition to reauthorizing Amtrak , PRIIA established three new competitive grant programs for funding High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail capital improvements , each of which , as authorized , require a 20 percent non- Federal match : [ cir ] Intercity Passenger Rail Service Corridor Capital Assistance ( Section 301 ) -- Under this section , the broadest of PRIIA 's three new funding programs , States ( including the District of Columbia ) , groups of States , interstate compacts , and public Intercity Passenger Rail agencies established by one or more State (s ) may apply for grants for capital improvements to benefit all types of Intercity Passenger Rail service , including high - speed service .
Amtrak may participate through a cooperative agreement with a State(s ) .
To be eligible for funding under this program , proposed projects must meet a number of requirements ( e.g. , inclusion in a State Rail Plan ) . [ cir ]
High - Speed Rail Corridor Development ( Section 501 ) -- Although similar in structure , criteria , and conditions to Section 301 , eligibility for this program is restricted to projects intended to develop Federally - designated High - Speed Rail corridors for Intercity Passenger Rail services that may reasonably be expected to reach speeds of at least 110 miles per hour ( mph ) .
Applicant eligibility under Section 501 is broadened from Section 301 to include Amtrak as well .
[ cir ]
Congestion Grants ( Section 302 ) -- This program authorizes grants to States or to Amtrak ( in cooperation with States ) for facilities , infrastructure , and [ [ Page 29902 ] ] equipment for high - priority rail corridor projects to reduce congestion or facilitate Intercity Passenger Rail ridership growth .
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) -- The $ 8 billion in High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail funding under ARRA ``jump starts '' the widespread improvement of High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail service in the United States .
The appropriation references the authorities included in Sections 301 , 302 , and 501 of PRIIA but states the ``Federal share of the costs for which a grant is made * * * shall be , at the option of the recipient , up to 100 percent . ''
It also does not require that proposed projects be included in a State Rail Plan ( and it excludes the costs of preparing such plans from eligibility for ARRA funding ) .
1.3 Selection Process and Priorities
The application process begins with a preapplication .
The preapplication is a simple form intended to give FRA an early assessment of the universe of projects and programs , and to provide pre-applicants with any feedback necessary to complete their applications ( e.g. , eligibility issues , most appropriate application Track to pursue , etc. ) .
It also allows FRA and preapplicants to start a collaborative process for ensuring early program success .
Preapplications should be submitted as early as possible , but no later than July 10 , 2009 ; applicants should not wait for submission of , or any comments on , a preapplication before preparing their full applications .
In recognition of a variety of considerations , including the urgency of project implementation as reflected in ARRA and the complexities of launching a new HSIPR program , FRA considers the preapplication to be an essential component of the application submission and decision making processes .
As a result , FRA will only consider applications that were not supported by a timely filed preapplication only if there are special , compelling circumstances .
Complete applications for Tracks 1 , 3 and 4 are due on August 24 , 2009 and for Track 2 on October 2 , 2009 .
Once an application is received , it will proceed through a three - step process .
Screening for completeness and eligibility ( both applicant and project eligibility ) ; Evaluation panel review process , applying ``evaluation criteria ' ' ; and Final review and selection , applying ``selection '' criteria .
See Section 5 for a full description of the review process and criteria .
1.3.1 Application Screening Screening will confirm applicant and project eligibility , and ensure that the application provides complete and sufficient information for the evaluation process .
1.3.2 Evaluation Criteria Eligible applications in all Tracks will be individually reviewed and assessed against seven evaluation criteria - - organized into three categories -- detailed below .
For each of the applicable criteria , the application will be assigned a rating of between one and five points , based on the application 's fulfillment of the objectives of each criterion .
These individual criterion ratings will then be accounted according to priority of criteria ( which vary by Track , as described in Section 5 ) , to arrive at an overall rating for the application .
FRA will require a rigorous analysis of benefits and costs of proposed projects , with a focus on the transportation service and output measures that are fundamental to estimating other public benefits .
Applicants must provide requested benefit and cost information the best available tools in order to ensure adequate assessment of business cases for projects .

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 Program Implementation Opportunities and Challenges
In addition to the fiscal constraints currently affecting States , local governments , and businesses , the development of a comprehensive High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail network faces challenges specific to this program and the rail industry .
For instance , FRA recognizes the challenges associated with the need for agreements among multiple States and with private railroad companies , as well as the shortage of engineering professionals , planners , and managers with experience in High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail development with project implementation in the United States .
The intent to establish a pipeline of future High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail programs and projects poses a further challenge .
The traditional pipeline for major transportation investments progresses from alternatives analysis to investment planning , preliminary engineering ( PE ) and environmental clearance , final design ( FD ) , construction , and operations .
With very narrow exceptions , States have historically lacked a Federal funding partner in High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail development ; thus , many States have no High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail program at all , and others find their limited High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail development efforts stalled at various points along the typical progression .
This situation necessitates a Federal funding approach that is flexible enough to support the High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail development efforts of each State -- whether , for example , the State has just initiated High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail planning , or has prepared for capital investments to enhance existing services , or has readied itself to construct new infrastructure to accommodate new High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail service .
With such disparate situations among the States , the Federal funding approach must accommodate different situations , offering an array of possibilities to dovetail with the States ' diverse aspirations , capabilities , and resources .
1.5 Environmental Review and Approval Central to High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail Program implementation -- and crucial to each applicant 's choice of Track for a proposal -- is the environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) and related laws and regulations .
\2 \ NEPA applies to all federal grant programs and requires Federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision - making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions .
Agencies must also make information on these impacts and alternatives publicly available before decisions are made and actions occur .
NEPA also mandates that all reasonable alternatives be considered , and to that end , an alternatives analysis is typically conducted during the environmental review process .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The National Historic Preservation Act , Clean Water Act , 49 U.S.C. 303 relating to parks , wildlife refuges and historic sites ( commonly referred to as Section 4 ( f ) ) , and the Endangered Species Act are examples .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRA--as the Federal sponsoring agency -- has primary responsibility for assuring NEPA compliance while accomplishing the purposes , priorities , and requirements of the HSIPR Program .
While NEPA compliance is a Federal agency responsibility and the ultimate decisions remain with the Federal sponsoring agency , FRA encourages applicants to take a leadership role in NEPA documentation development , consistent with existing law and regulations .
In the varied and flexible HSIPR Program , with its four Tracks and multiple authorizations , no single approach to NEPA compliance will work for every proposal and applicant .
Therefore , FRA will work closely with applicants to assist in the timely and effective completion of the NEPA process in the manner most pertinent to the applicant 's proposal .
NEPA reviews should focus on the issues that are ripe for decision at each stage of project or program development .
To help focus environmental reviews , the Council on Environmental Quality encourages agencies to tier their environmental reviews , whereby general matters or broader programs are covered in a Tier I NEPA document , such as a corridor - wide ( or ``service ' ' ) environmental impact statement ( EIS ) or environmental assessment ( EA ) ; and narrower more site - specific projects or actions are addressed in site - specific EISs , EAs or categorical exclusion ( CE ) documents .
1.6 Funding Approach
In order to accommodate the variety of potential applicant goals and stages of [ [ Page 29904 ] ] project development , while meeting the statutory and program constraints , this guidance provides four funding ``tracks '' in which applications may be submitted .
FRA has adopted this four - Track approach to aid in near - term economic recovery efforts and to establish the path to realize a fully - developed national High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail network .
The deadlines for FRA obligation and project (s ) completion for each Track reflect the imperatives of ARRA , balanced with the longer - term development goals .
( See DATES above . ) 1.6.1 Track 1-- Intercity Passenger Rail Projects Funded Under ARRA ( `` Track 1-- Projects '')
This track is aimed at chiefly addressing the economic recovery goals of ARRA through -- ( a ) FD / construction of ``ready - to - go ' ' projects -- i.e. , those with completed site - specific NEPA documentation ( project - level final EIS , final EA or CE documentation ) along with PE ; and ( b ) completion of project - level NEPA and PE to prepare projects for FD / construction grants that may be available under future solicitations .
Track 1 projects should be completed within two years of award .
These projects are funded through either Section 301 ( Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ) or Section 302 ( Congestion Grants ) of PRIIA , for the benefit of existing services , including those that support development of High - Speed Rail .
Eligible projects include infrastructure , facilities , and equipment , and must have independent utility .
\3 \ The Federal funding share can be up to 100 percent , although evaluation criteria favor projects that leverage federal funding with non-federal investments .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\
While ARRA - funded projects are exempt from State Rail Plan requirements , evaluation preference is given to those that are part of a planning process that includes a prioritized list of capital projects supporting a corridor service development plan ; equipment projects should be consistent with Section 305 of PRIIA , which calls for the establishment of a standardized next - generation rail corridor equipment pool ( see Section 3.6.3 ) .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.6.2 Track 2-- High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail Service Development Programs ( `` Track 2-- Programs '')
This track is aimed at developing new High - Speed Rail corridor and Intercity Passenger Rail services , or substantial upgrades to existing corridor services , eligible under Section 501 ( High - Speed Rail Corridor Development ) and Section 301 ( Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ) of PRIIA .
It is intended to fund development of a set of inter-related projects that constitute the entirety or a distinct phase ( or geographic section ) of a long - range service development plan -- projects which collectively produce benefits greater than the sum of each individual project .
\4 \ Under this Track , not all projects need to be ready - to - go ; the Federal Government provides a commitment to fund the entire program , generally through a Letter of Intent ( LOI ) , and obligates funds for FD / construction projects through cooperative agreements as soon as they are deemed ready - to - go .
Track 2 LOIs and cooperative agreements must include specific milestone deadlines for completion of environmental , engineering , design and other work .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4 \
A group of projects that collectively advance the entirety , or a ``phase ' ' or ``geographic section , '' of a corridor service development plan are referred to here as a ``program .''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be eligible for awards under Track 2 , Service Development Programs ( ``SDP '' - - defined in Section 2.2 ) must include completed : ( a) A corridor - wide ``service ' ' NEPA study , such as a programmatic or Tier I EIS ; and ( b ) a High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail SDP , or an equivalent approach that provides a business and investment justification with sufficient project cost and benefit estimates .
Key elements of an SDP or equivalent business case include : ( i ) An overview of program rationale ( including purpose and need ) ; ( ii ) a service and operations plan , and a prioritized capital investment plan for infrastructure , fleet and stations / facilities ; and ( iii ) an implementation approach , including schedule , project management plan , stakeholder agreements , and a financial plan for funding both capital and operations .
See Appendix 2.1 for a summary of expectations for a SDP .
Track 2 programs will generally address infrastructure , equipment and stations / facilities investments in a comprehensive fashion .
While these programs are the most complicated and need a particularly rigorous project management approach , Track 2 programs represent the long - term emphasis of the HSIPR Program , and thus FRA expects to focus its collaborative efforts on this Track .
The Federal funding share can be up to 100 percent , although evaluation criteria favor projects that leverage federal funding with non-federal investments .
1.6.3 Track 3 -- Service Planning Activities funded under the FY 2009 and FY 2008 DOT Appropriations Acts ( `` Track 3 -- Planning ' ' )
This track is aimed at helping establish a pipeline of future High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail projects and service development programs by advancing planning activities for applicants at an earlier stage of the development process .
Under Track 3 , FRA will enter into cooperative agreements for preparation of SDPs , State Rail Plans and service - level environmental documents .
\5 \ This Track provides States an opportunity to complete the prerequisite work needed to submit applications under Tracks 1 and 2 , so that applicants may be ready for potential future solicitations .
Under the terms of the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations acts , planning activities funded under this Track require a 50 percent non-Federal match .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Project - level NEPA documents are eligible for funding under Tracks 1 and 2 .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.6.4 Track 4--FY2009 Appropriations - Funded Projects ( `` Track 4-- FY2009 Appropriations Projects '' ) \ 6 \
Track 4 provides an alternative for projects that would otherwise fit under Track 1 , but for State applicants offering at least a 50 percent non-Federal share of financing .
This Track offers applicants simplified grant agreement terms , and up to five years to complete projects ( vs. two years under Track 1 ) .
Applicants providing at least a 50 - percent project match are strongly encouraged to submit project applications under Track 4 ( those submitting project application (s ) under Track 4 may also request concurrent consideration of such application ( s ) under Track 1 ) .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6 \
A total of $ 90 million was appropriated under the FY 2009 DOT Appropriations
Act under the heading of Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Service , of which no more than ten percent , or $ 9 million , may be made available for planning activities .
In addition , a total of $ 540,500 in planning funding , and at least $ 1,352,573 in FD / construction funding also remained available until expended following the award of grants under the FY 2008 Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Service program .

1.7 Opportunity for Public Comment FRA is soliciting public comment on this document through Docket Number FRA - 2009-0045 ( at http://www.regulations.gov).
While the interim guidance in this document does not constitute a rulemaking , FRA will consider all comments received no later than July 10 , 2009 and will publish any resultant clarifications or revisions to [ [ Page 29905 ] ] this document in the Federal Register and on FRA 's Web site ( http:// www.fra.dot.gov).
FRA began this comment process during its outreach sessions in May and June , in which over 1,100 stakeholders attended seven sessions around the country ; in addition , a public docket was established for comment , and 110 comments were received as of June 15 , 2009 .
FRA has already revised the approach contained herein based on this initial feedback .
To give prospective applicants adequate time to complete their applications ( while incorporating any guidance clarifications or revisions ) , FRA may adjust application dates to allow for a minimum of 30 days for application submission following any material changes to this guidance that arise from comments .
Section 2 : Award Information 2.1 General Award Information ARRA appropriated a total of $ 8 billion under three Intercity Passenger Rail capital investment programs authorized by the PRIIA : Section 501 ( High - Speed Rail Corridor Development ) , Section 301 ( Intercity Passenger Rail Service Corridor Capital Assistance ) , and Section 302 ( Congestion Grants ) .
ARRA left the mix of funding among the three PRIIA programs to the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation .
As described in the Department 's April 2009 strategic plan for high - speed rail , Vision for High - Speed Rail in America , FRA will not allocate funding among the three PRIIA programs in advance , but will cumulate the amounts under each PRIIA section from the funding sources identified in the selected applications , subject to the overall $ 8 billion ARRA limit .
In addition to the ARRA appropriation for High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail , this funding opportunity announcement also solicits applications for up to $ 9,540,500 for Intercity Passenger Rail planning activities , and at least $ 82,352,573 in FD / construction funding appropriated under the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations Acts.\7 \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7 \
A total of $ 90 million was appropriated under the FY 2009 DOT Appropriations
Act to remain available and unexpended under the heading of Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Service , of which no more than 10 percent , or $ 9 million , may be made available for planning activities .
In addition , a total of $ 540,500 in planning funding , and at least $ 1,352,573 in FD / construction funding also remained available until expended following the award of grants under the FY 2008 Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Service program .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This funding and announcement solicits applications for funding appropriated through ARRA , the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations
Acts under the four distinct Tracks described above : Track 1 -- Projects ( ARRA funds ) ; Track 2 -- Programs ( ARRA funds ) ; Track 3 -- Planning ( annual appropriations funds for Interstate Passenger Rail planning from FY 2009 and remaining from FY 2008 ) ; and Track 4-- FY2009 Appropriations Projects ( annual appropriations funds for Interstate Passenger Rail non-planning from FY 2009 and remaining from FY 2008 ) .
FRA anticipates making multiple awards under each of the four Tracks .
While the entire $ 9,540,500 under Track 3 and at least $ 82,352,573 under Track 4 may be awarded , FRA may choose not to award through this solicitation the full amount available for Tracks 1 and 2 , to allow for potential future rounds of solicitations and awards which occur after 2009 .
There is no predetermined allocation between Tracks 1 and 2 or between this and any future solicitations ; all such distributions will cumulatively reflect the nature and timing of the selected applications ( as referenced in Section 5 , selection criteria ) .
2.2 Definitions of Key Terms , Concepts , and Milestones for Track Selection A prospective applicant under this solicitation should first determine into which Track the applicant 's proposal would most appropriately fit .
The choice of Track largely reflects the scope of the proposed undertaking and the proposed effort 's achievement of key milestones within the project development process .
Below are definitions of key terms , concepts , and milestones for the HSIPR Program that affect the selection of a Track .
Section 2.3 is then intended to assist an applicant in selecting a Track based on the proposed investment 's relationship to these terms , concepts , and milestones .
Corridor -- For the specific purposes of the HSIPR Program , a corridor is an existing or proposed Intercity Passenger Rail route of approximately 100-600 miles in total length , linking population centers at its endpoints and typically points in between .
Corridors may cross State or national boundaries and thus require a regional , multi- jurisdictional approach to planning and development .
\8 \ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8 \
Federal investment in corridor projects may be limited to the United States .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Design -- The last phase of project development , including : right - of - way acquisition , utility relocation , the preparation of final design plans , construction management plans , system safety plans for construction management & operations , safety certification , any required collision hazard analysis , final construction cost estimates , and detailed specifications , as well as procurement of construction services and equipment .
During this phase , any remaining uncertainties or risks associated with minor changes to design scope and the procurement processes are fully addressed , and plans for financing the project or program would be updated and refined to reflect accurately the expected year - of - expenditure costs and cash flow projections .
Financial Plan-- The financial plan documents the recent and forecasted financial condition of the applicant agency and other key partners that will provide capital or operating funding for project development and / or implementation .
The Financial Plan describes the current financial health of the aforementioned agencies , documents projected capital and operating costs and revenues , and details key assumptions and methodologies .
A financial plan also details the sources , reliability and feasibility of funding for both capital and operating expenses and provides an overview of the project sponsor 's strategies to address potential project cost increases .
FRA Obligation -- Commitment of Federal funding made through execution of a grant agreement or cooperative agreement .
High - Speed Rail -- Intercity Passenger Rail service that ``is reasonably expected to reach speeds of at least 110 mph ' ' ( 49 U.S.C. 26106 ( b ) ( 4 ) ) .
Independent Utility -- A project , group of projects , or Service Development Program ( or phase of a Service Development Program ) is considered to have independent utility if it will result , upon completion , in the creation of new or substantially improved High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail service , and will provide tangible and measurable benefits even if no additional investments in the same High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail service are made .
Typical examples of these benefits would include on - time performance improvements , travel - time reductions , and higher service frequencies resulting in increased ridership .
Intercity Passenger Rail -- Defined in statue as ``rail passenger transportation except commuter rail passenger transportation '' ( 49 U.S.C. 24102 ( 4 ) ) ; it subsumes both High - Speed Rail and conventional intercity passenger [ [ Page 29906 ] ] services .
Commuter rail is defined at as ``short - haul rail passenger transportation in metropolitan and suburban areas usually having reduced fare , multiple ride , and commuter tickets and morning and evening peak period operations '' ( 49 U.S.C. 24102( 3 ) ) ; Federal funding for commuter rail projects is available from Federal Transit Administration programs .
Intercity Passenger Rail Service -- An Intercity Passenger Rail service consists of a group of one or more scheduled trains ( roundtrips ) that provide Intercity Passenger Rail transportation between bona fide travel markets ( not constrained by State or jurisdictional boundaries ) , generally with similar quality and level - of - service specifications , within a common ( but not necessarily exclusive or identical ) set of identifiable geographic markets .
An Intercity Passenger Rail service is considered ``substantially changed '' when its inherent nature or market focus is altered , or when its operating frequencies ( roundtrips per day ) are increased significantly ; a substantial change in service may include adding short - distance corridor - type trains where only long - distance service operates , or service restoration where trains ceased to operate several years before .
See Appendix 1.3 for further discussion of the definition of Intercity Passenger Rail .
Letter of Intent ( LOI ) -- Represents a contingent financial commitment by FRA to provide up to a prescribed amount of funding to fully implement a service development program ( or specific phases of such a program ) , with defined milestones for completion of work necessary to ensure successful and timely program development .
National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) Documentation -- Includes four principal levels ( with respect to the HSIPR Program ) : Tier I , ``programmatic , '' or service - level environmental impact statement ( Tier I EIS ) -- Addresses actions at a broad level , such as a program concept for an entire corridor , and typically does not lead directly to project construction .
Site - specific , or project EIS -- Addresses specific environmental issues associated with a site or project , and is intended to lead directly to construction once applicable permits are secured .
Environmental assessment ( EA ) -- May be programmatic or site - specific , and concisely provides sufficient evidence and analysis of the proposal to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a finding of no significant impact ( FONSI ) .
Categorical exclusion ( CE ) -- Documentation that shows how a proposal fits a category of predefined actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and for which neither an EIS nor an environmental assessment are required .
Planning -- Activities that support the case for investing in project (s ) or program (s ) , such as : identification of purpose and need ; analysis comparing the costs , benefits , and impacts of a range of transportation alternatives ; studies that assess different levels of rail service and investment ; service - level , programmatic , or Tier I NEPA studies ; Service Development Plans ; and State Rail Plans .
Preliminary Engineering ( PE ) -- Sufficient engineering design to define a project , including identification of all environmental impacts , design of all critical project elements at a level sufficient to assure reliable cost estimates and schedules ( in turn sufficient to complete project management and financial plans ) , and definition of procurement requirements and strategies .
The PE development process starts with specific project design alternatives that allow for assessment of a range of rail improvements , specific alignments , and project designs -- sufficient to support subsequent NEPA analysis .
PE is prerequisite to final design ( FD ) and construction .
Appendix 2.2 contains additional information about PE .
Project -- A High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail project is a discrete action that has a distinct purpose , such as adding track to an existing railroad line , or the purchase of one or more pieces of rolling stock .
Project Management Plan -- Approach for ensuring successful implementation of a project or program , including : ( i ) Identification of a manager accountable for project or program delivery ; ( ii ) an organization / resource plan that describes ( e.g. , through an organization chart ) the relationships among entities involved in the proposed program and a description of the relationships among the entities responsible for the financing , design , construction , operation , and maintenance of the proposed program ; ( iii ) any new legal entities required , how they would be structured , and their relationship to existing entities ; ( iv ) stakeholder agreements with owners of right - of - way , operators , or other entities critical to successful project / program delivery ; ( v ) required governmental actions and approvals ; and , ( vi ) an appropriate system safety plan for the entire project lifecycle consistent with FTA guidance for safety and security management plans .
The project management plan should address the safety certification process and any required collision hazard analysis consistent with the FRA guidance .
A project management plan generally should also include metrics by which the success of the project is defined .
Right - of - Way -- Railroad infrastructure within the property lines of an existing , or within the presumed property lines of a proposed , railroad useful for Intercity Passenger Rail service .
Service Development Plan ( SDP ) -- A plan for developing High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail service , either initiating new service or improving existing service ( e.g. , adding train frequencies and / or reducing trip times ) -- typically developed around distinct phases and / or geographic sections of service improvement .
A High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail SDP or equivalent covers three general topics : ( i ) Rationale ( including purpose and need ) , ( ii ) service / operating plan and prioritized capital plan , and ( iii ) implementation plan ( including project management approach , stakeholder agreements and financial plan ) .
The precise structure of an SDP can vary , but these elements must be covered in some fashion .
( See Appendix 2.1 for additional explanation ) .
Service Development Program ( `` Program '' ) -- Implementation of a High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail SDP , generally broken into discrete phases or geographic sections .
Such programs may be for new service on an existing or new railroad alignment , or for improved service on an existing railroad alignment .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After selecting the appropriate application Track , prospective applicants should consult the relevant Track - specific and general information contained in the balance of this document .
2.4 Anticipated Award Amounts Tracks 1 and 2 -- Awards under Tracks 1 and 2 will be made using a portion of the $ 8 billion appropriated through ARRA .
FRA anticipates making multiple awards under Track 1 as a result of this solicitation ; however , FRA will not award all of the available $ 8 billion to Track 1 applicants .
Funds will be reserved for award to Track 2 applications under this solicitation , and likely to Tracks 1 and 2 in potential future rounds of solicitations -- as described in Section 5 .
As the authorizations underlying Tracks 1 and 2 are new , the FRA cannot provide an average amount of funding per award in previous years .
Tracks 3 and 4 -- Awards under Tracks 3 and 4 will be made using the $ 90 million dedicated to Capital Grants to States -- Intercity Passenger Rail Service in the FY 2009 DOT Appropriations
Act , plus the remaining funds appropriated for the same purpose in the Capital Assistance to States -- Intercity Passenger Service Program in the FY 2008 DOT Appropriations
Act ( currently estimated at $ 1,893,073 ) .
In accordance with the provisions of the Appropriations Acts , no more than 10 percent of appropriated amounts in each fiscal year ( $ 9,540,500 of the available funds ) may be allocated to Track 3 -- Planning , with the balance available for Track 4-- FY2009 Appropriations Projects .
These funds require a non-Federal match of at least 50 percent of total project cost .
2.5 Types of Awards

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ [ Page 29908 ] ] 2.5.1 Track 1
The FRA will make awards under Track 1 through either : ( a) Grant agreements supporting FD and project construction ; or ( b ) cooperative agreements for completion of PE and / or project - level NEPA documentation .
Construction grants will fund both FD ( if not already completed ) and construction of projects for which PE and project - level NEPA documentation is complete at the time of application .
\9 \ FD / construction grant recipients will be required to obtain FRA approval prior to the commencement of construction activities ( the process will be set out in the grant agreement ) .
The grant agreement can also be structured to cover alternative construction scenarios , such as through a design - build type approach .
Applicants under Track 1 will be considered for funding under either Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance Grants ( Section 301 of PRIIA ) , or Congestion Grants ( Section 302 of PRIIA ) .
Eligible projects intended to reduce congestion by alleviating major rail capacity bottlenecks , particularly those that benefit multiple railroad operators ( e.g. Intercity Passenger Rail , rail freight , and commuter rail ) in a congested corridor , will likely be considered for funding under the Congestion Grant program .
Note that where multiple railroad operations benefit from project (s ) , FRA will expect the costs for such project (s ) to be shared proportional to the benefit each operator accrues from the investment .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9 \
If substantial progress on NEPA documentation has been made on NEPA documentation , application may be reviewed for FD / Construction grant funding ; in any case , project - level NEPA documentation must be complete at time of grant agreement .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under Track PE / NEPA cooperative agreements , FRA will be more involved in the project through collaborative work with the recipient .
In addition to providing technical assistance to the recipient , FRA will participate in key project meetings , and will assist in the preparation of engineering and environmental documents .
FRA will also be responsible for approving project deliverables at key milestones , and providing authorization for progressing with subsequent stages of the project .
2.5.2 Track 2 Under Track 2 , FRA may issue Letters of Intent ( LOI ) for Service Development Programs , and make subsequent awards for program components through cooperative agreements .
The issuance of a LOI represents the expression of FRA 's full support of a Service Development Program , and the funding contingently committed through an LOI will be reserved for that Service Development Program from the $ 8 billion in available ARRA funding .
An LOI will include milestones for completion of work needed to advance the program into obligation and completion ; if milestone deadlines are not met , funding reserved under an LOI will be returned to the pool of funds available for future solicitations .
As milestones under an LOI are reached , FRA will obligate funding to implement approved portions of the program through a cooperative agreement .
Funding to complete remaining PE and project - level NEPA would be awarded immediately following the issuance of the LOI .
Funding for FD / construction would be awarded through a grant or cooperative agreement as milestones are reached ( e.g. , completion of PE and NEPA for project (s ) with independent utility .
Even after funds are converted from LOI into a cooperative / grant agreement ( i.e. , obligated ) , grantees will be required to obtain FRA approval prior to the commencement of construction activities .
This process will be included in the grant agreement ( which could also be structured to address options such as a design - build implementation approach ) .
Recognizing the unique challenges posed by complex new corridor programs , a higher level of Federal oversight and support will be involved than under standard grant agreements .
The substantial Federal involvement of FRA will extend across all aspects of Service Development Programs and will include technical assistance , review of interim work products , support for environmental reviews , review of PE and FD , and continuous program oversight .
2.5.3 Track 3 FRA will make awards under Track 3 using the $ 9,540,500 available under the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations
Acts through cooperative agreements .
The substantial Federal involvement for Intercity Passenger Rail planning activities would include agreement on the scope of study , review of draft studies , and acceptance of final deliverables .
Recognizing the importance of planning to the long - term success of the HSIPR Program and the limited funding available under existing appropriations , FRA will favorably consider applicant expenditures for High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail project planning when evaluating the State share or matching contributions component of an evaluation under subsequent solicitations .
2.5.4 Track 4 Awards under Track 4 will be made using $ 82 million available under the FY 2009 DOT Appropriations
Act for non-planning Intercity Passenger Rail Capital Assistance to States , as well as remaining non-planning funding under the analogous FY 2008 DOT Appropriations
Act funding .
FRA anticipates making one or more awards , and awarding the entire $ 82 million under Track 4 as a result of this solicitation .
Funding under Track 4 cannot exceed 50 percent of a project 's total cost .
States are the only eligible applicants under Track 4 , and must be able to certify in their applications as to the availability of the matching funds .
As the source of the Federal funds is a regular annual appropriation rather than ARRA , requirements specific to ARRA ( e.g. , job retention and creation as an evaluation factor , and various reporting requirements ) need not be met , although States are encouraged to do so .
The average amount of Federal funding per non-planning award in the analogous FY 2008 program was $ 2.75 million .
Section 3 : Eligibility Information Applications will be required to meet minimum requirements for each Track in terms of applicant eligibility , project eligibility , and the fulfillment of other Track - specific application prerequisites .
To the extent that an application 's substance exceeds the minimum eligibility requirements described below , such qualifications will be considered in evaluating the merits of an application .

Further detail on the definitions of ``eligible applicants '' is available in Appendix 3 under ``Applicant Types . ''
3.1.1 Track 1
An entity seeking assistance under Track 1 must meet the definition of an ``applicant '' under the funding authorization that would pertain to its proposal (s ) -- either Section 301 ( Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ) or Section 302 ( Congestion Grants ) of PRIIA .
Eligible applicant entities under those sections are as follows : Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ( Section 301 ) -- States ( including the District of Columbia ) , groups of States , Interstate Compacts , and public agencies established by one or more States and having responsibility for providing intercity passenger rail service .
Congestion Grants ( Section 302 ) -- States ( including the District of Columbia ) , or Amtrak ( in cooperation with States ) .
3.1.2 Track 2
An entity seeking assistance under Track 2 must meet the definition of an ``applicant '' under the funding authorization that would pertain to its proposal (s ) -- either Section 301 ( Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ) or Section 501 ( High - Speed Rail Corridor Development ) of PRIIA .
Eligible applicant entities under those sections are as follows : Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Capital Assistance ( Section 301 ) -- States ( including the District of Columbia ) , groups of States , interstate compacts , and public agencies established by one or more States and having responsibility for providing Intercity Passenger Rail service .
High - Speed Rail Corridor Development ( Section 501 ) -- States ( including the District of Columbia ) , groups of States , interstate compacts , and public agencies established by one or more States and having responsibility for providing High - Speed Rail service , or Amtrak .
3.1.3 Tracks 3 and 4 Only States , including District of Columbia , are eligible to apply under Tracks 3 and 4 .
3.2 Applicant and Key Partner Qualifications
For an application submitted by an eligible entity to be considered under any Track , it must affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has or will have the legal , financial , and technical capacity to carry out the proposal .
In addition , for FD / construction applications under Tracks 1 , 2 , and 4 , the applicant must demonstrate that it has or will have satisfactory continuing control over the use of equipment or facilities acquired , constructed , or improved by the project , and the capability and willingness to maintain such equipment or facilities .
Further discussion of how applicants can demonstrate compliance with these minimum qualifications appears in Appendix 1.2 .
Entities other than States must submit information and documentation demonstrating the fulfillment of the minimum applicant qualifications described in this section as part of a preapplication ( see Section 4.3 . for complete preapplication information and documentation requirements ) .
On the basis of such information , FRA will issue a written decision on the entity 's eligibility as an applicant .
3.3 Cost Sharing and Matching 3.3.1 Treatment of Applicant Cost Sharing 3.3.1.1
Track 1 Pursuant to the provisions of the ARRA appropriation for High - Speed Rail / Intercity Passenger Rail , the Federal share of the costs of projects issued grants under Track 1 of this solicitation will be , at the option of the recipient , up to 100 percent .
The evaluation criteria provide preference to applicants , should the applicant choose the option of leveraging federal funds with contributions from its own project partners ' resources toward the costs of its proposed project .
These contributions may be considered in evaluating the merit of its application ( See section 5 for a complete description of evaluation and selection criteria ) .
3.3.1.2 Track 2
As in the case for Track 1 , the Federal share of the costs of projects issued grants under Track 2 of this solicitation shall be , at the option of the recipient , up to 100 percent .
Again , the evaluation criteria provide preference to applicants that leverage federal funding with non-Federal investment .
Applicants for Service Development Programs who do not choose to contribute their own or their project partners ' resources toward the costs of the proposed project , and who ( i ) have not demonstrated continuous , sustained support to the proposed program , and ( ii ) do not have a demonstrable history of capital investment in intercity passenger rail , may , as a condition of the obligation of [ [ Page 29910 ] ] funding for FD / construction activities , be required to establish a Capital Reserve Account funded by their own dedicated financial resources .
Funds deposited by recipients into a Capital Reserve Account would be used to pay for any project cost overruns .
3.3.1.3 Tracks 3 and 4 Pursuant to the provisions of the FY 2008/2009 DOT Appropriations Acts , the Federal share of the costs of projects issued grants under Tracks 3 and 4 of this solicitation may not exceed 50 percent .
If an applicant chooses the option of contributing , from its own or its partner project stakeholders ' resources , more than 50 percent of the costs of its proposed project , such additional contributions will be considered in evaluating the merit of its application ( See Section 5 for a complete description of evaluation and selection criteria ) .
3.3.2 Requirements for Applicant Cost Sharing
Whether optional ( under Tracks 1 and 2 ) or mandatory ( under Tracks 3 and 4 ) , an applicant 's contribution toward the cost of its proposed project may be in the form of cash or , with FRA approval , in - kind contributions of services , supplies , equipment , or real estate .
As part of its application , an applicant offering an in - kind contribution must provide a documented estimate of the monetary value of any such contribution , and its eligibility under 49 CFR 18.24 .
The applicant must provide as part of its application documentation that demonstrates that it has committed and will be able to fulfill any pledged contribution , including committing any required financial resources that are budgeted or planned at the time the application is submitted .
Furthermore , any applicant under Tracks 1 and 2 who seeks to contribute toward its proposed project funds from another Federal financial assistance program that itself requires a match , should be aware of the prohibition in many such programs of using any Federal funding ( such as that being applied for under this program ) as a matching share ( See 49 CFR 18.24 ( b ) ( 3 ) ) .
Funds from other Federal financial assistance programs may not be used to satisfy the 50 percent match requirement under Tracks 3 and 4 .
3.4 Grantee Responsibility for Project Delivery , Cost Overruns , and Contributions Due From States under PRIIA Section 209
All applicants will be required to demonstrate the ability to : Absorb any cost overruns and deliver the proposed project with no Federal funding or financial assistance beyond that provided in grant or cooperative agreement ; and Cover all future cash needs associated with the service benefiting from the proposed program / project and allocated to States as a result of the costing methodology to be developed under Section 209 of the PRIIA .

4.3 Content and Form of Application 4.3.1 Preapplication
All prospective applicants for all Tracks must submit a preapplication in order to establish communication with FRA , and to afford FRA an opportunity to provide feedback to the prospective applicant as to the suitability of their proposed project under the Track that the applicant proposes to use .
Preapplications should be submitted as early as possible , but no later than July 10 , 2009 , and applicants should not wait for submission of , or any comments on , a preapplication before preparing their full applications .
Prospective applicants for potential future funding rounds of solicitations are not required to submit a preapplication at this time .
FRA will announce any corresponding application as needed .
Preapplications consist of the following components : Project Description -- A brief overview of the project 's main features , type of proposed improvement , location , purpose , expected outcome , cost , ownership arrangements and the Intercity Passenger Rail service (s ) that will benefit from the project ; Project Development Status -- The status of key project development elements , such as completion of the planning documents through which the project was identified , engineering work , and NEPA documentation ; and Applicant Eligibility -- Answers to questions regarding cost sharing , and applicant and key partners ' legal , financial , and technical capacity to carry out their proposed project .
Prospective applicants that do not fall within the definition of a State will also [ [ Page 29913 ] ] be required to provide copies of documentation ( or references ( URLs ) to such documentation that is located on the Internet ) that supports the answers provided in the preapplication form .
Such supporting documentation should include ( to the extent available ) , but need not be limited to , copies of laws that established the applicant as a legal entity , contractual agreements between States ( either as a group of States or an interstate compact ) , financial statements and audit reports , and technical reports demonstrating the applicant 's technical capacity and experience in carrying out projects similar to that proposed .
In an effort to focus application efforts and remedy concerns , FRA may contact potential applicants if there are any questions that arise from the information submitted in a preapplication , or if the information raises questions as to the eligibility of the proposed project or its proper classification by Track .
For preapplications submitted by applicants that do not fall within the definition of a State , and for preapplications under Track 2 , FRA will contact the prospective applicants to kick - off discussions for the preparation of the application .
4.3.2 Application Administrative Requirements Prior to submitting an application , prospective applicants must have completed two administrative requirements : Establishment of a DUNS ( Data Universal Numbering System ) number , and registration in the Central Contractor Registration ( CCR ) database .
These requirements need not be completed prior to submitting a preapplication , but FRA encourages applicants to begin the process immediately to meet the application submission deadlines .
All applicants must include a DUNS number in their application .
Applications without a DUNS number are incomplete .
A DUNS number is a unique nine - digit number recognized as the universal standard for identifying and keeping track of entities receiving Federal funds .
The identifier is used for tracking purposes and to validate address and point of contact information for Federal assistance applicants , recipients and subrecipients .
The DUNS number will be used throughout the grant lifecycle .
Obtaining a DUNS number is a free , simple , one - time activity .
Obtain a number by calling 1-866-705-5177 or by applying online at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.do.
FRA also requires that all applicants ( other than individuals ) for Federal financial assistance maintain current registrations in the CCR database .
The CCR database is the repository for standard information about Federal financial assistance applicants , recipients and subrecipients .
Organizations that have previously submitted applications via http://www.grants.gov are already registered with CCR , as it is a requirement for www.grants.gov registration .
Please note , however , that applicants must update or renew their CCR registration at least once per year to maintain an active status .
Information about registration procedures can be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.
4.3.3 Application Package Components
The application package for the HSIPR Program consists of three components -- ( 1 ) program - specific application forms -- Narrative and Templates Form -- available from FRA 's Web site at : http:// www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/2243, ( 2 ) supporting documentation , and ( 3 ) standard application forms available through http:// www.GrantSolutions.gov.
Applicants must complete all three components of the application package as required by Track and listed in the section 4.2.5 application checklist ; failure to do so may result in the application being removed from consideration for award .
Both the standard application forms and the Narrative and Templates Form must be submitted through http://www.GrantSolutions.gov_with standard forms submitted directly as electronic forms , and program - specific forms submitted as attachments to the application .
4.3.3.1 Narrative and Templates Form
The most significant component of the application package is the Narrative and Templates Forms , forms into which the applicant enters specific information about the proposed project .
The forms include templates that have been developed by FRA to capture pertinent qualitative and quantitative program - specific information needed for FRA to confirm applicant and project 's eligibility for the HSIPR Program , and information needed for evaluation and selection of applications .
These forms will be used to conduct a comprehensive benefit cost analysis .
The forms allow for the applicant to make quantitative and qualitative arguments of the public return on investment .
In order to conduct this analysis FRA requires specific quantitative data relating to service outputs ( delay reduction , schedule improvement , or capacity increases ) , and transportation outputs ( increases in passenger - miles traveled on Intercity Passenger Rail services , including shifts from other modes of transportation ) .
The information entered into the Narrative and Templates Form falls into two categories : ( 1 ) Narrative information , provided in response to specific application questions , with length limitations for each response ; and ( 2 ) structured and / or quantitative information , which is entered into tables contained in the Forms .
Applicants may track and submit the Narrative and Templates Forms through GrantSolutions .
Separate Track - specific Narrative and Template Forms are tailored to corresponding tracks .
Information requested in the Narrative and Templates Form includes information on project overview , planning , purpose and need , project development status , project benefits -- economic recovery , transportation , environmental and livable communities -- project estimate / budget , applicant qualifications , stakeholder agreements and financial and operation information .
Completing the FRA - developed forms is expected to facilitate information input for required OMB standard forms described in section 4.3.3.3 below .

The Wolfhound , as a certified ( do n't say it ! ) member of the press , loves it when some rich fekkin ' dolt puts his foot in his mouth .
But it 's even more pathetic when the fekkin ' dolt sticks his foot in his arse first , THEN puts it in his mouth .
Meet U2 drummer Larry Mullen , a man long since eclipsed in the musical phenomenon that is U2 by the one - and - only Bono .
Yes , Mullen still has the great gift of being able to hit a canvas - covered circular box with a stick , sometimes even in harmony with the music being played at the time , but he 's just a blurry shape in Bono 's shadow these days .
He 's sort of a man on the band 's dole , and with a paycheck just about the only thing in his " life , " it means a lot to him .
But , as is often the case when a fading star or non-celebrity ( Larry , meet Paris Hilton ! ) realizes that he is no longer part of the A - team and is headed for a career in game shows , he is hit with a heavenly light , and hears the voice from above : " Larry !
Say something really stupid ! "
You wo n't be disappointed .
Surely , not as much as he will be very shortly .
Amid the biggest global meltdown since the Great Depression , with millions out of work , out of their homes , out of food and out of hope , what is the top concern for this almost - has - been ?
That rich and successful people ( like him ) " are unnecessarily humiliated when coming in and out of Ireland , " describing this to The Independent as " part of a new resentment of rich people in this country . "
Well , when the foot 's in , it stays in !
And away he goes : " We have experienced [ a situation ] where coming in and out of the country at certain times is made more difficult than it should be — not only for us , but for a lot of wealthy people , " he fretted .
" The better - off are being sort of humiliated . "
Yes , the man has made quite a point off the top of his head .
Wolfie — as a student of history — is well - aware of the kind of ignominious treatment received by the incredibly wealthy .
Often , their private jets are forced to wait while some slow clunker of a propeller plane lifts off with a heart transplant or something .
Their Rolls - Royces and Bentleys are often held up in traffic because of the congestion caused by people pointlessly driving around to answer a help - wanted ad .
Where , oh where , Larry must wonder , is the special treatment he and his super - rich friends deserve for all they have done — and done for us ?
" You see guys ... bringing a huge amount of money into this country , and they do not deserve to be humiliated , " the former musician declared .
Mullen especially praised developers — whose acumen at raising the Irish standard of living speaks for itself — for their charity work and for all they have done for the country .
" All those rich wives , all those rich guys with all those balls ( Not sure what Larry means here about these guys and their balls , but let 's keep the tape rolling ... ) , all those women that you see organizing this and organizing that , without them we'd be in a very , very different state than we are now . "
Ummm , Larry ?
Have you popped your balding head out the window of your limousine long enough to see the state we are in now ?
Maybe some of those men you know need to have more balls .
Maybe you do , too .
Better have a look .
When asked if this shoddy treatment of the fabulously wealthy had made him think of leaving his beloved Howth , Mullen went into deep thought .
" I certainly thought that if ... if this is what ( super - rich people ) experience ... how can I fly the Irish flag and tell people come to Ireland because it 's great ? "
Larry , if you can bring yourself to do Ireland any favor , please do this : DO NOT FLY THE IRISH FLAG .
It 's not meant for people like you .
But there is room in Larry 's heart for " the little guy . "
Take restaurateur Jay Bourke 's admission he would be forced to close the snobby Eden in Temple Bar unless he got a break on rent .
" It 's my favorite restaurant , " Larry moaned , moved with sympathy for himself .
" I love that restaurant .
'll be broken - hearted if that goes down . "
Well , would n't we all be ?
Where else is the working man , or more likely , the non-working man , going to find his " Caramelized Banana and Praline Parfait " with chocolate nougatine and milk chocolate mousse ?
At McDonald 's , fer Chrissake ?
The world loves Bono not only because of his amazing talent and his genuine , generous joy before a live audience , but for his humanity .
He is one man who has earned his super - richness , and has earned the love of his fans and the respect of the world not just because , as Larry says , he " has brought a lot of money into this country , " but because he has taken a lot of it it out and spread it around — and not just in Ireland , but around the world .
There are people in the world who are have something to eat , who may live through an epidemic , who may see their children grow up in a better world than they knew , because of Bono .
What have YOU done , Larry ?
It should n't come as any surprise that Larry has a different view than others ( human beings ) when it comes to the kind of charity and advocacy work Bono has made U2 symbolic of .
The Herald Sun quoted Bono saying Larry worried that " all my campaigning would sink the ship . "
Was Larry worried that Bono 's work would make the band less - popular ?
Its music less - compelling ?
Or was it , perhaps , that he irrationally feared it might kill the golden goose , and thus deprive him of the rich life he clings to — and this , despite all the " humiliation " he must suffer for having tens of millions to his name ?

My Sunday column looks at the 40 - year “ war on drugs ” and argue that it has failed and that it is time for a dramatic rethink of drug policy .
I have n’t written about drugs before because I ’ve been ambivalent — in particular , I ’ve worried that liberalization would lead to an increase in drug use .
I ’m not one of those who thinks that drugs are fine — on the contrary , I ’ve seen how narcotics can devastate families , even countries .
My home town of Yamhill , Oregon , has been hit hard by the Meth explosion .
Yet over the last year I ’ve swung toward liberalization , for three reasons .
First , the evidence suggests that any increase in use from liberalization would be minor , if there was one at all .
Second , Mexico and Afghanistan have shown how American drug policy empowers foreign cartels / terrorists and destabilizes foreign countries .
Third , the tens of billions of dollars spent on the drug war seem a vast misallocation of resources at a time we ’re struggling to pay for education and health care .
I do n’t know precisely what policy I ’m in favor of .
Decriminalization to start with , as some European countries have done .
But maybe we should look at a legalization model as well , with state liquor stores or pharmacists selling narcotics and raising money through taxes .
With cigarettes we ’ve seen that an aggressive combination of taxation and public health campaigning can reduce addictive behavior , so maybe those are the better tools to apply to narcotics .
I hope to continue looking at these issues and thinking about them .
Your thoughts most welcome .

The largest torrent indexer on the Internet defended itself in court today in a landmark case for the BitTorrent community .
The outcome of the civil dispute between the anti-piracy group BREIN and Mininova will decide if the BitTorrent indexer has to actively filter torrents from the site .
Mininova , based in The Netherlands and founded by five Dutch students , was up against local anti-piracy outfit BREIN in court today .
BREIN ’s lawyer tried to convince the court that Mininova has to remove from their site any torrents linking to unauthorized content .
It also demanded that Mininova should cover the costs of implementing such a system .
Mininova ’s lawyer argued that the site is already taking measures to ensure rights holders can protect their content , and this amounts to more than they are required to do under the law .
The site has a ‘ notice and takedown ’ policy and recently started offering an infohash filter where content owners can blacklist torrents .

Mininova ’s case against BREIN was heard at the Utrecht court .
Three judges have been appointed to the case .
One of them is a replacement for a judge who was taken off the case a few weeks ago because he was connected to the entertainment industry .
The hearing started at 1 PM with BREIN ’s lawyer Dirk Visser .
Visser began by informing the court that Mininova has over 5 million daily users who use the site to download copyrighted content .
A brief look at the site ’s homepage clearly shows that they link to illegal content , and their business models is to make money off the millions of ads that are displayed , he said .
Mininova ’s attempt to offer a distribution platform to publishers through their “ featured content ” section is nonsense , BREIN ’s lawyer insisted .
According to research conducted by BREIN 92 % of the torrents on Mininova point to ‘ illegal ’ content , and the tag cloud with popular searches also shows that illegal content is what people are mainly looking for on the site .
In 2006 and 2007 BREIN and Mininova had lengthy discussions on how to deal with copyrighted content , Visser said .
Mininova wanted BREIN to come up with specific infohashes that should be in the filter , and BREIN wanted Mininova to cover the costs .
They never reached an agreement and the negotiations ended .
All in all Visser is arguing that Mininova aids in distributing copyright infringing works , and BREIN demands that the site installs a filtering mechanism that will put an end to this .
Mininova will have to cover the costs of such a copyright filter themselves , they say .
Next up was Mininova ’s lawyer Vita Zwaan .
She started out by informing the court that this is a landmark case because it ’s the first to make a judgment about the legality of the BitTorrent platform in The Netherlands , pointing out that this case obviously has far reaching consequences .
Zwaan further told the court that , while the hearing was taking place , approximately 180 torrents would be added to the site ’s database and that Mininova has no knowledge of the content currently tracked by these torrents .
In addition Zwaan explained that Mininova has partnerships with content owners to distribute works though their distribution platform .
On top of this , Mininova offers several options for content owners to take ‘ infringing ’ torrents off the site , the lawyer explained .
Together with the Motion Picture Association ( MPA ) , Mininova started experimenting with a content filter through which torrents can taken off the site by the content owners .
The filter trial is a success according to Mininova ’s lawyer , who quoted one of Torrent Freak ’s recent articles to point this out .
BREIN also had to option to participate in the filtering trial so they could see for themselves how it works , but BREIN rejected this offer .
It is unclear what BREIN ’s demands actually are according to Zwaan .
They want Mininova to implement “ preventive measure ” but are vague about the details .
However , BREIN does n’t want to provide the info - hashes for the torrents it wants removed , and argues that this is something Mininova should do themselves .
This is the opposite of what the MPA ( a member of BREIN ) is doing now .
According to Mininova ’s lawyer , this disagreement on who should provide information on what to filter is what the case is all about .
A keyword filter that was proposed by BREIN is unworkable according to Zwaan because it would result in too many false positives .
A filter for the keyword ‘ office ’ , as BREIN suggested , would result in the removal of 92 torrents linking to “ Open Office ” she said .
Mininova ’s lawyer then discussed some of the costs Mininova made thus far to take down torrents upon request from copyright holders ( though the old system ) .
She said that 155,876 takedown requests have been reviewed which cost the site 250,000 euro ( $ 350,000 ) .
In addition , Mininova invested several thousand euros in the content filter .
Zwaan went on to explain that Mininova is not a necessary nor sufficient part of the BitTorrent download process .
Unlike The Pirate Bay they do n’t host a public tracker , and neither do they offer a BitTorrent client through which users can download torrents .
BREIN argued otherwise and this is incorrect Zwaan said .
Towards the end of her plea , Zwaan argued that Mininova is not infringing the rights of various copyright holders as BREIN stated .
She cited several cases in and outside The Netherlands to make point out why , and pointed out that The Pirate Bay may not have been found guilty if they had a notice and takedown policy like Mininova has .
After a short break the hearing continued briefly and the judges asked both lawyers for clarification on some issues .
Mininova ’s lawyer was asked about the moderators that Mininova has , and why they remove porn but not copyrighted content .
Mininova explained that the moderators handle problem reports from users ( about virusses , porn , etc. ) , while the Mininova admins handle the copyright complaints .
The site has around five moderators , a number which the changes from time to time .
After roughly three hours the hearing ended and it ’s now up to the judges to come up with a decision .
The verdict is due on July 15 .
Erik Dubbelboer and the other Mininova founders think they have the law on their side .
“ We have confidence in the outcome of the case and we believe Mininova will continue to exist , ” Erik told TorrentFreak .
This is a developing story , info might be added .
The road to being thrown out of school is paved by missed opportunities for early intervention , a limited curriculum and poor teacher training .
That 's the consensus of educators , parents and students concerned about a school system that suspended 112,829 pupils in Ontario in 2006 - 2007 , the most recent data available .
Another 1,889 students were expelled .
The number of suspensions issued was almost twice as high – 201,224 .
Many students are suspended multiple times , which suggests problems are snowballing .
What 's clear is that teachers and principals spot signs of trouble as early as Grade 1 .
It 's common , teachers say , for elementary students to divert attention from literacy or numeracy problems by acting out – from being the class clown to confronting teachers .
Kevin Battaglia , principal of the Toronto District School Board 's programs for suspended and expelled students , recalls witnessing one Grade 6 child , who was struggling academically , become a deft shoplifter .
" We all have a need to be good at something , " he says .
The education ministry 's figures show 42 per cent of all suspensions in 2006 - 2007 – 42,292 students – were from the elementary grades .
Of expelled students , 14 per cent – 263 – were in elementary school .
Melanie Parrack , the TDSB 's executive superintendent of programs , says the board is making " a concerted effort to focus interventions earlier . "
But more money is needed , she says , for social workers , youth workers , psychologists and teaching assistants .
While some argue principals are too quick to suspend , teachers think otherwise .
" There is a feeling among many of my members that they do n't suspend quickly enough , " said Doug Jolliffe , president of the Toronto branch of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation .
But fewer teachers are complaining since the new law on suspensions and expulsions took effect in February 2008 , he adds .
Anyone suspended more than five days must be offered an alternative academic program .
Help with behavioural issues – anger management , for example – is offered for suspensions longer than 10 days .
Jolliffe says there 's a sense the alternative programs are helping .
" The greatest challenge that teachers have is classroom management , " he says .
" What people forget is that a teacher 's got anywhere from 25 to 35 people in a classroom , most of whom really do n't want to be there for various reasons .
You also have some students that have issues – they 're angry about something that probably has nothing to do with schools . "
Bay St. lawyer Glenn Stuart , who works with a program helping at - risk youth , says students struggle with a school system that values conformity and control .
Many get suspended simply for opposing authority .
" That 's sort of like saying , ` OK , we 're suspending you because you 're 15 . ' "
Jolliffe says principals are n't helping .
They often do n't flag troubled students to teachers .
And the TDSB has been slow to deliver much - needed " crisis management " training , he adds .
Add to that pressure to deliver the curriculum through standardized tests as well as the need for more support staff and the result is " one of the toughest and most stressful jobs you got going , " Jolliffe says .
" A lot of people – and these are good teachers , these are n't time - servers – are feeling a greater sense of depression , a greater sense of frustration .
In some cases that emerges almost as an anger – not at students – but just a generalized anger , " he says .
" Teachers do n't feel they 're part of the great experiment that is public education .
They feel isolated . "
Critics say the new law 's provision of extra resources to expelled and some suspended students reflects the school system 's Catch - 22 : to get help , many students need to be thrown out .
Many students get multiple suspensions every year , for less than five days at a time , and get nothing more than homework .
Yet the accumulated impact can be disastrous :
Studies show that students absent more than 10 per cent of the time are far more likely to drop out .
Once in high school , at - risk students are poorly served by a school system that caters to those bound for university , says Queen 's University professor , Alan King , a leading researcher in education .
At the Toronto District School Board , the 60 per cent of students who do n't go to university are left struggling to find " meaning " in their education – increasing the chances of some being suspended or expelled , he says .
" A lot of kids are caught with very little programming , " says King , who has conducted major studies of the high school system for the Ontario government .
" What you have is a fairly large group of kids ... not particularly well served by the system . "
Especially worrisome in Toronto are cuts to technical programs .
As the system becomes more oriented toward academic studies , students who perform better with hands - on learning " will be marginalized and placed more at risk , " says Chris Wiggins , guidance counsellor for three TDSB programs for expelled and suspended students .
Declining enrolment prompted the board to recently close one of its last trade schools , Timothy Eaton Business and Technical Institute in Scarborough .
The board is working hard to change the negative perception students and parents have of trades , says Parrack .
Compounding the challenge are teachers who largely do n't reflect the diverse cultural makeup of students – particularly in Toronto , says Lance McCready , who heads a project on discipline and classroom management in schools .
" They 're certainly not good at communicating with teenagers , " adds McCready , assistant professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education .
The youngest , least - experienced teachers are given the most challenging classes , says professor Ray Hughes , who teaches student teachers at the University of Western Ontario .
Their reactions to problem behaviours tend to escalate incidents , he adds .
Education Minister Kathleen
Wynne says she 's determined to transform the school system from a " sorting mechanism " that writes off kids who fail to one that caters to every student that enters a school .
Among other initiatives , she points to a new " equity strategy , " designed to ensure that students do n't fall behind due to ethnic or economic background , and the goal of turning schools into " community hubs " that help parents access an array of services .
CASE STUDY : A FUNERAL
On most nights , the six young people gathered around a table in a boardroom at the Black Creek Community Health Centre are here to hang out , maybe eat from the communal kitchen , which tonight smells of a stir - fry that will not quite fill the assembled stomachs and results in a pizza order .
On this spring evening , they are in this mall - front community hub to talk about being suspended .
For some , multiple times , beginning in middle school .
There was often a good reason , like a fight .
But there were questionable reasons , too .
Like being rude , swearing or missing part of a uniform .
" I got suspended , quite a few times , " says Lola Lawson , 18 , who is now at York University studying psychology .
Once it was after her math teacher told Lawson , who was struggling with an assignment , that she should know how to do the work .
She responded : " You 're a teacher and you 're supposed to be teaching . "
Lawson was sent to the office , and home .
" It 's the teacher 's word over yours , that the student is being defiant , or something .
There you go , you get in trouble and suspended for something stupid like that . "
Shantay , 15 , says she was once suspended for missing class to attend a funeral .
Andrew , 19 , began getting suspended in Grade 5 - " One of my friends started getting suspended in kindergarten " - but served the punishments in school .
" I actually liked it .
I got to know my principal very well , so that was good , " he said .

CASE STUDY : A BELLY BUMP
Can a tuque be cause for a suspension and a court date ?
It can if it also includes an alleged " belly bump . "
On a wintry day in January 2008 , James and several other students had finished their final exam and were outside a class in jackets preparing to go home .
One or two of the teens had had tuques seized previously by a teacher , headgear being a no - no inside school .
They wanted them back .
The kids said they were jovial that day and that they were joking with the teacher and the teacher was joking back .
In court , the teacher had a markedly different recollection :
He was not joking .
He said the tuque could be picked up several hours later .
He testified that James ( not his real name ) bumped him chest - to - chest , once " really hard " just as another boy behind applied a similar move , making for a teacher belly - bump sandwich .
The principal , after seeing a grainy video of the incident that showed no faces , called police .
James , now 16 , was charged with assault .
He was suspended and handed a limited expulsion .
He could not return to his Durham Region Catholic high school .
He missed 10 days of the start of the next semester before being put in a new school .
His parents hired a lawyer and appealed .
Months later , it was agreed the expulsion would disappear from his school record if his behaviour remained good .
The criminal case went ahead .
" This matter here today , " James 's lawyer , Selwyn Pieters , said in his closing argument in the assault trial , " is trifling , very , very trifling .
This is not a criminal matter . "
And there was certainly not enough evidence there to convict , he said .
Justice Paul Bellefontaine agreed , acquitting James .

CASE STUDY : A TOKE
" Are you sure you do n't have weed ? "
Rayshawn had never seen the guy before , part of a group of young men who approached him and some friends in the yard of his Scarborough high school last September .
No , Rayshawn replied , he did not .
The guy did not believe Rayshawn and , in anger and allegedly aiming to rob him , pulled out a handgun .
Rayshawn ( not his real name ) wrestled with the gunman and several shots were fired , striking one bystander .
The school was locked down and the incident made front - page headlines .
Amid fears for his safety , Rayshawn was sent home to recover .
He would never return to that school , nor would he go to any school - for five months .
Within days of the gun incident , stories made it to the principal 's office that Rayshawn was dealing drugs at school - cause for a mandatory suspension and possible expulsion .
Rayshawn admitted smoking weed on school property .
Rayshawn was suspended for 19 days .
But for a number of reasons , including concerns for his safety and offers to go to other schools that did not work out , those days stretched into months .
Late in the year , the board offered him a spot in a pre-employment program .
For a month , he learned about saving money and other life skills , and was paid $ 250 a week .
That was a good thing that happened , says Rayshawn 's mom .
Otherwise , he lost his semester .
" I feel as if they do n't even care , " she says .
" They just stick the child out of class , provide no work .
I mean , what happens to the child 's mental frame of mind ?
He 's sitting here wondering , ' Why am I at home ?
I 'm not getting no work . '
When he does return to school now , you feel kind of lost because you have that big gap in between . "
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Scientists asked people around the world on Monday to help compile an Internet - based observatory of life on earth as a guide to everything from the impact of climate change on wildlife to pests that can damage crops .

“ I would hope that ... we might even have millions of people providing data ” in the long term , James Edwards , head of the Encyclopedia of Life ( EOL ) based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , told Reuters of the 10 - year project .
He said scientific organizations were already working to link up thousands of computer databases of animals and plants into a one - stop “ virtual observatory ” that could be similar to global systems for monitoring the weather or earthquakes .
People in many countries already log observations on the Internet , ranging from sightings of rare birds in Canada to the dates on which flowers bloom in spring in Australia .
The new system , when up and running , would link up the disparate sites .
About 400 biology and technology experts from 50 countries will meet in London from June 1 - 3 at an “ e- Biosphere ” conference organized by the EOL to discuss the plans .
The EOL is separately trying to describe the world ’s species online .
“ This would be a free system that everyone can access and contribute to , ” said Norman MacLeod , keeper of paleontology at the Natural History Museum in London which is hosting the talks .
Edwards said a biodiversity overview could have big economic benefits , for instance an unusual insect found in a garden might be an insect pest brought unwittingly in a grain shipment that could disrupt local agriculture .
Among health benefits could be understanding any shifts in the ranges of malaria - carrying mosquitoes linked to global warming , Edwards said .
“ Within 10 years , scientists say they could have an efficient and effective way of tracking changes over time in the range and abundance of plants and animals as worldwide temperature and precipitation patterns shift , ” a statement said .
And plane accidents might be averted by studying DNA genetic samples of birds sucked into jet engines and the timing , altitude and routes of bird migrations .
The observatory could give a benchmark for monitoring the rate of extinctions , for instance , to threats led by loss of habitats to farms , cities and roads .
It could also help people in their everyday lives -- anyone planning to visit a local forest could study trees , flowers , animals or insects that might be seen on a hike .

The colossal star probably gave way to a black hole , scientists say
The cataclysmic explosion of a giant star early in the history of the Universe is the most distant single object ever detected by telescopes .
The colossal blast was picked up first by Nasa 's Swift space observatory which is tuned to see the high - energy gamma - rays emitted from extreme events .
Other telescopes then followed up the signal , confirming the source to be more than 13 billion light - years away .
Scientists say the star 's destruction probably resulted in a black hole .
" This gets us into a realm where we 've never been before , " said Professor Nial Tanvir , of the University of Leicester , UK .
" This is the most remote gamma - ray burst ( GRB ) ever detected , and also the most distant object ever discovered . "
Fast mover
The Swift satellite was launched in 2004 to investigate the energetic flashes that characterise some of the Universe 's most violent happenings .
A GAMMA -RAY BURST RECIPE
Models assume GRBs arise when giant stars burn out and collapse During collapse , super - fast jets of matter burst out from the stars Collisions occur with gas already shed by the dying behemoths
The interaction generates the energetic signals detected by Swift Remnants of the huge stars end their days as black holes Led by the US space agency , the mission has significant UK and Italian contributions .
It is a three - in - one observatory .
Its Burst Alert Telescope is set up to catch the initial flood of gamma rays .
The spacecraft then swings itself to look directly into the flash with X -ray and ultraviolet / visible telescopes .
This longer wavelength afterglow lasts on the order of hours to days and Swift also calls up ground - based observatories to join the spectacle .
Indeed , it is the ground campaign that establishes the distance .
This burst , dubbed GRB 090423 , was detected by Swift on 23 April .
Follow - up observations were led by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and the Gemini North Telescope , both on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
Cosmic expansion Analysis of the light spectrum confirmed the blast had a redshift of 8.2 .
Redshift is a measure of the degree to which light has been " stretched " by the expansion of the Universe .
The greater the redshift , the more distant the object and the earlier it is being seen in cosmic history .
Ground facilities like the UK Infrared Telescope were also involved The figure 8.2 equates to a distance of 13.035 billion light - years .
Put another way , the explosion is being viewed when the Universe was only 630 million years old , a mere one - 20th of its current age ( estimated to be 13.7 billion years old ) .
The previous record holder was a GRB witnessed , also by Swift , in September 2008 .
It had a redshift of 6.7 , making it 190 million light - years closer than GRB 090423 .
Scientists have seen what they believe may be faint galaxies at redshifts 8 - 10 , but their true nature is still being investigated .
Researchers are very keen to probe these great distances because they will learn how the early Universe evolved , and that will help them explain why the cosmos looks like it does now .
' Fried ' gas Scientists believe the super - hot conditions that existed after the Big Bang eventually cooled sufficiently to allow protons , neutrons and electrons to form neutral atoms of hydrogen and helium .
When the first stars formed , from infalling clouds of hydrogen and helium , they lit up the cosmos .
Swift swings itself around to look at the direction of a blast
What is more , these hot , young stars produced so much intense ultraviolet radiation , they " fried " the gas around them - tearing electrons off neutral atoms to leave the diffuse plasma we detect between the stars even today .
The star which ended its days as GRB 090423 was very probably among that early population of giants responsible for this re-ionisation .
Professor Tanvir said : " The re-ionisation era was a change that occurred in the Universe when the first stars switched on ; but the actual timescale for that and the processes at work are poorly understood because we have so few observations .
We 're now pushing into that epoch . "
Professor Gerry Gilmore , from Cambridge University , UK , commented : " [ This ] was probably one of the first stars that ever formed in the Universe ; and it will have been one of the first things that ever created stuff like carbon , nitrogen and oxygen that led then to normal stars like our Sun and the planets forming much , much later on .
" This is really a crucial stage of the Universe .
The fact that we can see that long ago is just astonishing , " he told BBC News .

WASHINGTON .—
El director general de la Oficina de Naciones Unidas para la Droga y el Delito ( ONUDD ) , Antonio María Costa , afirmó que en la lucha internacional contra el tráfico de drogas “ México es un caso extraordinariamente violento y una situación sin par en el mundo ” .
Al presentar ayer el Reporte Mundial sobre Drogas 2009 , el funcionario del organismo internacional expresó ante periodistas mexicanos lo que piensa realmente de la situación en México y que no incluyó en las conclusiones del documento .
“ Yo personalmente tomé la responsabilidad de remover cualquier mención específica al país ” para no herir las susceptibilidades del gobierno mexicano , mencionó .
En el mismo acto , la encargada en funciones de la agencia antinarcóticos de Estados Unidos ( DEA ) , Michele Leonhart , consideró que la lucha del presidente Felipe Calderón está teniendo éxito “ y se demuestra con la salida a la luz de casos de corrupción policial ” , comentó .
Por su parte , el zar antidrogas estadounidense , Gil Kerlikowske , descartó que la legalización de algunas drogas “ esté en el vocabulario del presidente Barack Obama ” ; anunció que visitará México en julio .

Reading As Resistance
Free Gaza Movement launches its � Right to Read� Campaign Free Gaza Movement " Education is a right .
Yet throughout history , societies have used access to education as a weapon of oppression .
We refuse to let Israel blockade our students � thirst for knowledge .
We welcome working with Free Gaza and others to break this siege against our people�s greatest resource . "
Dr. Haidar Eid , professor at Al - Aqsa University
June 10 , 2009
About the Campaign
In partnership with Al - Aqsa University , the Free Gaza Movement ( FG ) is launching its " Right to Read " campaign which will use the FG boats to deliver textbooks and other educational supplies to universities throughout the occupied Gaza Strip .
This is not a charitable endeavor .
Rather it is an act of solidarity and resistance to Israel�s chokehold on Gaza and attempt to deny Palestinians education .
According to UNWRA , Israel�s blockade prevents ink , paper and other learning materials from entering into Gaza .
Our first shipment will be sent on FG�s Summer of Hope July voyage to Gaza .
How You Can Help
Our campaign invites individuals to join us at a person - to - person level by contributing one or more books to our shipment as an expression of resistance to the blockade .
This effort also allows institutions around the world to support Palestinians� right to education by donating new and used copies of textbooks to be delivered by the Free Gaza Movement to universities in the Gaza Strip .
You can donate funds to purchase books ( and / or help offset shipping costs to Cyprus ) or you can send new and used books directly for inclusion on an upcoming voyage .

But that is actually just the most recent in a long line of amazing , often ancient artifacts turning up in random places like garage sales or just collecting on the same shelf where somebody was storing their old comic books .
Recently there was an inspirational story about a person who found a bottle in their basement , containing some mysterious scraps with writing that turned out to be a long - lost message from some concentration camp survivors .
5 The $ 800,000 Stradivarius Violin

Lost :
Have you ever sat your coffee on top of your car , intending to grab it before you get behind the wheel , only to forget about it ?
Then you go driving off and it falls onto the road somewhere while you stare confused at your empty cup holder ?
What would you say is the worst possible scenario for something like that ?
Other than , say , leaving your newborn infant up there ?
That brings us to the story of The Duke of Alcantara , which is not a person but a 267 - year - old Stradivarius violin ( when an instrument is valued at $ 800,000 , they tend to give it a pimp name ) .
The violin was donated to UCLA at some point in its long lifespan , and wound up in the hands of David Margetts , the second violinist for the UCLA string quartet .
He borrowed the violin on August 2 , 1967 from the university for a rehearsal in Hollywood .

An $ 800,000 loaner ?
Yeah , UCLA apparently trusted the shit out of David Margetts .
They should n't have .
He was on his way home and stopped to get groceries , leaving his car unlocked .
When he got back , he was minus one violin and was in some serious shit with UCLA .
Surely some thieves had stolen it , recognizing it for its rarity and extraordinary value !
They were probably selling it to sophisticated international criminals that very moment !

Fast forward 27 years to 1994 .
A violin dealer repairing a ( you guessed it ) violin , realized that , holy shit , he was working on a Stradivarius two and a half centuries old and worth more than he made in a decade .

He looked up the particular violin and found out it had been missing from UCLA all this time .
The violin was now owned by an amateur violinist by the name of Teresa Salvato , who had gotten it in her divorce settlement .
Wondering how the musical equivalent of that guy who always " totally has to show you a song he wrote " at parties ended up with an $ 800,000 violin , UCLA did a little asking around and found out the violin was given to Teresa 's husband by his aunt ... who found the Stradivarius on the side of a freeway one evening in 1967 .
So what we were saying earlier , about the cup of coffee ?
Yeah , it appears that 's what David did with the violin .
Air pollution has long been a fact of life in Spanish cities , but scientists now say that it is not just smog that chokes people as they walk to work or stroll through the park .
American diplomats here have concluded that a quarter of the homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and half of those in the Gaza Strip are empty , raising questions about the Israeli Government 's contention that it is expanding the settlements to accommodate natural growth .
The American figures , disclosed by the daily newspaper Haaretz and confirmed by United States officials , were immediately denounced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as groundless and dismissed by the Jewish settlers as false .
The settlements have long been one of the most contentious issues between the United States and Israel , and Mr. Netanyahu 's determination to expand them has been criticized by American officials as hampering peace efforts because the settlements make it more difficult to negotiate a territorial compromise between Israel and the Palestinians .
After the disclosure today of the American findings , Edward Abington , the American Consul General in Jerusalem , said the reported vacancy rate '' strikes me as undercutting the argument that settlement expansion is based on natural growth and demand for housing . ''
A suburban " mother - to - be " has infuriated the right - to - life community in America by admitting a blog she had written for more than two months tracking her pregnancy with a child diagnosed with a terminal disease was nothing more than a fantasy , albeit one that had attracted an online audience of a million or more .
Beccah Beushausen , a 26 - year - old social worker from the outskirts of Chicago , almost unwittingly hit a nerve in a country where the battle over abortion rights still rages .
Last month , a doctor in Kansas , George Tiller , was gunned down while serving as an usher in church .
Mr Tiller was one of only a small number of doctors in the United States willing to perform late - term terminations in circumstances where the mother 's life may be at risk .
Even the most fervent of pro-life groups condemned the killing of Mr Tiller and reiterated their opposition to violence .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Ms Beushausen , throngs of conservative Christians and right - to - life advocates thought they had found a living symbol of their deepest - felt beliefs : a woman who was committed to bringing to term a pregnancy she knew would give her a child – April - Rose – who was destined to live perhaps only weeks , days or even hours .
The blog , a well - written and heart - rending account of her pregnancy that was peppered with Biblical quotes and featured a Christian music track , took off in ways she now says she had not expected .
Other mainstream Christian websites , many dedicated to the right - to - life cause , began channelling their readers to it .
Fans of the blog began sending gifts – pairs of booties , blankets , hair bows , even money – to Ms Beushausen , who online called herself only " B " .
The entry describing April - Rose 's delivery informed the blog audience that the child had died hours after delivery , as her mother had feared .
But " B " – she sometimes also referred to herself simply as " April 's Mom " – did manage to post a picture of herself holding the infant swaddled in blankets .
By then a cyber- celebrity in the world of anti-abortion activists , Ms Beushausen 's post on that day lit up with nearly one million hits .
However , in her determination to sustain the illusion , Ms Beushausen had posed for the photograph not with a baby , but a plastic doll .
One reader spotted the deception and word of the deceit quickly spread .
Even though Ms Beushausen moved quickly to take down the website and accounts on Twitter and Facebook , she was quickly identified .
The response among her legion of followers has ranged from fury to sympathy .
For her part , Ms Beushausen acknowledged the fraud to her local newspaper , the Chicago Tribune , last weekend , and put up a last post offering her apologies .
She has revealed that while the entire story was made up – the pregnancy never happened – she was using the blog in part to deal with the real sadness of having lost a baby boy four years before .
" I lied to a community of people whose only intention was to support me through this time and that is wrong , and for that I am sorrier than you could know , " she said in the final post last Sunday , adding that she actually had lost babies " more than once " and had lied because she was " dealing with unresolved pain " .

Ms Beushausen has said that the gifts she received have now been given to charity .
" I do n't feel the need to exploit either the Christian community or the sanctity of human life any further , " she went on .
" Forgive me and understand on some level that I am a broken woman .
" I do understand why people are mad , and so does she , " Anna Beushausen , her sister , acknowledged this week .
" I see pieces of her life in there .
She is so remorseful , and she is in immense pain . "
One of the first to become suspicious of the events described on the site – littleoneapril .
blogspot.com – was Elizabeth Russell , a dollmaker from upstate New York .
" I have that exact doll in my house , " she said .
" As soon as I saw that picture , I knew it was a scam . "
She then started a counter - blog to expose the fabrication .
For her trouble , she was bombarded with hate mail .
Jennifer McKinney of Minnesota , who has written her own blogs about a difficult pregnancy , is not impressed by the belated mea culpa .
" To be honest , I think she is far from recognising the true gravity of the situation , " she said .
But Raechal Myers of Tennessee , who sold T - shirts to raise money for Ms Beusheusen and sent her hundreds of dollars has no regrets .
" She 's someone who needed love and attention , " she says , " which we gave her " .

The ' pregnancy '
" Everything that has happened so far seems to be setting the stage , so to speak , for a miracle .
I am carrying April , still .
Not knowing what will happen next .
I have another appointment on Thursday and that one will hopefully bring concrete answers .
Though , as much as I say I want them , I do n't think I will want them when they come .
I have been completely humbled to get emails , comments , prayer requests , etc. Humbled that God is using me and April to bring Him glory . "
The ' birth ' ( described by a friend , ' Rachael ' )
" B is having frequent contractions now and is up and moving around .
Active labour is only just beginning and B has a lot more work to do before April comes .
B is pushing .
April is doing well so far and will be here soon .
Lord , be near .
April is here !
Praise Jesus ! "

Model - based Engineering for Embedded Systems
The AADL framework allows the analysis of system designs ( and system of systems designs ) prior to development and supports an architecture - centric , model - based development approach throughout the system lifecycle .
AADL is targeted at real - time systems , embedded systems where sensors and actuators are tightly coupled with software components and facilitate the analysis of interactions between hardware and software components .
It focuses on system design specification using a rich , formal semantics that can be used to analyze and generate the system .
The AADL standard :
gives you the power to specify and generate a single model that can be analyzed for multiple qualities
provides an industry - standard , textual and graphic notation with precise semantics to model applications and execution platforms
features an XML interchange format that supports the exchange of models between subcontractors , integrators , and agencies
includes a UML profile that presents AADL as a specialized modeling notation within UML framework
is supported by commercial and open source tool solutions
Understanding the Model
An AADL model contains component types and implementation with their interfaces , subcomponents , and other properties .
It defines the system in a hierarchical manner , with a top component called the root system and other component categories are grouped into three clusters : hardware , software , and hybrid .
The language is constantly being evolved by the standardization committee .
Benefits
The SAE AADL standard can lower development and maintenance costs by

But American military justice law , which is the model for the military commission rules , bars members of the armed services who are facing capital charges from pleading guilty .
Partly to assure fairness when execution is possible , court - martial prosecutors are required to prove guilt in a trial even against service members who want to plead guilty .
ambiguous
military law
Lawyers who were asked about the administration ’s proposed change in recent days said it appeared to be intended for the Sept. 11 case .
“ They are trying to give the 9/11 guys what they want : let them plead guilty and get the death penalty and not have to have a trial , ” said Maj .
David J. R. Frakt of the Air Force , a Guantánamo defense lawyer .
Cmdr . Suzanne M. Lachelier , a Navy lawyer for one of the detainees in the Sept. 11 case , Ramzi Bin al - Shibh , said of the Obama administration , “ They ’re encouraging martyrdom . ”
Martyr
This , You Asshole ... Bring it On
terra
went shopping
OK , here we go ; US Military law does not really allow for guilty pleas in cases where the death penalty is a possible outcome .
According to the New York Times today , President Obama and his administration are looking at ways to make this law less ambiguous .
The push to clarify this comes from military prosecutors who do n't want to have to put on an entire case if a defendant pleads guilty .... really ?... Is n't putting on cases sorta what they do ?
Why ?
Well , what comes to mind immediately for me is that the military is a very controlling apparatus , just like , say , a terrorist group , in that there is a strong belief system so deeply held that one would gladly die for it , to keep a code of silence , or to become a martyr .
When young recruits are broken down and built back up , they are imbued with a code that could maybe , in some off chance , in a system that has been proven time and again to be imperfect , falsely incriminate themselves .
If that part of the law was left " " maybe it was so that cases could be decided on their individual merits and depending on the judge .
I 'm happy to have all of the evidence presented if we are going to put anyone to death , much less a soldier or an enemy combatant .
There are certain standards of morality and ethics that have to be upheld , even if it seems like an exercise to these supposed prosecutors .
I 'm no law expert , and I 'm definitely noexpert , but in the middle of a certain amount of confusing backpedaling by the Obama Administration , I find it incredibly disconcerting to hear that the idea is being kicked around to allow certain Guantanamo detainees to plead guilty to the 9 - 11 attack and therefore be executed without a full trial .
This is not because there is some 100 % way to know they are guilty .
Their stated intent has been to die as martyrs by execution , and because their confessions are completely the fruit of torture techniques that have been proven to elicit false confessions , it would seem to be a little counter intuitive to just give them what they want .
It would , however , make the problem of what we did to them go away pretty nicely !
It appears to me that Obama has had to backtrack on the military tribunals because in a regular court these guys might just go free under the weight of how these confessions were coerced out of these very same detainees .
The idea of cutting out the tribunal altogether is not only far fetched but pretty unbelievable !
We may need a new set of laws and a new sort of prison to deal with this sort of detainee over the long term , but I 've got to say that putting them to death on the strength of confession elicited by torture is not the way to go .
As much as the New York Times seems to be sure that this idea has legs in the administration , it seems like a long shot that it could ever work .
The administration is , for some reason , going to great lengths to try to prevent the details of torture on the Bush watch from coming out , but in so doing they are implicating the Obama administration as more of the same .
This is a slippery slope that none of us wants to start sliding down ; and I 'm afraid that we are already there .
It seems that alot of this revolves around the 9 - 11 case and our usual need for vengeance by death penalty .
According to the Times I can just hear the wheels turning in the conspiracy theorists minds .
But , if this is just about that pound of flesh , and also serves to cover up the crimes committed by the Bush Administration , its not worth the long term effect on the law and our constitution , which will be skirted in a way that will not serve anyone but the Bush folks , who really need to be at least investigated !
Which is exactly right , and a shortsighted band - aid on a long term problem , exacerbated by the very treatment that is now being glossed over in this way .
The Bush answer to martyrs would be " ! "
But that reverberates across the world and creates thousands of more of these same guys .
Hiding what happened is not goign to prevent more terrorism ; its going to incite it .
The best thing that we can do is , if they want to plead guilty , have a trial and then keep them in a small cell forever ; take the execution option off the table , at least .
The need to make the torture facts go away is a crime in itself , and the need for a pound of flesh in regards to 9 - 11 is a big example of human weakness .
What would Jesus do , after all ?
I say that as a non-religious person trying to understand the methods and logic of how these things work in the minds of good religious and community minded people of all ilks .
If heaven and martyrdom is the ultimate gift to some , and death is the ultimate punishment to others , where do logical people find a common ground ?
Considering that we each live on this earth for a speck of time in the grander scheme of history , and considering that it seems like a relatively long time to us , during which we go through many changes mentally , does n't it make sense that perhaps the better punishment for a criminal is to make them live out their lives in a high security facility with little contact with the outside world ?
Is our need to cover up our own misdeeds so strong that we would , in their minds anyway , let them go freely to their reward in heaven ?
And if there is the slightest possibility for these guys to ever fully realize the gravity of what they 've done and to suffer the anguish of having to live with it , day in and day out , into old age , is n't that a worse punishment ?
The real story may lie in the fear that we have of realizing the gravity of what was done in our names while we crumbled to theand .
We are all guilty of that , but our system and our way of being should allow for us to look at that so that it never can happen again .
The ruined cases of these alleged 9 - 11 conspirators will go down in history as a reason that we do n't torture ; you cant make a real case out of what you find out that way .
If President Obama is behind this misguided idea , I 'm going to have a very hard time reconciling the image that he presents in his wonderful speeches around the world with this ass backward , Bushian idea .
I never thought I would agree with President Obama on everything , but on the issue of torture and holding the previous administration accountable , its going to be very hard to get past what seems to be purposeful governmental roadblocks to justice !
I 've said it before and I 'll keep saying it :
We can not heal and learn from the past unless and until we look hard at what went on , the good and the bad ; there is no moving on !
There is only repetition of our mistakes until we fully understand what went into making them .
Alot of that may be fear , and fear is an issue that human beings have alot of trouble looking at .
But , if we do n't look , we can be controlled by it ; and thats exactly what happened !!
So , face it , and move ahead ; but do it in the right way , like real Americans , not scared and embarassed children .
My theory at this point is to wait and see , but I would hope that some sort of check and balance system would kick in in order to give the people a voice .
In the meantime , I am heading over to the White House page to drop him a note .

Research on Later Abortions What This Is
This website was created as both a memorial to the lifework of Dr. George Tiller and as a living testimony to the courageous lives of abortion providers .
Here you will find stories of individuals who have dedicated their lives to making abortion safe , legal , healthy , and accessible to women and girls .
These people may be nurses , counselors , escorts , volunteers at abortion funds , or abortion doctors themselves .
You will not see the faces of these providers to protect their safety .
What you will see is the story they decide to share - how they came to abortion work , what their function is at their abortion clinic , or their personal abortion story .
We want to humanize these individuals to convey the kindness , courtesy , justice , love , and respect they have for women and the health care choices women make .
We share our stories in hopes of ending clinic violence , to alleviate the shame associated with the abortion experience , and as an homage to Dr. Tiller 's outstanding and courageous life work .
Please respect this space as one of compassion , dignity and love .
We do not cover our faces out of shame .
We do so to recognize an unfortunate aspect of the lives of abortion providers -- we must always be wary of our safety .
No one knew this better than Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller Works in Salt Lake City , Utah I live in the most conservative state in the west and grew up in a Mormon , fundamentalist , conservative home .
I was raised to believe all the “ expected ” messages about abortion and was taught to be very judgmental towards women who chose to be sexual , free and unapologetic .
I believed I was Pro Life because of all of the terrible things I had heard about abortion and the types of women that had abortions .
It was n’t until I myself became sexually active when I was almost 18 yrs old that I began to understand the impact of sex and sexuality for a woman .
Women , by design , face choices that are extremely individual , private and dare I say - sacred .
We do bear an enormous responsibility when it comes to decisions that are made regarding birth control , pregnancy , family and parenthood .
Boom - I suddenly became Pro Choice because I knew that if my birth control ever failed that I would be kicked out of my home , sent to live with a Mormon “ foster ” family for pregnant girls and forced to have a baby that would be placed for adoption whether I wanted to be a mother or not .
I was 25 years old when my step mother told me about the abortion she had when she was 17 in 1963 .
Abortion was illegal .
Luckily for her she comes from a wealthy family and her uncle was a
Dr that provided documentation that she had been exposed to small pox during her first trimester which would allow her ( if she could find a provider ) an abortion - hopefully .
She and my grandmother flew from Louisiana to Sacramento , California to see a Dr they have never spoken to in hopes that he would refer them to someone that could help them .
When they got to his office he was angry and adamant that he knew NOTHING about abortion or providers and to leave his office immediately .
They went back to the hotel , stunned and devastated .
Then the phone rang .
It was the Dr they just met and he was calling from a pay phone .
He apologized for the way he treated them and explained that his office was bugged and under FBI surveillance and that he DID know where they could go but that they would have to leave now .
He directed them to a tiny motel on the California / Mexico border .
He told them that when they checked in to ask for a specific person that would give them a bag of clothing and instructions on what to do next .
They drove all night and arrived at the dirty , cheap motel early that morning .
They checked in and received the bag of clothing with the instructions to get dressed and that a car would be there shortly to pick them up .
The clothes were old , scrappy rags and included a handkerchief that my step mother was to use to cover her hair - she was disguised as a young , Hispanic migrant farm worker .
A station wagon arrived and picked up at least 10 young girls , all dressed in disguise and they were driven across the border into Mexico to a medical complex .
She was approximately 25 weeks pregnant and the procedure was agonizing .
None of the girls were given anesthesia because if something were to go “ wrong ” or if the office was raided , they could n’t risk having a room full of white girls knocked out and unable to run out .
My step mother hemorrhaged and had to undergo a rudimentary D&C - again , with no anesthesia or sedatives .
The cost of the abortion was almost $ 5,000 which by today ’s standards is like $ 20,000 .
The station wagon came back that evening and picked up the girls , drove back to the motel and dropped everyone off .
No medical care was provided , no medications were offered and no follow up was available .
She had no idea if she would ever stop bleeding or if she might get an infection and die .
This was abortion before Roe .
When I became a divorced , single mom I went back to school and ended up serving an internship with Planned Parenthood .
This led to a job offer and I spent 5 years as a reproductive health counselor , community educator and staff training coordinator .
During my time with PP I encountered nearly every possible client situation .
This led me to the realization that while I considered myself a pro-choice woman , the only experience I had with abortion was from the shock pictures and videos on the internet and my step mother ’s experience nearly 3 decades earlier .
I decided to volunteer at one of the local abortion clinics in Salt Lake City .
As I entered the clinic I understood that there was a very real possibility that what I saw that day may cause me to change my mind as to whether or not I supported abortion rights and believe it or not , I was ok with the possibility that I may change my mind .
I have always been open minded re . both sides of the abortion issue .
I was nervous but I firmly believed that I owed it to my clients to know , without a shadow of a doubt , where I stood .
I needed to know that I was honest and trustworthy when I said that I supported her right to choose .
I believe my clients deserved that .
As I entered the clinic in my scrubs I was immediately told that they next time I came , PLEASE do n’t wear scrubs because it easily identified the medical professionals that worked at the clinic and thus provided an easy target for anti-choicers that may want to hurt or kill us .
I was stunned .
It never occurred to me that I could be killed for supporting reproductive choice .
It sent a chill up my spine .
What I experienced in clinic that day was heart wrenching .
The clients were scared and nervous but also grateful .
The “ shock ” media images I had seen in the past never entered my mind .
I was focused on serving the client - serving her future , supporting her very personal decision .
I encountered a woman whose birth control pills failed , another whose EC failed and a young couple that had found out ( yet again ) that their planned and wanted pregnancy was doomed with life threatening genetic anomalies that were not compatible with life .
She had already spontaneously miscarried a pregnancy at 6 months due to the same genetic issues and they decided together that they could not emotionally deal with another tragedy like this .
After spending the day with clients I left even MORE resolved in my support for choice .
I returned several more times to volunteer as a recovery room support person ….. talking with women before their abortion , holding their hand during the abortion , wiping away their tears and attending to their needs after the abortion .
One of the clients actually came to see me at my Planned Parenthood clinic and brought me a gift .
She said my support and kindness had made all the difference for her .
She was grateful I took the time to just be with her .
I just recently moved to Albuquerque , New Mexico and have spend some time at a clinic owned and operated by Dr Curtis Boyd ; a peer of Dr. Tiller ’s .
I will continue to work for women and for choice .
I am raising my daughter to understand and respect herself and other women .
She will never be taught the bigoted and hateful things I was taught .
She knows what abortion is and why it is something that has to be protected .
I am proud to be raising a daughter that will carry the mission of reproductive choice .
We are Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller works in Missouri I am a student in a very conservative area where women are not likely to receive the care they need in the event of an unwanted pregnancy .
I discovered this personally when I found myself pregnant three years ago .
After taking the pill to terminate an unwanted pregnancy , I developed complications which local hospitals refused to treat , as there was still human chorionic gonadotropin in my blood .
This means , in the eyes of the doctors treating me , I was still pregnant , and in order to have an abortion in Missouri , you must wait 24 hours .
No one wanted to take care of the products of conception remaining in my uterus , which caused an infection .
I am lucky .
I was able to return early to the clinic where I was given the medication to terminate the pregnancy .
They were able to treat me , and I am still fertile , should I decide , on my terms , to have another child .
My career goals have changed due to this .
Women who have been brave enough to share their own stories with me all say one thing : they wanted someone to stand beside them .
Some of them had support ; unfortunately , many did n’t .
It is my intention now to continue my education in nursing so that I may specialize in gynecological care and work in an abortion clinic where , at least in some capacity , I may be an advocate to women just like those I spoke to , to women just like myself .
So often these women have no advocate , and they are left feeling alone and scared during a time when they need support .
Many of these women have spouses who do not know they are terminating a pregnancy because they are in abusive situations where pregnancy is forced on them .
Many of these women have friends who are so vehemently against their choice to terminate that the friendship is lost .
In any case , what I want to provide is a hand , an ear , and a shoulder .
I want the women whom I will care for in my capacity as a nurse to know that I am their advocate , that I respect and support not only their choice but THEM .
This is why I am Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller Works in New York .
When I was teaching in a low - income inner-city high school in Texas , I saw too many of my students leaving school to have babies .
The girls would miss class here and there for their doctor ’s appointments , then as their pregnancy progressed they would attend school with decreasing frequency , until finally they stopped showing up altogether .
Some girls would come back to school after they had the baby ; some would n’t ever return .
One of my students had two children by the time she was in tenth grade .
I saw future after future destroyed , and it was devastating .
Texas law does not permit minors to obtain an abortion without their parents ’ permission .
There was no “ choice ” for these girls , many of them coming from impoverished Catholic families who would not have supported terminating the pregnancy .
I decided during my time teaching that I would strive to be a champion for reproductive justice for all women .
I applied to medical school and am now in my third year , getting ready to apply to a residency program in Obstetrics & Gynecology .
I aspire to eventually complete a fellowship in Family Planning .
My experiences in med school have only strengthened my convictions ; I have seen first hand how abortion and contraception are a vital part of high quality health care .
In today ’s political climate , where Republicans have launched a war on women ’s health , I am more determined than ever to be the best provider I can be .
Every time I hear a conservative lamenting the evils of abortion and contraception , I just smile and remind myself of all of the women I will serve in my lifetime , whose lives will be improved because of the control they have over their fertility .

I ’m a medical student doing a summer program with Medical Students For Choice , and I ’m blogging about my experience here .
It has been fantastic in so many ways to do this work .
I come in early every day I ’m there to escort patients past the protestors .
Every friend I ’ve brought in to escort with me has found it just as empowering as I have and come back to keep escorting .
Inside the clinic , I ’m surrounded by people who are committed to abortion access .
They understand the high bar and the dire need for patient comfort .
Best of all , they ’re all enthusiastic about teaching me .
Whatever field of medicine I go into , the surgical experience will be valuable , and I ’ll be better able to serve those patients of mine who have undergone or will undergo one of the most common surgeries in the country .

I started at the clinic in 2007 as the Administrative Assistant and have since moved into the position of Risk Manager .
Having an administrative background at the clinic for a few years I felt that I would be adequately prepared for doing paperwork , keeping employees up to date with certifications and training and helping to do state reports of complications and taking emergency calls .
However , in the last few months , in the wake of the Gosnell tragedy , I have found my job to be more political , detailed , and sometimes difficult than I could have imagined .
The state ’s new regulations regarding Serious Event reporting and clinic inspections has caused a lot of confusion on the part of good clinics and the DOH alike .
I feel like it creates more problems with patient confidentiality .
The rules , to an extent , are so vague that we are always wondering if we are doing too much or too little .
We have had to change policies several times , have been bombarded with questions that we do n’t feel have anything to do with patient safety and the staff is on edge whenever the inspectors come in ( not to mention this can disrupt patient flow if the doctor needs to be pulled away for questions ) .
Of course , I always do and always will continue to make these changes and and follow policies accordingly with a smile on my face because it ’s what I believe in .
It needs to be done and it needs to be done with passion , compassion , and belief that this fight will continue .
I am motivated by so many things in my profession .
From a simple thank you over the phone to a hug from a patient to the anti-choice faction standing outside telling me to “ get a real job . ”
All of these things make me want to go to work everyday and wonder what else I can do to make not only the patients , but my co-worker ’s day a little bit better .
The women that I work with motivate me to constantly do more and more and keep learning .
I was never told that abortion was n’t an option , I was never told NOT to do this and now I know it ’s exactly what I ’m supposed to be doing .
I hope one day to branch out and help with more causes as well .
We have an entourage of regular protesters here pretty much on a daily basis , there are usually quite a few more on Saturdays .
It ’s sad to say that I ’ve gotten immune to their commentary , but I have .
Besides they say the same 5 things over and over .
They carry their signs and hand out their literature and speak their anti sentiments , but it no longer bothers me .
When I first began here one of our protesters specifically targeted me and said something unforgivably about my 4 year old brother that had passed away .
In my mind I feel like I vowed vengeance … but the best vengeance is continuing to do my job despite whatever they throw at me .
I have been followed into bathrooms at clinic sponsored events by protesters , and been ridiculed for making pro-choice speeches … and I say …so what ?
Bring it on , it only makes stronger .
I wish that they did n’t scare the patients and I do my best to make patients aware and comfortable on the phone when speaking about protesters and sometimes it helps to make a joke out of it .
If I feel a patient is having a particularly tough time and that their good experience may be hindered by protesters , I try to counsel them over the phone about walking in the door empowered and leaving proud that they made a choice and no one made it for them .
They love the fact that we have volunteer escorts who arrive rain or shine and are incredibly relieved when they are given this information .
I recently had a patient who was a young girl , about 19 , with a slight mental handicap .
She and her mother called the clinic several times to ask questions and since I had given them my name on the initial call , I probably spoke with them about 10 times before they even came in .
They asked all of the most logical questions about our services and had a bit of trouble with scheduling , but they were so patient and so nice and worked with us without complaint to come in for the appointment .
I was at a conference on the day that this patient was actually seen and never got to meet her face to face .
About a week after her appointment I received a call from the patient ’s mother who had questions about post- abortion symptoms .
When she found out it was me on the phone she was so grateful and thanked me for doing my job and fighting for choice .
I spoke with the patient a few days later to check in on her and she was so happy with her experience and that things had turned out ok .
The patient and her mother were able to learn from her experience and what it means to have a choice .
I wrote them a letter a few days later to say thank you and I was sorry I never got to meet them in person .
Non-abortion medical providers and community members alike need to speak out about the outrageous rules and amendments that are being passed that are limiting patient ’s resources for good medical care in regards to abortion services .
A lot of providers are happy to refer to our clinic for services , but very few speak out about having a choice .
They do n’t understand what it ’s like to go to a doctor for a simple medical procedure and be harassed and intimidated and maybe even put down by your family and friends .
They walk through the doors of their offices every day without so much as a second thought .
They do n’t need to look behind them .
Abortion needs to be normalized and understood and right now we are far from that .
The more physicians and nurses that speak out , the better .
Clinics are seen as bad , dirty , or evil places and to be honest , I only see love and compassion when I walk in these doors .
We are not asking for money , we do n’t ask for these people to come work with us , but verbal support and activism are the first step .
I am Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller works in the Midwest .
“ Ministry ” is a word owned by religion generally , Christianity specifically .
Look it up in your dictionary of choice and you ’ll see ministry ( of the non-government sort ) defined as a function of religion – not of plain old civility , goodwill , humanitarianism , nor any other “ - isms ” , “ - ologies ” or “ - osophies . ”
Ministry is by definition outreach or action in some way associated with , motivated by , or stemming from religion .
Having lived and breathed evangelical Christianity from childhood until my mid-twenties , I understood ministry as the New Testament directive to emulate Jesus by following
His example of service , sacrifice , and caring for others .
Since breaking up with Jesus almost 15 years ago and relegating the whole question of God ’s existence as SEP ( somebody else ’s problem ) , I inexorably shifted from identifying as a “ prolifer ” to becoming an unabashed advocate of reproductive freedom and abortion access .
I then took up escorting for a women ’s clinic some 5 years ago , originally motivated to do so as a way to walk - the - talk on my pro-choice philosophy .
From my first shift experiencing protesters shouting at , threatening , humiliating , and shaming patients walking the interminably long walk from the end of the block to the doors of the clinic , I discovered that rather than feeling some detached self - satisfaction about living - my - principles , I instead felt an instant , fierce and personal protectiveness towards the patients and their partners , friends , family , and others coming into the clinic .
I mean , I did n’t even know these people – the patients and their companions – but you would have thought they were my own BFFs or sisters or brothers being harassed and humiliated on that sidewalk .
Five years later I feel just as fiercely protective and vigilant about each and every one of them who walks down that sidewalk treated to such indignity and abuse by protesters who claim to be “ ministering . ”
Charley is a protester at the clinic with whom I have an exceptional relationship .
“ Exceptional ” as in he ’s the exception to my otherwise standing policy of not conversing or interacting with protesters .
As any clinic escort knows – engaging with clinic protesters generally is at best an exercise in futility , and at worst a distraction from the primary purpose of serving the patients for whom we ’re there in the first place .
The singular reason for my interacting with Charley at all is his openness to genuinely hearing my criticisms of his behavior and his willingness to modify some of his actions and tactics accordingly .
Now it may seem a distinction without a difference when , for example , I ’ve convinced Charley to use his inside voice to try to engage the patients instead of his usual shouting - such - to - be - heard - over - a - death - metal - concert volume .
However to a patient – such a difference in a protester ’s manner can mean the difference between their walk into the clinic being a highly emotionally / psychologically upsetting experience and a merely irritating one .
And while some might say the only real “ victory ” on the sidewalks of our clinics would be for the protesters to be banished entirely ( and I would n’t disagree ) , short of that I ’ve learned to look for ways of achieving small degrees of meaningful victory for patients in that gray - scale between the all and nothing .
Which brings me back to ministry .
In a conversation with Charley early on , I put it like this : “ Ideology and politics are what got me out here on the sidewalk in the first place , but what keeps me coming back is that this is my way of ministering to women , it ’s my way of manifesting God ’s love in the world . ”
Now some might question the honesty of a now - agnostic / atheist co-opting the inside - baseball vernacular of my former faith - community in communicating with protesters , and a more thorough exploration of the ethics and honesty in doing so is worthy of its own post another day .
My short answer is that I ’m done with evangelicals getting away with the claim of exclusive ownership of love , compassion and taking care of one ’s fellow humans , or that it ’s only through Jesus that such motivation and emotion are even possible .
These notions originated neither from Jesus , nor God , nor unicorns nor any other mythological entity – they are , beautifully , human - originated emotions , choices and behaviors .
And if I need use evangelicals ’ own language – the native language of my own experience – as the framework for meaningful dialogue between me and a protester , I feel no ethical dilemma ; hey it ’s my language too .
As it turns out , sharing my ministry assertions with Charley are what opened some genuine channels of communication between him and me .
It seems no escorts or abortion - associated folks had ever pulled the “ yeah – well I ’m a Christian too ” card on him before , and it took a whole lot of the God ’s - totally - on - my - side wind out of his sails .
It also seemed to really click for him that I am at least as passionate and ministry - minded in escorting women into a clinic for their abortions as he thinks he is trying to talk them out of going through with it .
Turning some Christian lingo back on Charley provided a bridge for him to hear and respond to my criticisms , and for him to recognize that Jesus was n’t necessarily best served , say , by shouting at patients and to change his behavior accordingly .
One of the glorious aspects of not - the - Queen ’s English is the malleability of words and their meanings through co-opting , repetition , new contexts and simple meme-ery , as well as deliberate taking - back or taking - over of words when we find fault with associated history , connotations , flavor or another group ’s claimed ownership of a word .
Ministry is such a word for me .
It may have started out as a word signifying an action or expression of one ’s faith , but I assert that ministry irrespective of faith is exactly the right word for what motivates legions of us within the abortion / reproductive healthcare realm to do what we do every day .
Ministry – it ’s not just for the religiously - motivated anymore .
I am Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller Works in the United States .
Dr. Tiller was murdered a little over a month after I started working with Planned Parenthood .
I ’m not going to lie ; I was terrified to go to work .
I had been apprehensive about my new position within a clinic that provided abortion services to begin with , but when he was killed , I began to get really scared .
I was n’t anxious in the “ oh man , what if people judge me for assisting with abortions ” sort of way , but rather in the “ am I going to come to work one day and leave in a body bag ” way .
My first job with the office was in high school , doing tech support , ghost cloning hard drives , and generally troubleshooting for the practice .
As I got older , I started working for them as a receptionist and completely loathed it .
Sure , I have a great “ phone voice ” and interact well with people , but I wanted to be involved in the “ action . ”
So , as I got older , I was trained to work as a medical assistant and phlebotomist in the practice , and really loved what I did .
This is what eventually spurred me to go on to become an EMT and go to nursing school .
So , when I was offered a position at Planned Parenthood , I was happy to take it .
I was going to be working in the clinic as a medical assistant and phlebotomist , working with women who were seeking birth control , prenatal care , pap smears , and * gulp * abortion .
Please do n’t misunderstand .
I had always been pro-choice , but being in favor of reproductive freedom is one thing ; being a part of abortion care is something completely different .
So , when news of Dr. Tiller ’s slaying flashed across my television screen , my stomach dropped .
Here I am , 19 years old , and thinking about the fact that at 8:00 am the next morning I ’ll be driving past a group of protesters , some of whom may or may not want my coworkers and I to end up like Dr. Tiller .
I went into work that next morning nervous and ready to tender my resignation .
“ Terribly sorry , ” I ’d say , “ but I ’m just not willing to risk my life to work here . ”
They ’d understand , right ?
I do n’t know how I did n’t notice the plaque before that day , but for some reason it was staring me straight in the face that morning .
I know it was n’t put there in memory of Dr. Tiller , because I was the one opening the clinic that day and no one had been there since the news of his death had spread .
I do n’t tend to believe in “ signs , ” but I do n’t know how else to interpret it .
There it was in our break room , mounted on the wall next to the refrigerator .
In bold blue ink , the plate read “ ’ They may define the way I die , but they will not the way I live . ’
– Dr. George Tiller . ”
Well , that was it .
How the hell could I turn my back on this clinic now ?
Years after Dr. Tiller spoke those words , they gave some college girl the courage to stand by what she believed and not let the anti-choicers intimidate her out of what was possibly the most important job she had ever had .
A few months later , I got promoted from simply being a clinic assistant ( taking blood pressures , giving injections , etc. ) to also being an abortion assitant , where I was in the room assisting the doctor with procedures .
Again , when I was put in this position , I was terrified .
Perhaps
I ’d be targeted more , now that the antis could claim there was “ blood on my hands , ” or some other form of ridiculous rhetoric .
I almost did n’t accept the job because I was so anxious .
But my first morning in the new position , and every morning since , I looked in the mirror and reminded myself that they will not define the way I live .
Perhaps that ’s what prompted me to start my blog ; I feel the need to share my experiences with people who may be searching for the courage they need to find in their own lives .
So , if you ’re reading this , and you need someone to tell you that it really is worth it to stand by what you believe , take this as your “ sign ” ; I was lucky enough to have one , and I am forever thankful for it .
I am Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tiller Works in Mesa , Arizona I grew up Baptist .
I parroted that abortion was murder and homosexuality was a sin without having the slightest experience with either topic .
Sixteen was my age of reason .
A pastor reduced my gay friend to tears and I began to realize that the Church was not the loving entity it seemed to be , and the people in it were about as far from living like Christ as one could get .
It was the turning point that led me to leave the Church .
A wise man later told me that the first step to becoming an adult is letting go of all of the beliefs that you were conditioned with , analyzing situations and facts , and making up your own mind .
I feel that this was my shift into adulthood .
Though I ’d been subject to a “ pro life ” assembly at my public school in junior high that I had walked out of because I sensed that the information being provided was largely false or highly exaggerated , I did n’t give much interest to the abortion debate until later in my teenage years .
I had a close friend , I was two years her senior .
I did n’t particularly agree with her lifestyle and I could n’t always talk her out of bad decisions , but I tried to protect her the best I could .
I found after a few months of close friendship that a lot of her destructive behavior was brought on by her abusive father .
The abuse was reported but could n’t be proved , so it only worsened .
My friends parents were gone the night she had called me , begging me to come over after several months of not talking to me .
The second I walked into her bedroom , I gasped and my heart started racing .
I will never forget the vision of her halfheartedly slumped against her bed .
There was blood everywhere along with several puddles of vomit .
At first I thought she had slit her wrists , but I saw no gashes .
Plus the majority of the blood was on her jeans , and the comforter on her bed .
A bit was on her fingers , and smudged across her face .
It was like something I only imagined I would see in a horror movie .
She looked up at me with pupils that were tiny little specs , her lips tinged with blue .
Apparently , she did n’t remember calling me because she had no idea why I was there .
After my split second of shock , I fell to my knees at her side and grabbed her hand .
It was cold and clammy , and her breathing was frighteningly shallow .
I called 911 .
They had me stay on the phone until they arrived .
A minute or two before the ambulance pulled up , she began convulsing .
They had me check her pulse , which was faint and seemingly fading .
There was n’t a doubt in my mind that these were the last moments I would ever see her .
I stroked her hair , held her hand , and talked to her , though she was n’t really responsive .
Later that night , I found out from a mutual friend that she had found out she was pregnant .
Since she was a minor , parental consent was involved to obtain an abortion .
Besides , the closest clinic was nearly four hours away .
She had tried to talk to a friend ’s parent , who got her the court papers and tried to help convince the judge to grant a bypass .
He denied it , saying it would only be granted if she could prove the abuse .
As she had already painfully learned , this was impossible .
So she did the next best thing ; she stole a fifth of vodka and her step mom ’s Percocet .
I saved my friends life that night and vowed to fight for justice so that no friend would ever have to witness what I did and no woman would ever have to experience what she did .
And so I have .
I have lobbied my legislators to protect women ’s reproductive rights and have worked to elect pro choice representatives nationwide .
I have volunteered on the front lines of the debate as a clinic escort .
I have stood in the pouring rain to ensure that every woman could enter my clinic and make the choice that she felt was best for her .
I have had holy water thrown on me and have been called every vile name in the book , but still I trudged forward .
I have helped women who felt coerced obtain resources to parent or place for adoption .
I have counseled women , even held their hand while they cried after an abortion .
I am a volunteer support specialist for women who experience complicated emotions after an abortion .
I had an abortion and I have no shame in sharing my story .
Now that I am ready , I am a proud mommy - to - be , starting a family by choice , not by chance .
I may not have a medical degree .
I may not perform the surgeries ( though I have witnessed several . )
But I have dedicated my life to protecting the rights of my fellow women and giving them the opportunity they were promised upon being born into this country : life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
I am Dr. Tiller .
Dr. Tillers Works in the World .
I recently saw a quote from a president of a I hate women and their reproductive freedom organization .
The quote goes as follows : “ No one goes to medical school with the intent of working in a Planned Parenthood or some other abortion clinic . ”
I love ( actually hate ) when anti-choicers make such blatantly false blanket statements as if they have any knowledge of this particular topic .
The truth is , many people go to medical school for the purpose of becoming abortion providers , as well as all - encompassing women ’s health care providers .
I am one of those people .
I knew before medical school that I wanted to offer abortion services in my practice , and I was determined to get trained during medical school and pursue a residency that would train me to be a competent women ’s health care provider .
I ’m sure Mr. Wrong would like to believe that we reluctantly step into the abortion provider role because no one else will , or because we are after the money ( which is n’t there ) or because we like being harassed by psychos .
The truth is , we believe abortion is a right and each woman should have the chance to make an informed decision among all her options .
I believe that I can only be a good physician to my patients if I offer them all services surrounding their reproductive freedom , not just some .
Unfortunately for Mr. Wrong , there are more and more of us each year .
Not all of us enter medical school with the hopes of having the honor to serve women in this way , but many more of us are leaving medical school with that very ambition .
This is especially thanks to organizations like Medical Students for Choice and certain residency programs that support medical students throughout their years in medical school and beyond .
Sorry , Mr. Wrong .
We are here to stay , and I would be honored to work in a “ Planned Parenthood or some other abortion clinic ” one day .
I am Dr. Tiller . ( via abortioneers ) Dr. Tiller Works in the World .
As a child my mother took me to clinic defense rallies .
I did n’t really understand what it was were defending but I knew that it was important to my mom .
I do n’t really remember a time when I learned about abortion or choice .
Abortion was always a part of life just like pregnancy , miscarriage , or childbirth is a part of life .
I sort of fell into abortion work , or rather it chose me .
I wrote a personal narrative about coming out as gay and being from a multi-racial family for an adjunct professor my freshman year in college .
She encouraged me to attempt to publish the piece , but I did n’t follow through .
As the school year came to an end , I told her I was looking for part time work and asked if she had any suggestions .
She told me she did n’t know where I stood in regards to choice but she worked for a pro-choice organization while in school and gave me the information , and I pursued a job working in direct service with women seeking abortions .
The question of where I stood in regards to choice was not really a question for me .
The understanding that women should be able to control their bodies and lives seemed like something very basic and unquestionable .
I distinctly remember having a crush on a boy in first grade , who I then saw in the midst of a huge pro-life rally with his family .
My mom and I were on the clinic defense team .
At that moment my 6 - year - old heart was crushed , because I knew he was on the wrong side of something really important and my infatuation with him was over .
As a child , when my mom told me she had an abortion a few years before having me as a single parent , I told her it was me .
I told her this because it made sense to me that I was meant to be my mother ’s child .
It just was n’t the right time when she found herself pregnant the first time at 20 years old .
I told her it was me and I came back when the time was right .
When I was hired in abortionland I did not feel particularly passionate about the work .
I had just come out as gay and I was hired the week of a catastrophic disaster in my hometown , so it was really the least of my concerns .
But I needed a part - time job , and I was all about helping other people regardless of how much or little it had to do with my life .
I had to have an ovary removed within the first 6 months of working in abortionland , and as time went on I was just going through the motions .
I knew I was good at the kind of phone counseling I was doing , but I felt highly disconnected from abortion .
My supervisor during most of the time I worked for this organization was definitely instrumental in solidifying my understanding of how abortion was important to me personally .
My supervisor and the women I spoke to each day are the primary people who shaped my journey .
One day I went to my supervisor for a new security card because I had been robbed .
She looked at me and said , “ Your life has never been easy , has it ? ” I responded , “ No , not really . ”
This authority figure ’s acknowledgment of my personal circumstance made the work I was doing to help women seeking abortions feel more important to me .
Some of the staff and I began joking that I would win the award for having the most pregnant friends of anyone in abortionland .
During the first few years that I worked in abortion care , I had several friends who had abortions and several more who had babies .
I had a friend call me on my personal cell phone one day when I was at work to tell me she had been raped and she was pregnant .
I was able to leave my break , call her from a work phone and attempt to assist her .
I ended up lending her half the cost of her procedure from my next check so she could be seen as quickly as possible .
The many women in my family and friendship circle who have made the difficult choice to have a baby or an abortion have guided my journey too as I have become passionate about reproductive choice , health , and education .
For me this work is the closest thing to what a lot of people , especially Christians , might identify as a calling .
I am Dr. Tiller .
