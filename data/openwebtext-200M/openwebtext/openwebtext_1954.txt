He was a young man then .
Fresh out of the University of London , Jason Lewis was running his own window - cleaning business and playing in a grunge rock band when his friend Stevie Smith was struck by the terrifying thought that the prime of his life would turn out to be less than it should .
“ What I see , day after day , are captured lives , half - lives , dedicated to a mirage of fullness that never comes , ” Smith would explain later .
“ My greatest fear is of mediocrity and of a slow , unremarkable acquiescence to society . ”
Come with me around the world , Smith told Lewis .
We ’ll circumvent the globe like Magellan did riding the wind , but we ’ll do it under our own power : by bicycle , pedal boat , kayak , skates and our own remarkable feet .
“ When do we start ? ” Lewis replied .

The answer to that question was July 12 , 1994 .
One of them finished Saturday , more than 13 years later , but it was n’t Smith .
Leather - faced , thin , weeping , and now 40 , Lewis pedaled his boat up the River Thames to the prime meridian here -- 46,405 miles later , and exactly to the spot where he and Smith had started .
Smith , who dropped out five years into the journey , stood back quietly among the cheering spectators , jostled by the television camera crews .
Along the way , Lewis capsized in two oceans , was chased by a 17 - foot crocodile in Australia , suffered from two bouts of malaria , underwent surgery for two hernias , nearly died of blood poisoning 1,300 miles out to sea from Hawaii , stumbled upon a civil war in the Solomon Islands , suffered acute altitude sickness while biking over the Himalayas , got hit by a car and sustained fractures to both legs in Colorado , was robbed at the point of a machete in Sumatra and arrested as a spy in Egypt .

He sold T - shirts and worked odd jobs to raise money , and then kept going .
He fell in love , but said goodbye and kept going .
“ Thirteen years , coming to an end .
It ’s been a big , long journey .
It ’s good to be back , ” Lewis said simply as he pushed his 26 - foot - long pedal boat , now resting on a trailer , across the famous cobblestone courtyard outside the Greenwich Royal Observatory .
Though it is still in dispute , Lewis and his Expedition 360 team believe it to be the first true human - powered circumnavigation of the globe , a voyage that spanned 37 countries both north and south of the equator and ended at Greenwich , 0 degree longitude , where Earth ’s time zones begin .
Standing opposite Prince Richard , the Duke of Gloucester , a patron of the voyage who had christened the boat Moksha ( Sanskrit for Freedom ) Lewis was clad in canvas sandals , bicycle shorts and an old orange windbreaker .

“ It gives me great pleasure to inform you , ” Lewis declared , holding aloft a magnum of Taittinger champagne , “ that as of this moment , the world has been circumnavigated using only human power . ”
Before Lewis left Greenwich 13 years , 2 months and 23 days ago , he had spent a grand total of three days crewing on a sailboat and had ridden no more than three miles at a time on a bicycle .
With Smith , he crossed the English Channel , bicycled to the Portuguese coast ; spent 111 days crossing the Atlantic to Miami in the pedal boat ( at a speed of 2 to 4 knots ) and spent a year rollerblading across the United States , including several months in Colorado recuperating from the car accident .
They set off early in 1997 by bicycle for South America , intending to cross from Peru to Australia .
They made it as far as Honduras , covering 3,500 miles in seven months by bike and kayak , but unfavorable El Nio currents and winds forced them to reverse and go thousands of miles north to San Francisco .
They decided to cross the Pacific near the equator instead , with a stop in Hawaii .

It was in Hawaii , already five years into the journey , that a no- longer - aching - for - adventure Smith threw in the towel .
Lewis kept going .
Later he would bring in occasional crew members on various legs to help , but he pedaled alone for 72 days across the Pacific .
“ I just let the boat drift when I was sleeping , ” he said , which caused a problem when he ran into countercurrents near the equator .
“ I ’d pedal in the day and go to sleep , and wake up in the same space where I started the previous day , ” he said .
“ That was probably the most demoralizing part of the whole expedition . ”

He arrived in Australia $ 40,000 in debt , and spent more than three years raising funds and working with schools while traversing the Outback on bicycle .
Lewis then pedaled his boat to Southeast Asia ; bicycled through China and eastern Tibet to India ; took his boat to Djibouti in East Africa ; bicycled and kayaked through Africa and Turkey ; and bicycled to France , before setting out one last time on the pedal boat to cross the English Channel and go up the Thames .
At sea sometimes for weeks at a time , he had freeze - dried rations in one end of the boat , a small sleeping compartment known as “ the rathole ” in the other , and a desalinator for processing drinking water .
“ The idea was to be able to travel through countries , meet people , experience culture .
I suppose it was part physical challenge and part the human - powered element , to be able to travel slow enough to experience culture at a very grass - roots and grounded human level , ” Lewis said in a telephone interview from Belgium last week before beginning the final leg of his trip .
“ I loved the Atlantic .
Being away from the clutter and distractions of normal day - to - day life on land , ” he said .
“ I found this sort of Zen - like state being on the boat , doing one thing at any one time well , rather than a lot of things badly , like one does on land . ”

Smith , on the other hand , never seemed easy at sea after being washed overboard in terrifying , 30 - foot seas during a storm , Lewis said .
“ I thought he ’d gone .
I was thinking : ‘ What the hell am I going to tell his mother ? ’
Miraculously , there was a rope that somehow got wound round his foot as the boat was being blown away from where he fell , and about three minutes after it happened , he crawled up on the back of the boat , ” he said .
“ He was always very much on edge from then on , being on the ocean at all . ”
But the two also had begun to get on each others ’ nerves .
“ The biggest row we had was I had some laundry dragging over the side on a rope , wrapped up in a sweater with a bit of washing liquid .
I ’d forgotten about this laundry , it was about two or three days out there , I guess , and finally Steve blew a gasket .

“ If it was Americans , you ’d talk about it before it became an issue .
But being Brits , he kept quiet until it became a problem , because the drag was slowing us down .
. . .
I think it was really the straw that broke the camel ’s back . ”
Smith , 41 , whose book “ Pedaling to Hawaii ” chronicles his experiences on the trip , now operates a ferryboat on an estuary in southern England .
He said it was not nervousness or even annoyance that ended his journey , but a desire for roots and permanence .
He began to realize that he was carrying on to reach a goal , not because he was enjoying it , he said in an interview Saturday .

“ It was never about finishing .
It was about the journey .
And I just felt like I did n’t need to do it anymore , ” he said .
“ Sometimes it takes more courage not to do something than it takes to start something in the first place .
The idea of staying true to yourself , and not being captured by a dream , or anything else . ”
The two have remained friends , he said .
“ I had a last pedal around the Thames this morning with Jason , ” he said .
In the hubbub of the day ’s celebrations , the memories of what they had been through together all came back .
In addition to financial help from more than 1,800 individual contributors and sponsors , Lewis earned money with odd jobs , including working on a cattle ranch in Colorado and in a funeral parlor in Australia .
He sold expedition T - shirts for $ 20 apiece .
One company donated the 340 rollerblade wheels he chewed through crossing the United States .

Lewis ’ father , retired army Col. Sebert Lewis , meanwhile , helped with logistics and plotted his son ’s position on navigation charts with a fix Lewis would send each day by satellite communication .
“ I ’d get a message : ‘ All OK . ’
Then latitude and longitude , then date - time - group , ” the elder Lewis said .
Later , Lewis and his traveling companions began posting diaries , photos and video on an Internet blog .
“ I ’m hugely relieved that this whole thing is over .
And sad in a way , that a whole chunk of my life will be missing -- that which is the daily and nightly anxiety over what ’s happening to the boy , ” his father said .
“ It ’s been like a military exercise for 13 years .
The dining room table will no longer be covered with charts and maps and situation reports , looking after Jason in some far distant clime . ”

Lewis now faces another challenge : establishing his feat as a record .
There is a challenger .
Canadian Colin Angus claims to have completed the first human - powered circumference last year , in 720 days .
Lewis says Angus ’ journey was not a true circumnavigation -- it was much shorter , spanned only the northern hemisphere and failed to pass through two antipodes ( diametrically opposite places on Earth ) .
Angus says Lewis had help pedaling the boat and had to double back on one of his Australian legs , disqualifying him .
Two Americans have separate expeditions underway now .
Lewis also plans to write a book , to give a series of talks and help develop educational materials from the trip .
In between , he hopes to find the kind of ordinary life that he and Smith once scorned .

“ On the trip , I fell in love , deeply , a couple of times , ” he said .
“ I remember leaving this girl I was absolutely in love with , on the beach there after Baja .
We had just finished crossing the Sea of Cortez [ Gulf of California ] to mainland Mexico , and she had to go back to San Francisco .
“ I remember the day , I remember it like it was yesterday .
We never saw each other again , ” he said .
“ I remember just riding my bike , going into this headwind in Sinaloa , thinking what in the heck am I doing ?
It was probably one of the points where I questioned the sense of going on , where everything was telling me , you ’ve got this woman you love , why go on with this crazy trip ?
“ For some reason , maybe it was pride , I always felt the need to go ahead and finish it . ”

When I started writing Interesting Thing of the Day in April 2003 , the idea was simply that I ’d tell readers about things they probably had n’t encountered — or , at least , provide interesting new information about well - known things .
And when choosing topics , I tried to select things that would still probably be interesting long in the future .
Like , maybe for five whole years .
It ’s hardly surprising that with the passage of time , some of those old articles have n’t aged well .
Although I ’m in the process of gradually rehabilitating older articles , a number of them are beyond hope — their topics just are n’t interesting anymore .
In some cases everyone has heard of the thing by now ; in others , the thing has stopped existing or the underlying facts have changed in dramatic ways ; and in still other cases , I realized the story simply has no more to offer modern readers .
So I ’ve decided — probably a decade too late , in some cases — to retire a bunch of those old articles .
They all redirect to this page now , and I ’ll add to this list as necessary .
Sure , I could keep them online indefinitely for the sake of nostalgia , but I ’d rather have this site reflect an approximation of the truth than be a snapshot of history .
Let ’s say goodbye together to some topics that were interesting while they lasted .

Update ( March 11 , 2019 )
As more time has passed and I ’ve updated a larger percentage of our old articles , quite a few more have shown that they need to be retired :
Honey bee worker carrying a parasitic Varroa mite .
A comparison of healthy and unhealthy bee colonies points to a virus contributing to Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) , according to a report being published by the journal Science , at the Science Express web site , on 06 September .
Science is published by AAAS , the nonprofit science society .
“ Our extensive study suggests that the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ( IAPV ) may be a potential cause of Colony Collapse Disorder , ” said W. Ian Lipkin , director of the Center for Infection and Immunology at the Mailman School of Public Health , Columbia University .
“ Our next step is to ascertain whether this virus , alone or in concert with other factors such as microbes , toxins and stressors , can induce CCD in healthy bees , ” he added .
Honey bee reflecting on DNA gel data .
CCD is a puzzling phenomenon occurring in the United States – and possibly other countries where it is not yet confirmed – in which all adult bees disappear from the hive , leaving the honey and pollen behind .
Few , if any , dead bees are found around the hive .
Between 50 and 90 percent of the commercial honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) colonies in the United States have been afflicted by CCD , and the disorder is making it difficult for U.S. commercial beekeepers to pollinate crops .
About a quarter of beekeeping operations were affected by CCD during the 2006 - 2007 winter alone .
Researchers including Lipkin and Diana Cox -Foster , entomology professor at Pennsylvania State University , and colleagues have taken a new approach to investigating infectious disease outbreaks .
To find the cause of CCD they used a rapid genome sequencing technique called pyrosequencing to catalogue the entire variety of microorganisms that honey bees harbor .
After comparing their sequences with known sequences held in public databases , they identified symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria , fungi and viruses found in both healthy and CCD - afflicted colonies .
Field collection materials for forensic samples from honey bee colonies .
They tested samples collected over three years across the United States from normal and CCD - affected hives .
They also tested royal jelly imported from China , which is fed to bee larvae to start up a new colony , as well as apparently healthy bees imported from Australia , in an attempt to locate a source for an infectious agent .
After detailed statistical comparison of all the samples , the molecular signs of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus appeared to be associated with CCD .
“ This research gives us a very good lead to follow , but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone , ” said coauthor Jeffery S. Pettis , research leader of the Bee Research Laboratory , United States Department of Agriculture .
“ Other stressors to the colony are likely involved , ” he said .
Those stressors could be poor nutrition , pesticide exposure and parasitic mites .
The next research steps include inducing CCD in healthy bees , determining the global distribution of IAPV and CCD and studying bees that appear to be resistant to CCD .

Browse column O ne of the many advantages to living in Russia is that you can pop into any apteka -- and even most kiosks -- and grab yourself any of the three leading erectile - dysfunction pills , Viagra , Cialis , or Levitra .
No unnecessary expensive doctor 's visit , no wasted time .
Just erections - on - demand , as they should be .
The only real question that concerns your flaccid consumer is , " Which pill works best ? "
This issue , with spring arriving and Snapper Season just around the corner , I decided to investigate the erectile - dysfunction pills first - hand .
Everyone has heard of Viagra , and most men I know have tried it at least a few times -- usually to ensure performance in case of heavy drug or alcohol intake , or else to convince their life partner that they 're still attracted to her .
" Gosh honey , look how rock - hard I am !
And all because of you !
Each time is just like the first time with you , honey ! "
The easiest way to conduct this " Viagra Challenge " would be to simply pop each pill on different nights and try them out on different girls .
But there would be nothing particularly revealing about getting a Viagra - induced erection with a hot young prostitute , or even a girlfriend for that matter .
No , what this Viagra Challenge needed was something that Car & Driver puts its machines through in their consumer tests : extreme , rugged , unbearable conditions .
And that meant only one thing : I 'd have to test - drive each erectile - dysfunction pill on a grotesquely aging whore .
A prostitute so old and washed - up that she has n't been able to work the Leningradskoe Shosse tochkas since right around the time that Yeltsin shelled the White House .
A whore so far past her expiration date that she 's lucky if she lands a bit part in a bestiality porn , getting banged by a Great Dane named " Rex " for lunch change ...
In order to ensure some kind of fairness , I set a base rule : each prostitute that I test the pill on must be 40 years old or over .
She must be the khruschyovka of the prostitution world , born into the world at a time when the Zaporozhets was considered a sporty car , and gold teeth were a sign of prestige .
But even that was n't enough .
What if the pill worked too well ?
I needed to put up another obstacle to the erection , to make sure it really was dysfunctional .
Therefore , on the day of each trick I decided I would pop prescription amphetamines -- time - released Ritalins .
The good thing about amphetamines is that they lower your inhibitions , making it a little easier to consider fucking a beat - up whore than if life was going at its slow " reality " rhythm .
The bad thing - if you can call this " bad " - is that amphetamines turn your dick into what my friends and I used to call " the walnut " : a shriveled , tiny , sweaty , disfigured stump , a remnant of what once was , turning the bone into a tail bone .
That made the Viagra Challenge genuinely tough .
I figured if I pop a Levitra and test - drive it on , say , a haggard 45 - year - old prostitute while grinding on a mild overdose of prescription amphetamines , I 'll be performing the sexual equivalent of test - driving a 2006 Toyota Landcruiser in the Pankisi Gorge : the only way to know how well the product really works is to test it out in the most extreme conditions imaginable .
A Whore Too Far
It 's not easy to find a 40 - plus prostitute in Moscow , but they 're out there on the on - line whore - to - door service sites .
I popped triple the dose of time - released Ritalins , and wound up spending way too much time tracking down a total of about eight 40 - plus prostitutes , including a fat 55 - year - old woman whose gray and dyed - blond hair was piled atop her flabby head , and who , in the advertisement , was shoving a bright red dildo up her grayish vagina .
It did n't seem possible .
Can you actually fuck a woman that old ?
Do they really do this ?
The first whore I called was named Masha .
She was listed as 40 years old .
She had black shoulder - length hair , a kind of chiseled face , thin wearied lips , and a not entirely awful body , judging by the doctored photo - though from my experience I guessed it was one of those barrel - like torsos with flabby breasts .
She only charged 1000 rubles .
That 's 30 dollars !
I 'd never fucked a prostitute for so little in Moscow - this presented a true Viagra Challenge .
Masha told me by phone that she worked out of an apartment " 10 to 15 minutes from Alexeevskaya metro . "
She had an accent , perhaps Caucasian or southern Ukrainian .
" I 'd like to come over now , " I told her .
It was 5 pm on a working weekday .
" You need to call one hour in advance , " she said .
" Okay , so I 'll make the appointment now and I 'll come over at 6 pm . "
" No , you need to call me back in one hour and make your appointment for one hour from that call . "
I laughed .
" Why not just one hour from now ? "
The old sovok rules were even transfered to sovok - era whores .
" Call me back in one hour , " she said , and hung up the phone .
I was kind of shocked .
You'd think she 'd need the business , occupying as she does the lowest rung on the prostitution ladder .
What did it mean ?
Was it something I said or did ?
My voice tends to get higher and more child - like on amphetamines ... did that annoy her ?
I shook it off and moved on to a prostitute who called herself " Natalya Vladimirovna . "
I 'd never seen a whore use her patronymic before - it must be for fetishists , designed to give authenticity to her age .
Natalya Vladimirovna had frosted blond hair , big red lips , nice round breasts that seemed firm from the photo of her lying on her back , and smooth legs .
In fact , she looked almost too good - and at $ 70 for a one - hour visit to her apartment , she better be good .
" Natalya Vladimirovna ? " I said , calling her .
" Yes . "
Her voice was sharp and annoyed .
" Um , I saw your ad and I 'd like to meet with you . "
She sighed .
" Seventy dollars one hour , one hundred twenty for two .
You must come to my apartment .
What would you like ?
Classic ?
Anal ? "
" I do n't know , maybe both , " I said .
" Your ad says you 're at Taganskaya ? "
" Well , between Taganskaya and Proletarskaya , " she said .
" That 's good for me .
I 'd like to meet as soon as you can . "
" We can meet at 8:30 pm , " she said .
She told me her address - it was actually nowhere near Taganka , let alone the Proletarskaya metro area .
An unnecessarily inconvenient bait - and - switch .
" So I have just one question , are you really 40 years old ? " I asked her .
" Yes , I 'm 40 . "
" Because you really do n't look 40 in the photo I saw .
You look very good for your age . "
" What the hell did you expect me to look like , an old woman ?!
I 'm only 40 !
That 's not such an old age you know ! "
" I 'm sorry , I meant that as a compliment , " I said , taken aback .
There was silence on the phone .
I could n't believe it - I was fighting with an overaged whore , when all I wanted to do was fuck her , for no pleasure of my own .
" So , I 'll be over at 8:30 pm . "
She grumbled affirmatively , and told me to call when I reached a supermarket near her building .
Just to confirm , I said , " Tochno ? " " Tochno , " she snarled sarcastically .
I bought a Levitra pill for 450 rubles from the apteka just up the street from me .
Levitra is a small orange pill - while Viagra is a larger blue pill , and Cialis is a small yellow pill .
The same people who branded the Orange / Red Rose / Tulip revolutions branded the erectile - dysfunction pills , and for whatever reason , it seems to work .
Beyond the color , there were some vital differences .
I had read on the ' net that Levitra 's one main advantage was that it kicked in within 15 minutes , unlike Viagra , which takes at least 30 minutes , or Cialis , which supposedly took an hour or more .
I tried timing my Levitra dose as close as possible to my ETA at the whore 's apartment .
But timing it was impossible - her building was easily a 25 minute walk from the metro , in blustery cold , with almost no way of crossing the wide , busy prospekt .
I really felt like shit , and I was freezing my ass off , wondering how or whether I 'd ever find her goddamn building , especially since the residential buildings were hundreds of meters off the main road , in darkened courtyards ...
In Moscow , you always forget how large a scale you need to use when figuring distances .
During my Long March , our new sales apprentice Branko called me on my mobile to let me know that he was enjoying a free meal that was intended to be served to me , in a nice warm bar in the center of Moscow .
I had given up that meal ... for this !
That was when the first real wave of regret started to hit me , and I asked myself , " What the hell am I doing ?
I 'm trekking through a Moscow shithole , trying to score a rank , mean old whore whom I do n't want and who does n't want me , drugged up on Levitra and Ritalin just for the amusement of my readers ...
Oh shit , I 'm going to have a dark epipheny here ... "
Besides , the whole joke is that I 'm nearing 40 myself .
Here I am , treating 40 - year - old whores as if they 're gargoyles , when in fact they 're really my peers .
Not just age - wise , but in other ways as well .
I 've set up a future marginally more secure than your average 50 - year - old whore .
I reached the appointed supermarket and called Natalya Vladimirovna on her cell phone .
She had switched it off .
I called again , but it went straight to her voice mail .
She had turned her cell phone off .
I left a nice message , then a second more urgent message .
It was clear she had decided to blow me off , perhaps because I had offended her with my comment about her age , or perhaps because she simply had a change of heart and decided to watch a movie on ORT .
I called once more to leave a really nasty message about her age , but that would have depressed me even more , trashing a washed up whore .
It would be like running over road kill for thrills .
There was no choice but retreat .
The Levitra was still making my heart race ... I had to find an aging whore !
When I got home , I called up three aging whores unsuccessfully before finally getting one to pick up the phone .
It was Katerina , a fat - rolled 45 - year - old whore with the size 8 breasts .
" Da . " " Hi , I 'm calling about your ad .
I 'd like to come over tonight . "
" Impossible , it 's too late , call back tomorrow ! "
And she hung up the phone .
And that was it , my first day on the assignment .
I could n't believe what had just happened to me : in the middle of the highest - quality whore - garden in all of Europe , I could n't get laid by the dross , the weeds and fungi of Moscow 's whore market .
I thought they'd be wailing with joy and offering me incentives to see them - like their daughters , for example .
But the simple fact was the old prostitutes just did n't give a fuck about whether they turned an extra trick or not .
I would never have thought so , but the truth is that it 's a million times easier , and probably even cheaper , to score an 18 - year - old prostitute freshly plucked from a Moldovan village than to score a 50 - year - old whore suffering from bed sores .
Who 'd - a thunk !
The Michelin Woman I waited two days to give my heart a rest , then popped my counter - acting medicines , caught my breath and managed to secure a 45 - year - old prostitute named Ella .
She had a kind of late - 60s Soviet coif of dark - reddish hair with Corinthian curls and cutesy bangs , a rectangular face with a small , bright strawberry - shaped mouth , and a " big- boned " figure .
That is to say , fat , again , like so many women in this country past the age of 40 .
Ella's " dispyacher " arranged to send Ella out to my apartment in as soon as 45 minutes for just 2000 rubles , a steal in whore - delivery terms .
I bought another Levitra , raising eyebrows from my apteka pharmacist , then showered and ate some pasta with jarred pesto sauce .
The skinny on Levitra is that eating before use supposedly does n't affect its potency , as food does with Viagra .
It was 10:30 pm when Ella finally arrived , and I was already starting to crash from the Ritalins .
I had no desire , and the sight of her made this non-desire implode into a vortex of mild nausea .
Ella was shorter - and much thicker - than I 'd expected , built sort of like the Michelin Man with her rolls of fat visible through her erotic clothes .
Her heavy eye - paint could n't hide the webs of wrinkles and crow 's feet .
" Am I older than you thought ? " she asked me .
" Are you shocked ? " " No , it 's okay , you 're just what I wanted , " trying to keep from staring at her the way a kid stares at a cripple .
" Oh ? Good , " she said , taking off her boots .
She wore black nylon trousers and a black blouse with see - through arms .
I sat on my couch , wearing only my underwear and my pink Royal Hawaiian Hotel bathrobe .
Ella kneeled on the floor at my feet and , laughing uneasily , opened my bathrobe and started to rub my legs and chest , making small circles .
" Do you like this ?
I was a professional masseuse at a clinic in Minsk , " she said proudly .
" Where are you from ? " I asked .
She hesitated .
" Moscow , " she said .
" Why , you do n't think so ? "
" You seem to have an accent , " I said , though I could n't place it .
She insisted she was from Moscow , then went for my crotch .
My dick was still limp , but something was stirring , to my amazement .
Her hands were strong .
" Let 's take our clothes off , " she said .
I liked the way she did n't waste time - some whores can be exhausting .
I watched her take off her pants , stripping down to her rynok black fake - lace underwear and garter .
Then she took off her blouse and her bra , and ...
Well , have you ever seen the movie About Schmidt ?
The Kathy Bates scene in the Jacuzzi , when Jack Nicholson literally screams from the site of those rotten rolls of flesh , those long , flat boobs whose large nipples angle straight downward , like large deflated balloons ?...
Yeah .
Then you know what I mean .
Ella pulled out a pack of condoms and a roll of tissue papers , then kneeled again at my feet .
I looked at those condoms , and thought , " There is no way in Hell I 'm going to fuck her .
I mean , how will I do it anyway ?
Fuck her missionary style ?
On top of those rolls ?
Or from behind ?
How will it go in ?
Ugh , oh god , no way ... "
Ella told me to relax as she performed her simple massage technique , cupping her hands and rubbing them in small circles over my muscles .
Then she pulled down my underwear and started to jerk me off with a firm grip .
And , well , I 'm not sure what this means or says about me , but ... the Levitra worked .
As lightly - nauseous as I was , I found myself the proud owner of a 4 - alarm hard - on .
The walnut was gone in 60 seconds .
Ella started to kiss my legs , then my balls ( something I can't stand -- what 's exciting about having your tenderest part kissed or sucked by some total stranger whose motives are not entirely clear ? ) , then she rolled a condom on me and began to give me head .
It was , technically , a pretty adept blowjob -- but every time I opened my eyes , I could n't believe what I was looking at : a 45 - year - old woman , wearing what I now realized was a cheap wig , sucking my dick .
I tried to recall if I had ever been with even a 30 - year - old woman in my life , let alone a 40 - year - old ...
I could n't think of one , and did n't want to .
Instead , all I thought of was my 18 - year - old girlfriend , wondering if she 'd dump me over this , and wondering when the time would come in my life when I 'd be grateful to have an Ella .
I also thought , watching her , " Wow , so 45 - year - old women also give head .
And they give head pretty much the way 25 - year - old girls do -- the same motion , the same slurps and sucking sounds . "
That seemed like valuable information for reasons I could n't explain .
Ella wanted to get up and fuck me , but I nudged her head back down , and tried to think of a happy place .
Finally , after a grueling 20 minute blowjob , I was able to cum ...
Ella had me lie down on another couch and started to massage my body .
" I was a professional masseuse , " she said .
" I finished with a higher medical education , a gynecologist by profession .
I never worked as a gynecologist because of circumstances .
Work and life took me to massaging , " she said .
" Here in Moscow ? "
She hesitated .
" Well , no , I 'm not from here , " she said , very suspiciously .
I had n't ever encountered this kind of suspicion from a prostitute before -- all the ones I 'd interviewed either blabbed until their tongues turned white , or , in rarer circumstances , were simply too bitchy and angry to talk .
" I should be careful , " she said .
" Why do you want to know where I 'm from ?
Are you going to write something in the comments section of the web site ? "
" Write a review of you ?
People do that ? "
" Of course , look at the site , " she said .
" No , I wo n't write a bad review , " I assured her .
" I 'm just curious , I want to know what you do , how you started .
So you were in Minsk before coming back to Moscow ? "
" I 'm from Khabarovsk , in Siberia , " she said .
" Do you know it ? " " Yes , but I have n't been there , " I said .
" You have North Korean workers there , right ? "
" No , Chinese , lots of them .
Khabarovsk is my hometown , maybe that 's why I speak differently .
I met my husband there - an army officer .
We got married , and then he was transferred to Belarus , to the border units .
Eventually we wound up back in Minsk .
We lived there for 11 years .
I had a good life there , everything was good .
I was a masseuse , we had an apartment , a dacha , friends ... I only moved to Moscow in January . "
" What happened ? "
She paused again , kneeling beside my couch and rubbing me .
" My husband ... "
" You divorced ? " " He did awful things that - okay , let 's not talk about my husband anymore , ladno ? "
Ella smiled .
" That 's all I 'll say .
Let 's talk about happier things . "
She rubbed me some more , then asked me if I wanted to know anything else about her , only not involving her marriage .
" How did you land in this kind of work , in prostitution ? "
" I had to leave Minsk , and I had nothing .
Moscow is the only place that has money .
A woman my age , with nothing at all , in Moscow ...
I answered an ad , and now I 'm doing this .
It 's not so bad , actually .
It pays my rent , I have spending money .
They help pay for my apartment , they take care of me .
We have a dispatcher .
Of course , it 's not work I 'm proud of .
I never expected , really , to be doing this ... "
" Have you been doing it a long time ? "
" Oh no !
I just started in January .
I 'd never worked in this field before .
I never imagined ...
It can be difficult , but you know ... "
She started to grow sad .
" Yes , difficult . "
She rubbed my dick again , and tried to suck it .
" Let 's not talk about me .
Davai , I want to do the full act now . "
" Oh no , I can 't , " I said , pulling away .
" Yes , you can , " she said , and started to suck on my flaccid unit .
It might have been possible with the Levitra , but if it was , frankly , I did n't want to know .
There was no way I was going to fuck her - I wanted her out of my apartment .
I was crashing from the mix of post - orgasmic depression , Ritalin exhaustin and the Levitra fibrillation .
She did n't put up too much of a fight .
She asked me to call her again , and told me she looked forward to " completing the act " with me , assuring me it would be fantastic .
After she left , I sat around my house drinking cheap Moldovan wine and staring mutely at my walls .
I felt a vague , steady nausea - the real puking - nausea , not the Sartre kind - and wondered if this had changed me .
I was mildly depressed and exhausted , despondent over the fact that I was barely able to get Ella 's story , wondering what it was all worth .
But for the purposes of the Viagra Challenge , I had to admit , the Levitra worked .
RESULTS : Levitra performed well under extreme conditions , and it worked fast .
My erection had enough horse power to carry me through a blowjob to its completion , despite the rugged , brutal terrain .
Banging Miss Daisies
It was Sunday night , and I 'd spent the entire day flying again on Ritalins , a day I wasted in a blur .
It was time to take my second 40 - plus whore .
But I ran into the same problems .
Some whores refused to answer their phones .
Some told me , at 5 pm , that it was already too late .
I called the 1000r Masha at Alexeevskaya metro , and she gave me the same spiel about calling her in an hour to arrange an appointment an hour from then .
When I called her again , she told me she does n't work Sundays , and hung up .
Unbelievable .
I finally hit the jackpot an hour later - a 45 - year - old lesbian double team .
One had short red hair , a plain face and a formless though not horrifying body - the other , from the photo at least , had nice breasts , curves and a scary face heavily painted , with frosted hair teased in all directions , almost like a Siberian drag queen , like Divine , only presumable female and much thinner .
They invited me to their apartment , " just a five minute walk from the Begovaya metro station . "
I had popped a Cialis on my way over , after buying it at a nearby apteka for 680 rubles ( about $ 25 ) .
Cialis supposedly takes an hour to kick in , but once it does , it lasts for two days .
I had only taken Cialis once in my life , about two years ago , during a brutal all - nighter that involved copious amounts of absinthe , vodka and blow .
When I got home late that night , I committed the crime of " dialing while under the influence , " inviting a sleazy Chuvash girl up to my apartment at 5 in the morning .
She was a genuine nymphomaniac who was Hep - B positive , but since I was vaccinated and safe , and in spite of my stupidity , I never caught it .
The Cialis did n't work that night - I was too drunk , and too disgusted by her new short masculine hairdo .
The Chuvash girl left early , while I was passed out on my bed , and a girlfriend at the time called me at around 11 am inviting me to go to an airshow with her .
That was when I learned the power of Cialis - in the crush of the crowd at the airshow , where we were constantly herded into barriers and lines , I started popping these embarrassing chubbies a full 12 hours after popping the Cialis .
The hard - ons would n't go away , so long as the crowd was crushing .
A few people turned around sharply to see what was poking into them ...
" Heh - heh , sorry ' bout that ma'am !
Sir !
It 's not me , it 's the , uh , ekologichesky chisty air out here .
Yessirree , does n't get healthier than the podmoskovie town of Zhukov !
Just breathe it in ! " ... The old whores ' apartment was a wretched , freezing 20 minute trek from the Begovaya station , past some kind of junkyard , where each address number on the street represented about 3 minutes of walking distance , and I had a lot of numbers to go .
They lived on the 7th floor of a 12 story Brezhnev - era building .
The one with the short red hair answered the door .
She was wearing a bathrobe and tapochki , and looked very displeased to have to be working .
I heard voices in the apartment - it had a russkii remont feel to it , with cheap white walls and white doors that seemed perhaps 2 years old , but looked about three times that .
She led me into a bedroom off to the right .
It had a large couch - bed folded out with ornate blankets on top , a dresser with cheap hair sprays and cosmetics , and a TV playing the X - Men film .
We heard voices - the doorbell rang , and a woman walked in .
" There are four of us who live here , " my woman told me .
" Do you want one girl or two ? "
I was jittery from the Ritalins , although the Cialis did n't hit me hard like the Levitra did .
" I do n't know , " I said .
" Could you bring in the other , what 's her name ? " " Marina . "
As if on cue , the one with the painted gargoyle face and the teased up gray - blond hair entered , wearing see - through nylons and a garter .
This was Marina .
She snapped at Vika to switch off the movie ( " but he said he liked it " " put on some music , will you ? ! " ) , then started rubbing my hair and my hands , pitying me for how ice - cold they were .
On the wall , I noticed a framed photograph of Marina in lingerie , blowing a kiss to the photographer .
" You 're so tall , " Marina said , rubbing my hair .
I had n't shaved , and I looked haggard , but I was a client .
" Where are you from ? " " America . "
" No , it 's not possible .
You do n't look American . "
I knew what she meant : you look like a hachik .
" Poor American is cold .
We need to warm him up , right Vika ? "
" So where are you from ? " I asked .
Vika sighed .
" From Vladimir .
All of us came from Vladimir . "
" Did you know each other and come out together ? "
" No , we met here through the agency .
They just put us all together . "
" How many rooms is the apartment ? " " Two bedrooms .
It 's okay , it 's fine . "
The view from the window was that sad , depressing view you have when you live in the big residential settlements - darkened 15 - story buildings with dim lights illuminating every other window .
Vika sighed .
" So which one of us do you want ? " she asked .
" Um , both of you , " I answered .
It had to be this way .
They were only $ 50 each , and it made for better copy .
And besides , nothing turns me off more than lesbian sex - if amphetamines make my dick into a walnut , then lesbian sex makes my dick literally burrow into my pelvis .
" I want both of you , and I want you to do lesbos , ok ? "
" Of course , dorogoi , " Marina said , rubbing my arms and hands .
Right then , another old woman with long blond hair and a wrinkled face walked into the room .
She excused herself , pulled a few things out of the dresser , and left .
" So , do n't be shy , let 's get undressed and start , " Marina said , laughing .
We all took off our clothes and I threw myself onto the bed , on my back .
Vika , whose body was simply without features , like her face - pale , dollops of mayonnaise , formless and squat though not exactly fat - immediately went for my dick , kissing around my groin , while Marina started rubbing my chest and sucking my nipples .
It might have been a turn - on - might be a turn - on in some later period of my life - but it was just plain fucking weird .
It was like something you 'd expect to happen in college , a racy two - on - one with a couple of dorm sluts ... but they were middle - aged , really middle - aged .
Marina 's hair had gray roots which showed , and it reeked of deeply - embedded cheap cigarette smoke , like an old carpet in a cheap casino ; the flesh on her face was sagging and creased , her lips pulled down .
I closed my eyes hard .
They quickly changed roles ; Vika now sucked on my nipples , while Marina started giving me head .
I was limp , completely flaccid .
Walnut - scrunched .
I was sure that the Cialis was too weak to overcome this nightmare .
But Marina was a fighter .
She did this tongue - flicking thing on my dick for so long I wondered if she had a little motor in there .
She tugged on it , stroked it , sucked it ... she went for my balls , my taint , and sucked again .
This went on for ten , fifteen minutes .
There was no need to get them to do lesbos , and they did n't seem to necessarily want to either - the point was , I could n't get hard anyway .
But Marina was a fighter .
She doubled up her efforts .
She started to moan , blowing me with increasing conviction .
Nothing happened though .
I started to think it never would - and while that might be funny , it would also ensure that they would n't open up to me afterwards .
Incredibly enough , after about 20 minutes of relentless stimulation , signs of life started to stir .
Once my dick peeked out of its shell , Marina grabbed it by the neck and pulled it out into the daylight .
To my horror , I even began to enjoy it .
Marina started to moan loudly , a husky old moan whose significanceI tried to ignore .
Within five minutes , I could feel myself getting on the monorail to an orgasm .
I had my eyes closed , thinking of someone else , when suddenly , I felt a shifting of bodies , felt something close over my dick , opened my eyes , and saw ...
MARINA SITTING ON MY DICK !
I quickly shut my eyes as she lowered herself down and started to fuck me .
I could n't look - I did n't want that image burned into my mind .
Vika stroked my legs and balls while Marina rode me .
After about five minutes of this , she rolled me over on top of her .
I kept my eyes closed - Marina reached to try to kiss me , but I pulled my head away and buried them into her deflated breasts .
That same vague gagging nausea started to well up in my stomach .
I fucked her for about 5 minutes - I take no pride in saying this , but I think she really enjoyed it .
She started to push me into her , to heave and moan loudly .
I could n't tell whether to laugh , to feel shame , or to feel nothing .
Like my friend Ricky Ramirez would say , " They 're just fuckin ' people man , who gives a fuck . "
Moreover , her pussy was not what I expected -- it was fairly tight , warm and wet , not wide , dry and brittle .
I decided that it was time to fuck the other - for one thing , there seemed to be something wrong about the way Marina was enjoying it - it was as if I was complicit .
I pulled off of Marina , told Vika to lie down ... she did the whore swipe , licking her palm and lubing her vagina ... and I entered her .
Her pussy was also rather nice and warm .
I started to fuck her a bit faster and harder , but she did n't have any kind of passionate response .
This was how I wanted it - totally devoid of any sexual interest , far less intimate than masturbating .
Meanwhile , Marina was now behind me , moaning oddly and trying to get a piece of the action .
The old bag started rubbing my balls and ass , then kissed my back .
She kissed down lower ... and a little lower ... and I swear , I 'm sure , as I was fucking Vika , Marina dug her mouth into my crack and proceeded to rim me .
I instantly squeezed my ass , forcing her to pop her head out .
What is it with my ass ?
Is n't all that hair there nature 's way of saying " Warning : Toxic Zone ! Do Not Enter ! "
A few minutes later , Marina tried slipping a finger in .
I think I squeezed in time to prevent the finger , but she maneuvered it in just as I was going to cum , so I did n't have a lot of control over my butt muscles .
Later , I felt a little weird when I walked home , so I think the sneaky bitch beat me to it , just for a few seconds .
Maybe that was her way of punishing me for not paying proper attention to her .
... Afterwards , Marina left to make me some tea , and I lay on the bed with Vika .
" So how long have you been in Moscow ? " I asked her .
" Six months , " she said .
" You never lived in Moscow before this ? " I asked .
" No , always Vladimir . "
" What did you do in Vladimir ? "
" I was a prodavschitsa . "
Wow , jackpot !
I actually fucked a prodavschitsa !
And she looked like one too !
" What about Marina ? "
" We all used to have work , " Vika said .
" Marina worked in a warehouse selling wholesale goods .
All of us worked , but there 's no way to make money now . "
" Were you ever married ? "
Just then , Marina entered with the tea .
" I was married , yes , and I have one child , " Vika said despondently .
" I also have two children ! " Marina said .
" The eldest daughter is 25 , and she has two kids , so that makes me a grandmother ! "
So I had actually fucked a babushka and a prodavschitsa .
" My parents divorced when I was seven , " I said .
" When did you divorce your husband ? "
" When my eldest daughter was eight , " Marina said .
" A long time ago , " Vika said .
" What about you , do you have a wife and kids ? " Marina asked me .
" No , never married , no wife and kids .
I 've had what you call ' grazhdanskii brak ' a couple of times , but it never worked out .
And I do n't really want children . "
" How old are you ?
" Marina asked reproachfully .
" Almost 40 , " I said .
" And never married ?
No kids ?
It 's going to be too late for you now , Mark . "
" It 's already too late for him , " Vika agreed sadly .
" Did you do this ... prostitution ... in Vladimir ? "
I asked , moving the focus back to their lives .
" No , none of us did .
We never thought we'd be doing this .
We just started six months ago .
We took a bus out to Moscow , all of us separately . "
" How did you find each other ? "
" We work for the same agency .
We found an ad in the paper , understood what they wanted . "
" What happened in Vladimir ? "
" No money , no work .
We lost our jobs , all separately . "
" I have to support my children and grandchildren , " Marina said , suddenly growing sullen .
" I 'm doing this for them .
They have nothing .
Their husbands do n't support them , my ex-husband ... "
" Is it difficult to get used to this work ? "
Vika nodded her head , and Marina suddenly got serious , lifting her head from my legs .
" It 's very hard , of course .
Each time is like the first time , Mark . "
Vika explained , " Every time it 's as if we have to get used to it all over again .
We have n't got used to it , you see , not at all . "
" You just meet a guy and sleep with him right away , " Marina added .
" It 's not the way we do things , the way I lived my life .
You do n't know the man , you just sleep with him after meeting him for 10 minutes .
It 's very difficult , very painful ... "
Marina started to sniffle .
She put her head down .
I could n't tell if she 'd started to cry .
" I 'm sorry , excuse me , " she said , and buried her head into my legs .
" Let 's not talk about this anymore , okay ?
Let 's talk about happy things , not about this .
It 's too heavy . "
" I 'm sorry , " I said .
" I 'm just curious , I ask a lot of questions . "
" You want to ask questions more than you want to have sex , " Marina quipped , then reached for my dick and started to stroke it .
" I 'm not ready yet , " I said .
" Oh come on , " Marina said , trying to kiss it .
" And really , why did n't you ever get married ?
It 's too late now , Mark .
Because all the woman around your age are all married or divorced , and girls from the younger generation , you can't get along with them .
For example , Alesha , he was 32 and he was dating my daughter who was 22 .
He was going to marry her , but he 'd complain to me that he and my daughter had nothing to talk about .
All she wanted was to go to discos .
So he wanted me .
He fell in love with me and wanted to marry me instead .
It happens sometimes , " Marina added proudly .
" So did you marry him ? " I asked .
" Ha !
No , I 'm not going to do that again .
But you - you wo n't find anyone , it 's too late .
Age difference does n't work out .
Although , there was a Dutch man who wanted to marry me when I was 33 .
He was 52 , a very nice man .
He wanted to take me back to Holland with him .
The day he came to propose to me , I fled into the forest until he left . "
" Do you regret that ? " I asked .
She shrugged - she seemed more proud than anything .
" We all have regrets .
It happened .
What was I going to do in Holland anyway ?
I 'm Russian , this is my motherland . "
I think she meant what she said .
Marina really did n't seem to regret not marrying the Dutch man .
She lived somewhere beyond regret , while he , if he ever indeed existed , only proposed to her in order to bolster her Vladimir tragedy credits .
Marina liked telling these stories of men who were interested in her - they set her apart from Vika the prodavschitsa , who was mostly dull and quiet , more inclined to watch television than to reminisce about past romances .
In fact , she did n't seem to have any to tell .
TEST RESULTS : After our talk , Marina attacked my unit , moaning as she sucked it .
" No Marina , I ca n't go twice , it 's too soon , " I said .
" It 's not that you can't , it 's that you 're lazy , " Marina joked .
" Come on , one more ? " " No , really . "
The frightening thing was that I could feel something stirring -- I could have gone again .
Even after her story , even after knowing she was a grandmother .
The Cialis was put through a far rougher test than the Levitra , and it passed with alarmingly airborne colors .
Indeed when I got home , I had to drain my unit twice just to keep it from whistling at me for more .
All through the next day , the Cialis had me .
If Cialis had any drawback , it was that it made me too aware of my dick .
That was not something I needed , not after the Munch - like sexual experiences I 'd just been through .
A New Winner
There was no point in testing Viagra .
I have put Viagra through the test many times - and it has never let me down , no matter how close to overdosing or alcohol poisoning or just plain old and nerve - dead I became .
Indeed the existence of Viagra really made me proud of America - that we really can solve problems without pain , by merely popping a pill .
Fuck elbow grease and the old - fashioned way .
Like all Americans , I want to solve my problems with the least amount of effort , study or inconvenience .
The problem is that idiotic Americans not only restrict their own drugs ' availability to themselves , but even when it 's available , the cowardly little Puritans are still afraid to take it .
Less than 15 % of the estimated 30 million American men who suffer from impotence have even tried one of the three pills - and doctors say that the main reason most wo n't try it is because they 're " embarrassed to ask . "
That 's because , well , they 're embarrassed to admit there 's a problem .
Pretty much sums up the American electorate , does n't it .
My own conclusion is that while the Levitra performed pretty much like Viagra - lasting the same , giving one of those He - Man ultra - hard - ons , the Cialis really surprised me the most , and seems to get the most bang for your buck .
My next plan of action : to take a whore - an attractive , young whore - for a night , pop a Cialis , and punish her well into the next day .
There is nothing a whore hates more than a john who wants a second round .
Unless that whore happens to be a 45 - year - old grandmother , that is ...

The newspeak is absolutely incredible !
Mossad propagandists , operating out of the Israeli consulate in New York , are referred to as media consultants …
Well , as U.S. Army theorist Ralph Peters wrote , the effect of media on young men , in terms of reaching national security objectives , “ is destructive beyond the power of words to describe . ”
Keeping that in mind , an operation like the one described below makes sense .
Everyone knows about Israel ’s relationship with the U.S. , and how the U.S. is complicit in Israeli atrocities , but this is particularly weird .
It does n’t set the right kind of precedent when “ friendly ” governments run intelligence operations targeted at the civilian populations of other “ friendly ” governments .
Therefore , this operation is , almost certainly , being run in collusion with U.S. intelligence .
Why now ?
Has Iran finally run out of time ?
Is this part of the mindwar necessary to program the zombies about what they ’re going to be supporting in the near future ?
The Israeli regime is n’t run by war criminals and diabolical fascists .
They do n’t murder American activists with impunity .
It ’s all about self defense …
And hot chicks .
Via : International Herald Tribune :
A new Israeli public relations effort wants the country known less for its conflict with the Palestinians or for its myriad holy sites than for its beautiful women in uniform .
Or , more accurately , out of uniform .
A photo spread in the upcoming July issue of the U.S. lad mag Maxim features a roster of Israeli models , all ex-soldiers , photographed wearing very little in the cause of their country .
Initiated by Israel ’s New York consulate and headlined “ Women of the Israel Defense Forces , ” the campaign has already been criticized as inappropriate by some in Israel .
The Maxim shoot presents Israeli models like Nivit Bash , who apparently served in military intelligence â€ ” though the only remnant of an army career evident in her photograph on the magazine ’s web site is a military - style black cap that matches a minimal swimsuit .
Gal Gadot , a former Miss Israel and army fitness instructor , appears sprawled provocatively on the ledge of a Tel Aviv high - rise .
The idea originated in the media office at Israel ’s consulate in New York City , where research showed that Israel meant little to young American men .
“ Males that age have no feeling toward Israel one way or another , and we view that as a problem , so we came up with an idea that would be appealing to them , ” said David Dorfman , a media adviser at the consulate .
Maxim ’s popularity with that demographic led to the strange partnership .
“ Maxim was approached by the Israeli consulate to be a part of reshaping Israel ’s public image , specifically because of our unmatched mainstream reach to men aged 18 to 35 .
We are pleased with the result of our work together , ” the magazine said in a statement .
Followup to : Illusion of Transparency : Why No One Understands You , Expecting Short Inferential Distances
A few years ago , an eminent scientist once told me how he'd written an explanation of his field aimed at a much lower technical level than usual .
He had thought it would be useful to academics outside the field , or even reporters .
This ended up being one of his most popular papers within his field , cited more often than anything else he 'd written .
The lesson was not that his fellow scientists were stupid , but that we tend to enormously underestimate the effort required to properly explain things .
He told me this , because I 'd just told him about my experience publishing " An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning " .
This is still one of my most popular , most blogged , and most appreciated works today .
I regularly get fan mail from formerly confused undergraduates taking statistics classes , and journalists , and professors from outside fields .
In short , I successfully hit the audience the eminent scientist had thought he was aiming for .
I 'd thought I was aiming for elementary school .
Today , when I look back at the Intuitive Explanation , it seems pretty silly as an attempt on grade school :
It 's assumed that the reader knows what a " probability " is .
No single idea requires more than a single example .
No homework problems !
I 've gotten several complaints about this .
( Then again , I get a roughly equal number of complaints that the Intuitive Explanation is too long and drawn - out , as that it is too short .
The current version does seem to be " just right " for a fair number of people . )
Explainers shoot way , way higher than they think they 're aiming , thanks to the illusion of transparency and self - anchoring .
We miss the mark by several major grades of expertise .
Aiming for outside academics gets you an article that will be popular among specialists in your field .
Aiming at grade school ( admittedly , naively so ) will hit undergraduates .
This is not because your audience is more stupid than you think , but because your words are far less helpful than you think .
You 're way way overshooting the target .
Aim several major gradations lower , and you may hit your mark .
PS : I know and do confess that I need to work on taking my own advice .
Addendum : With his gracious permission :
The eminent scientist was Ralph Merkle .
Last weekend we took a trip to Urban Ore in Berkeley , where I found an incredible gem : this “ Fraction of an Inch Adding Machine . ”
It ’s a simple to use device that lets you add any number of fractions – from 1/64 to 63/64 – quickly , automatically , correctly , and without thinking about it .
As proudly proclaimed on the bezel itself , this calculator design is covered under patent Des. 169941 , submitted in 1952 , and granted a 14 - year term in 1953 .
Forty years after the patent has expired , it ’s painfully obsolescent , and yet remarkably charming .
The design is so simple and so obvious in how it works , and yet … there ’s something almost magical about it .
But enough talk .
Want to play with one ?
Using our pdf pattern and some office supplies , you can make a working replica in 5 - 10 minutes and try it out yourself !
The first thing to do is to download the design here ( 430 kB PDF document ) .
Print it out on an inkjet or ( preferably ) laser printer .
There are a few different ways to build your adding machine ; we ’ll point out some of the possible variations as we go along .
In particular , the machine may be built with or without the largest of the three wheels that appears on the pattern .
We will need some simple tools for this project .
Most importantly , we ’ll need scissors , a basic pushpin ( or other pointy object ) and a brass paper fastener of the type pictured to the upper right .
I also used a glue stick , regular tape , a hobby knife , a cutting mat , superglue , and the paperboard from an old cereal box .
( If you do n’t have any of the latter items , keep reading – you can still make a working model without them . )
Take your printed pattern and * roughly * cut out around the three shapes , leaving 1/8 - 1/4 ″ border around the edges of each shape .
We ’re going to attach them to a piece of thin paperboard to provide rigidity to our wheels .
I actually used some ultra - thin ( 1 mm ) corrugated cardboard that came from a cereal box .
But … use whatever ’s handy .
Using a glue stick , rubber cement , or double - sided tape , attach the three shapes firmly to the paperboard .
The glue stick worked great , and was ready to cut immediately after application .
Carefully cut out the shapes on the paperboard , cutting all the way down to the outlines this time .
You may find it helpful to use a hobby knife for some of the finer detail , particularly on the smallest ( top ) wheel .
Then , cut out the the small circle in the center of each of the three wheels .
There is one step remaining to complete the lower disk , which is to put a physical hole through each of the 64 holes drawn around the perimeter .
To make the holes , place the disk atop a some corrugated cardboard ( that you do n’t care about ) or a corkboard , and push the pushpin through each of the holes once .
( This is a very fast procedure in practice . )
Stack the two smaller wheels , small one on top ( it says “ Re- Made by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories ” on it ) and insert the brass fastener to keep the two wheels together .
Splay the two tabs of the brass fastener on the back side .
Note that the cheerful folks on the back of my calculator are a side effect of using a cereal box .
Your cartoons may vary .
The completed 1952 Fraction of an inch adding machine !
( You may notice that we did n’t use the largest of the three wheels – it ’s an optional upgrade that we ’ll get to shortly . )
Serious Shortcut :
If you are short on time and / or office supplies , you may wish to build the quick minimalist version ( shown in the two photos above ) instead of the version described in all the steps above –
Use scissors to cut the top two shapes out of the printed PDF pattern and connect them together with the brass fastener .
It ’s floppy but functional .
Next , let ’s see how to use it .
When we first start to use the machine , the black segment on the outer ring is in some arbitary location .
Insert the point of a ball - point or roller ball pen into the hole of the black outer segment .
Holding the inner wheel , use the pen to rotate the outer wheel CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop .
When you have reached the stop , notice that the window with the arrow reads “ Zero . ”
The calculator is now ready to use .
We ’ll do an easy one first : 1/8 ″ + 3/16 ″ .
To enter the first operand , 1/8 ″ , take the pen out and put it in the hole on the outer rim corresponding to 1/8 ″ .
Now , use the pen to rotate the outer disk CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop .
Note that 1/8 ″ is now displayed in the window with the arrow .
To enter the second operand , 3/16 ″ , take the pen out and put it in the hole on the outer rim corresponding to 3/16 ″ .
Next , to actually perform the computation , use the pen to rotate the outer disk CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop .
The number displayed in the window with the arrow is the answer : 5/16 ″ .
You can of course repeat this procedure , adding as many other fractions together as you like .
( Note : The window only displays the fractional part of the answer .
If your fraction is larger than one inch , you will need to keep track of the whole number part .
If your adding operation generates a “ carry , ” the black bar on the outer ring will pass the arrow and window as you slide the ring clockwise– see the second demonstration below for an example . )
Next , let ’s add in the optional base , and show how that ’s built :
Assemble the stack of three wheels , using the brass fastener to hold the stack together as before .
What ’s different now is that we need the upper wheel and the lower wheel to be fixed together , and the middle wheel ( the one with the holes around the edges ) is free to turn with respect to the outer two .
On the back of the optional base , bend down the sides of the brass fastener as before ; leave some slack in it to reduce the amount of friction between layers .
Use a piece of tape on the back side to hold the two leaves of the brass fastener fixed in place .
On the front side , use glue to hold head of the brass fastener fixed with respect to the top wheel .
If you ’ve used thick paperboard or cardboard for the wheels , you can do this with a tiny drop of superglue .
And here is what the completed adding machine looks like with the optional base installed .
This version is easier to use because you merely need to hold the outer ring while you move the middle wheel with the pen .
Let ’s give one more example of how to use the adding machine , now demonstrating with this version with the base .
To generate an answer that is larger than one inch , let ’s add 13 / 16 ″ and 1/4 ″ .
Again , to initialize , we point the pen into the black segment and drag it clockwise until the stop .
We are now zeroed , and ready to enter the first operand .
Here is 13 /16 ″ , which we again drag clockwise until we reach the stop .
As you can see , 13 / 16 ″ is entered and shows up in the window .
Our second operand is 1/4 ″ .
Note that when we put the pen there , the black segment in the outer ring is between the pen position and the arrowed window– when we drag , it will cross zero .
Again , drag clockwise until we reach the stop .
In doing so , the black segment has passed the arrowed window– indicating that we ’ve carried a digit .
The answer displayed in the box is 1/16 ″ , and , since we ’ve carried a digit , the answer is actually 1 1/16 ″ .
Neat .
So that ’s how to build and use your own replica of the 1952 Fraction of an Inch Adding Machine .
Have fun with it !

Warhol was a prophet of the surveillance age .
In Salford , they now have traffic wardens ( called parking attendants in the newspeak of the times ) with cameras fitted to their heads .
These sons of Warhol will not just film parking violations but , empowered by one of New Labour 's bossy innovations , they will also capture those who litter or allow their dogs to defecate in the wrong place .
Armed with the evidence , they will issue fixed penalty notices to offenders .
And a jolly good thing too , you may say .
I can not agree .
If some podgy uniformed stalker with a camera lens sticking out of his hat starts filming me any time soon I will not be answerable for my actions , and it is my fervent hope that the people of Salford will treat these street - spies with all the rude contempt they deserve .
For it seems to me that the infringement of rights represented by filming without permission far outweighs any crime I or my dog may commit .
In short , we are losing more than we gain .
And that loss runs right through our once brave , bloody - minded , individualist culture , which is now watched , nagged , chivvied and fussed over by a political establishment whose guiding spirit is Nurse Ratched .
Nurse Mildred Ratched , you will remember , was the head administrative nurse in One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest , the novel by Ken Kesey that is set in a mental health hospital in Oregon .
She is a powerful symbol of arbitrary power - and indeed of malign government - who has complete sway over the lives of the inmates , until one Randle McMurphy comes under her charge .
She crushes his challenge with a lobotomy but her order in the ward is never quite restored .
With our simple trust that the ever - extending reach of authority is somehow good for us we become more like those inmates every day .
Last week saw the launch of the first police camera drone which will spy on people in Manchester .
New speed cameras are being tested in London .
They do n't flash the speeding driver but they do take his picture .
Energy monitors are to be installed in our homes to display the individual consumption by appliances , and three million homes already have micro chips in their dustbins which when activated will reveal how much the homeowner is throwing away .
To portray these last two as infringements of liberty would be absurd , but they seem to add to the sense of official intrusion .
Of far greater importance is the news that the DNA of 100,000 teenagers - many of them guilty of no crime - has been taken and stored on the police national database .
They will be on it for the rest of their lives and have no rights over how their DNA is used and , like the rest of us , cannot predict what genetic science will eventually tell the authorities about them .
Can anyone seriously doubt that this is a fundamental breach of privacy and is contrary to the spirit of any code of rights ever written ?
What makes our apathy so striking is that even police officers are beginning to speak out about the state we 're creating .
Ian Readhead , head of the Association of Chief Police Officers data protection group , warned that we were moving to an ' Orwellian situation ' with cameras being installed in peaceful villages such as Stockbridge in Hampshire .
Mr Readhead , also deputy chief constable of Hampshire , said if the spread of cameras continued , Britain would not be a country he would want to live in .
His comments followed those by the acting chief constable of Suffolk , Colin Langham - Fitt , who criticised the growth of CCTV and the government 's ID card scheme .
If these officers are expressing concern , we can safely conclude that it is time for us to show something more than the bovine compliance of the last few years .
The issue of surveillance and databases is crucial to our future , to our children 's future , and the maintenance of sound and transparent democracy .
The more information we allow government about our movements and our lives , the more power we give up to a centralised authority which will , as night follows day , become ever more shielded from proper scrutiny .
With the concerns expressed in this column about the erosion of civil liberties and the attack by Blair on parliamentary scrutiny , I am often taken to task by people who are more relaxed about New Labour 's decade - long assault on rights .
A woman columnist on the Times suggested that those who worry about surveillance manifest a kind of vanity - that we 're suffering from a delusion that the state is actually interested in our petty lives .
That is simply not true .
I do n't believe the state is remotely interested in me , but I am convinced that with its fixations about crime and disorder , the government is building a state that is among the most controlled in the free world .
And at least two senior police chiefs agree .
It is a measure of New Labour 's cunning to frame the issue in terms of rank individualism against the collective good .
This approach is supported by what is known as pro-social thinking , the idea that each of us owes the state and community as much as the state owes us .
The effect is to diminish the individual and to burden us with obligations to the state .
We must prove our innocence positively , submit to all kinds of monitoring and allow agencies to retain information about our movements and genetic essence all in the endeavour of being good , pro-social citizens .
Ratched is winning .
From behind the glass screen I hear the whisper of her uniform , a smile of satisfaction spreads across her face as the inmates begin to settle down for the evening .
But there is still time because most of us know in our hearts that the collective good will suffer just as much as any individual if we continue to lead the way in the West with these surveillance systems .
Go to any country on the continent , or to the US , and you will see only a fraction of the cameras that are on British streets , and of course they have nothing like the DNA database or the ID card scheme , which to the French , for example , seems self - evidently oppressive .
These societies are no less safe than we are - just less observed and in consequence more free .
Over the last few weeks one or two hints have been dropped by Gordon Brown 's allies that he is considering a written constitution , which would include a new , home - grown Bill of Rights .
If Labour provides the conditions for the writing of an eloquent but simple Bill of Rights which everyone can understand and which is embedded in the constitution beyond the reach of Parliament , I will eat several straw hats .
It seems unlikely because a clearly written statement of each person 's rights - including privacy - would militate against the very control that Labour has sought to impose .
But I emphasise one point : Labour could not attempt the Ratched strategy without our help .
It is our fears , lack of rigour and laziness which have led us to this pass .
Where is Randle McMurphy when we need him ?

ATLANTA — A globe - trotting Atlanta lawyer with a dangerous strain of tuberculosis was allowed back into the U.S. by a border inspector who disregarded a computer warning to stop him and don protective gear , officials said Thursday .
The inspector has been removed from border duty .
The unidentified inspector explained that he was no doctor but that the infected man seemed perfectly healthy and that he thought the warning was merely “ discretionary , ” officials briefed on the case told The Associated Press .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is still under investigation .
The patient was identified as Andrew Speaker , a 31 - year - old personal injury lawyer who returned last week from his wedding and honeymoon trip through Italy , the Greek isles and other spots in Europe .
His new father - in - law , Robert C. Cooksey , is a CDC microbiologist whose specialty is TB and other bacteria .
Cooksey would not comment on whether he reported his son- in - law to federal health authorities .
Nor did the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain how the case came to their attention .
However , Cooksey said that neither he nor his CDC laboratory was the source of his son - in - law ’s TB .
Speaker is now under quarantine at a hospital in Denver .
He is the first infected person to be quarantined by the U.S. government since 1963 .
The disclosure that the patient is a lawyer — and specifically a personal injury lawyer — outraged many people on the Internet and elsewhere .
Some travellers who flew on the same planes with Speaker angrily accused him of selfishly putting hundreds of people ’s lives in danger .
“ It ’s still very scary , ” 21 - year - old Laney Wiggins , one of more than two dozen University of South Carolina - Aiken students who are getting skin tests for TB .
“ That is an outrageous number of people that he was very reckless with their health .
It ’s not fair .
It ’s selfish . "
Speaker said in a newspaper interview that he knew he had TB when he flew from Atlanta to Europe in mid-May for his wedding and honeymoon , but that he did not find out until he was already in Rome that it was an extensively drug - resistant strain considered especially dangerous .
Despite warnings from federal health officials not to board another long flight , he flew home for treatment , fearing he would n’t survive if he did n’t reach the U.S. , he said .
He said he tried to sneak home by way of Canada instead of flying directly into the U.S .
He was quarantined May 25 , a day after he was allowed to pass through the border crossing at Champlain , N.Y. , along the Canadian border .
The inspector ran Speaker ’s passport through a computer , and a warning — including instructions to hold the traveller , don a protective mask in dealing with him , and telephone health authorities — popped up , officials said .
About a minute later , Speaker was instead cleared to continue on his journey , according to officials familiar with the records .
The Homeland Security Department is investigating .
The border officer “ who questioned that person is at present performing administrative duties , ” said Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke , adding that the officer is not checking people at the land border crossing .
Colleen Kelley , president of the union that represents customs and border agents , declined to comment on the specifics of the case , but said “ public health issues were not receiving adequate attention and training ” within the agency .
On Thursday , a tan and healthy - looking Speaker was flown from Atlanta to Denver , accompanied by his wife and federal marshals , to Denver ’s National Jewish Medical and Research Center , where doctors planned to isolate him and treat him with oral and intravenous antibiotics .
Dr. Charles Daley , chief of the hospital ’s infectious - disease division , said he is optimistic Speaker can be cured because he is believed to be in the early stages of the disease .
Dr. Gwen Huitt of National Jewish described Speaker as “ a young , healthy individual ” who is “ doing extremely well . ’’
“ By conventional methods that we traditionally use in the public health arena ... he would be considered low infectivity at this point in time , ” she said .
“ He is not coughing , he is healthy , he does not have a fever . ’’
Doctors hope also to determine where he contracted the disease , which has been found around the world and exists in pockets in Russia and Asia .
Speaker ’s tuberculosis was discovered when he had a chest X - ray in January for a rib injury , Huitt said .
His care — which could also include surgery — could cost between $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 ( U.S. ) , she said .
The air ambulance flight and other costs of transporting him from Atlanta to Denver on Thursday morning totalled another $ 12,000 , said a spokesperson for Kaiser Permanente , Speaker ’s health insurer , which paid the bill .
He will be kept in a special unit with a ventilation system to prevent the escape of germs .
“ He may not leave that room much for several weeks , ” hospital spokesperson William Allstetter said .
Speaker ’s father - in - law has worked at the CDC for 32 years and is in the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination , where he works with TB and other organisms .
He has co-authored papers on diabetes , TB and other infectious diseases .
“ As part of my job , I am regularly tested for TB .
I do not have TB , nor have I ever had TB , ” he said in a statement .
“ My son - in - law ’s TB did not originate from myself or the CDC ’s labs , which operate under the highest levels of biosecurity . ’’
In a brief telephone interview with the AP , Cooksey said that he gave Speaker “ fatherly advice ” when he learned the young man had contracted the disease .
“ I ’m hoping and praying that he ’s getting the proper treatment , that my daughter is holding up mentally and physically , ” Cooksey said .
“ Had I known that my daughter was in any risk , I would not allow her to travel . "
According to a biography posted on a website connected with Speaker ’s law firm , the young lawyer attended the U.S. Naval Academy , graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in finance , and then attended University of Georgia ’s law school .
He is in private practice with his father , Ted Speaker , an unsuccessful candidate for a judgeship in 2004 .
Speaker ’s father told WSB - TV : “ The way he ’s been shown and spoken about on TV , it ’s like a terrorist travelling around the world escaping authorities .
It ’s blown out of proportion immensely . ’’
Andrew Speaker recently moved from an upscale condominium complex in anticipation of his wedding , former neighbours said .
He also wrote in an application to become a board member of his condo association that he was going to Vietnam for five weeks as part of the Rotary Club to act as an ambassador .
His wife , Sarah , is a third - year law student at Atlanta ’s Emory University .
“ He ’s a great guy .
Gregarious , ” said Pam Hood , a former neighbour .
“ He ’s a wonderful guy .
Just a very , very pleasant man . ’’
Health officials in North America and Europe are now trying to track down about 80 passengers who sat near him on his two trans -Atlantic flights , and they want passenger lists from four shorter flights he took while in Europe .
However , other passengers are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in Speaker was low , said Dr. Martin Cetron , director of the CDC ’s division of global migration and quarantine .
Health law experts said Speaker could be sued if others contract TB .
“ There are a number of cases that say a person who negligently transmits an infectious disease could be held liable , ” said Lawrence Gostin , a public health law expert at Georgetown University .
“ So long as he knew it was infectious , and knew about the appropriate behaviour but failed to comply , he could be held liable . "
Speaker told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution that he was n’t coughing and that doctors initially did not order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long - planned wedding .
“ We headed off to Greece thinking everything ’s fine , ” he told the newspaper .

Associated Press writers Lara Jakes Jordan in Washington ; Mike Stobbe in Atlanta ; Jim Davenport in Columbia , S.C. ; and Colleen Slevin in Denver also contributed to this report , along with AP news researcher Judy Ausuebel in New York .
In Stalin's Soviet Union , a madman named Lysenko was put in charge of the nation 's wheat growing .
Lysenko rejected the idea that genetic traits are inherited from your parents , and instead believed that you could change an organism 's offspring by changing the organism itself .
So if you cut one leg off a mouse and bred it , he reasoned , the little mice would have one leg smaller than the rest .
Do it for long enough and you 'd get a three - legged mouse .
It 's rubbish , of course , but it was ideologically comforting rubbish .
Stalin loved Lysenko's theories because they suggested that the Soviet programme of changing the current generation would change the generations that followed , making an ever more perfect worker 's paradise .
Every media business has , by now , entertained a sales call from a digital rights management company - purveyors of copy protection tools that supposedly stop people from copying your works and sharing them with the world .
Not one of them has ever stopped the widespread , unauthorised copying of media .
Not one of them ever will .
The companies that sell this stuff are , at best , bunkum peddlers and , at worst , out and out fraudsters .
Their wares simply can't work - not without changing the laws of physics , maths and information science .
DRMs are often designed by ambitious , well - funded consortia , with top - notch engineers from every corner of the industry .
They spend millions .
They take years .
They are defeated in days , for pennies , by hobbyists .
It 's inevitable , because every time you give someone a locked item , you have to give them the key to unlock it too .
The industry admits this .
The pitchmen will tell you that DRM is a sleeping policeman ; a bump in the road that " keeps honest users honest " .
This is silly : DRM can't make an honest person more honest .
In fact , once a person has opted to buy - rather than pinch - your movie , all it can do is cause frustration .
Why ?
Because DRM stops people from doing legitimate things - like using a new device ( for example , playing a song from the iTunes store on a non-Apple player ) ; like backing up a file ; like selling , loaning or giving away a movie .
Unfortunately for those selling DRM today we inhabit a networked world , where every customer is seconds away from a computer , a browser and a search engine .
You do n't have to be a genius hacker to get a copy of Ratatouille - you just need to plug " download ratatouille " into Google and get the copy that some more skilled person has thoughtfully made available to you .
Computers are machines for copying data .
A good computer is one that copies well , quickly and cheaply .
The internet is a machine for moving copies of data around .
When the internet works well , it copies data quickly and cheaply .
Ideologically , this is difficult for some people to accept .
If your fortune has been based on stopping people from copying information , it is an inconvenient truth indeed .
If you earn your living by preventing copying , the only options are to change everything , or deny everything .
Lysenko thought he could change the laws of nature .
But his theory was n't harmless rubbish – it was fatal .
When the state applied Lysenkoism to the business of planting wheat , famine followed .
Millions starved .
The Soviet Union fell into a long , grinding , corrupt decline .
DRM is Lysenkoism for the digital age .
It 's an ideologically correct lie that 's been concocted to bilk the entertainment industry out of a fortune .
DRM products make buying media less attractive , but its peddlers do n't care - their industry wo n't crater when a hopeless strategy is defeated by brutal , uncaring mathematics .
They want to make their fortunes and move on to the next bunch of luvvies : yesterday it was software , today it 's movies , tomorrow they 'll be peddling their junk to the healthcare industry for " protecting " health records .
The wheat wo n't grow under Lysenkoism , and you can't stop people from copying files on a computer .
But you can still get rich - just sell the same stuff , without the DRM .
We 're the same customers , and we'd buy just as many DVDs if there was no anti-copying magic on them .

Fully 78 % of the differences between men and women are small or close to zero .
There are three main areas of differences between men and women :
Sexuality – in particular attitudes to sex in uncommitted relationships .
Aggression – men are generally more aggressive .
Motor performance – this is where the largest differences are seen with men being better at throwing , jumping , sprinting and so on .
The bottom line is that if someone tells you men are more aggressive , have better motor performance or have different attitudes to sex than women , then you can believe them .
If it ’s anything else , the differences between men and women are probably very small or non-existent .
Continued overinflated reports of differences between men and women are damaging to all of us :
If men and women are told they ‘ speak a different language ’ , they may not bother trying to patch up their relationships .
If women continue to believe they are the ‘ nurturers ’ , they may be penalised in the workplace .
Similarly , men who believe they cannot be nurturant may be penalised in their family and relationships .
If girls believe they cannot achieve in maths , this affects their actual achievement .
Similarly , if boys think they are poor at communicating or working together , this may be detrimental to them .
Ultimately men are not from Mars and women are not from Venus .
We ’re both from Earth , so do n’t let anyone tell you otherwise .

Linguists studying a signing system that spontaneously developed in an isolated Bedouin village say they have captured a new language being generated from scratch .
They believe its features may reflect the innate neural circuitry that governs the brain 's faculty for language .
The language , known as Al Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language , is used in a village of some 3,500 people in the Negev desert of Israel .
They are descendants of a single founder , who arrived 200 years ago from Egypt and married a local woman .
Two of the couple 's five sons were deaf , as are about 150 members of the community today .
The clan has long been known to geneticists , but only now have linguists studied its sign language .
A team led by Dr. Wendy Sandler of the University of Haifa says in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today that the Bedouin sign language developed spontaneously and without outside influence .
It is not related to Israeli or Jordanian sign languages , and its word order differs from that of the spoken languages of the region .
Linguists have long disputed whether language is transmitted just through culture , as part of the brain 's general learning ability or is internally generated with the help of genetically specified neural circuits that prescribe the elements of grammar .
Since children learn to speak from those around them , there is no obvious way of separating what is learned from what is innate except by observing a new language being developed from scratch , something that happens very rarely .
Alleged pedophile prosecutor sought ' young girls , ' online profiles reveal Nick Juliano

In his day - to - day life John David Roy Atchison appeared to be your typical family man : a successful federal prosecutor and girls basketball coach who accompanied his wife and three children to youth sporting events on weekends .
Online , though , Atchison , 53 , was living a secret life as " daddy " who wanted to fulfill fantasies of changing diapers and taking care of little girls .
The two worlds collided this week when Atchison was arrested at an airport in Detroit , where prosecutors say he traveled from his home in Pensacola , Fla. , intending on having sex with a 5 - year - old girl .
His profile on hi5 , the site where he first contacted the undercover officer in Michigan , displays 189 " friends " nearly all of whom appear to be underage girls , some purporting to be as young as 4 .
" I adore everything about young girls , how they talk , think , act , look , " he says .
" Love to meet cute girls from anywhere . "
Investigators say Atchison 's MySpace profile uses abbreviations indicating he wants to meet adult or teen " babies , " reports the Macomb Daily .
Atchison , who has been sitting in a Michigan jail cell since his arrest Sunday , tried to kill himself Thursday , but guards managed to sto him in time .
His MySpace profile , along with others that RAW STORY accessed Thursday , indicates Atchison would like to meet " DL [ diaper - loving ] girls needing a Daddy to pamper , spoil , change and take care of them . "
A Yahoo profile for fldaddy04 -- the same screen - name Atchison used on MySpace -- says his favorite quote is , " What a cute little butt ! "
His hobbies are listed as : " surfing , skiing , diving , boating , young girls , petite girls , skinny girls , TB / AB [ teen baby / adult baby ] girls , girls of all ages who like to dress and act young , and girls who like girls . "
The assistant US Attorney from Pensacola Florida was active on Internet message boards catering to infantilism -- a fetish whose practitioners like to act like babies or little girls .
On one message board , a woman describes being in " LG [ little girl ] mode " when " wearing wet or poopy pants never worries me and I 'm quite happy to wait until Daddy is ready to change me . "
Atchison replied as " fldaddy04 , " [ T ] hat 's exactly what I like in a little girl . "
After being arrested at the airport in Detroit , MI , Atchison has been suspended by a youth sports organization where he coached .
Atchison 's boss , Bush - appoionted US Attorney Gregory R. Miller , was " deeply saddened " by news of Atchison 's arrest and said his office is cooperating with the investigation .
Police said he discussed having sex with a 5 - year - old girl in conversations with an undercover officer he thought was the girl 's mother .
He promised to be " gentle and loving " and bragged that he had " done it plenty . "
People check out products at the Sharp booth during the 2007 International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , Nevada January 8 , 2007 .
Sharp Corp said it would launch a Blu-ray high - definition DVD recorder with a 1 - terabyte hard disk drive ( HDD ) , the world 's largest storage capacity on any Blu-ray recorder , as it competes with the HD DVD camp .
REUTERS / Steve Marcus
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sharp Corp 6753.T said it would launch a Blu-ray high - definition DVD recorder with a 1 - terabyte hard disk drive ( HDD ) , the world 's largest storage capacity on any Blu-ray recorder , as it competes with the HD DVD camp .
Sharp , along with Sony Corp 6758.T and Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co 6752.T , promotes Blu-ray optical disc technology , while Toshiba Corp 6502.T and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O back the rival HD DVD format .
The 1 - terabyte model , capable of recording 127 hours of digital high - definition programs , will go on sale on December 1 in Japan for about 300,000 yen ( $ 2,616 ) .
Sharp also plans to offer eight other new Blu-ray recorder models by the end of the year in Japan in a bid to replace video cassette recorders and conventional DVD machines .
The Osaka - based company said on Wednesday it has no specific plans at the moment for overseas launch of these products .
Video rental chain Blockbuster Inc BBI.N , the largest U.S. provider of home movie entertainment , in June came out in favor of the Blu-ray format .
But Viacom Inc's VIAb .N Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.N signed exclusivity deals last month to distribute their next - generation discs on Toshiba 's HD DVD format for the next 18 months , a move that evened a contest where the Blu-ray camp appeared to be pulling ahead .

Frank Benford 's Discovery
Frank Benford was a research physicist at General Electric in the 1930s when he noticed something unusual about a book of logarithmic tables .
The first pages showed more wear than the last pages , indicating that numbers beginning with the digit 1 were being looked up more often than numbers beginning with 2 through 9 .
Benford seized upon this idea and spent years collecting data to show that this pattern was widespread in nature .
In 1938 , Benford published his results , citing more than 20,000 values such as atomic weights , numbers in magazine articles , baseball statistics , and the areas of rivers .
This pattern of numbers is unexpected and counterintuitive .
In fact , many do not believe it is real until they conduct an experiment for themselves .
I did n't !
For instance , go through several pages of today 's newspaper and examine the leading digit of each number .
That is , start from the left of each number and ignore the sign , the decimal point and any zeros .
The first digit you come to , between 1 and 9 , is the leading digit .
For example , 3 is the leading digit of 37.3447 , and 6 is the leading digit of - 0.06345 .
Since there are nine possible digits , you would expect that one - ninth ( 11.11 % ) of the numbers would have 1 in the leading digit position .
However , this is not what you will find– about 30.1 % of the numbers will start with 1 .
It gets even stranger from here .
Figure 34 - 2 shows two examples of Benford 's law .
The histogram on the left is for 14,414 numbers taken from the income tax returns of U.S. corporations .
The pattern here is obvious and very repeatable .
The leading digit in these numbers is a 1 about 30.1 % of the time , a 2 about 17.6 % of the time , and so on .
Mathematicians immediately recognize that these values correspond to the spacing on the logarithmic number line .
That is , the distance between 1 and 2 on the log scale is log ( 2 ) - log ( 1 ) = 0.301 .
The distance between 2 and 3 is log ( 3 ) - log ( 2 ) = 0.176 , and so on .
Benford showed us that this logarithmic pattern of leading digits is extremely common in nature and human activities .
In fact , even the physical constants of the universe follow this pattern– just look at the tables in a physics textbook .
On the other hand , not all sets of numbers follow Benford 's law .
For example , the histogram in Fig. 34 - 2 b was generated by taking a large number of samples from a computer random number generator .
These particular numbers follow a normal distribution with a mean of five and a standard deviation of three .
Changing any of these parameters will drastically change the shape of this histogram , with little apparent rhyme or reason .
Obviously , these numbers do not follow the logarithmic leading - digit distribution .
Likewise , most of the common distributions you learned about in statistics classes do not follow Benford 's law .
One of the primary mysteries of Benford 's law has been this seemingly unpredictable behavior .
Why does one set of numbers follow the logarithmic pattern , while another set of numbers does not ?
As if this was n't mysterious enough , Benford 's law has another property that is certain to keep you up at night .
Figure 34 - 2a was created from numbers that appear in U.S. tax returns , and therefore each of these numbers is a dollar value .
But what is so special about the U.S. dollar ?
Suppose that you are a financial expert in India and want to examine this set of data .
To make it easier you convert all of the dollar values to Indian rupees by multiplying each number by the current conversion rate .
It is likely that the leading digit of all 14,414 numbers will be changed
by this conversion .
Nevertheless , about 30.1 % of the converted numbers will still have a leading digit of 1 .
In other words , if a set of numbers follows Benford 's law , multiplying the numbers by any possible constant will create another set of numbers that also follows Benford 's law .
A system that remains unchanged when multiplied by a constant is called scale invariant .
Specifically , groups of numbers that follow Benford 's law are scale invariant .
Likewise , groups of numbers that do not follow Benford 's law are not .
For instance , this procedure would scramble the shape of the histogram in Fig. 34 - 2 b .
Now suppose that this tax return data is being examined by an alien from another planet .
Since he has eight fingers , he converts all of his numbers to base 8 .
Like before , most or all of the leading digits will change in this procedure .
In spite of this , the new group of numbers also follows Benford 's law ( taking into account that there are no 8 's or 9's in base 8 ) .
This property is called base invariance .
In general , if a group of numbers follows Benford 's law in one base , it will also follow Benford 's law if converted to another base .
However , there are some exceptions to this that we will look at later .
What does this all mean ?
Over the last seven decades Benford 's law has achieved almost a cult following .
It has been widely claimed to be evidence of some mysterious or paranormal property of our universe .
For instance , Benford himself tried to connect the mathematics with Nature , claiming that mere Man counts arithmetically , 1,2,3,4... , while Nature counts e0 , ex , e2x , e3 x , and so on .
In another popular version , suppose that nature contains some underlying and universal distribution of numbers .
Since it is universal , it should look the same regardless of how we choose to examine it .
In particular , it should not make any difference what units we associate with the numbers .
The distribution should appear the same if we express it in dollars or rupees , feet or meters , Fahrenheit or Celsius , and so on .
Likewise , the appearance should not change when we examine the numbers in different bases .
It has been mathematically proven that the logarithmic leading - digit pattern is the only distribution that fulfils these invariance requirements .
Therefore , if there is an underlying universal distribution , Benford 's law must be it .
Based on this logic , it is very common to hear that Benford 's law only applies to numbers that have units associated with them .
On the other end of the spectrum , crackpots abound that associate Benford 's law with psychic and other paranormal claims .
Do n't waste your time trying to understand the above ideas ; they are completely on the wrong track .
There is no " universal distribution " and this phenomenon is unrelated to " units " .
In the end , we will find that Benford 's law looks more like a well - executed magic trick than a hidden property of the universe .
To say Mr OReilly has had it in for me the last month or so would be an understatement .
Every day he seemed to take pride in calling me every name in the book and questioning my patriotism .
I ’ve already covered my feelings on that subject in blog posts here and here .
I ’ve talked about what I , or anyone can do to serve their country here .
What I was curious about was whether this really was important to Mr OReilly , or whether he was just a ratings whore and would say whatever he needed to say to get more people to watch .
I needed to design a very simple test to determine Mr OReilly ’s motivation .
It occured to me to see if FoxNews would take an ad for the movie Redacted .
I had someone call FoxNews and tell them specifically , unequivocally that we wanted to run an ad for the movie Redacted .
The same movie Bill OReilly was so upset about .
They said no problem .
Do you want to run the ads in both the live show and the repeat ?
Our first reaction was that this was just the sales department and at some point , someone at FoxNews would step in and stop the ads from running .
The call to say they were stopping the ads never came .
The ad ran in both shows .
Here is a link with Bill ’s smiling face at the end .
So Mr OReilly , the king of the OReilly Factor , the man who called this movie Anti American and said erroneously it could cause harm to American Troops , was willing to overlook those points and take our money to promote the movie .
We are n’t talking about an ad in a show that Mr OReilly has an interest in .
This is an ad in the TV show that bears his name .
This is a show that he controls from top to bottom .
He knowingly took multiple ads for a movie that he he hasnt seen , but believes to be vile .
What does that say about Mr OReilly
Of course Mr OReilly can make the argument that he is not involved in the sale of ads , he leaves that to other people .
OK , but lets think about the scenario at Fox News if that is the case .
If Mr OReilly doesnt know about the ads , I would think that the people at his show would know and care about his positions , wouldnt you ? ”
So the question is , do they know that Mr OReilly is all about the money first , last and every bit in between and thats why they took the ad ?
Or is it that they know exactly what Mr OReilly stands for and hate him for it , or could care less what he thinks and they took the ad to spite him ?
Is it that no one involved with Mr OReilly actually watches the show ?
Which is why after the ad ran in the live show , no one caught it and had it replaced in the replay ?
its about responsibility Mr OReilly .
And while Im on the subject of Mr OReilly and his ethics , let me add a couple thoughts :
In response to Mr OReilly ’s comments that “ he is going to be my worst nightmare ” .
Well you have succeeded Mr OReilly .
The people who take you literally took it upon themselves to call my businesses with bomb threats , threaten employees , myself and others with physical harm and wish every manor of death , injury and illness on us all .
They also managed to fill up the telephone lines of the Fallen Patriot Fund so that we could n’t conduct business , and maybe its coincidence , but the fund ’s website went offline for the first time ever yesterday .
What say you Mr OReilly
Before reading this node , I recommend reading up on Classical Conditioning and Pavlov 's Dog .
Then watch me reduce it into a shallow hedge science reference like Schroedinger 's Cat .
Subject : two pastel green towels , Egyptian cotton
: two pastel green towels , Egyptian cotton Stimulus : Pinkerton , Weezer 's critically underrated second album
: , Weezer 's critically underrated second album Desired Response :
The towels should autonomously dry my naked body , with no effort required on my behalf
: The towels should autonomously dry my naked body , with no effort required on my behalf Duration : 6 month test period
The idea for this experiment came in the shower one morning .
I waste a tremendous amount of time every day drying myself .
If I could train my towels to do this for me , my life would be more efficient .
It was clear I would need some stimulus more powerful than the ringing of a handbell to condition my towels , due to their lack of ears .
I plumped for Pinkerton as it has enough energy to do the task and , more importantly , it 's something I could put up with listening to every morning .
If I played the album to my towels while drying myself daily , over a six month period , then my theory states that they would associate drying my body with the music .
Once this response is ingrained , merely listening to the album would cause my towels to rise from the chair and dry my body , leaving me free to think about more important things .
Every morning for the last three months , I 've dried myself with the same two towels while listening ( or more importantly while they listen ) to the same album .
No sign of independent movement yet , but I 'm hopeful it'll manifest within the next three months .
Unfortunately , I 'm now unable to listen to one of my favourite albums without rubbing myself vigorously with a towel , which causes problems at parties .
A woman kills herself to stop the pain of an illness she tried to alleviate with marijuana :
She was a high - profile campaigner for the Montana Medical Marijuana Act , and like others , she was dismayed when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that drug agents could still arrest sick people using marijuana , even in states that legalized its use .
The ruling came to haunt Prosser in late March , when DEA agents seized less than a half ounce of marijuana sent to her by her registered caregiver in Flathead County .
At the time , the DEA special agent in charge of the Rocky Mountain Field Division said federal agents were “ protecting people from their own state laws ” by seizing such shipments .
That DEA statement should go down in history as an emblem of the anti-federalist agenda of today 's conservatives .
It 's up there with protecting people from the alleviation of their own pain .
Prosser could n't get the medicine she needed , except from unreliable and sometimes dangerous sources .
Unable to cope with the pain of her illness , she took her own life .
“ Give me liberty or give me death , ” she wrote in July .
That 's the American spirit .
The government deprived her of liberty and so she chose death .
May she and every other victim of the drug war rest in peace .
( Update : here 's Obama on the question .
He 'd pull the feds off persecuting the sick in states where medical marijuana is legal . )

Do you think you know who you are ?
Maybe Irish , Italian , Jewish , Chinese , or one of the dozens of other hyphenated Americans that make up the United States melting pot ?
Think deeper — beyond the past few hundred years .
Back beyond genealogy , where everyone loses track of his or her ancestry — back in that dark , mysterious realm we call prehistory .
What if I told you every single person in America — every single person on earth — is African ?
With a small scrape of cells from the inside of anyone 's cheek , the science of genetics can even prove it .
Here 's how it works .
The human genome , the blueprint that describes how to make another version of you , is huge .
It 's composed of billions of sub-units called nucleotides , repeated in a long , linear code that contains all of your biological information .
Skin color , hair type , the way you metabolize milk : it 's all in there .
You got your DNA from your parents , who got it from theirs , and so on , for millions of generations to the very beginning of life on earth .
If you go far enough back , your genome connects you with bacteria , butterflies , and barracuda — the great chain of being linked together through DNA .
What about humanity , though ?
What about creatures you would recognize as being like you if they were peering over your shoulder right now ?
It turns out that every person alive today can trace his or her ancestry back to Africa .
Everyone 's DNA tells a story of a journey from an African homeland to wherever you live .
You may be from Cambodia or County Cork , but you are carrying a map inside your genome that describes the wanderings of your ancestors as they moved from the savannas of Africa to wherever your family came from most recently .
This is thanks to genetic markers — tiny changes that arise rarely and spontaneously as our DNA is copied and passed down through the generations — which serve to unite people on ever older branches of the human family tree .
If you share a marker with someone , you share an ancestor with him or her at some point in the past : the person whose DNA first had the marker that defines your shared lineage .
These markers can be traced to relatively specific times and places as humans moved across the globe .
The farther back in time and the closer to Africa we get , the more markers we all share .
What set these migrations in motion ?
Climate change — today 's big threat — seems to have had a long history of tormenting our species .
Around 70,000 years ago it was getting very nippy in the northern part of the globe , with ice sheets bearing down on Seattle and New York ; this was the last Ice Age .
At that time , though , our species , Homo sapiens , was still limited to Africa ; we were very much homebodies .
But the encroaching Ice Age , perhaps coupled with the eruption of a super - volcano named Toba , in Sumatra , dried out the tropics and nearly decimated the early human population .
While Homo sapiens can be traced to around 200,000 years ago in the fossil record , it is remarkably difficult to find an archaeological record of our species between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago , and genetic data suggest that the population eventually dwindled to as few as 2,000 individuals .
Yes , 2,000 — fewer than fit into many symphony halls .
We were on the brink of extinction .

An entrepreneur believes he 's struck gold with the rights to a 1999 patent for location - based search that he says is being infringed upon by some of the internet 's biggest players .
London - based Geomas filed suit ( .pdf ) late last year against Verizon Communications and its spinoff Idearc Media in a Texas federal court , alleging their Superpages.com search site infringes upon patent No. 5,930,474 , for an " Internet Organizer for Accessing Geographically and Topically Based Information . "
Last month , U.S. District Judge T. John
Ward ruled the case could proceed to the discovery phase .
The patent describes an internet search functionality in which users can locate a topic or business based on their location .
If you 've ever looked for a nearby doctor or plumber online using your ZIP code or city , according to Geomas , the site you used likely infringed upon the patent .
" In a perfect world , we commercialize the technology and grab licensing fees , " said Jason Galanis , founder of Geomas , which was formerly called Yellowone Investments .
" We are n't necessarily looking to sue as our main business , but realistically I think that 's going to have to happen . "
If he 's right , those sites could be forced to pay , or shut down their local search services .
Geomas could rake in hundreds of millions of dollars in the process , and as search stalwarts see more local and map- centric search traffic and advertising revenue , the Verizon suit could be just the tip of the legal and licensing iceberg .
Verizon did n't return calls from Wired News seeking comment .
Galanis said he 's raised $ 20 million to support the venture and is attempting to arrange licensing meetings with at least 20 firms Geomas believes infringe upon the patent .
Search patents have been hit or miss in the courts :
One major suit regarding paid search placement resulted in Google handing Yahoo 2.7 million shares in a settlement worth nearly $ 300 million at the time ; a suit against Google 's search toolbar was thrown out late last year .
However , the district where Geomas filed , the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas , Marshall Division , is widely considered friendly to patent holders .
" They ( Verizon ) have to take it seriously , given that the Patent and Trademark Office at least issued the patent , " said Fred Perkins , an intellectual property attorney with law firm Morrison Cohen .
Perkins said the case could hinge on how the patent fit into the market when it was filed in 1996 , not in 2007 .
The patent appears broad and obvious today , but was filed in 1996 , before internet search became so commonplace .
Roughly 100 companies , including Verizon , cite ' 474 as prior art in their own patents .
Unlike many of those other companies , however , Geomas has n't created a working technology based on the patent , which Perkins said could give defendants an advantage in court .
Oscar Abril Ascaso invited me to participate in his project Techformance which will take place around Murcia / Cartagena and will eventually be shown at ARCO Madrid , one of the biggest art fairs in Europe .
I ’ve been invited to do a public performance with some citizens from Cartagena interested in trying out the Constraint City jacket in January .
It was an interesting experience watching other people than me wearing the corset .
Around eight people ( 3 women among them ! ) wore the corset and subjectively experienced an enhanced psycho- geographic walk through emblematic signs and ancient monuments in the maritime city of Cartagena !
The walk has been recorded and each progressively attacking network has been rendered into a Constraint City map of Cartagena .
A hub of participatory projects inviting visitors to the art fair and citizens in Murcia alike to take part in real time from February 11th to 16th 2009 .
All other selected works are presented on the Techformance website ( both in english and Castellano ) .
Take a look and contact me if you are around Madrid .
I ’ll be there from 11th till 13th of February !

Peter Klimley , from the University of California , has been studying hammerheads and their behaviour for more than 20 years .
He is looking closely at this curious tendency of hammerheads , and thinks that the behaviour is related to the magnetic polarity of seamounts .
Hammerhead sharks form really large schools of over 500 specimens .
This habit is not at all common shark behaviour , and shark experts still do not know the reason .
And what makes it even more interesting is the fact that they school in large groups around underwater mountains .
Peter Klimley , from the University of California , has been studying hammerheads and their behaviour for more than 20 years .
He is looking closely at this curious tendency of hammerheads , and thinks that the behaviour is related to the magnetic polarity of seamounts .
According to National Geographic , Klimley speculates that hammerheads follow magnetic patterns , using them almost like roads to guide their travel .
According to this , when it comes time for the sharks to continue their migration , the animals may follow magnetic " highways " across the ocean floor — swimming from landmark to landmark using the seamounts as " stepping stones . "
Another classic mystery about these sharks is their bizarrely shaped head .
Some experts think that the wide lobes of the hammerheads allow them to have longer electro - receptors .
In fact , Klimley thinks that these electro - receptors allow them to detect the magnetic fields .
Other interesting fact is that hammerheads schools only exist during daytime .
In the evening , each hammerhead shark leaves the school and spends the night alone .
One clue to this behaviour might be found in the fact that really big hammerhead sharks hardly ever take part in these schools .
Schooling might therefore be a way for small and medium sized hammerhead sharks to avoid being preyed upon by large predators .

The picture shows you some things that will probably be in the box including Nate 's Nokia ngage , a collection of hats ... we 'll throw in a few of the 10 - year anniversary t- shirts as well ...
We 're willing to sign the things if you think that makes it worth donating more .
Or more likely not , if you think it 's worth more without our childish scribblings on it .
And bid high folks !
This is for the EFF after all ...

The Many - Worlds theory and the Copenhagen interpretation are n't the only competitors ­trying to explain the basic level of the universe .
In fact , quantum mechanics is n't even the only field within physics searching for such an explanation .
The theories that have emerged from the study of subatomic physics still remain theories .
This has caused the field of study to be divided in much the same way as the world of psychology .
Theories have adherents and critics , as do the psychological frameworks proposed by Carl Jung , Albert Ellis and Sigmund Freud .
Since their science was developed , physicists have been engaged in reverse engineering the universe -- they have studied what they could observe and worked backward toward smaller and smaller levels of the physical world .
By doing this , physicists are attempting to reach the final and most basic level .
It is this level , they hope , that will serve as the foundation for understanding everything else .

Following his famous Theory of Relativity , Albert Einstein spent the rest of his life looking for the one final level that would answer all physical questions .
Physicists refer to this phantom theory as the Theory of Everything .
Quantum physicists believe that they are on the trail of finding that final theory .
But another field of physics believes that the quantum level is not the smallest level , so it therefore could not provide the Theory of Everything .
These physicists turn instead to a theoretical subquantum level called string theory for the answers to all of life .
What 's amazing is that through their theoretical investigation , these physicists , like Everett , have also concluded that there are parallel universes .
String theory was originated by the Japanese - American physicist Michio Kaku .
His theory says that the essential building blocks of all matter as well as all of the physical forces in the universe -- like gravity -- exist on a subquantum level .
These building blocks resemble tiny rubber bands -- or strings -- that make up quarks ( quantum particles ) , and in turn electrons , and atoms , and cells and so on .
Exactly what kind of matter is created by the strings and how that matter behaves depends on the vibration of these strings .
It is in this manner that our entire universe is composed .
And according to string theory , this composition takes place across 11 separate dimensions .
Like the Many - Worlds theory , string theory demonstrates that parallel universes exist .
According to the theory , our own universe is like a bubble that exists alongside similar parallel universes .
Unlike the Many - Worlds theory , string theory supposes that these universes can come into contact with one another .
String theory says that gravity can flow between these parallel universes .
When these universes interact , a Big Bang like the one that created our universe occurs .
While physicists have managed to create machines that can detect quantum matter , the subquantum strings are yet to be observed , which makes them -- and the theory on which they 're built -- entirely theoretical .
It has been discredited by some , although others believe it is correct .
So do parallel universes really exist ?
According to the Many - Worlds theory , we can't truly be certain , since we can not be aware of them .
The string theory has already been tested at least once -- with negative results .
Dr. Kaku still believes parallel dimensions do exist , however [ source : The Guardian ] .
Einstein did n't live long enough to see his quest for the Theory of Everything taken up by others .
Then again , if Many - Worlds is correct , Einstein 's still alive in a parallel universe .
Perhaps in that universe , physicists have already found the Theory of Everything .

The third WhiteHat Website Security Statistics Report highlights the top 10 vulnerabilities currently affecting organizations .
Attacks on websites are on the rise , placing intellectual property , customer data , and brand integrity at risk .
Based on more than a year of data , this is the industry ’s only report focused solely on previously unknown vulnerabilities on publicly facing websites .
The report shows that nine out of ten websites have serious vulnerabilities that make them targets for malicious online attacks .
Cross-site Scripting ( XSS ) remains the top vulnerability class , appearing in approximately three quarters of websites , while Information Leakage is the top vulnerability class of the overall population .
New attack techniques such as XSS - phishing , Intranet hacking and Web worms may force enterprises to re-evaluate the criticality of XSS on a case - by - case basis .
The report statistics were gathered through an outsourced service providing website vulnerability assessments on an ongoing basis .
With more than six hundred sites under management , including many of the Fortune 500 , WhiteHat has access to an unparalleled amount of security data , which allows them to accurately identify which issues are the most prevalent .
Since the last report in April 2007 , there has been a noticeable increase in several technical vulnerabilities including XSS , Information Leakage , SQL Injection and HTTP Response Splitting , which can be directly attributed to the discovery of new attack techniques and the improvement in vulnerability identification technology .
The report revealed that HTTP Response Splitting has proven to be a hugely misunderstood and underestimated issue , evading most scanning technology since its discovery several years ago .
The overall results are startling both in the prevalence and potential consequences of HTTP Response Splitting exploits .
WhiteHat Security also examined the ways in which website vulnerabilities are plaguing various vertical markets , finding that while website security remains generally weak , the retail sector has been performing better than other markets .
XSS tops the list of vulnerability classes by vertical , followed closely by Information Leakage .
WhiteHat found that while the security posture of some industries is stronger than others , the difference is insignificant when it comes to a website being compromised since hackers only need to exploit a single vulnerability to cause damage .
WhiteHat plans to issue continued installments of the Website Security Statistics Report on a quarterly basis .
To ensure the report remains useful and relevant , WhiteHat incorporates feedback and ideas from leading industry thought leaders and influencers .

The Money Party is a small group of enterprises and individuals who have most of the money in this country .
They use that money to make more money .
Controlling who gets elected to public office is the key to more money for them and less for us .
As 2008 approaches , The Money Party is working hard to maintain its perfect record .
It is not about Republicans versus Democrats .
Right now , the Republicans do a better job taking money than the Democrats .
But The Money Party is an equal opportunity employer .
They have no permanent friends or enemies , just permanent interests .
Democrats are as welcome as Republicans to this party .
It 's all good when you are on the take and the take is legal .
This is not a conspiracy theory .
There are no secret societies or sinister operators .
This party is up front and in your face .
Just follow the money .
One percent of Americans hold 33 % of the nation 's wealth .
The top 10 % hold 72 % of the total wealth .
The bottom 40 % of Americans control only 0.3 % ( three tenths of one percent ) .
And that was before " pay day loans . "
The story is as old as civilization but the stakes have never been higher than they are right now .
In every campaign for major office , the party passes out money and buys candidates from both parties .
Thanks to the candidates who get elected , this pay to play system remains perfectly legal .
Those elected get luxury trips , sweet jobs for family members , and more campaign contributions for the next round of elections .
What they do is perfectly legal even though it looks like bribery .
In return for contributions , the election winners come through by fixing the laws so that The Money Party cleans up .
Lower taxes , highly favorable business regulations , laws that shield their businesses from real competition all start with the nonstop flow of Money Party funds .
Cost is no object , because in the end it 's all paid for with our tax dollars .
The Money Party gets no -bid contracts as well as the ability to lay off their employees and dump their pension plans just about any time they want .
It does n't get much better than that .
It 's welfare for big money and survival of the fittest for the rest of us .
We are nothing to them .
When the White House and Congress ignore the health care crisis year after year , why be surprised ?
They 're not in office to serve you .
The drug companies and hospitals had their bid in first .
When our public servants fail to get us out of Iraq , donâ€™t take it personally .
That will happen when The Money Party says so .
When citizens suffer and starve for days after a hurricane , we 're told they should have been better prepared .
When levees and bridges collapse , it 's an act of God .
But when the fat no - bid contracts show up , The Money Party takes it all .
Unreliable election systems , citizens excluded from the vote on the basis of race and class , and questionable results do n't matter as long as the right candidates get in .
We pretend to vote , they pretend to get elected , but there 's no doubt who is in charge - The Money Party .
It 's nothing personal .
The party is just doing its job .
Why be surprised or disappointed ?
It 's been happening for centuries .
The more some have , the more they want , the harder they fight to keep it .
Spread some around so they can get even more .
It 's a rigged game from top to bottom .
We let this happen .
We can change it .
The first step is to name it , and we just did .
The Irish fought for 800 years to win their independence from the worldâ€™s most powerful empire .
Generations came and went before the goal even seemed possible .
They never gave up .
Now it 's our turn .

The Agonist
By Roger Harrabin
Environment analyst , BBC News
Professor John Marburger ( left ) is Mr Bush 's top science advisor
Professor John Marburger , who advises President Bush , said it was more than 90 % certain that greenhouse gas emissions from mankind are to blame .
The Earth may become " unliveable " without cuts in CO2 output , he said , but he labelled targets for curbing temperature rise as " arbitrary " .
His comments come shortly before major meetings on climate change at the UN and the Washington White House .
There may still be some members of the White House team who are not completely convinced about climate change - but it is clear that the science advisor to the President and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is not one of them .
In the starkest warning from the White House so far about the dangers ahead , Professor Marburger told the BBC that climate change was unequivocal , with mankind more than 90 % likely to blame .
The CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and there 's no end point , it just gets hotter and hotter
Marburger interview
" And it 's going to lead to trouble unless we can begin to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we are burning and using in our economies . "
Trouble ahead
This is an explicit endorsement of the latest major review of climate science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Professor Marburger said humanity would be in trouble if we did not stop increasing carbon emissions .
The US sees technologies such as biofuels as the way ahead
Professor Marburger said he wished he could stop US emissions right away , but that was obviously not possible .
US backing for the scientific consensus was confirmed by President Bush 's top climate advisor , James Connaughton .
The chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality told BBC
News that advancing technology was the best way to curb the warming trend .
" You only have two choices ; you either have advanced technologies and get them into the marketplace , or you shut down your economies and put people out of work , " he said .
" I do n't know of any politician that favours shutting down economies . "
' Arbitrary ' targets
Mr Bush has invited leaders of major developed and developing nations to the White House later this month for discussions on a future global direction on climate change .
It will follow a UN General Assembly session on the same issue .
Last week the Asia - Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Sydney backed the UN climate convention as the right body for developing future global policy .
The European Union wants such a policy to adopt its own target of stabilising temperature rise at or below 2C .
But Mr Marburger said the state of the science made it difficult to justify any particular target .
" It 's not clear that we 'll be in a position to predict the future accurately enough to make policy confidently for a long time , " he said .
" I think 2C is rather arbitrary , and it's not clear to me that the answer should n't be 3C or more or less .
It 's a hunch , a guess . "
The truth , he said , was that we just do not know what the ' safe ' limit is .
Feds crack down on pot candy firm - 4 tied to business are charged EAST BAY 4 people tied to firm charged with growing marijuana
Tainted Inc. started in 2001 as a boutique business in Oakland that cooked marijuana leaves in butter and made chocolate truffles , federal authorities say .
Over time , it got a lot bigger .
In the last couple of years , authorities say , it bought chocolate by the ton as it produced pot-laced candy with names playing off those of popular legal treats : Buddafinga , Mr. Greenbud , Stoners .
Four people linked to the business were charged in Oakland federal court Thursday with growing marijuana that became the not - so - secret ingredient in treats resembling the popular candy bars and other packaged food , including cookies , ice cream , peanut butter , granola bars and even barbecue sauce .
" Kids and parents need to be careful in case kids get ahold of this candy .
Halloween is coming up , " Javier Pena , special agent in charge of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration in San Francisco , said as he displayed products seized from the company .
Authorities said Tainted Inc. grew into an enterprise that supplied marijuana - laced candies to cannabis clubs in the Bay Area , Los Angeles , Seattle , Vancouver , British Columbia , and Amsterdam .
The company also has distributed ecstasy and cocaine , DEA Special Agent William Armstrong wrote in an affidavit .
Over the past two years , Tainted Inc. bought nearly 4 tons of chocolate from Guittard Chocolate Co. in Burlingame for more than $ 14,000 , Armstrong wrote .
Tainted 's candies and other food items sold for $ 2.50 to $ 20 apiece , depending on the strength of the product , authorities said .
The investigation bears similarities to DEA raids in Oakland last year in which five people connected with a company called Beyond Bomb were convicted of making marijuana - laced treats with names like Munchy Way , Rasta Reece 's and Puff - a - Mint Pattie .
Federal prosecutors charged Tainted Inc.'s alleged owner , 33 - year - old Michael Martin of El Sobrante , with conspiracy to manufacture or distribute controlled substances .
Also accused of those charges were the operation 's manager , Jessica Sanders , 30 , of San Leandro , and couriers Michael Anderson , 42 , of Oakland and Diallo McLinn , 35 , of Oakland , authorities said .
Martin is a fugitive ; the other three defendants appeared Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oakland .
U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil released them on bond and ordered them back to court Oct. 19 after warning them not to use drugs .
He took note of Proposition 215 , the initiative approved in 1996 by state voters that legalized growing and using marijuana for medical purposes with a doctor 's recommendation .
But he said the defendants could n't use marijuana even under the terms of that law .
" Too bad , " Brazil said , noting that the three face federal charges and that federal law bars all forms of marijuana use .
" Take it to your congressman . "
" This appears to represent , once again , the federal government taking umbrage with the fact that California has legalized medical marijuana for medical patients , " Sanders ' attorney , Randolph Daar , said outside court .
Attorneys for McLinn and Anderson had no comment , nor did McLinn 's father , Osha Neumann , a longtime peace activist from Berkeley .
Drug agents conducted surveillance of the suspects for several months , Armstrong 's affidavit said .
On Wednesday , they searched homes or warehouses on the 900 block of 61st Street , where Tainted Inc. products were made ; the 300 block of 40th Street in North Oakland , where an alleged marijuana - growing operation was located ; Martin 's home on the 3300 block of Brentwood Avenue in El Sobrante ; Anderson and McLinn 's home on the 4100 block of Howe Street in Oakland ; and Sanders ' home on the 600 block of Black Pine Drive in San Leandro .
During the raids , investigators seized hundreds of marijuana products , 460 marijuana plants , a handgun , an undetermined amount of cash and a 2005 GMC truck , Pena said .
While arresting Sanders , an agent shot and paralyzed her Doberman pinscher , her boyfriend said .
A DEA official said the incident is under investigation .
Odyssey says the ship was seized in international waters
The guard had been ordered by a Spanish judge to seize the vessel as soon as it left the British colony of Gibraltar .
Gibraltar officials and Odyssey Marine Exploration , which owns the ship , said Spain had boarded the ship illegally as it was in international waters .
In May , Odyssey said it had found $ 500 m ( £ 253 m ) in coins from a 17th Century wreck somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean .
Madrid suspects the sunken galleon may either have been Spanish or have gone down in Spanish waters .
The salvaged booty , which included half a million silver coins and hundreds of gold objects , has already been flown back to the US .
' Threat of force '
After leaving Gibraltar , the Ocean Alert was picked up at about 0700 GMT on Thursday off Europa Point and sent to the Spanish port of Algeciras to be searched , the Civil Guard said .
RULES OF THE WAVES Seas and oceans governed by UN Laws of the Sea Ownership of sunken property in international waters governed by the law of salvage and the law of finds Law of salvage :
If property is owned , those finding it are entitled to compensation for their salvage efforts Law of finds :
Salvor is entitled to all reclaimed property if it is proved to be abandoned Spain insists it retains rights to all its sunken treasure Odyssey intends its haul to be dealt with under US federal law , where previous judgements have sometimes granted exclusive rights to salvors
The guard was investigating a possible " offence against Spanish historic heritage " , it said in a statement .
Odyssey said the boarding was illegal and said the Civil Guard threatened to use force if Ocean Alert 's captain did not follow orders .
It said Spain had earlier promised the ship would be searched at sea .
" At this point , Odyssey is assuming that the action on the part of the Guardia Civil is a miscommunication between Spanish authorities , " the Florida - based company said in a statement .
A spokesman for the governor of Gibraltar said the ship was in international waters at the time it was seized .
A lawyer for Odyssey , Allen von Spiegelfeld , told Reuters news agency that Spain had not sought permission to board Ocean Alert from officials in Panama , where it is registered .
" The owners of the vessel have contacted the Panamanian maritime authorities protesting the seizure on international waters , " Mr von Spiegelfeld said .
Spain 's Civil Guard is searching the Panama - registered ship
Some experts believe the wreck to be the Merchant Royal , an English ship carrying stolen Spanish treasure which sank in 1641 .
US coin expert Dr Lane Brunner has said there is evidence the shipwreck was found off England 's Cornish coast .
Odyssey has kept the location of its find secret , citing security and legal reasons .
Dropping ‘ D’ Bomb On Cancer
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi

Cancer is part of America …
This week many Americans will be busy fighting cancer , holding bowling marathons and running races to raise money for cancer research .
Americans receive advice on how to prevent cancer , to stop smoking , eat more vegetables and fruits , stay out of the sun .
May is skin cancer awareness month , so Americans will be reminded of the potentially harmful effects of the sun .
These Americans are unaware of the bomb that is ready to drop on the cancer world … the first direct scientific evidence that cancer can be defeated in a major way .
A knife is ready to be thrust through the heart of this most dreaded disease .
The heralded antidote will not be a pricey cancer drug , but rather a 10 - cent cure .
Here is how the Globe & Mail described the upcoming breakthrough :
But perhaps the biggest bombshell …. is about to go off .
In June , U.S. researchers will announce the first direct link between cancer prevention .
Their results are nothing short of astounding .
A four - year clinical trial involving 1,200 women found those taking vitamin D pills had about a 60 - per-cent reduction in cancer incidence , compared with those who did n’t take it , a drop so large — twice the impact on cancer attributed to smoking — it almost looks like a typographical error .
And in an era of pricey medical advances , the reduction seems even more remarkable because it was achieved with an over - the - counter supplement costing pennies a day .
[ Martin Mittelstaedt , Vitamin D casts cancer prevention in new light .
Globe & Mail , April 28 , 2007 ]
Prior evidence that vitamin D prevents cancer has been gleaned from population studies which indirectly show sunny areas of the U.S. have lower cancer rates .
Because there are so many factors involved in cancer , it has been difficult to identify vitamin D as the sole factor responsible for lower rates of cancer in certain geographical areas .
That is , till now .
Sunshine in a bottle , vitamin D pills , are about to do more to defeat cancer than any pricey cancer drug or other measure to prevent cancer .
Recognize the National Cancer Institute ’s 5 - A - Day program to encourage consumption of five servings of plant foods a day has been a failure in reducing cancer rates .
So has the advice to say out of the sun .
Advice to avoid sun exposure has been misguided information “ of just breathtaking proportions , ” says Dr. John Cannell , head of the Vitamin D Council , a non-profit , California - based organization .
“ Fifteen hundred Americans die every year from skin cancers .
Fifteen hundred Americans die every day from the serious cancers . ”
Skin cancer mortality rates did n’t rise steeply till 1971 when Americans were advised to use sunscreen lotions that blocked the vitamin D—producing UV - B sun rays .
This permitted the deep penetrating UV - A sun rays to attack the skin without the protection of vitamin D. Only recently have researchers conceded that UV - A rays cause skin cancer .
[ Oncogene 25 ( 26 ) : 3680 — 8. June 22 , 2006 ]
As for the idea that environmental pollutants cause cancer , Reinhold Vieth , professor at the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto and one of the world ’s top vitamin D experts , says those who try to brand contaminants as the key factor behind cancer in the West are “ looking for a bogeyman that does n’t exist . ”
Instead , he says , the critical factor “ is more likely a lack of vitamin D . ”
Dieticians , physicians and pharmacists have been inaccurately trained to warn the public away from higher - dose vitamin D pills for unfounded fears of side effects .
The National Academy of Science says 2000 IU ( international units ) is the safe upper limit .
But to show how ridiculous this limit is , an hour of total body summer sun exposure at a southern latitude produces about 10,000 IU of natural vitamin D in the skin without side effect .
Somebody has been pulling the wool over the public ’s eyes on this issue for a long time .
Dieticians will be quick to advise increased consumption of vitamin D - rich foods .
But to achieve the vitamin D doses used for cancer prevention through foods , people would need to drink about three quarts of milk a day , which is impractical .
Most multivitamins provide only 400 IU of vitamin D .
Researchers at the Sunlight , Nutrition and Health Research Center in San Francisco report that 1000 IU of vitamin D daily would significantly reduce cancer rates throughout Europe and North America .
Provision of 1000 IU of vitamin D in fortified foods would cost about $ 1 billion but produce cost savings of about $ 16 — 25 billion .
[ Recent Results Cancer Research 174 : 225—34 , 2007 ]
The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) is strangely silent on the growing body of scientific studies that now show vitamin D is a major weapon against cancer .
Instead , the NCI continues to promote expensive and unproven technologies , like nanoparticles , to fight cancer .
The most advanced cancer drugs cost up to $ 50,000 a year and only add a few months of life to terminal cancer patients .
Will oncologists begin to prescribe vitamin D pills for their patients who face recurrence of tumors after conventional treatment ?
Will family doctors begin to suggest vitamin D pills for their patients with a family history of cancer ?
Will dermatologists " see the light " and begin to recommend vitamin D pills instead of continuing to spread misinformation to totally avoid the sun ?
This is unlikely .
Doctors have been trained to treat rather than prevent .
Insurance payments reward treatment , not prevention .
Modern medicine is not a culture that is geared to rapid change , nor towards true preventive medicine .
It took decades for doctors to be convinced that hand washing in hospitals would save lives .
With low levels of vitamin D now linked with a long list of diseases , including autoimmune disorders ( rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , sarcoidosis , multiple sclerosis , Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis , Crohn ’s disease ) , high blood pressure , diabetes , infectious disease ( tuberculosis , influenza , common cold ) , and obesity , it becomes difficult to predict the actual level of remaining chronic disease in a vitamin D- sufficient population .
With food fortification of vitamin D would the medical industry be prepared for massive downsizing ?
Are you shopping for a new taxi car ?
Buying a car can be fun if you know what to look for .
You ’ve come to the right article as experts have provided their advice below , all of which can be used to make buying a car a simpler situation .
Visit abtaxi .no and read to learn the best approach in car shopping .
Do a little research before you enter the showroom .
When you walk into a showroom , sticker prices are usually listed right on the cars .
It is important to understand that all dealerships have some wiggle room from these prices .
If you do your research online first , you can gain an understanding of how much the car you want is selling for you in your area .
This will help you to understand how much room there is to negotiate down from sticker price , so that you get the deal you are really looking for .
Look for deals online .
Doing some online research can result in major savings .
Look for the ideal vehicle and contact different dealerships to find out whether or not they have this vehicle available .
If the source is n’t too far away , go get it yourself .
Do n’t forget to calculate ownership costs when selecting a new vehicle .
That bargain priced SUV might not be such a good deal if it means you will be spending twice the amount you used to on gasoline to drive it .
The same goes for sporty racing style cars or models favored by car thieves that both can come with increased insurance rates .
Before signing any contract take the time to read every line , including the fine print .
If there is anything listed that you do not understand , do not sign until you get an answer that you understand .
Unsavory salesmen can use a contract to insert many fees that were not discussed .
Make a wish list of cars that you are interested in .
You have seen many cars in advertisements and on the road .
It should be easy for you to build a solid list of vehicles that would suit your style .
You can add a couple of dream cars that seem out of your range ; however , be realistic about what you can afford .
If you are frequently using your car , it is important that you ask the dealer about the tires of the car .
Find out about the size of the tires and how much they would be to replace .
This is a big deal because certain tired cost a substantial amount to replace .
Due diligence should be exercised when planning your car budget .
It is imperative that you take a full and realistic look at your budget .
Not only must you consider a car payment , you must also consider insurance , gas and maintenance for the vehicle .
There is nothing worse than having a vehicle that you cannot afford to drive .
Now that you have some terrific advice , get ready to have some fun while purchasing a vehicle .
By purchasing an affordable car , you ’ll get great pleasure from driving it every day .
Your hard work will be rewarded .
It 's been revealed that the new 40 GB PlayStation 3 features more than just a cut down hard disk drive .
Sony has also thought to stick the 65nm version of the Cell inside the new console , reducing the power usage down to around 135 Watts ( down from 200 Watts . )
That means the console also runs cooler and quieter , which is always a plus for a device that usually resides in the living room .
Sony also jiggled around a few other components by making the heat pipe smaller , swapping out the motherboard for a new version , and added a button battery to keep time when the system is off .
Looks like potential PS3 purchasers will be looking forward to a less noticeable din then .

ROME ( Reuters ) - A Sicilian mother took away her 61 - year - old son ’s house keys , cut off his allowance and hauled him to the police station because he stayed out late .
Tired of her son ’s misbehavior , the retiree in the central Sicilian city of Caltagirone turned to the police to “ convince this blockhead ” to behave properly , La Sicilia , one of Sicily ’s leading newspapers , reported on Thursday .
The son responded by saying his mother did not give him a big enough weekly allowance and did not know how to cook .
“ My son does not respect me , he does n’t tell me where he ’s going in the evenings and returns home late , ” the woman was quoted as saying .
“ He is never happy with the food I make and always complains .
This ca n’t go on . ”
Police helped the squabbling duo make up and the two returned home together , with the son ’s house keys and daily allowance restored .
Most Italian men still live at home late into their 30s , enjoying their “ mamma ’s ” cooking , washing and ironing .
Russian political life has been usurped by " siloviki " — ex-spies — who have apparently seized power from the small network of hyper - rich plutocratic " bankers " who rose to power after the Wall came down .
The siloviki are a tight mafiyeh whose methods include high - profile international assassination of defectors ( the assassins walk free and then run for high office ) .
Virtually all key positions in Russian political life — in government and the economy — are controlled by the so - called " siloviki , " a blanket term to describe the network of former and current state - security officers with personal ties to the Soviet - era KGB and its successor agencies .
The unexpected replacement of former Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov by former Federal Financial Monitoring Service Director Viktor Zubkov is the latest consolidation of this group 's grip on power in Russia .
Although Zubkov is not an intelligence officer by background , he has become one de facto during his years at the Financial Monitoring Service , and he has intimate knowledge of where the country 's legal and illegal assets are to be found .
The core of the siloviki group , led by former KGB officer and Federal Security Service ( FSB ) Director Vladimir Putin himself , comprises about 6,000 security - service alumni who entered the corridors of power during Putin 's first term .
Now , as Putin 's second term winds down , their clout is virtually unassailable .
Their locus of power is in the presidential administration : deputy chief of staff Igor Sechin cut his teeth in the KGB 's First Main Directorate , which oversaw foreign intelligence operations and has since been transformed into the Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) .
Fellow deputy chief of staff Viktor Ivanov worked for the KGB 's main successor organization , the FSB , which is responsible for counterintelligence operations .

ActionMonkey is Mozilla ’s latest foray into a new JavaScript engine .
It ’s actually an amalgam of two of Mozilla ’s current engines : SpiderMonkey ( which powers the current Mozilla platform ) and Tamarin ( the ActionScript engine donated to Mozilla by Adobe ) .
The result will be what is used to run the upcoming Mozilla 2 platform .
New hire , Jason Orendorff is actively tackling this project with intern Edward Lee and under the supervision of Brendan Eich .
The whole project is going to take a lot of effort , and a lot of time , to align all these pieces together , so they ’re moving in stages to make this happen .
The first stage ( Stage 0 ) is to replace SpiderMonkey ’s memory management with the garbage collection routiens of Tamarin ( also called MMgc ) .
Other stages that need to be taken into account include :
Preservation of the existing SpiderMonkey API .
Integration of SpiderMonkey ’s thread safety and property tree concepts into Tamarin ( necessary for the security needed in web - based JavaScript ) .
Replacement of SpiderMonkey ’s decomplier with one that is compatible with Tamarin .
Replacement of SpiderMonkey ’s interpreter with an evolved version of Tamarin’s
… and much more .

Published : Tuesday August 14 , 2007
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann on Monday recalled for viewers an incident " 34 years ago last Friday , when a story appeared in the Washington Post detailing a Republican National Committee probe " of then - 22 year old Karl Rove , who'd been teaching political dirty tricks to his fellow College Republicans .
As a result of that probe , Rove was hired by RNC head George H.W. Bush and made the acquaintance of then - 27 year old George W. Bush .
Olbermann then welcomed James Moore , author of Bush 's Brain : How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential , and asked him , " What does Mr. Bush become when he has to operate without Rove for the first time in his political life . "
" He goes from lame duck to lame brain , " said Moore .
" This presidency is going to achieve nothing .
...
There 's nothing left that he can accomplish domestically , the war is a mess , and Karl is radioactive . "
When Olbermann asked if Rove was really going to stay out of the 2008 campaign , Moore replied , " Even a shark gets a full belly every now and then .
And this is a chance for this guy to cash in on his reputation .
...
I think the most important thing that this guy wants to do is to set down and to write his first draft , his version of history so that he can put his definitive spin on the 8 years of the Bush administration , in hopes that history will judge them a bit more kindly than everybody expects history to judge them . "
Olbermann then asked whether people might " start coming out of the woodwork and filling in the blanks " of Rove 's career .
" You like to believe that we 're all -- at least have a shred of humanity and will have a moment of atonement , " said Moore .
" I do n't think Karl does .
I think that there 's a certain part of this guy that is pathological , and he has a happy little movie in his head that he 's watching and he creates a reality that he refers to .
And that 's what sustains him and the people who support him , and they 're in absolute denial .
... I do n't know that these people are going to talk any time in the near future . "
" If Rove 's so smart , how come they did lose Congress ? " asked Olbermann .
" What Karl has done throughout the years is to turn everything political , " said Moore .
" Federal agencies are used to accumulate political power .
Everything they did was to accumulate political power .
And eventually , what happened was that when those agencies were called upon to serve the constituencies that elected people to Washington , when they were unable to do that , the public finally said , ' Okay , we 've had enough . ' "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on August 13 .
" From the emergence of the Zionist Neocons as an ideological power base dominant over U.S. foreign policy , to destruction wreaked on the Bill of Rights by illegal surveillance of citizens , to the senseless creation of the bureaucratically monstrous Department of Homeland Security and passage of the Patriot Acts , to the initiation of " wars of choice " leading to the devastation of two nations and the killing or displacement of perhaps a million Middle Eastern non-combatants , to violation of international treaties and conventions against wars of aggression and torture of prisoners , to presiding over an economy ruined by the continued export of manufacturing jobs and the creation and deflation of the housing bubble , to the wrecking of the federal budget by over a trillion dollars of wartime expenditure , to the abandonment of the city of New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina , to tax cuts for the most wealthy while the income of the middle class has drastically eroded , and to threat s to start another war , this time against Iran , based on deceptions similar to those which preceded the Iraq invasion , the Bush / Cheney administration has brought the U.S. to the brink of catastrophe .

The previously mandated analog TV cutoff date of 2009 has just been extended by the FCC , meaning that even though broadcasters ( the people like NBC who send out the shows ) will be dropping the analog feed , cable operators ( the local cable companies that take your money every month ) will still have to support old ass analog TV sets .
They have two ways do to it .

The cable operators , come Feb 2009 , can either convert digital SD signals to analog SD signals and throw it across their cable lines to you , or they can give all their grandma and grandpa customers with old sets a digital to analog converter box .
It 's a tradeoff between sucking up more of their bandwidth or giving away free equipment .
Come 2012 , five years from now , the FCC will make another decision whether to force cable operators to support analog signals .

One of the greatest virtues of programmers is that we are lazy .
Regularly this means that we do not want to spend a lot of time and / or energy in doing stuff that bore us .
We should be lazy in that common - sensical way , but we should also make our code lazy in two ways , whereof only the second one is analogous to the aforementioned human laziness , whereas the first one is usually considered its dual , “ planning ahead ” :
Even though these two statements seem simple and obvious , it is one thing to just read them and imagine oneself intrinsically following them by the nature of being a “ programmer . ”
Actually , there are quite few “ programmers ” who follow these statements to their fullest , and reach that delicate balance of duals .
A balance of expression .
Let us look further at these two seemingly simple statements .
There are two aspects to this : logic and data .
As to not repeating logic , this means identifying a recurring pattern of labor , describing that pattern formally and , finally , using these magnificent machines we call computers to carry out the corresponding laborious tasks over and over again .
This goes for all levels , from the simplistic level of actually – this is what conventionally is called “ programming ” - to writing generic code , such as employing the notions and ideas of There is also a data aspect to not repeating labor and that is to not calculate the same data over and over again .
This is called This ranges from not trying to optimize code in advance to actually not calculating data we might not need .
Unfortunately , only non-common programming languages have intrinsic support for this kind of laziness .
Those languages are almost always in the category of functional languages , such as Haskell .
Those languages are called– orif you are into language semantics .
Luckily , there are both libraries for more common languages that provide lazy evaluation , such as the eminentfor C++ , and frequently used notions that are intrinsically lazy .
Consider TCP / IP streams for this latter category .
The revival of asynchronous queuing is also a variant of that example .
The problem is that these realizations of the “ lazy pattern ” are purely inter-modular and quite often even inter-process .
What I am saying ?
I will provide examples of how one can use laziness in C++ later .

The MPAA and other antipirates are desperately trying to come up with new arguments to cease The Pirate Bay 's activities , but the popular BitTorrent tracker is not planning to back down .
Pirate Bay admin Brokep notes : " The US government is losing popularity every day in Europe , and people do n't want to see us give in to them . "
It is no secret that the MPAA was involved in the raid on The Pirate Bay during May last year .
They kindly pressured Swedish authorities to take down the popular BitTorrent tracker a few months before the infamous raid .
John Malcolm , executive vice - president of the MPAA wrote to the State Secretary ( pdf ) , “ It is certainly not in Sweden ’s best interests to earn a reputation among other nations and trading partners as a place where utter lawlessness with respect to intellectual property rights is tolerated . ”
In addition , it turned out that US authorities had threatened to put Sweden on WTO ’s black list if they did n’t take the Pirate Bay down .
This threat should have have made the Swedish government move even quicker .
By now we all know that the raid was highly unsuccessful , the Pirate Bay Bay was back in action within three days , and it still is .
However , this does not mean that the MPAA and US authorities have given up their goal to take the Swedes down , they continue to lobby for their cause .
MPAA ’s John Malcolm said in a recent interview with The Guardian : “ The bottom line is that the operators of The Pirate Bay , and others like them , are criminals who profit handsomely by facilitating the distribution of millions of copyrighted creative works . ”
Pirate Bay admin Brokep , also known as Peter Sunde , is used to claims like this by now and responded : “ I do n’t like the word untouchable , but we feel pretty safe , The US government is losing popularity every day in Europe , and people do n’t want to see us give in to them . ”
Piracy is part and parcel of the lifestyle of today ’s youth according to Brokep .
“ I started off copying disks on my computer when I was eight or nine , ” he said .
“ You should never tell people where they ca n’t go or what they ca n ’t do . ”
It turns out that the legal actions following last years raid probably wo n’t be sufficient to take down The Pirate Bay so Hollywood is looking for other means to make The Pirate Bay look bad .
Over the past few months they were accused of willingly facilitating the distribution of child porn , having ties with right - wing extremists , and being millionaires thanks to some very lucrative advertising deals .
None of this is true of course , but for now it ’s the only weapon the antipirates have .
Orange UK disclosed the details of its Christmas range of handsets last week - giving the bum 's rush to two of the biggest phone manufacturers .
Nokia and Motorola are both conspicuously absent from the new line - up ( details here ) .
Sony Ericsson is favoured with three Walkman - branded phones , the W910i , W580i , and the budget W200 .
Samsung features , as does LG 's pink Shine , and Orange has already revealed the first of a new range of own brand phones called " Berlin " .
But there 's nothing from the number one and number three manufacturers .
Orange has already indicated its displeasure at Nokia 's bid to capture service revenues with its new Ovi portal - these are services that operators such as Orange reckon are rightfully theirs .
After all , when you buy a Samsung TV , you do n't expect to watch a Samsung TV channel ...
Nor is Orange alone .
Industry watchers are keen to see how the operators will retaliate to Ovi , with Nokia 's attractive new music phone N81 perhaps the first casualty .
3 UK is already carrying it - will the others ensure the N81 sinks without trace ?
As recently as April Nokia and Moto commanded 54 per cent market share between them . ®
The MPAA has caused TorrentSpy , once the most popular BitTorrent site , some serious headaches .
After a federal judge ordered TorrentSpy to log all user data stored in RAM , they decided to block access to US users , consequently their traffic dropped significantly .
TorrentSpy founder Justin told TorrentFreak in a response to the censorship : “ Whatever future awaits , the innovations of peer - to - peer technology and the jobs and opportunities it creates will take place outside of the USA . ”
Although it is relatively easy for US users to access TorrentSpy through proxies such as UnblockTorrentSpy , most people get their . torrent files elsewhere .
Torrent sites like Mininova , The Pirate Bay , Torrentz and Isohunt all benefited from the partial TorrentSpy shutdowns and continued to grow over the past months .
By the end of 2006 TorrentSpy was more popular that any other BitTorrent site , but times have changed .
The graph below shows that Mininova now receives the most traffic , The Pirate Bay , Torrentz and Isohunt battle for second place and TorrentSpy dropped to the fifth position .
Censorship seems to be the new strategy employed by anti-piracy organizations these days .
Not only did the MPAA manage to shut down TorrentSpy from US users , they ’re also the reason why Isohunt blocked access to US users on their TorrentBox and PodTropolis tracker .
The Pirate Bay on the other hand is banned in Turkey and even the P2P friendly Canadians are not safe anymore after the CRIA pressured demonoid to ban Canadians from their website .
A trend ?
Note : Alexa ’s data gathering is quite dubious .
The exact figures may be not be completely accurate for smaller sites , but it is a great tool ( especially the traffic rank ) to compare larger sites within the same niche and to get a global impression of traffic shifts over time .
Hrithik Roshan , probably the best looking actor from India has made another hit at the news .
Presently on a holiday trip in United States of America , the hunk is spotted smooching his wife Suzanne Roshan .
The occasion happened at a ice - cream joint in Hollywood .
Here are those pictures :
Many are writing about this as a mere publicity stunt ( is it ? ) for his upcoming movie : Kites .
But , I do n't understand how a kiss to wife can improve the prospects of a movie .
This is purely a show of love and affection he has for his wife and nothing less .
It could well have been the so called " publicity stunt " had he kissed the actress of the movie - Barbara Mori .
But it 's not !!.
This should also be an answer to those who brought up rumors that Suzanne is to divorce Hrithik following his affair with Barbara Mori .
Claim : Photographs show backpacks and clothing discarded at an Arizona rest area used by illegal immigrants .
TRUE
Examples : [ Collected via e-mail , September 2007 ]
How can anyone doubt the USA is being invaded ?
How can anyone doubt the USA is being invaded ?
This is just one of many Mexican Invader Layup / Rest Areas
This is on an ‘ illegal super highway ’ from Mexico to the USA ( Tucson ) used by Invading Mexicans and is located in a wash area approximately 1 / 4 of a mile long just south of Tucson .
It is estimated that there are over 3000 discarded back packs in this layup area .
Countless water containers , food wrappers , clothing .
And as you can see in this picture , fresh footprints leading right into it .
We were n’t too far behind them .
As I kept walking down the wash , I was sure it was going to end just ahead , but I kept walking and walking , and around every corner was more and more trash !
And of course the trail leading out of the layup area heading NORTH to Tucson , and on to your town tomorrow .
Origins :
The photographs displayed above were taken on 27 June 2007 by Lance Altherr , the Tucson Chapter Leader of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps ( MCDC ) , at an area just south of Amado , Arizona .
He explained the prevalence of backpacks and clothing in these pictures as follows :
The illegals have walked over 25 miles into our country when they get to this spot .
At this spot they can see the lights of Ammado , and they know they are within a few hours of getting picked up by the load vehicle which will take them anywhere in the country .
When they come they carry backpacks with clean clothes and food in them ; when they get to this layup spot , they change out of their dirty clothes and into clean clothes so that they will blend in better once they get to town .
They will cram as many as 20 people into the cab of a pickup truck or 30 people into a van or SUV , so there is no room for any backpacks or extra clothing .
We find a lot of brand new clothes and good backpacks which we donate to local schools .
He also passed along a similar picture from another site in southern Arizona :
These pictures and explanation mirror information presented on the National Park Service ’s ( NPS ) web site about Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona , which notes ( in part ) :
Every year thousands of people are attracted to this remote location for its apparent ease with which they can illegally enter the USA .
Away from the development at Lukeville , the remoteness of our international boundary is impossible to effectively patrol .
Under the cover of darkness , this line becomes a freeway filled with illegal foot and vehicle traffic .

Most immigrants are unprepared for the rigors of crossing the Sonoran Desert .
They carry a few possessions , a little food , and even less water .
They are unaware they are crossing a national monument , a place dedicated to preservation for present and future generations .
They may be unsure of the exact route , and merely follow the footsteps of others .
As a result , the monument ’s wilderness is laced with hundreds of miles of unofficial roads and trails .
These routes are usually lined with empty water jugs and other discarded items .

In Afghanistan last November , the Northern Alliance , supported by American Special Forces troops and emboldened by the highly accurate American bombing , forced thousands of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to retreat inside the northern hill town of Kunduz .
Trapped with them were Pakistani Army officers , intelligence advisers , and volunteers who were fighting alongside the Taliban .
( Pakistan had been the Taliban ’s staunchest military and economic supporter in its long - running war against the Northern Alliance . )
Many of the fighters had fled earlier defeats at Mazar - i- Sharif , to the west ; Taloqan , to the east ; and Pul - i - Khumri , to the south .
The road to Kabul , a potential point of retreat , was blocked and was targeted by American bombers .
Kunduz offered safety from the bombs and a chance to negotiate painless surrender terms , as Afghan tribes often do .
Surrender negotiations began immediately , but the Bush Administration heatedly — and successfully — opposed them .
On November 25th , the Northern Alliance took Kunduz , capturing some four thousand of the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters .
The next day , President Bush said , “ We ’re smoking them out .
They ’re running , and now we ’re going to bring them to justice . ”
Even before the siege ended , however , a puzzling series of reports appeared in the Times and in other publications , quoting Northern Alliance officials who claimed that Pakistani airplanes had flown into Kunduz to evacuate the Pakistanis there .
American and Pakistani officials refused to confirm the reports .
On November 16th , when journalists asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about the reports of rescue aircraft , he was dismissive .
“ Well , if we see them , we shoot them down , ” he said .
Five days later , Rumsfeld declared , “ Any idea that those people should be let loose on any basis at all to leave that country and to go bring terror to other countries and destabilize other countries is unacceptable . ”
At a Pentagon news conference on Monday , November 26th , the day after Kunduz fell , General Richard B. Myers , of the Air Force , who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was asked about the reports .
The General did not directly answer the question but stated , “ The runway there is not usable .
I mean , there are segments of it that are usable .
They ’re too short for your standard transport aircraft .
So we ’re not sure where the reports are coming from . ”
Pakistani officials also debunked the rescue reports , and continued to insist , as they had throughout the Afghanistan war , that no Pakistani military personnel were in the country .
Anwar Mehmood , the government spokesman , told newsmen at the time that reports of a Pakistani airlift were “ total rubbish .
Hogwash . ”
In interviews , however , American intelligence officials and high - ranking military officers said that Pakistanis were indeed flown to safety , in a series of nighttime airlifts that were approved by the Bush Administration .
The Americans also said that what was supposed to be a limited evacuation apparently slipped out of control , and , as an unintended consequence , an unknown number of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters managed to join in the exodus .
“ Dirt got through the screen , ” a senior intelligence official told me .
Last week , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not respond to a request for comment .
Pakistan ’s leader , General Pervez Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , had risked his standing with the religious fundamentalists — and perhaps his life — by endorsing the American attack on Afghanistan and the American support of the Northern Alliance .
At the time of Kunduz , his decision looked like an especially dangerous one .
The initial American aim in Afghanistan had been not to eliminate the Taliban ’s presence there entirely but to undermine the regime and Al Qaeda while leaving intact so - called moderate Taliban elements that would play a role in a new postwar government .
This would insure that Pakistan would not end up with a regime on its border dominated by the Northern Alliance .
By mid-November , it was clear that the Northern Alliance would quickly sweep through Afghanistan .
There were fears that once the Northern Alliance took Kunduz , there would be wholesale killings of the defeated fighters , especially the foreigners .
Musharraf won American support for the airlift by warning that the humiliation of losing hundreds — and perhaps thousands — of Pakistani Army men and intelligence operatives would jeopardize his political survival .
“ Clearly , there is a great willingness to help Musharraf , ” an American intelligence official told me .
A C.I.A. analyst said that it was his understanding that the decision to permit the airlift was made by the White House and was indeed driven by a desire to protect the Pakistani leader .
The airlift “ made sense at the time , ” the C.I.A. analyst said .
“ Many of the people they spirited away were the Taliban leadership ” — who Pakistan hoped could play a role in a postwar Afghan government .
According to this person , “ Musharraf wanted to have these people to put another card on the table ” in future political negotiations .
“ We were supposed to have access to them , ” he said , but “ it did n’t happen , ” and the rescued Taliban remain unavailable to American intelligence .
According to a former high - level American defense official , the airlift was approved because of representations by the Pakistanis that “ there were guys — intelligence agents and underground guys — who needed to get out . ”
Once under way , a senior American defense adviser said , the airlift became chaotic .
“ Everyone brought their friends with them , ” he said , referring to the Afghans with whom the Pakistanis had worked , and whom they had trained or had used to run intelligence operations .
“ You ’re not going to leave them behind to get their throats cut . ”
Recalling the last - minute American evacuation at the end of the Vietnam War , in 1975 , the adviser added , “ When we came out of Saigon , we brought our boys with us . ”
He meant South Vietnamese nationals .
“ ‘ How many does that helicopter hold ?
Ten ?
We ’re bringing fourteen . ’ ”
The Bush Administration may have done more than simply acquiesce in the rescue effort : at the height of the standoff , according to both a C.I.A. official and a military analyst who has worked with the Delta Force , the American commando unit that was destroying Taliban units on the ground , the Administration ordered the United States Central Command to set up a special air corridor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights from Kunduz to the northwest corner of Pakistan , about two hundred miles away .
The order left some members of the Delta Force deeply frustrated .
“ These guys did Desert Storm and Mogadishu , ” the military analyst said .
“ They see things in black - and - white .
‘ Unhappy ’ is not the word .
They ’re supposed to be killing people . ”
The airlift also angered the Northern Alliance , whose leadership , according to Reuel Gerecht , a former Near East operative for the C.I.A. , had sought unsuccessfully for years to “ get people to pay attention to the Pakistani element ” among the Taliban .
The Northern Alliance was eager to capture “ mainline Pakistani military and intelligence officers ” at Kunduz , Gerecht said .
“ When the rescue flights started , it touched a raw nerve . ”
Just as Pakistan has supported the Taliban in Afghanistan , Pakistan ’s arch-rival India has supported the Northern Alliance .
Operatives in India ’s main external intelligence unit — known as RAW , for Research and Analysis Wing — reported extensively on the Pakistani airlift out of Kunduz .
( The Taliban and Al Qaeda have declared the elimination of India ’s presence in the contested territory of Kashmir as a major goal . )
RAW has excellent access to the Northern Alliance and a highly sophisticated ability to intercept electronic communications .
An Indian military adviser boasted that when the airlift began “ we knew within minutes . ”
In interviews in New Delhi , Indian national - security and intelligence officials repeatedly declared that the airlift had rescued not only members of the Pakistani military but Pakistani citizens who had volunteered to fight against the Northern Alliance , as well as non-Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Brajesh Mishra , India ’s national - security adviser , said his government had concluded that five thousand Pakistanis and Taliban — he called it “ a ballpark figure ” — had been rescued .

It ’s time to weigh in on a fundamental question :
What is chocolate ?
Two of California ’s oldest confectioners , See ’s Candies Inc. and Guittard Chocolate Co. , are battling an attempt to loosen government rules that dictate what ingredients go into the sweet stuff .

Chocolate standards :
A photograph accompanying an article in Section A on April 14 about a proposal to loosen government rules that dictate what ingredients go into chocolate described the candy pictured as containing walnuts .
In fact , the confection shown contained pecans .
Legally , the candy that melts hearts and comforts the brokenhearted is made with cocoa butter and , in the case of milk chocolate , whole milk .
But the Grocery Manufacturers of America , a trade group , wants to let confectioners substitute cheaper ingredients -- vegetable oils and milk protein concentrates .
Gary Guittard , president of his eponymous , family - owned business , sees this as a battle for the soul of the popular confection .

“ Anybody who has a passion for chocolate does n’t want to see it adulterated , ” said Guittard , whose great - grandfather Etienne Guittard founded the company in San Francisco in 1868 .
But the trade group , which has the support of the Chocolate Manufacturers of America , says it ’s just thinking outside the old chocolate box .
The petition is part of a broad effort to give its members more flexibility in choosing the ingredients that go into many food products .
A spokeswoman said the proposed rules would not prevent companies such as See ’s and Guittard from adhering to the current standards for chocolate .
Nevertheless , Guittard and See ’s Chief Executive Brad Kinstler want America ’s chocoholics to complain loudly to the Food and Drug Administration before April 25 , the day the agency will stop taking public comments on the issue .
It ’s a big constituency .
About a quarter of Americans eat chocolate at least once every two weeks , according to market research firm NPD Group Inc .
All told , the U.S. consumes 3.6 billion pounds of chocolate annually -- that ’s 12 pounds per person .

The chocolatiers have urged lovers of the candy to visit Guittard ’s DontMessWithOur Chocolate.com website , where they can electronically submit complaints to the FDA .
The idea of substituting vegetable oil for cocoa butter , a natural component of the cocoa bean that is the traditional source of chocolate , irks Andrea Langston of Long Beach .
“ I would feel like I was being duped , ” said Langston , who has taken a liking to dark organic chocolate .
“ It ’s $ 3.50 a bar , but it is so worth it .
You just eat one square at a time , ” said the 36 - year - old employee of a computer products company .

Langston and other self - respecting lovers of what the Mayans called the food of the gods should be worried about producers ’ substituting oils for cocoa butter , said Kristy Choo , artisan chocolatier at Jin Patisserie in Venice .
“ It wo n’t be as intense as a real chocolate .
It will have a waxy taste , ” said Choo , whose mango - basil , lavender and ginger - cinnamon chocolate squares sell in a six - piece box for $ 15 .
Price is at the heart of the argument over whether manufacturers should be allowed to change the ingredients of chocolate , said Kinstler of See ’s , which has 205 stores and is based in South San Francisco .
“ You can make chocolate a lot cheaper with vegetable oil , ” he said .

A pound of chocolate contains more than 4 ounces of cocoa butter , at a cost of about $ 2.30 , said Guittard Chocolate , based in Burlingame , Calif .
The same amount of vegetable oil was 70 cents .
Hershey Co. , which supports the Grocery Manufacturers ’ petition , said the standards were created decades ago and should be modernized .
By adopting the proposal , the FDA would be providing “ flexibility to make changes based on consumer taste preferences , ingredient costs and availability and shelf life , ” said Kirk Saville , spokesman for the Hershey , Pa. - based company .
Saville said it could be years before the FDA issued a decision .

Hershey is supporting the move to loosen chocolate rules at a time when sales of premium and gourmet versions of the food are exploding .
Late last year , Hershey launched its upscale Cacao Reserve brand .
Two years ago , it purchased artisan chocolatier Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker Inc. , a Berkeley confectioner known for its dark chocolates and cocoa .
It also recently acquired Ashland , Ore. - based Dagoba Organic Chocolate .
The proposed rule change is part of a strategy by Hershey and other large producers to segment the industry , lowering the quality and expense of everyday candy bars while marketing high - quality , high - priced premium chocolate , said Marcia Mogelonsky , an analyst with market research firm Mintel International .
“ If you take the cocoa butter out of an inexpensive candy bar , most people probably wo n’t notice , ” Mogelonsky said .

Sales of premium chocolate topped $ 2 billion last year , a 129 % increase in five years , Mintel said .
Sales are expected to continue at a torrid pace , reaching $ 3.5 billion by 2011 .
Gourmet offerings include chocolate infused with wine , honey , chai and other exotic flavors .
Some bars are made with cacao from a single region , almost like a wine appellation , and others have high cacao contents ranging up to 72 % .
Medical studies that have found that flavonols and antioxidants in chocolate might play a role in reducing strokes and heart failure -- as long as the fat does n’t kill you -- have only added to the growth in premium chocolate bars , Mogelonsky said .

Gary Guittard believes that in proposing to change the rules , the food industry is overthinking what he believes should be one of the simple joys of life .
“ Why add ingredients to something that is just fine the way it is ? ” he asked .

Cindy Sheehan Arrested ; Will Run Against Nancy Pelosi Posted by Pile ( 5313 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Activists ]
Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan was arrested Monday at the Capitol for disorderly conduct , shortly after saying she would run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the California Democrat ’s refusal to try to impeach President Bush .
Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan says “ Impeachment is not a fringe movement . ”
" The Democrats will not hold this administration accountable , so we have to hold the Democrats accountable , " Sheehan said outside Conyers ' office after the meeting .
" And I for one am going to step up to the plate and run against Nancy Pelosi . "
Sheehan was taken into custody inside Rep. John Conyers ’ office , where she had spent an hour imploring him to launch impeachment proceedings against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Conyers , D - Michigan , chairs the House Judiciary Committee , where any impeachment effort would have to begin .
Sheehan and about 200 other protesters had walked to Conyers ’ office from Arlington National Cemetery .
She said Conyers told her there were n’t enough votes for impeachment to move forward on the issue .

Another apparent violation of the law by Bush administration officials came to light this week , as a Freedom of Information Act request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation revealed that the FBI had sent letters to telecommunications providers requesting that they " provide a community of interest " for telephone numbers the FBI was investigating .
The documents were among the so - called exigent letters that the FBI has admitted were " improper " ( read : illegal ) .
But in a Monday blog post , EFF 's Kurt Opsahl charged that the " community of interest " requests were fresh evidence that the FBI had broken the law .
Opsahl points to a glossary of government terms that defines a " community of interest " as " A grouping of users who generate a majority of their traffic in calls to other members of the group . "
That suggests that the FBI was asking carriers to analyze a suspect 's call patterns and the call patterns of his friends in order to identify which individuals were closely associated with the suspect .
Opsahl notes that the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act places strict limits on the information a telecommunications carrier can share with the government , and information about " communities of interest " are not among the types of information carriers may disclose .
Troubling implications
The revelations have a couple of troubling implications .
First , it illustrates that allowing law enforcement officials to request information directly from telecommunications providers , without obtaining a court order first , is an invitation to abuse .
Without the oversight of an independent magistrate , there is no one to object if the FBI oversteps its authority , as it appears to have done in this case .
Second , the letters suggest that the unnamed telecommunications providers have developed the in - house capacity to perform link analysis on customer data and determine a " community of interest " for each of their customers .
Given that such analysis likely involves examining the call records of dozens of individuals who are not under investigation and turning the results over to the government , it is difficult to see such a capability can be squared with the Fourth Amendment .
Matt Blaze , a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania , told the New York Times that determining communities of interest is " the sort of things telephone companies are doing anyway because it 's central to their businesses for marketing or optimizing the network or detecting fraud . "
He noted that such algorithms can be very powerful , but " it 's also very invasive , " pulling in the private information of people who are not connected to any suspected crime .
In July post on Wired 's Threat Level blog , Ryan Singel noted that the FBI has requested millions of dollars from Congress to pay " contractors " ( most likely AT&T and Verizon ) for " the development of data storage and retrieval systems " that will allow the FBI to request information and analysis for calling records going back two years .
Those funds may be used to expand AT&T 's ability to perform the kind of complex data analysis suggested by the " community of interest " requests .
Markey calls for FCC investigation
Yesterday , Ed Markey , the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet , wrote a letter to FCC chairman Kevin Martin urging him to begin an investigation of the numerous allegations of illegal activities by the FBI , NSA , and other intelligence agencies .
Markey has been urging Martin to act for more than a year , and thus far , Martin has refused to begin an investigation , citing the Bush administration 's state secrets claims .
But Markey suggested that the recent statements of National Security Director Michael McConnell admitting that telecom companies have been assisting the government in its surveillance programs undermine those claims .
Markey could also have cited the July ruling by a federal judge that regulators in five states could launch investigations of carriers ' alleged lawbreaking without running afoul of the state secret privilege .
In that case , Judge Walker did not rule out the possibility that the government could later invoke the state secret privilege to shield some of the information sought by regulators , but he refused to shut down the investigations before they began .
In a Sunday interview with Fox News , White House Homeland Security Advisor Frances Fragos Townsend responded to questions about the latest revelations by pointing to the creation of a " compliance unit " in the FBI .
We thought the Constitution already provided for a " compliance unit " : the judicial branch .
For the past couple of days the White House has dismissed any comparisons between their response to the California wildfires versus their non-response to Hurricane Katrina , and at every opportunity they 've implied that Louisiana was to blame for the humanitarian disaster that followed in Katrina 's wake .
Today 's White House press briefing was no different .
After Perino waxed poetic about California 's local governements and their top - notch evacuation plans , someone pointed out :
Q But you do admit , at least , that scenarios , income - levels , people who have a little bit more money are able to move , go somewhere , versus people who do n't --
And how do you argue with that obvious truth ?
With a little selective amnesia :
MS. PERINO : I think that 's logical .
Absolutely that happens .
And I think that when we see hurricanes that hit -- for example , when the hurricane hit Haiti , it affects people differently , and a lot of people lost shelter completely and did n't have anywhere else to go ... We 're very fortunate in America to have the means to take care of our citizens .
Yes , very fortunate :
This complex is a storage facility to be built by Portland City Storage on the east bank of the Willamette River in Portland .
It will have a glass tower rising more than 22 stories and enclosing a giant mechanical arm capable of lifting 40,000 pounds ( to conserve valuable riverfront land ) .
The building is designed to house boats , recreational vehicles and storage pods , and will hopefully get a Platinum LEED certification by the Green Building Council .
The design includes 175,000 square feet of integrated solar panels , which will make it the largest solar facility in the Northwest , with the excess power being sold to Portland General Electric .
It will be built on just three acres , compared to the more than 30 acres that would be required for a conventional single - story storage facility of a similar capacity .
The building also will have an green roof that collects and recycles rainwater .
It will also feature walkways and bike paths that will help connect Southeast Portland neighborhoods to the river and downtown .

The main base of Scientologists in the world , located in Hemet , CA on a 550 acre space of land which holds multiple castle - like structures as well as L. Ron Hubbard ’s mansion from decades ago .
Here ’s how it goes :
The Deal
Sometime last week , I receive a call from a long time friend who always hooks me up with great short - term jobs and connections .
He ’s a headhunter ( recruiter ) for a living so he ‘ really ’ knows where to look and he ’s always down to find me something interesting to do .
This time I pick up the phone and I can already tell something strange is going on .
He wo n’t tell me what the job is but promises that the pay will be high , and it will be flash - work with a little bit of 3D work thrown in .
And they will also pay me huge amounts of travel expense because of the fact the place I ’ll be going is a little armpit city named Hemet , deep in the hilly fields of eastern California .
After he throws out some numbers , I immediately free my schedule up in a split - second and accept for the week - long project .
Fast - forward a day , I ’m driving up the interstate 15 , wondering what company I ’ll be working for and why my friend would n’t tell me .
It did n’t make any sense .
I ’m following my google maps , driving deeper and deeper into the hills , the wind kicking up sand into my cars paint , and I kept thinking this shit better be worth it .
I finally reach the final street , and as I turn the corner of the farm - ridden land , I almost slam my brakes as a huge silver castle - like structure comes flying into view behind the trees .
I slow to a roll and ca n’t believe the kind of structures that begin appearing behind it .
I started wondering who lived there and what it was , until a few seconds later when I saw my destination address numbers on the gate the property itself .
Confusion sets in …
The gate guard looks pretty sketchy as I slowly pull up , and asks what my name is and if I ’ve been there before .
I tell him , and he asks the exact words , “ who sent for you ? ” , like we ’re living in some sort of fucking medieval age and I ’m a peasant that ’s been sent for some food for my starving village .
At least that ’s what it felt like .
I told him “ I do n’t even know where I am ” .
For some reason he nodded and let me in , as if that kind of situation happens all the time in these parts .
I meet the lady I spoke on the phone with at the reception desk .
She ’s wearing a green shirt with an interesting logo on it – one that rings a bell in my memory , but I ca n’t quite place a finger on it .
Have I seen that before ?
It seems like something I may have made fun of in the past ?
What the hell symbol is that !?
She says , “ Before we start , you can fill out this paperwork and I ’ll put on an introduction movie just to show you what kind of work we do . ”
I sit back and relax after a simple half sheet of information filled out ( Wtf ?
Half a sheet ?
Am I working for the garbage company ? ) , and the movie sprawls into view on the huge TV in front of me .
My jaw drops as the first title screen is read aloud , booming and shaking the room .
WELCOME TO THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY AND DIANETICS .
I keep a smile on my face , because I know the lady is looking at me .
I can always keep my cool if I want to , but this situation was pushing me into a delusional state .
Scientology ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?
I ’m about to work for these goons and stay near / in their stronghold fortress type of shit ?
I laugh under my breath as I think about my friend and what he knew he was doing to me .
Anyway , this is getting too long , let me get down to the rest of the week :
Scientologists are the best people possible to work for .
There is no comparison .
Google is dwarfed .
Yes , I fucking said that just now – GOOGLE CAN NOT COMPETE .
You ’re probably thinking the freaks used their electrical rods on me and I ’m just tripping out right now because I ’ve been messed up in the brain .
But let me tell you what it ’s like .
I worked in an extremely high - tech room , with other regular people ( 2/3 of us there were ‘ not ’ scientologists , simply graphical artists , mostly 3D modelers / animators ) , with all the best perks you can think of .
I was paid $ 55 an hour , PLUS $ 175 a day in travel expenses – and I did n’t even drive back to S.D. every day .
I slept in a cheap hotel or on the premises itself .
But get this , this is the real kicker :
Anyone working there can set their own hours , and you can work unlimited hours .
I ’m not kidding … not only that , but since they are a religious organization , you do n’t get taxed very much at all on your check .
Every day we were served breakfast , lunch , and dinner – the most premium , home - cooked food ever .
The bipolar chef lady ( er , the “ non-existent ” bipolar lady , since mental diseases do n’t exist in a scientology world , haha ) was very nice … and also very mean .
But she served some damn good food .
Everyone in the lab area was always messing around and having a good time , and as long as you got your work done you could take whatever breaks you wanted and even sleep in the lounge if you got tired .
The work itself was grueling , no doubt about that .
I pumped out the most intense , high - tech Flash work I ’ve ever done , by far , which I will post when they upload it .
I performed better than usual because of the vibe around me .
Scientologists only hire the best of the best .
All of the 3D Artists in there were near - Pixar level .
They were paid $ 75 an hour on average and could work as many hours as they pleased .
I know those reading this probably think that ’s bullshit , but I ’m not kidding about this , and if anyone is a 3d animator in Southern Cali , hit me up because I CAN get you a job there .
But ,
It ’s an 84 - hour work week .
Scientologists work more than anyone ever .
In history .
The 30 - year olds of the Church are already going bald – at least 50 % of them in that age range .
You work 7 days a week , 12 hours a day minimum .
As of this writing , I ‘ just ’ got home from a 21 - hour shift .
Nonstop from 7 PM to 4 PM the following day – it ’s no softie shit here .
They break the laws and they do n’t care because they ’re a religious organization .
They told me if I wanted a full - time job , they would offer me a salary well above twice what I ’ve ever made in my life .
But I know in my head that this means one thing – I would ‘ lose ’ every other aspect of my life .
No more games , no more hanging out , no more beer , probably no more girls either , especially since Scientology women are not … the… most … greatest looking women you can find .
I have as much time as I want to decide , they said .
“ Come back whenever ” ...
I ’ll be sure to alert all my friends and acquaintances if I ever do it , because they will no longer be seeing me very much .
I ’m dubious right now despite the cash calling .
Scientology ?
What the fuck ?
I asked the same thing , Let me go into some shorter sections about the religion itself .
The Religion
I have three major points to make .
I feel my opinions on the subject are pretty unbiased , being an atheist , yet relatively educated in most religions .
1 ) Scientology ‘ is ’ a true religion .
There are positive ( and negative ) morals and beliefs behind it , and under the surface there is more than it may seem at first glance .
2 ) While it ’s not the most scientifically - correct belief system , I promise you that the media has screwed up the image of this world way , way more than it really is in reality .
There are large numbers of questionable points , but no one fucking believes in Xenu .
3 ) I am not , and never will be a scientologist .
The only interest I have in it is curiosity , and the only reason I ’m writing this is because this experience was totally new for me and I felt like sharing my opinion on the subject .
I ’m not vouching for it or putting it down – I just want to try and speak the reality of the situation .
I ’ll start with the bad first .
And the first thing that comes to mind is L. Ron Hubbard himself .
I read multiple books of his , under the subject of dianetics , throughout my week - long stay .
A lot of my flash work for them also incorporated his words and ideas into the interface , so you can say I received a good dose of old Hubbard .
This man ’s writings reek of obviousness and vague made - up terms about life that he created to try and better those around him .
Some of the stuff he wrote was just totally outrageous and unable to be backed by any decent experiment or thesis .
I will say though , he was a good science - fiction writer , and most would n’t deny that .
That ’s where the Xenu character comes in – Scientologists ‘ do not ’ believe in Xenu , I was assured over and over again … besides for maybe a few crazies , but every religion has those .
I found it slightly comforting that Scientologists do not believe in a made - up invisible friend .
Back to Hubbard , yes , he was probably a genius , but only in the aspects of persuasion and social cohesion .
He printed his books in a way so that more simple - minded folk could pick them up and quickly extract many ‘ points ’ about life from them .
Most of the points in the books are questionable to any intelligent mind , but the fact remains that the majority sound positive and motivating .
It gives you a good feeling to read about how life “ could ” be .
Other bad things : Scientologists are against all forms of psychiatry and pharmaceutical drugs , and they do n’t really believe in mental illness .
This is baffling to me .
They do n’t like lazy people , and they do n’t like poor people .
Everyone else is pretty much accepted .
Also , it still feels like they have a “ religious ” mind state , as in , most things they do should somehow benefit their church and community , or else something is not worth doing .
Now onto the good .
These people are somehow , in some way , smart as hell .
They are technology geniuses , as Hubbard was , and they have a keen understanding of modern movements in the digital world .
They are very nice people for the most part as well , even though they can be sort of cliquish .
It sort of felt like they were intimidated by me in many instances , even though I ’m very friendly and easy to get along with for most people .
It put me in a position I was n’t used to , but it was n’t too big of a deal .
In reality , I know this was just because they do n’t “ get out ” too much outside of their huge , huge semi-city that they have built for themselves in this remote region of the hills .
The followers of this religion also are fairly peaceful and worldly .
They have set up tents all around the world in many cities that need help , offering their services .
They definitely have the money to do it .
Now whether or not this is for exposure and fame can be debated .
I think it ’s probably half and half myself .
Either way though – it ’s still helping many regions of the world , especially the programs set up in Africa .
One more section I have to address ...
The People
One scientologist lady , also the one doing my payroll , was so god damn cool that she almost single - handedly changed my opinion on this religion upon our first conversation .
This lady is truly one of the coolest people I ’ve ever met , and I only spent a week around her and her crew .
She always knew how to act in the most sincere and positive way in any situation and her head was on straighter than mine ever will be .
Her , and the other “ ones ” like her got me to thinking :
If some of these people are truly genuine , and they follow this practice , that means the religion ‘ has ’ to have some sort of reasonable and intelligent values .
And it does – I know for a fact it does .
It ’s not ALL mumbo- jumbo FOX - News reported fucking crap .
There ’s no aliens .
There ’s definitely no brainwash of any kind .
And better than that .. all the “ real ” scientologists love nothing more than to talk shit about Tom Cruise all day .
They do n’t like him or Travolta one bit … they got their status through money and money alone .
But really , I ’m not praising them more than what I saw .
Just a percentage of them .
Overall , in truth … this is still a weird group of people .
They are secretive , they are quiet , and the word that comes most to mind , is “ sentinel ” .
I would be outside on a break , at 5 AM in the desert , and a few hundred yards away I might see a group of four people , all in green shirts , marching along together into the structures of the darkness .
Then I might turn around and hear a motor - scooter buzzing around in a circle around me , invisible to the eye , the roads non-existent .
They also would n’t let us “ normies ” walk anywhere on the property besides our designated areas .
We knew where those were without ever having to question it .
Getting caught outside the socially - marked spots would spell disaster , or so I heard .
I snapped some pictures and got a couple movies actually , although I do n’t know how well they will actually represent the vibe on the lands there .
I ’ll show them later .
This came out way longer than I meant it to be , but that should be expected when I try some new shit .
The main points I ’d like to reassure you about :
I ’m not a scientologist and I never will be .
I am an atheist who believes in no supernatural or magical forces , and that will probably never change .
Scientologists pay the most .
I was a 2D artist getting more cash than most 3D artists .
And when / if I become a full - blown 3D artist , you better believe I ’m working for these sons of bitches .
That is $ 300,000 a year when you factor in the 84 hour work week , if you work every day ( Rare .
That ’s too much . )
It ’s not a bullshit , fake religion , but it ’s still weird and obscure .
I ’m still having a hard time grasping “ exactly ” what it is , and trust me , you might think you know but you have no idea .
After a week with these people , I actually feel sort of grateful to have seen how much the media and word - of - mouthers really skew things like this .
It ’s not a good religion , and it ’s not a bad religion .
It ’s definitely filled with propaganda bullshit , but it has decency .
I guess that goes for most religions .
Fucking weird , what a weird week .
Scientology … lol… that ’s still funny to me .

A company that distributes Japanese animated cartoons has tracked down thousands of BitTorrent users it accuses of breaching their copyrights and has successfully forced their ISPs to reveal their identities .
Next step - threatening letters : " Pay Us $ 3,500 or Else "
Odex Pt. Ltd is a Singapore - based company that distributes anime in South East Asia .
Created in 1998 it started distributing anime in 2000 , later with titles such as Bleach , Fullmetal Alchemist , Mobile Suit Gundam and Chrono Crusade .
In 2007 a decision was made in the company to start targeting people who share their material via BitTorrent after they claimed their sales had dropped 60 - 70 percent in just 2 years .
After using a tracking system to collect the IP addresses of sharers , they have successfully forced StarHub – an internet service provider – to reveal the identities of 1000 BitTorrent users they accuse of breaching their copyrights .
It had previously forced the ISP SingNet to reveal its customers details .
In all fairness , StarHub did put up a fight to keep the privacy of its users but it was little use .
According to StarHub spokesman Michael Sim , although the company originally said they had “ an obligation to protect our customers ’ information ” , the pressure from the courts was too great .
A court order against StarHub was obtained in a closed chamber session in the Subordinate Court which forces them to hand over their customer ’s details .
“ In the instance of Odex , ” said Sim , “ they have satisfied the court of their need for the information .
As such , we will comply with the court order ”
The next step for Odex is a familiar one to file - sharers : they will use the list of names that StarHub supplies to send them threatening letters ( pdf ) declaring that they ’ve been caught sharing anime , such as the hugely popular ‘ Bleach ’ , and that the only alternative to being dragged through the courts , is to pay a $ 3000 - plus ‘ fine ’ .
Not that they ’ll have much time to think about the next step – Odex gives around 9 days for a response before it threatens legal action .
According to Stephen Sing ( a director of Odex ) the “ downloading situation ” in Singapore is very bad : “ We have engaged companies to track illegal downloads in Singapore , and ratio - wise , we ’re actually right up there in the illegal downloads in the world , in terms of Japanese animation . ”
Interestingly , Stephen Sing is also a director of the AVPAS – Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore and has become very , very unpopular .
Just after the Odex anti-BitTorrent campaign began , Mr Sing made the mistake of using an online forum to joke about how many sharers he was taking action against , and the guys over at HardwareZone caught him at it , via their dedicated ( Official ) Anti-Odex Club .
Mr Sing has been dubbed ‘ the most hated main in Singapore ’s anime community ’ , with anime fans putting up his photographs and personal information onto the internet , making wanted posters of him , posting pictures of his wife on the internet , threatening him with violence and promising to set fire to his house .
At this point , Sing called in the police .
Next ISP on the Odex hit - list is Pacific Internet – if they win , that ’s another 1000 BitTorrent users about to get threatening letters and demands for $ 3000 – thats 3000 users in total .
Should everyone pay up , Odex stands to collect a massive $ 9 million .
No wonder the death - threats did n’t deter Mr Sing .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The historic deal between GM and the UAW on health benefits is the latest and loudest signal that healthcare will be the largest domestic issue facing the next President .
That news , combined with Hillary Clinton 's announcement of her plan and the Mayo Clinic 's release of its proposal , starts to set the firm outlines of the coming debate .
It will be big and messy , taking us places we have n't imagined , but here 's one probable - and surprising - consequence : Americans will increasingly realize that their own health depends on business 's health .
The reasoning goes like this .
Clinton 's proposal defines the left - most boundary of the mainstream debate .
Her main Democratic rival , Barack Obama , has a position slightly less liberal than Clinton's .
( John Edwards has a more liberal position but seems stuck in third place . )
The most significant feature of Clinton 's proposal is that it relies mainly on private health insurance , not a single - payer structure .
It 's hardly a free - market plan .
It would force every American to get health insurance and would subsidize those who might have trouble affording it .
But it would be built largely around private insurance companies .
The right edge is imprecise because Republican proposals are sketchier , but none of them would require anyone to buy health insurance .
They would alter the tax code to make insurance and direct healthcare costs more affordable , then let people buy what they liked .
For example , Mitt Romney would make individuals ' health - insurance premiums and direct expenditures fully tax deductible .
So we 've roughly defined the terms of the discussion , which is a major development .
Now consider the GM - UAW deal , which offloads the company 's retiree health benefit obligations onto a trust that GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) will fund with tens of billions of dollars , assuming union members approve the overall contract .
Similar trusts would presumably be set up at Ford ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler .
When that happens , hundreds of thousands of retirees will depend for their benefits not on negotiations with employers and not on government , but on the performance of the investments in those trusts - the stocks and bonds of thousands of corporations .
The emerging big picture is that no matter what happens , most of us will bear more responsibility for our healthcare expenses than we do now .
Clinton 's plan would make America 's 47 million uninsured get coverage , throwing them into the world of premiums , deductibles , and tax credits - a long way from the current system of just going to the emergency room and letting someone else pay .
Republican proposals to level the tax treatment of health spending would lead people to choose plans with lower premiums and higher co-payments ; as Romney advisors John Cogan and Glenn Hubbard point out , consumers would thus have more skin in the game .
That 's all to the good .
A major reason American healthcare is the world 's most expensive by a mile is that it lets consumers make choices about how to spend someone else 's money , and no one makes economical choices that way .
As consumers face the reality that there is no free hip replacement , they may begin to reflect on how their care actually gets paid for .
Specifically , it may occur to them that only a few options exist .
Private insurance companies can't pay out more than they take in ; they 're businesses .
They invest premiums , so the success of their investments - of business - benefits everyone .
Similarly , labor union funds like the UAW 's would need high - performing investments .
As Americans pay more of their health expenses out of pocket , especially in retirement , they 'll have to rely more on their pension funds , mutual funds , and life insurance - all of which depend on the success of investments .
People in the workforce will need a good job more than ever .
Combine all those factors , and more people may realize that their own health requires healthy companies .
Am I being insanely Pollyanna -ish ?
It 's possible .
Americans have a long tradition of hating medical insurance companies .
Clinton continues to demonize them , which is not a dumb tactic if you want to win an election .
So as Americans face the reality of what healthcare really costs , they may despise insurance companies even more and by extension companies in general .
In any case , the reckoning is coming , probably in the next President 's first term .
I 'm guessing that as Americans face the tough tradeoffs on life - and - death issues , they just might realize that business is not their enemy but their essential partner .
What would buy your vote ?
Twenty percent of students polled by their peers at New York University ­said they ’d exchange their vote in the next presidential election for an iPod touch .
Sixty - six percent would exchange it for free tuition .
And fifty percent said they 'd lose the right forever for $ 1 million .
Would you give up your vote for anything ?
If so , what would it take ?
Post a comment below and let us know .
Duluth , Minnesota — Capitol Records , et al v. Jammie Thomas ( the name of the suit changed after the RIAA dropped the sole Virgin recording from the case ) got under way this morning in Courtroom One of the Federal Building in Duluth .
Armed with three boxes of documents and Thomas ' computer ( a squat black and silver Compaq minitower of not - too - recent vintage ) , Thomas ' attorneys arrived bright and early , about an hour before proceedings began at 9am .
The RIAA 's team , consisting of Richard Gabriel and Tim Reynolds of Holme Roberts & Owen as well as Matt Oppenheim of The Oppenheim Group , arrived a few minutes before the scheduled start .
They were armed with several boxes of exhibits , which included CD - Rs they said contained the songs allegedly downloaded by Thomas .
Like over 20,000 US residents , Thomas stands accused of copyright infringement by the RIAA , but this case is the only one to make it to trial .
Although Thomas ' defense is expected to center around the ownership of the copyrights to the songs flagged by the RIAA 's investigative arm , SafeNet , her counsel Brian Toder did n't raise the issue during opening arguments .
According to the certificates of copyright presented by the RIAA during discovery , the registrations for half of the songs in question do n't jibe with the group 's court filings .
On the eve of the trial , Judge Michael Davis ruled against the RIAA 's motion to introduce another 784 pages of documentation that it had failed to produce during discovery .
Jury selection
Jury selection went quickly , with 12 jurors selected from a the initial pool of 16 .
Included among them are a high - school English teacher who describes himself as an amateur musician and a subscriber to Rolling Stone magazine who had followed the RIAA 's litigation with some interest .
Some of his students had even done research papers on the topic of P2P litigation .
Judge Michael Davis and the attorneys seemed most interested in determining if any of the prospective jurors had any connection with the music industry , whether they believed artists should be compensated fairly for their work , whether they owned PCs and used the Internet , whether they were musicians , and whether they had ever downloaded music from the Internet .
Gabriel asked one juror who said she had heard a bit about the history of the litigation on NPR if she had heard any recent reports by NPR , presumably referring to Atlantic v. Andersen .
Five or six of the prospective jurors indicated that they had downloaded music , with most of those indicating that they had used iTunes .
One woman said she had downloaded music back in 2003 and that she was n't happy with the quality of the recording she had downloaded .
She said that she did n't think downloading without paying was right , but that if the music was of poor quality , the record labels should n't be concerned about it .
She did n't make the final cut for jurors .
The final 12 seem to be about as diverse as a random group of people from the Iron Range of Minnesota can be .
All of them are Caucasians , two of them do n't own PCs and have never used the Internet , and a third described himself as a " total computer illiterate . "
In addition to the English teacher , there 's a funeral director , a bartender , and a steelworker .
Opening arguments
After a brief recess , Richard Gabriel began his opening statements .
Dressed in a black suit and red tie , Gabriel was soft - spoken and addressed the jurors without the benefit of notes .
He told the jury that the record labels were made up of " real people " from the artists themselves down to those who worked in distribution .
" The recording industry faces a significant threat to their livelihood , " Gabriel told the jury .
" A large part of that threat is copyright infringement over the Internet . "
Gabriel accused Thomas of distributing over 1,700 songs over KaZaA , although the case is only focusing on 25 of those songs .
" Downloading and distribution does n't happen by accident , " he told the jury .
Gabriel then went through a description of how KaZaA and other P2P networks are used , how the RIAA 's investigators SafeNet ( formerly Media Sentry ) investigate and identify downloaders , and the process that led up to the lawsuit being filed against Thomas .
He emphasized that everyone on KaZaA can get an " exact digital copy " of every song shared .
With the background out of the way , Gabriel went on to the particulars of the case .
The alleged infringement was identified on February 21 , 2005 , and SafeNet 's investigator sent an IM to tereastarr@KaZaA warning her that she was engaged in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials .
A key part of the RIAA 's case is proving that Thomas was the person behind the tereastarr@KaZaA screen name .
Gabriel noted that Thomas uses the tereastarr handle online , including for her Charter e-mail account , her IM accounts , and her MySpace page .
He also said that she has an " eclectic , far - reaching taste in music " that was reflected in the shared folder discovered by SafeNet .
Another issue raised by Gabriel was Thomas ' hard drive .
She had the hard drive replaced in March 2005 at a Best Buy store , and Gabriel said that both the RIAA and Thomas ' forensic expert agreed that it was n't the drive in use when the alleged infringement took place .
Pointing out that the defendant was not planning to call her own forensic expert , Gabriel intimated that the hard drive was replaced to cover the defendant 's tracks , saying that she said it was replaced in March 2004 , not March 2005 as was actually the case .
He then concluded by saying that the labels would prove that they controlled the copyrights at issue and that the defendant distributed the songs to " millions of others " on the Internet .
Brian Toder , the defendant 's counsel responded .
Speaking from his notes , he told the jury that this was a " tough case , " with the defendant in the difficult position of having to prove a negative .
" Someone was on KaZaA , and someone from SafeNet downloaded the music , " he told the jury .
Toder then reminded the jury that the only bit of concrete identifying information is the IP address flagged by SafeNet and the MAC address of the cable modem .
" The best we can say is that someone using the IP address in question offered music that was downloaded by the plaintiffs , " he argued .
Toder also laid out a different timeline of events .
He noted that there was no evidence that anyone had seen the IM allegedly sent by SafeNet on February 21 .
On March 7 , 2005 , Thomas took her PC to Best Buy for repair due to " beeping and error codes , " not in an attempt to conceal anything .
" It was Best Buy 's decision to replace the hard drive , before she had any idea that the RIAA was even putting together a case against her and 20,000 others , " he said .
According to the the timeline offered by Toder , the first communication to the defendant came on April 22 , 2005 , in the form of a letter sent by her ISP .
She did n't receive one of the RIAA 's settlement letters until August 2005 .
Toder again pointed out that the hard drive was replaced before the defendant was ever notified that she was the potential target of a copyright infringement lawsuit .
He also attacked the " circumstantial evidence " of the tereastarr@KaZaA name .
" If you 're going to engage in illegal activity , are you going to use the name everybody knows you by ? "
Toder asked the jury .
He also said that the decision not to call the forensic expert was solely financial .
First witness
With opening statements concluded , the labels called their first witness , Jennifer Pariser , the head of litigation for Sony BMG .
Gabriel started with a number of questions about file sharing and the music industry before honing in on the particulars of the case .
Pariser called file - sharing a " tremendous problem affecting the music industry " that " causes several billions of dollars of harm " to the labels .
" It 's important to combat , " she explained .
" If we do n't , we have no business . "
The rest of her testimony covered the investigative process , settlement letters , and consisted of her identifying the specific Sony BMG recordings in the case .
Pariser also explained the chain of ownership , saying that the actual copyright registrations did n't always match those in the case because of sales and name changes .
Before the lunch recess , the jury and the rest of the courtroom were subjected to Journey 's " Do n't Stop Believing " played from a portable CD player over a cheap set of computer speakers .
Pariser played two versions of the song , the one she said was downloaded from KaZaA , and the version from the album Escape , to demonstrate that both recordings are identical .
After the lunch recess , Pariser is expected to finish up her testimony , and the labels are expected to call others from the industry as well as the forensic investigators .
It 's the judge 's hope that the case will wrap up on Thursday .
We 'll have a recap of the day 's proceedings when court adjourns this evening .

CANCER patients ' chances of survival vary widely among European countries .
Franco Berrino and a team of researchers from Eurocare studied the outcome of 2.7 m new cases diagnosed between 1995 and 1999 in 23 countries .
Five years after diagnosis , survival rates were highest overall in the Nordic region ( except Denmark ) and lowest in central Europe .
Health spending is a factor , with higher national expenditure usually correlating with higher survival rates .
Denmark and Britain are exceptions .
They have lower rates than those in countries with similar levels of spending , perhaps suggesting ineffective use of resources .
The findings are published in the latest issue of the Lancet Oncology .

One of the biggest problems when developing a system , be it software or a website , is getting the customer to visualise how your proposed solution is going to work .
Quite often , you will get a long way down the path towards producing your solution before you get any meaningful feedback .
The big early career lesson for most programmers is showing an unfinished piece of software to the eventual users and assuming that they will be able to visualise how the software will eventually look and behave .
They wo n’t !
So , what ’s the solution .
How can you help your customers visualise your solution in the design phase , not the production phase ?
The answer is paper prototyping , a simple yet effective method of designing a system ’s user interface and performing usability testing .
Put simply , paper prototyping involves creating a paper / card based model of your proposed system .
You can mimic interactivity by the use of cut - out elements .
One person takes the place of the computer and makes sure that the paper model interacts with the user .
You can then garner feedback from your users on how well the system suits their needs .
All without resorting to the time consuming task of creating the system on a computer .
Why you should be interested in paper prototyping :
Test your design in the design phase .
Iterate the design before you go into production when changes are cheap ;

The Nielsen Norman Group also have a training video on paper prototyping .
Humans and Chimps share 98.5 % of their genes .
However , no one would say that chimps approach humans in intelligence or cognitive ability .
What accounts for the difference ?
About 5 million years ago or less , a genetic change was introduced into a protein called the neuropsin , which governs memory and learning and is found only in neurons in the central nervous system .
While both humans and chimps have neuropsin - humans alone have a second form of the protein called Type II neuropsin .
It is disintinguished from the former in that it is 45 amino acids longer .
In the recent study , conducted by Dr. Bing Su at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and just published in the journal Human Mutation , scientists also showed that inducing the Type II mutation in chimpanzee neurons was sufficient to create the longer splice variant found in humans , demonstrating that a relatively minor mutation could account for the difference in protein length - and therefore the mental performance gap , between the species .
It would be interesting to determine if the genesis of the Type II variant led to the development of consciousness or enhanced self - awareness by stimulating changes in the brain .

Critics have argued that the doctors have a financial incentive in sending patients to their own facilities , even when those patients might be better off having their surgery in regular hospitals .
But the Texas case , and others like it , have invited new scrutiny from regulators and members of Congress about these hospitals ’ ability to care for patients who suffer complications after their operations .
While some of these hospitals are large sophisticated operations , like those hospitals specializing in cardiac care , others are much more modest .
For example , small surgical hospitals may not have separate emergency facilities or , as in the Texas case , a doctor on site at all times during a patient ’s recovery .
A similar case involved an 88 - year - old woman two years ago at a small doctor - owned hospital in Portland , Ore. , where the nurses called 911 after she was given too much pain medicine following spine surgery .
She , too , later died .
As the number of doctor - owned surgical hospitals grows , federal and state officials now acknowledge that the government rules may be too vague about the emergency abilities a hospital must have in place .
Regulators are particularly concerned about the very small hospitals that focus on only a few kinds of surgery but perform operations that frequently require an overnight stay .
While Medicare ’s rules currently say a hospital must “ meet the emergency needs of patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice , ” the details are left largely to the hospital ’s discretion .
Federal and state officials say they are now reviewing the guidelines to toughen the rules and make them more specific .
We do n’t — just believe me — outside of a few places such as Monterey Park or Flushing , Queens .
Dan Drezner poses the query , and considers immigration restrictions as a factor , though without endorsing that hypothesis .
Immigration ca n’t be the key reason , since I can learn to cook the stuff ( really ) , there is plenty of excellent Chinese food in Tanzania ( really ) , and most French food in America is cooked by Mexicans ( that you already knew ) , albeit with instructions .
The main problems are simple :
1. Cantonese food requires super fresh ingredients , lots of vegetables , and amazing seafood .
That ’s three strikes right there , especially below the gourmet price level .
2. Sichuan and Hunan foods are oily , often very spicy , and most of all use lots of animal fat .
Nor do they hesitate to serve up chicken kidneys , pig ’s maw , and the like .
This is essential for these cuisines to taste good but it all goes against the American grain .
To cite one example , Mexican food cooked with fresh lard tastes much better than with vegetable oil , yet most Mexican families , within a generation and a half , make the switch to vegetable oil ( que triste ! ) .
3 . Even today most Chinese cities are huge gardens with massive swathes of small - plot farmland , right within the city .
Shanghai too .
The short food supply chain makes many things tastier , as they are sold fresh in daily markets .
The cuisine is designed around that system , whereas mass - produced American cuisine meshes with long - distance trucking .
This clash of culinary civilizations penalizes true Chinese styles , though I ’ll still predict that real Sichuan will be the next big food trend here in the U.S.
In my household , it already is .
Since there is excellent and reasonably authentic Chinese food in densely populated Chinese - American communities , consumer demand ( see # 2 ) is probably the major factor .
For the comments I ’ll stipulate no rehashing of the usual immigration debates ; you all have enough chances to do that .
p.s. On MR it ’s China Day !
Array #flatten は配列をたたむメソッドです 。
ary = [ [ 1 ] , [ 2 , [ 3 ] , 4 ] , [ 5 ] ] p ary .
flatten
このメソッドは便利に見えて、非常にはまりやすいメソッドです。このメソッドはたたみすぎるんです。上で言うと、[1 , 2 , [ 3 ] , 4 , 5 ] を返してほしいのです 。
例えば、 「 ちょっと x と y の組を作りたいけど、いちい ち
Point クラスを作るのは面倒 」 というようなときに、横着して [ x , y ] という配列を使います。その後、 「 座標の配列の配列 」から 「 座標の配列 」を作ろうと思って flatten すると、なんと「 x と y が順に並んだ配列」ができてしまいます。これはたまりません。
この例だけ見れば 「 横着すんな」で終わりそうですが、
そうは言っても使い捨てプログラムでは横着したいし、
連想配列からハッシュを作るとき Hash.new の引数にするために flatten を使う ( Hash.new (*ary.flatten ) ) も、ハッシュのキーや値が配列ではまる ( 参考 ) とか 、
Array を継承したクラスもつぶされるので始末が悪い
( Array を継承し て HTML の抽象構文木クラスを作っていたらはまった経験あり )
など、都合の悪い例は山ほど考えつきます。逆に、「たためる限りたたみたい」という現状の flatten への需要がどういうときに発生するのか想像できません。
というわけで、普通 は Haskell の concat のように 1 段だけたたみたいのです。現状ではしょうがないから inject を使って以下のように書きます 。
p ary.inject ( [ ] ) {| z , x | z + x }
でも僕は頭が悪いので、inject ( や fold ) を使うのに MP を 10 くらい消費した気分になります 。
というところで先日気がついたのですが、ruby 1.9 では Array # flatten のたたむ数を引数として指定できます。
p ary.flatten ( 1 )
これこそ求めていた機能です。できればデフォルトで 1 にしてほしい気もしますが、とりあえずそこまでは望みません。効率など無視してリストの変換ベースで
Ruby のプログラムを書く人 ( = 僕) は大喜びです 。 「 1.9 に乗り換え る 10 の理由」を僕が選ぶとしたら多分入選します。
という感動を経て、次くらいに不満に思っていた tail の提案に至りました。めでたしめでたし。
( 追記 ) 「 たたむ」じゃなくて「広げる」じゃないのかという信じられないほど正しいつっこみをいただきました。でもなぜか僕の中では「たたむ」というイメージです。なんでだろう？
JERUSALEM
ISRAEL is facing a challenge it never expected when it captured East Jerusalem and reunited the city in the 1967 war : each year , Jerusalem ’s population is becoming more Arab and less Jewish .
For four decades , Israel has pushed to build and expand Jewish neighborhoods , while trying to restrict the growth in Arab parts of the city .
Yet two trends are unchanged : Jews moving out of Jerusalem have outnumbered those moving in for 27 of the last 29 years .
And the Palestinian growth rate has been high .
In a 1967 census taken shortly after the war , the population of Jerusalem was 74 percent Jewish and 26 percent Arab .
Today , the city is 66 percent Jewish and 34 percent Arab , with the gap narrowing by about 1 percentage point a year , according to the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies .
Jerusalem ’s profound religious and historical significance makes its status perhaps the single most explosive issue in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
And that status clearly would become even more contentious were the balance of the population to tip toward the Arabs .
This is a specter that worries Israelis , even as the 40th anniversary of their victory in the June 1967 war approaches .
Even at the age of eight , the world is divided into chavs and chav-nots .
Evidence of just how early class attitudes kick in is revealed in a study published today .
Better - off children see their counterparts on disadvantaged housing estates as badly behaved " chavs " , going to " rough schools " with unemployed parents who do not care for them .
Those growing up on estates regard rich children as " posh " , mean , friendless and lacking in fun as their lives revolve around learning and homework .
Young people aged eight to 13 do not see themselves as rich or poor but they have a clear idea of who they are not , say researchers from Loughborough University 's centre for research in social policy .
Estate children see poverty as something that involves homeless people or living in the third world while private school pupils see themselves as average rather than affluent .
Yet when they talk about other people , rather than their peer group , children are far more antagonistic .
Their view of social differences is part of research into poverty and education funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .
It involved 42 eight - to 13 - year - olds , mostly white , from an unnamed estate and a private school .
The private school children spoke of chavs being at one end of the social spectrum and of rich at the other , with themselves in the middle .
Chavs , with their tracksuits , hoods and baseball caps , were common , if not necessarily poor .
Estate children thought rich people were spiteful and greedy , talked differently , lived in different houses and wore designer clothes .
All the children stressed the importance of education , free time , a similar range of most valued possessions - including pets , toys and games - and their family and friends .
Yet while the private school children were positive about school , felt encouraged by their teachers , and were financially rewarded for their achievements by their parents , the estate children were mainly disappointed , complained about the teaching and associated school with control .
They also wanted to protect parents from the extra costs of after - school activities .
The researchers say there is a real need for schools to help children become " less judgmental and hostile " towards their better or worse - off peers .
They also warn the government 's programme to make state schools have extended days to provide more help and activities for parents and children must be properly thought through .
" Children and young people are unlikely to relish the prospect of longer days at school if they are only receiving more of the same . "
They also warn that children on estates should not always be assumed to be behaving antisocially when on the street .
Limited opportunities for organised activities mean open spaces are vital , they say .
" Owing to the nature of their street play , they were often visible and therefore open to sanctions from those in authority and neighbours within the estate , " they add .
The Gillette Singularity
I ’m coming to this one late , but some wits at The Economist recently plotted out some interesting trends in razor - blade design .
They charted out the dates in which single , double , treble , qadruple and quintuple - bladed razors emerged , and noticed that the rate of increase in the number of blades per razor - head has been accelerating .
It took 80 years for the industry to add a second blade , about another 15 to add the third , then only two or three years between the four - bladed Schick Quattro and the five - bladed Gillette Fusion .
The story is here , and Avram Grumer wrote a funny post pointing out where this is all headed :
Now , that power - law curve predicts 14 - bladed razors by the year 2100 , but that ’s not the interesting curve .
The interesting curve is the hyperbolic one , for two reasons :
One , it matches the real - world data .
And two , it goes to infinity in 2015 .
And how are you going to get an asymptotically - accelerating number of blades onto a razor ?
Why , you ’d need godlike super - technology to do that .
Friends , it ’s clear what ’s upon us : The Gillette Singularity — the moment at which the act of shaving becomes so radically unlike any shaving before it that history no longer provides us a guide to what lies before us .
Personally , the whole four - and five - blade thing kinda baffles me .
If I try shaving with anything more than two blades , the bathroom turns into a total slaughterhouse — blood and guts on the ceiling .
I have yet to find a razor that shaves as well as the original , simple Gillette Sensor .
Yet the sad fact is that as the razor industry jetpacks its way into the eschatalogical glory of infinitely - bladed heads , the companies have scaled back production of their creaky two - bladed models .
Locating an actual package of Sensor razors in New York here is like trying to find a rotary pay phone .

Pot lobbyists target conservatives in New York legalization drive Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Since 1996 , 12 US states have enacted legislation permitting medical use of marijuana , prescribed under the supervision of a doctor , to patients who are seriously ill .
Earlier this month , the Marijuana Policy Project , a top D.C. pot lobby group , announced it had designs on number 13 : New York .
While it is no surprise that New York and its blue - tinged electorate would make a logical target for the medical legalization push -- not to mention a nice East Coast bookend for advocates ' successes in California ten years ago -- the pot policy group 's tactics in the Empire State are not so predictable .
They 're wooing conservatives .
" We 're focusing on Republicans in New York swing districts , " the group 's communications director , Bruce Mirken , told RAW STORY .
" Places where these people are not dead certain they 're going to win their elections . "
A bill legalizing medical use of marijuana has already passed the Democrat - heavy New York State Assembly , and the Senate could be poised to take on a different version of the bill in the next few months .
Proponents say that if they cobble together enough conservative support , the legislation could become law .
Joining with the like - minded group New Yorkers for Compassionate Care , the Policy Project rolled out an arsenal of print and radio advertisements in September .
They featured a conservative as the ad's centerpiece .
" I 'm Joel Peacock , a 56 - year old construction manager and member of the New York State Conservative Party , " read one ad , accompanied by a photo of Peacock , that ran in the Long Island district of Republican State Sen. Carl Marcellino .
" I 'm also a patient suffering from chronic , severe pain due to a 2001 car accident , who every month uses thousands of dollars of prescription pain medicines that offer me little relief , " the ad continues .
" Please give me and thousands of other suffering New Yorkers the legal option of the relief that medical marijuana can offer us . "
Although the ad may appear at first glance to be an uphill appeal to a voting block historically unsympathetic to calls for relaxed drug policy , poll findings tell a different story .
56 percent of Conservative Party members in New York -- and 76 percent of all New Yorkers -- are in favor of " allowing the very ill to use and grow medical marijuana , " the ads say .
" We said ' let 's look at the conservatives , the constituency that 's assured to be the most difficult , " Mirken said .
" And what we found is that they 're actually behind us . "
Those statistics , reported this year by pollsters Mason - Dixon and the Sienna Research Institute , represent , according to Mirken , a unique political phenomenon -- " a majority , " he said , " that does n't know they are a majority . "
A poll three years ago in Vermont asked if they thought others would support legalization of medical marijuana , regardless of their own personal opinion .
" People said ' no . '
They did n't think others would support it , " Mirken said .
" And it 's everywhere you go .
Support cuts across race , gender and ideology ... but there is a disconnect from political opinion .
And legislators are stuck .
They say , 'it 's going to look like I 'm soft on drugs . "
For the targets of the marijuana lobby , however -- namely , New York conservatives -- legalizing a controlled substance , even to be doled out under strict medical supervision , is not always an easy sell .
" There is nobody active in the Party who wants to see people suffering , " Shaun - Marie Levine , Executive Director of the Conservative Party of New York State , told RAW STORY .
" But smoking a joint is not the answer . "
Influential New York kingmakers who hold a great deal of sway among state Republicans , the Conservative Party may have a majority of registered members who back a move for medical use , but its leadership remains vocally opposed .
" Did you see that bill ? "
Levine asked , referring to the State Assembly 's version of the June legislation permitting pot prescriptions .
The Assembly 's measure " legalizes the possession , manufacture , use , delivery , transfer , transport or administration of [ marijuana ] by a certified patient or designated caregiver for a certified medical use ... "
And that , for Levine , is near - anarchical .
" It says you can have 12 pot plants in your house , " she said , aghast .
" 12 pot plants ! " " We really believe , " Levine said , " that this is just a way to make pot legal . "
Tomorrow : NY Conservative
Party leaders claim medical evidence is on their side ; fear ' full - blown legalization ' is on the horizon .
The single - mindedness , the one - sidedness of feeling , is perhaps the most important shibboleth of the emotional terrorist .
Furthermore , the extent of this one - sidedness is , for the practitioner , perhaps the greatest measure and indicator of how extreme the terrorist 's actions are capable of becoming .
Any person suffering an unhappy family situation , or the dissolution of a marriage or relationship , will feel some pain and desperation .
A relatively well - balanced person , however , will be not only aware of their own distress but also sensitive , in some degree , to the suffering of the other family members .
( For example , reasonably well - balanced parents , when facing divorce , will be most concerned with their children 's emotional well - being , even beyond their own grief . )
Not so the emotional terrorist .
To the family terrorist , there is only one wronged , one sufferer , only one person in pain , and this person is the terrorist herself .
The terrorist has no empathy and feels only her own pain .
In this manner , the terrorist 's capacity for feeling is narcissistic , solipsistic , and in fact pathological .
Again , I will not attempt here to detail the factors in childhood that lead to the creation of an emotional terrorist .
What is , however , evident , in the terrorist 's limited or non- existent ability to recognise other people 's feelings , is that the terrorist 's emotions and awareness , at crucial stages of childhood development , were stunted from reaching beyond the boundaries of self , due to a multiplicity of reasons .
Later , the adult terrorist went on to make a relationship that was , on some level , no true relationship , but a re-enactment of childhood pains , scenarios , situations , and ' scripts . '
Throughout the relationship , the solipsistic terrorist did not behave genuinely in response to the emotions of other family members but self - servingly used them as props for the recreation of the terrorist 's program .
And when that relationship finally faces dissolution , the terrorist is aware only of her own pain and outrage and , feeling no empathy for other family members , will proceed single - mindedly in pursuit of her goal , whether that goal is reunion , ruin , or revenge .
The terrorist 's perspective is tempered by little or no objectivity .
Instead the terrorist lives in a self - contained world of purely subjective pain and anger .
Because conscience consists so largely of the awareness of other people 's feelings as well as of one 's own , the emotional terrorist 's behaviour often can be described to be virtually without conscience .
In this lack of conscience lies the dangerous potential of the true terrorist , and again the degree of conscience in evidence is a useful measure in my work to anticipate the terrorist 's destructiveness .
An additional factor , making the terrorist so dangerous , is the fact that the terrorist , while in positively monomaniacal pursuit of her goal , feels fueled by a sense of omnipotence .
Perhaps it is true that one imagines oneself omnipotent when , in truth , one is in a position of impotence ( as in the case of losing one 's familial control through dissolution ) .
Whatever the source of the sensation of omnipotence , the terrorist believes herself to be unstoppable , and unbound by the constraints or conscience or empathy , believes that no cost ( cost , either to the terrorist or to other family members ) is too great to pay toward the achievement of the goal .
The terrorist , and the terrorist 's actions , know no bounds .
( The estimation of the extent of the terrorist 's ' boundlessness ' presents the greatest challenge to my work ) .
Intent only to achieve the goal ( perhaps ' hell - bent ' is the most accurate descriptive phrase ) the terrorist will take such measures as : stalking a spouse or ex-spouse , physically assaulting the spouse or the spouse 's new partners , telephoning all mutual friends and business associates of the spouse in an effort to ruin the spouse 's reputation , pressing fabricated criminal charges against the spouse ( including alleged battery and child molestation ) , staging intentionally unsuccessful suicide attempts for the purpose of manipulation , snatching children from the spouse 's care and custody , vandalising the spouse 's property , murdering the spouse and / or the children as an act of revenge .
In my experience both men and women are equally guilty of the above behaviour , but on the whole , because it is men's dysfunctional behaviour that is studied and reported upon , people do not realise that to the same extent women are equally guilty of this type of violent behaviour .
My working definition , then , of a ' family terrorist ' or an ' emotional terrorist ' is : a woman or a man ( but for the purposes of this work , I refer only to women ) who , pathologically motivated ( by unresolved tendencies from a problematical childhood ) , and pathologically insensitive to the feelings of other family members , obsessionally seeks through unbounded action to achieve a destructive ( and , therefore , pathological ) goal with regard to other family members .
Of course , this defining profile pertains to individuals in differing degrees .
Many people , unhappy within a relationship or made unhappy by the dissolution of a relationship , may lapse into periods of ' irrational ' behaviour .
What characterises the terrorist , however , is that the vindictive and destructive behaviours are consistent ; the moments of calm and periods of lucidity are the lapses , temporary lulls in the storm .
Also , there are women who , suffering chagrin and misery during or after the life - span of a relationship , appear far more self - destructive than destructive to anyone else .
For the other partner , contemplating leaving this kind of individual , the very thought of leaving such a person is made difficult and untenable by such frequently uttered protestations as ' I can not live without you , ' and ' Without you , I might as well be dead . '
To be sure , many women exist , extremely dependent within their relationships , who , probably having suffered severe emotional betrayal during their childhood , genuinely feel that their life outside a relationship would be so lonely as to be unbearable .
It is difficult to leave such a woman , and the man attempting to leave may well feel that , by leaving , he would be responsible for delivering a mortal blow to an already pathetic wretch .
Men also , are often kept in their relationships , which can only be likened to ' personal concentration camps , ' by the fact that they feel a genuine feeling of ' chivalry ' towards their partner .
Women tend to put so much more of themselves into their relationships and therefore suffer when these relationships fall apart .
There is a valid question as to whether or not this sort of suicidally - inclined individual may be deemed a terrorist .
( To many minds , this kind of individual , no doubt , would seem to fall more within the category of ' emotional black - mailer . ')
I believe that , sadly , there are people , deeply damaged by their childhood , who genuinely cannot face life by themselves .
When dealing with such potential cases , however , I try to make the leaving partner understand that the suicidal inclinations predate the relationship by many years , and that , however tragic the situation , one person simply cannot be held responsible for keeping another person alive .
In some individuals , the authentic ( though unhealthy ) longing for death is a longing planted within them since early childhood , and there is very little a partner can do to alter the apparently inevitable course of that longing .
Among true terrorists , however , threats of suicide can be seen to serve a largely manipulative role .
In short , the terrorist says , ' If you can't do as I tell you , I will kill myself . '
Whether suicide remains only a threat or is realised , the true terrorist uses suicide not so much as an expression of desperate grief but as a weapon to be wielded against others .
In working with clients struggling either in relationships or with the dissolution of a relationship , I am faced with many questions , all relevant to gauging the woman 's terrorist potential : ' Will the woman persevere in her efforts to financially ruin her partner ? '
' Is she sincere when she promises to kill her partner , or have him killed , should he ever become involved in a new relationship ?
Are the threats of suicide genuine or manipulative ? '
' Will she carry out the promises of using the law to ' kidnap ' the children in order to hurt the ex-partner ? '
' Will she brain - wash the children to such an extent that her ex-partner dare not form a new relationship ?'
Emotional terrorism is by no means confined to the family context .
I know an extremely successful woman in the world of fine arts .
This woman has been haunted by a former assistant who , vicariously imagining herself to the writer herself , dresses like her , stalks her , and issues public statements that it was she , not the writer , who created the works of art for which the writer is internationally famous .
If the writer is to ensure her own safety , then very definite steps must be taken .
In situations of emotional and family terrorism , there are two areas of work to be done : practical measures of protection ( ' strategies for survival ' ) on the part of family members , and therapeutic work with the terrorist himself or herself .
I must reiterate at this stage , that both men and women are capable of terrorist tactics but men tend to behave in a more physically violent manner within the family .
Women , as I have shown use far more subtle tactics ie .
that of the terrorist as opposed to outright war .
The first step , on the part of other family members , toward limiting the terrorist 's destructive potential is to understand the terrorist to be a terrorist .
In a recent case , a Mr. Roberts described to me how , during his marriage , he and his children faced a daily onslaught of verbal abuse from his wife .
Mrs. Roberts was also physically violent to the children .
Now that he has asked for a divorce , she is making use of every weapon in her arsenal .
In the children 's presence , she has used drugs and drunk alcohol to the point of extreme intoxication .
She has staged several unsuccessful suicide attempts in front of the children , threatened over the telephone to ' do something stupid , ' promised to kill Mr. Roberts new partner , and assured Mr. Roberts that when she has finished with him he will not have a penny to his name .
To Mr. Roberts , all of this behaviour seemed perfectly usual .
After all , he had witnessed this sort of commotion for thirteen years of their marriage .
When I suggested to him , ' What you endured is emotional terrorism , he suddenly and for the first time was able to see his situation clearly .
Now , he realised , his wife 's behaviour was neither appropriate nor acceptable .
No , this was not the treatment that every man should expect from his wife , either in or out of marriage .
No , he does not want his children to be subjected to such extreme behaviour any longer .
The fact of recognising a terrorist is the essential first step .
Then , because a terrorist is fuelled by a feeling of omnipotence and is prepared to behave without bounds , ( usually encouraged by feminist therapists who insist that their clients suffer from ' low self esteem ' ) , pragmatic measures must be taken to define clearly the boundaries of behaviour .
It is unfortunate that the legal situation which many divorce agreements mandate is open - ended .
Certainly , when both parties to a divorce are reasonably well - balanced , it is entirely fitting for the settlement to be flexible enough to incorporate changing financial circumstances , child - care capabilities , and visitation rights .
When , however , one party to the divorce is an emotional terrorist , then both the confrontational divorce procedure and the resultant open - ended divorce settlement provide infinite opportunity for the courts , lawyers , and the entire battery of psychologists called in for evaluations , to be used a the terrorist 's weapons .
In these cases , the court and the divorce procedure provide no boundaries for the terrorist ; instead they allow the terrorist to continue to behave boundlessly .
For this reason , when dealing with a terrorist , it is best for the divorce procedure and final decree to be as swift , as final , as absolute , as unequivocal as possible .
Every practitioner or attorney handling divorces is familiar with clients described as ' litigious . '
Only when ' litigiousness ' is seen as a manifestation of terrorism can the course to swift and precise legal settlement be steered .
To limit the terrorist 's feelings of omnipotence , there are many effective measures .
The guiding principle , as in the handling of political terrorists , must be ' There is no negotiating with terrorists . '
Endless telephone calls , conversations , confrontation , trial ' get - back - togethers , ' correspondence , visitations , gestures of appeasement , and efforts to placate the terrorist 's demands , all serve to reinforce the terrorist 's belief that she is accomplishing something .
Only determined resolution in the face of terrorism shows the terrorist that her power is limited .
Furthermore , for anyone dealing directly with the terrorist , reassurances , ' ego boosts , ' ' positive strokes , ' and consolations are lamentably counter - productive .
Mrs Roberts soon found for herself a feminist therapist staunchly supporting the erroneous belief ' All feelings ( and therefore behaviours ) are valid . '
Mrs Roberts is told by this therapist that she has a right to feel and to behave in any manner she chooses , in callous disregard for the devastation inflicted upon the children .
Such reassurances serve only to fortify the terrorist 's already pathological , solipsistic , and eternally self - justifying perspective .
If wishing to undertake the second sphere of disarming a terrorist - personal intervention with the terrorist herself - the therapist must be prepared to be straight , honest and very direct .
In my own dealings with women as terrorists , I have found on occasion that one quite simply can point out to the terrorist , ' You are behaving like a terrorist .
This is what you are doing .
This is how you are being destructive .
This is the destruction you are heading towards , ' and the terrorist , seeing themselves clearly for the first time , might be encouraged to reconsider their behaviour .
More commonly , however , extremely deep therapy is required .
For the terrorist 's behaviour to change , there must first be a solid and fundamental change within the terrorist 's physiological constitution .
Usually it is only by an in - depth excavation and resolution of early childhood pain that the terrorist can begin to gain a real , true , and level - headed perception of her own current situation .
Direct intervention with a terrorist - like all forms of therapeutic intervention - can hope to achieve change only if the individual concerned wishes to change and possesses that vital yet ineffable quality : the will to health .
When the will to health is lacking , there can be no change .
If the terrorist cannot or will not change , one can only help the other family members to be resolute , be strong , and , whenever possible , be distant .
Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , said yesterday that more borrowers with good credit were falling behind on their loans and that the housing market might not begin recovering until 2009 because of a decline in house prices that goes beyond anything experienced in decades .
The news from Countrywide , widely seen as a bellwether for the mortgage market , initiated a sell - off in the stock market , which is at its most volatile in more than a year .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index fell 30.53 points , or 2 percent , to 1,511.04 , its biggest one - day drop in nearly five months .
The dollar dropped to a new low against the euro , edging closer to $ 1.40 to 1 euro .
Stocks opened sharply lower in Japan this morning .
The slumping housing market has become the biggest worry for the stock market , which just four days ago set records , because of its potential impact on the broader economy and financial system .
Countrywide ’s stark assessment signaled a critical change in the substance and tenor of how housing executives are publicly describing the market .
Just a couple of months ago , some executives were predicting a relatively quick recovery and saying that most home loans would be fine with the exception of those made to borrowers with weak credit who stretched too far financially .

Never before have I believed in love at first sight .
They were shapely and round and oh - so - generously proportioned , with smooth creamy skin , and they were proudly standing up with the resilience of youth .
I immediately began thinking of all the things I could do with your breasts -- we could go for long walks together on misty mornings , have dinner in romantic restaurants , go for bike rides around the lake .
I began to imagine a lifetime of waking up with your breasts in my face , continuing to love them as age and gravity inevitably take their toll .
I could write poems for your pom-poms , ditties for your titties .
Eat your heart out Keats -- who needs a Grecian urn when I 've got a pair of ice cream sundaes with cherries on top ?
I 'm almost certainly too old for you , but I think I could still have a meaningful relationship with your boobs .
10 best ways to burn capital
Sometimes seeing how best to achieve the opposite of what you want to achieve can help you to clarify what you should do :
10 best ways to burn capital
Hire a complete set of senior managers ASAP after forming your company .
The great thing about senior managers is that they will want to hire other managers and you will end up with more layers of management to spend money on !
Hire the senior managers from large companies .
They are even more inclined to spend money on additional management layers as well as many different staff functions .
Locate your team in an expensive city .
Your staff will need more cash comp to live , so your salaries will be higher .
Also , your rent ( and everything else ) will be higher !
Ramp up your staff quickly in anticipation of high demand .
Your current staff will spend more of their time recruiting and training ( lowering productivity ) and your new staff will have a lower utilization as well .
If you do this really well , you will build a long - term culture of not being productive that will last through all phases of your company ’s evolution .
Use your marketing resources on branding and try to brand what you do n’t have .
Focussing your marketing efforts on lead generation and product marketing will have too much capital efficiency to meet your goal of burning capital .
Use your sales resources on field sales and large company partnerships .
These are the activities that cost the most and take the longest to turn into revenues .
Activities like telemarketing , inside sales , and developing the natural business partners are too capital efficient !
Put a large development team in place and then focus your development staff on the core technology and ignore the packaging and UI considerations … then hire some professional services , training , and customer service staff to help your customers implement , configure , train , and resolve issues .
Do not hold staff meetings or company - wide meetings or other communication methods to help focus your team ( e- mail , IM , etc . ) .
This will create too much clarity and resolve too many questions .
Get backing from 2 or more VCs with very large funds … the larger the better !
They have a need to deploy more capital and will own more of your company over time , so will be less resistant to these ideas .
Never , ever , ever put in place management systems such as budgeting , metric management , or incentive systems that drive the right activities .
If you do put in place the management systems , be sure not to focus them on the key drivers of your business .

Cheney ' interfered directly ' to get terror plea bargain David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 23 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney cut a deal with the prime minister of Australia to orchestrate a plea bargain with an Australian terror suspect that would keep him out of sight until after Australia 's national elections next month , an Australian television station reported .
Cheney " interfered directly " to secure Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks ' guilty plea to material support for terrorism , the Australian Broadcasting Company reported Tuesday .
Cheney 's intervention , according to a Harper 's article cited by the ABC , was " part of a deal " with Prime Minister John Howard , who is facing a re-election fight next month .
Howard denies the deal .
Hicks will be released from an Australian prison on Dec. 29 as part of a plea agreement reached in March .
The first detainee convicted by a Guantanamo military tribunal , Hicks was given a seven year jail sentence but a judge suspended all but nine months of that .
Hicks was held at Guantanamo for five years before going to trial .
An unnamed military official told Harpers , " One of our staffers was present when Vice President Cheney interfered directly to get Hicks ' plea bargain .
He did it , apparently as part of a deal cut with Howard . "
" I kept thinking : this is the sort of thing that used to go on behind the Iron Curtain , not in America , " the official continued .
" And then it struck me how much this entire process had disintegrated into a political charade . "
The ABC also reported that Australian police hope to put Hicks under a " control order " that would require him to report regularly to police , obey a curfew and limit his communications to approved phone lines .
Critics of Howard 's administration told the ABC that it was " just too convenient " that Hicks 's plea deal would have him out of sight until after Australians go to the polls this year .
Intervention in prosecutions for political purposes would fit the " modus operandi [ that ] has marked the Bush Administration for six years , " Harpers reported , citing demands from the administration to pursue politically opportune cases in the US before the 2008 presidential election .
The following video is from the Australia Broadcasting Company 's ABC News , broadcast on October 23 , 2007 .

THIS SHOULD BE DEEPLY DISTURBING :
Two separate segments of last evenings Hardball ought to be profoundly disturbing — if you want a Democrat to win the White House next year .
The conduct of the program itself was disgraceful .
But the problematic conduct extended to liberal guests on the program as well .
At issue was a recent comment by Michelle Obama .
This issue has blown up in the past few days .
So lets do a quick review :
Last Thursday , Michelle Obama joined her husband on the stump at Iowas Cass County Fair .
This is part of what she said during her speech that day : MICHELLE OBAMA ( 8/17/07 ) :
One of the most important things that we need to know about the next President of the United States is , is he somebody that shares our values ?
Is he somebody that respects family ?
Is a good and decent person ?
So our view was that , if you cant run your own house , you certainly cant run the White House .
So , so weve adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first , so while hes traveling around , I do day trips .
That means I get up in the morning , I get the girls ready , I get them off , I go and do trips , I m home before bedtime .
So the girls know that I was gone somewhere , but they dont care .
They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night , and it keeps them grounded , and , and children — the children in our country have to know that they come first .
And our girls do , and thats why were doing this .
We re in this race for not just our children , but all of our children .
It would be hard to imagine less provocative prose — and we dont meant that as a criticism .
But over at the New York Times , a little guy with great big ears was listening intently as Obama spoke .
The last time we looked in on fresh - faced Jeff Zeleny , he was crafting a non-story story about Candidate Biden , using a Standard Press Corps Script : Joe Biden talks too goddamned much .
Last Thursday , out in Iowas Cass County , Zelenys scriptometer began to clang when he listened to Michelle Obama .
The next day , he built a story around this theme : Barack Obama has moved in recent weeks to sharpen his tone noticeably as he fights for the Democratic presidential nomination , increasingly drawing sharp contrasts with his rivals . 
In his story , he pulled one line from Michelle Obamas speech — and a story was about to be born : ZELENY ( 8/17/07 ) : Even Michelle Obama presented a contrast here on Thursday as she introduced her husband in an open - air barn at the Cass County fairgrounds .
She told a crowd of more than 200 people that family values and trust were important in the next presidential candidate .
'' Our view is that if you can't run your own house , you certainly can't run the White House , '' Mrs. Obama said .
Later , she added : '' This election is about truth and authenticity .
There is nothing more important than your word .
Truth does matter .''
When he took the microphone , Mr. Obama used similar phrasing , saying , '' Part of the change , by the way , is telling the truth to the American people about the very serious and difficult challenges and choices that we face . ''
Zeleny didnt have the guts to say what he plainly meant .
But his implication was perfectly clear ; Michelle Obama was sliming the Clintons when she said ,  Our view is that if you can't run your own house , you certainly can't run the White House . 
For the record , theres no sign that Zeleny asked either of the Obamas if that was what Michelle Obama meant .
Nor did he include the larger context of Obamas statement — the context provided above .
Our guess ?
The scribe just knew how his colleagues would love the chance to talk about this matter !
Omigod !
Another chance to discuss Bill Clintons sex life !
For the past fifteen years , major journalists  have lived this dream , tossing aside all manner of substance to focus attention on Bill Clintons  blow jobs .
( They have health care .
They dont care if you do . )
Reading deep meaning into one line , Zeleny gave them their latest chance .
( For the record : Several other major newspapers , and the AP , covered the Obamas Cass County event .
Only Zeleny mentioned that line — the deathless line he cleverly pulled from the middle of Michelle Obamas statement . )
On Monday , a columnist at the Chicago Sun -Times also focused on that troubling line .
In this case , Jennifer Hunter came close to saying what she actually meant :
The line could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons ,  was what Michelle Obama had meant .
But her column gave Matt Drudge an excuse to pimp the exciting new scandal on his low - IQ , thumb - sucking site .
Presto !
Last night , two separate panels of pundits were asked to discuss the new scandal on Hardball .
Before we look at what happened on Hardball , lets make a few basic observations .
First , an obvious question : Was Michelle Obama taking a swipe at the Clintons  when she made that remark ?
Like Zeleny and Hunter , we have no way of knowing — although its far from clear that she was .
Both Barack Obama and his campaign have now aggressively said that this wasnt her intention .
And in fact , Michelle Obama has discussed family values issues many times — seeming to use the theme to take a swipe at the Bush Administrations skewed priorities ( examples below ) .
But yes , her cherry - picked remark could be interpreted  as a swipe at the Clintons — and for addled children like those in our press corps , this would be the obvious reading ; theyve spent their lives chasing Bill Clintons penis around , and nothing else really matters to them , or gets their dead blood flowing .
When the chance for such discussion presents , these hapless , broken - souled losers will seize it .
To borrow from a stale old jibe :
Our journalists  think with Bill Clintons penis !
They re empty , overpaid , broken - souled losers — and our nation will be at their mercy forever , unless we progressives can find a way to make their conduct stop .
This brings us up to
What was wrong with Hardballs conduct ?
Lets start with the tape Mike Barnicle played for Amy Goodman and Robert Tyrell , the first panel with which he discussed this matter .
Heres how Barnicle introduced this segment — the first of two separate segments he spent on this brain - dead topic .
BARNICLE ( 8/22/07 ) : Welcome back to Hardball .
Barack Obama`s wife , Michelle , has roughed up the campaign with a line that some believe is a back - handed swipe at Hillary Clintons marriage .
Take a look at what she said in Iowa last week :
MICHELLE OBAMA ( videotape ) :
One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is , is he somebody that shares our values ?
Is he somebody that respects family , is a good and decent person ?
So , our view is that , if you can`t run your own house , you certainly can`t run the White House .
( end of videotape )
BARNICLE : So , did Michelle Obama take a shot at Hillary there ?
At this point , Barnicle introduced Tyrell and Goodman .
 Bob , was she taking a shot at Hillary and the Clintons ?  he now asked the well - known crackpot .
What was disgraceful about Hardballs conduct ?
Note the way this tape was edited .
On Tuesday night , this same topic had been explored on Countdown , Hardballs companion program .
But Countdown aired the fuller tape , letting people see what Michelle Obama said after that highlighted sentence .
Just for the record , heres the text of the fuller tape which Countdown played Tuesday night : MICHELLE OBAMA ( videotape ; played on Countdown , 8/21/07 ) :
One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States it is he somebody that shares our values ?
Is he someone that respects family , is a good and decent person ?
Our view is that you cant run your own house , you certainly cant run the White House .
We have adjusted our schedule to make sure that our girls are first .
While he is traveling around , I do day trips .
I get the girls up in the morning , get them ready , get them off , go and do trips .
I m home before bedtime .
Do you mind if we make the obvious point ?
MSNBC possesses the longer tape — the tape which shows the fuller context of what Michelle Obama said .
It shows her talking about adjusting her schedule around her girls — and no one has ever said that the Clintons didnt do this when they were raising their daughter .
On Tuesday , Countdown played the longer tape — and Chuck Todd immediately cited Barack Obamas insistence that this statement wasnt a swipe at the Clintons .
But on Hardball , they wanted to chase Clintons penis around , so they edited 
Michelle Obamas fuller comments — and Barnicle forget to mention what the Obama campaign has said .
Hardball wanted a good penis - chase — the work it has specialized in for a decade — and the repulsive program was gimmicked again to make the chasin good .
This conduct by Hardball was disgraceful — although , of course , it was perfectly typical .
But we were also deeply frustrated by the performance of two liberal guests .
These people do a great deal of superlative work .
We thought they fell short last night .
Start with Goodman , the super - bright host of the progressive program , Democracy Now .
She clearly knew the fuller context of what Michelle Obama had said ; immediately , she began to read from the longer transcript about taking care of the girls .
But at no point in this endless segment did she ask the obvious question : Mike Barnicle , why are you running a doctored tape ?
Why arent you letting your viewers see Michelle Obamas fuller statement ?
Did it not occur to this super - bright guest that Hardball was playing a slick , contrived game ?
That Hardball was putting its thumb on the scale , playing its viewers for fools once again ?
Obviously , we dont know the answer to that .
But Goodman has become a semi- regular guest on Hardball — and you dont remain a semi- regular guest if you challenge this programs conduct .
And here we see the contradiction which has dogged liberal politics for the past dozen years — the contradiction which is likely to doom Democratic hopes for the White House .
Over the course of the past fifteen years , it has become increasingly clear that big mainstream news orgs are essentially tools of Republican interests when it comes to electing our president .
The Washington Post and the New York Times ?
NBC
News and its cable step - child ?
All these orgs were deeply involved in the lengthy Wars Against Clinton and Gore — but for the most part , career liberals sat around and stared , refusing to say one word about it .
When these orgs staged their two - year War Against Gore , career liberals took a near - total pass — and Bush ended up in the White House .
Weve told you this story for many years — but on the whole , you just cant make the nations career liberals deal with this critical contradiction .
For career liberals , career success runs through these big news orgs — orgs which might hire them as writers , orgs which give publicity to their publications .
To all appearances , many career liberals have no intention of blowing their own financial interests in the interest of liberal politics .
No , we wont name individuals here — we cant mind - read individuals  motives — but this group story has been blindingly evident over the course of the past dozen years .
Even now , our timid , mewling career liberal players sit around trembling at career liberal redoubts , unwilling to let average people know the shape of our modern press / politics .
This silence has killed Dem interests in the past ( see Gore ) .
It could doom us again in 08 .
Last night , Hardball was up to its standard old tricks — and two liberal guests didnt manage to say so .
Let s move past Goodman , who failed to ask for the fuller tape .
During Hardballs second segment about Obama , it would have been easy for smart - and - feisty Joan Walsh ( Salon ) to chide Barnicle thusly : COULD HAVE SAID THIS : Mike , come on !
Id like you to play the fuller tape of what Michelle Obama said .
If you would just show the fuller tape , it becomes perfectly clear that she wasnt talking about the Clintons .
Come on , Mike !
Why are you playing the edited tape — the tape which omits what she really said ?
Why arent you letting your viewers see the fuller tape ?
Why cant they see what she said ?
It would have been easy for Joan to say that .
At some point , average people in Hardballs audience deserve the chance to hear such comments .
If were progressives — and not just self - dealers — then average people deserve to be told about how they get played by the swells .
In the series we continue below , were starting to describe the sorry shape of next years presidential presspolitics .
If history is any sort of a guide , this is what is going to happen : Mainstream new orgs will keep finding character problems  in the Democratic nominee ; in Rudy Giuliani , those same mainstream orgs will find no moral flaw .
Only one questions remains to be answered :
Will career liberals be willing to notice this time ?
Will they holler , long and loud ?
This time , will we finally be honest ?
Will we finally name the orgs that are trying to elect a Republican ?
For the record , weve sent e-mails to Amy and Joan ; wed like to ask them about their strategies in their Hardball sessions last night .
Each does tons of excellent work .
But liberals have lost the White House before because of the onslaught of character sliming , and were going lose to Rudy next year if last night is a guide .
MICHELLE OBAMAS FAMILY VALUES : Michelle Obama has routinely discussed these issues in the past .
In July , this was part of a profile by the APs Jessica Gresko : GRESKO ( 7/19/07 ) : Michelle Obama also talked about the challenges facing her husband 's campaign and the difficulties women face in balancing work and family ...
An administrator at the University of Chicago Hospitals , Michelle Obama has scaled back her hours to campaign for her husband , though she generally makes day trips to be home in the evening for the couple 's two young daughters .
" We want to be the best parents that we can be with fewer and fewer resources and support systems to make it happen , " she said .
" Affordable child care is becoming less of a thing that women can count on .
Quality education in the public school is a hit or miss .
Health care , keeping your family healthy .
I could go down a list of struggles and challenges . "
Obama said that is n't being talked about publicly , and she wants to change that .
" We suffer in silence , and it 's almost as if we do n't want to admit that it 's as hard as it is , and that if we do that somehow we 're failing when the truth is that we need more help , " she said .
Did that sound like a swipe at the Clintons ?
No , and it also didnt sound like something that people like Hunter waste time discussing .
( In this same interview , Obama described her husband as a  Harry Potter parent . )
Meanwhile , here she is , explicitly discussing family values in a New York speech a few days before that : MICHELLE OBAMA ( 7/8/07 ) :
You know , there just are n't enough hours in the day .
I know we all feel that , so we do what we can , and many of us do it in spite of the lack of adequate government and social support .
The reality is , ladies , that women and families just are not getting the support that they need not just to survive , but to thrive .
We have spent the last decade talking a very good game about family values , but I just have n't seen much evidence that we actually value women or families .
We have essentially ignored the plight of women and families , and we 've essentially told them , " You go figure it out . "
Figure out how you 're going to support a family on minimum wage with no benefits .
You figure it out .
Figure out who 's going to watch your children without quality and affordable childcare .
You figure it out .
Figure out how you 're going to keep your family healthy without access to affordable health care .
Figure out how to ensure that your children are going to get the best education possible , if all of our schools are not sufficiently funded .
Figure out where you 're going to live without access to affordable housing .
So essentially , we 've told women , " Dream big . "
But after that , you 're on your own .
 We have spent the last decade talking a very good game about family values ? 
Did that sound like a swipe at the Clintons ?
Why , it almost sounds like a swipe at the Bushes !
But when Jack Welch went out and purchased his gang of  Lost Boys ,  he bought himself a group of lost lads who dont react to matters like that .
They want to chase Clintons penis around — and invent tall tales about Gores lies .
Next year ( see Part 2 , below ) , they will find no fault in Rudy — and theyll find big character problems with the Dem nominee .
And with the unfortunate spouse .
That s what happened on last nights Hardball .
If we liberals still refuse to respond — if were still prepared to pretend we dont see — then you can make way for President Rudy .
If we still pretend we dont see whats occurring , the next crazy war youll be crying about will be the one Saint Rudy starts .
TOMORROW : Humans cant understand spacetime .
And liberals just cant grasp presspolitics .
Special report : Only Dems !
BE SURE TO READ EACH THRILLING INSTALLMENT :
In modern press corps culture , character problems are only for Dems .
Read each thrilling installment : PART 1 : Only Dems have character problems .
Reactions to Rudy prove it .
See THE DAILY HOWLER , 8/21/07 .
In Part 2 , we get our first look at our brilliant  Ground Zero Hero . 
PART 2 — GROUND ZERO HERO :
To his credit , Tucker Carlson raised the point , late in Tucker .
The issue had been around for weeks ; it had then been fleshed out , in substantial detail , on the front page of Fridays New York Times .
But you know the culture of todays store - bought press corps !
In their store - bought , scripted world , character problems are only for Dems !
So the pundit world had been looking away — but to his credit , here was Carlsons introduction : CARLSON ( 8/21/07 ) : Rudy Giuliani has stayed atop of polls of Republican voters thanks largely to his image .
Americans think they know Rudy Giuliani .
They see him as a mayor who stood tall after 9/11 .
But could he be overplaying his hand when it comes to those tragic days ?
Possibly .
First , Giuliani had to backtrack after comparing himself to rescue workers that toiled at Ground Zero .
Now we learn from the fervently left - wing , but occasionally accurate , Salon.com that Giuliani actually spent more time cheering on the Yankees than he did at the World Trade Center site .
He even crossed the country to watch them play .
Does it matter ?
Or should Giulianis polished persona — could it possibly lose its luster ?
Here to tell us , Mort Zuckerman and Rosa Brooks .
Long story short : Giuliani has paraded about in the past several years , vastly embellishing his personal history concerning 9/11 and the work at Ground Zero .
Yes , BUETTNER ( 8/17/07 ) : As Rudolph W. Giuliani campaigns around the country highlighting his stewardship of New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks , he is widely hailed for bringing order to a traumatized city .
But he has also raised the hackles of rescue and recovery workers by likening his experience to theirs .
On at least three occasions , in responding to accusations that the city failed to adequately protect the health of workers in the wreckage , he has boasted that he faced comparable risks himself .
In one appearance he declared that he had been in the ruins '' as often , if not more ' ' than the cleanup workers who logged hundreds of hours in the smoldering pile .
Another time he brushed aside safety claims by asserting that his long hours at the site had left him susceptible to ' 'every health consequence that people have suffered . ''
 On at least three occasions ,  Giuliani has told the world about his own brilliant Ground Zero heroism .
He had been in the ruins at Ground Zero as often if not more than the actual clean - up workers , he has said .
Later in his report , Buettner recalled what Giuliani told the Associated Press on September 11 , 2006 — the fifth anniversary of the attacks .
 I spent as much time here as anyone ,  the heroic ex-mayor admitted that day .
'' I was here five , six times a day for four months .
I kind of thought of it as living here .
And there were times when I wore a mask when you got near the pile .
Times when I did n't .
Those were the instructions .
For Giuliani — the brilliant Ground Zero Hero — theres the good news and the bad news .
First the bad news :
These heroic statements simply arent true ; Giuliani has been wildly overstating , lying about his work at Ground Zero .
Then the good news :
In the modern American press corps , character problems  are only for Dems !
Within the past decade , a Major Dem was savaged , for years , for making self - serving misstatements like these — even though his alleged misstatements  were simply inventions of the press corps .
But right up through Carlsons show Tuesday night , few very pundits had even said boo about Giulianis lying .
And make no mistake : Giulianis lying about Ground Zero is only one part of the recent revelation of what would be called his character problem — if he were a Democrat .
On August 7 , biographer Wayne Barrett published Village Voice ,  Rudy Giuliani's Five Big Lies About 9/11 . 
Barretts report helped start the discussion which Buettner continued in Fridays Times .
But Barretts listing of Rudys five big lies went well beyond the matters examined by Buettner .
Buettner dealt with only one part of this big blowhards lies .
Given the norms of newspaper work , Giulianis lying has been so vast that you cant do it all in one article !
Lets say it again : Within the past decade , a Major Dem was eaten alive for allegedly embellishing the truth in this manner .
The press corps savaged him for years — even invented psychiatric theories about his deeply troubling conduct .
( Al Gore lies even when telling the truth would be just as good ! )
World history changed when this Big Major Dem was savaged — attacked for his troubling character problem . 
And uh - oh !
As the press corps has slowly begun to admit , reports of these lies had been greatly exaggerated !
Al Gore never said he invented the Internet , the Washington Post finally told us — last year .
Now , eight years later , Saint Rudy is lying .
In fact , hes been lying all over the country , about the most sacred event in our recent history .
But so what ?
Character problems are only for Dems — and we liberals are too dead - dog stupid to stand up and fight this double standard .
We liberals said nothing in 1999 , when the press corps went to war against Gore .
We said and did little in early 04 , when the spinning began about John Kerry .
And today , we sit and stare into space as the press corps ignores this Republicans lying .
Rudy remains the Ground Zero Hero — because were simply too stupid to fight .
Giuliani , the GOP front - runner , has benn lying his way all over the country .
But we liberals sit in our self - imposed puddles and stare .
What a group of willing victims losers we liberals keep turning out to be !
Get ready for foreign war with Saint / President Rudy — unless we ourselves learn to fight .
TOMORROW — PART 3 : What Barrett said .
NEXT WEEK : Brooks and Zuckerman on the Ground Zero Hero .
And : Romneys reinventions .
Two separate segments of last evening sought to be profoundly disturbing — if you want a Democrat to win the White House next year .
The conduct of the program itself was disgraceful .
But the problematic conduct extended to liberal guests on the program as well .
At issue was a recent comment by Michelle Obama .
This issue has blown up in the past few days .
So lets do a quick review : Last Thursday , Michelle Obama joined her husband on the stump at Iowas Cass County Fair .
This is part of what she said during her speech that day :
It would be hard to imagine less provocative prose — and wemeant that as a criticism .
But over at the New York Times , a little guy with great big ears was listening intently as Obama spoke .
The last time we looked in on fresh - faced Jeff Zeleny , he was crafting a non-story story about Candidate Biden , using a Standard Press Corps Script : Last Thursday , out in Iowas Cass County , Zelenys scriptometer began to clang when he listened to Michelle Obama .
The next day , he built a story around this theme : Barack Obama has moved in recent weeks to sharpen his tone noticeably as he fights for the Democratic presidential nomination , increasingly drawing sharp contrasts with his rivals . 
In his story , he pulled one line from Michelle Obamas speech — and a story was about to be born : Zeleny didnt have the guts to say what he plainly meant .
But his implication was perfectly clear ; Michelle Obama was sliming the Clintons when she said ,  Our view is that if you can't run your own house , you certainly can't run the White House . 
For the record , theres no sign that Zeleny asked either of the Obamas if that was what Michelle Obama meant .
Nor did he include the larger context of Obamas statement — the context provided above .
Our guess ?
The scribe justhow his colleagues would love the chance to talk about this matter !
Omigod !
For the past fifteen years , major journalists  have lived this dream , tossing aside all manner of substance to focus attention on Bill Clintons  blow jobs .
( Theyhealth care .
They dont care if you do . )
Reading deep meaning into one line , Zeleny gave them their latest chance .
( For the record : Several other major newspapers , and the AP , covered the Obamas Cass County event .
Only Zeleny mentioned that line — the deathless line he cleverly pulled from the middle of Michelle Obamas statement . )
On Monday , a columnist at the Chicago Sun -Times also focused on that troubling line .
In this case , Jennifer Hunter came close to saying what she actually meant :
The line could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons ,  the deep - thinking columnist mused .
Here again , theres no sign that Hunter asked the Obamas if thatwhat Michelle Obama had meant .
But her column gave Matt Drudge an excuse to pimp the exciting new scandal on his low - IQ , thumb - sucking site .
Presto !
Last night , two separate panels of pundits were asked to discuss the new scandal onBefore we look at what happened on , lets make a few basic observations .
First , an obvious question : Michelle Obama taking a swipe at the Clintons  when she made that remark ?
Like Zeleny and Hunter , we have no way of knowing — although its far from clear that she was .
Both Barack Obama and his campaign have now aggressively said that thisher intention .
And in fact , Michelle Obama has discussed family values issues many times — seeming to use the theme to take a swipe at the Bush Administrations skewed priorities ( examples below ) .
But yes , her cherry - picked remark could be interpreted  as a swipe at the Clintons — and for addled children like those in our press corps , this would be the obvious reading ; theyve spent their lives chasing Bill Clintons penis around , and nothing else really matters to them , or gets their dead blood flowing .
When the chance for such discussion presents , these hapless , broken - souled losers will seize it .
To borrow from a stale old jibe :
Our journalists  think withpenis !
They re empty , overpaid , broken - souled losers — and our nation will be at their mercy forever , unless we progressives can find a way to make their conduct stop .
This brings us up to last nights Hardball — to the disgraceful conduct of the program itself , and to the problematic behavior of several liberal guests .
What was wrong withconduct ?
Lets start with the tape Mike Barnicle played for Amy Goodman and Robert Tyrell , the first panel with which he discussed this matter .
Heres how Barnicle introduced this segment — the first of two separate segments he spent on this brain - dead topic .
At this point , Barnicle introduced Tyrell and Goodman .
 Bob , was she taking a shot at Hillary and the Clintons ?  he now asked the well - known crackpot .
What was disgraceful aboutconduct ?
Note the way this tape was edited .
On Tuesday night , this same topic had been explored oncompanion program .
Butaired the fuller tape , letting people see what Michelle Obama saidthat highlighted sentence .
Just for the record , heres the text of the fuller tape whichplayed Tuesday night :
Do you mind if we make the obvious point ?
MSNBC possesses the longer tape — the tape which shows the fuller context of what Michelle Obama said .
It shows her talking about adjusting her schedule around her girls — and no one has ever said that the Clintons didnt do this when they were raising their daughter .
On Tuesday , played the longer tape — and Chuck Todd immediately cited Barack Obamas insistence that this statementa swipe at the Clintons .
But on , they wanted to chase Clintons penis around , so they edited 
Michelle Obamas fuller comments — and Barnicle forget to mention what the Obama campaign has said .
wanted a good penis - chase — the work it has specialized in for a decade — and the repulsive program was gimmicked again to make the chasin good .
This conduct bywas disgraceful — although , of course , it was perfectly typical .
But we were also deeply frustrated by the performance of two liberal guests .
These people do a great deal of superlative work .
We thought they fell short last night .
Start with Goodman , the super - bright host of the progressive program , .
She clearly knew the fuller context of what Michelle Obama had said ; immediately , she began to read from the longer transcript about taking care of the girls .
But at no point in this endless segment did she ask the obvious question :
Did it notto this super - bright guest thatwas playing a slick , contrived game ?
Thatwas putting its thumb on the scale , playing its viewers for fools once again ?
Obviously , we dont know the answer to that .
But Goodman has become a semi- regular guest on — and you dont remain a semi- regular guest if you challenge this programs conduct .
And here we see the contradiction which has dogged liberal politics for the past dozen years — the contradiction which is likely to doom Democratic hopes for the White House .
Over the course of the past fifteen years , it has become increasingly clear that big mainstream news orgs are essentially tools of Republican interests when it comes to electing our president .
The Washington Post and the New York Times ?
NBC
News and its cable step - child ?
All these orgs were deeply involved in the lengthy Wars Against Clinton and Gore — but for the most part , career liberals sat around and stared , refusing to say one word about it .
When these orgs staged their two - year War Against Gore , career liberals took a near - total pass — and Bush ended up in the White House .
Weve told you this story for many years — but on the whole , you just cant make the nations career liberals deal with this critical contradiction .
For career liberals , career success runs through these big news orgs — orgs which might hire them as writers , orgs which give publicity to their publications .
To all appearances , many career liberals have no intention of blowing their own financial interests in the interest of liberal politics .
No , we wont name individuals here — we cant mind - read individuals  motives — but this group story has been blindingly evident over the course of the past dozen years .
Even now , our timid , mewling career liberal players sit around trembling at career liberal redoubts , unwilling to let average people know the shape of our modern press / politics .
This silence hasDem interests in the past ( see Gore ) .
It could doom us again in 08 .
Last night , was up to its standard old tricks — and two liberal guests didnt manage to say so .
Let s move past Goodman , who failed to ask for the fuller tape .
Duringsecond segment about Obama , it would have been easy for smart - and - feisty Joan Walsh ( ) to chide Barnicle thusly :
It would have been easy for Joan to say that .
At some point , average people inaudience deserve the chance to hear such comments .
If were progressives — and not just self - dealers — then average peopleto be told about how they get played by the swells .
In the series we continue below , were starting to describe the sorry shape of next years presidential presspolitics .
If history is any sort of a guide , this is what is going to happen : Mainstream new orgs will keep finding character problems  in the Democratic nominee ; in Rudy Giuliani , those same mainstream orgs will find no moral flaw .
Only one questions remains to be answered :
Will career liberals be willing to notice this time ?
Will they holler , long and loud ?
This time , will webe honest ?
Will wename the orgs that are trying to elect a Republican ?
For the record , weve sent e-mails to Amy and Joan ; wed like to ask them about their strategies in theirsessions last night .
Each does tons of excellent work .
But liberals have lost the White House before because of the onslaught of character sliming , and were going lose to Rudy next year if last night is a guide .
Michelle Obama has routinely discussed these issues in the past .
In July , this was part of a profile by the APs Jessica Gresko : Didsound like a swipe at the Clintons ?
No , and it also didnt sound like something that people like Hunter waste time discussing .
( In this same interview , Obama described her husband as a  Harry Potter parent . )
Meanwhile , here she is , explicitly discussing family values in a New York speech a few days before that :
We have spent the last decade talking a very good game about family values ?
Did that sound like a swipe at the Clintons ?
Why , But when Jack Welch went out and purchased his gang of  Lost Boys ,  he bought himself a group of lost lads who dont react to matters like that .
They want to chase Clintons penis around — and invent tall tales about Gores lies .
Next year ( see Part 2 , below ) , they will find no fault in Rudy — and theyll find big character problems with the Dem nominee .
And with the unfortunate spouse .
That s what happened on last nights .
If we liberals still refuse to respond — if were still prepared to pretend we dont see — then you can make way for President Rudy .
If wepretend we dont see whats occurring , the next crazy war youll be crying about will be the one Saint Rudy starts .
Humans cant understand spacetime .
And liberals just cant grasp presspolitics .
In modern press corps culture , character problems are only for Dems .
Read each thrilling installment :
In Part 2 , we get our first look at our brilliant  Ground Zero Hero .
To his credit , Tucker Carlson raised the point , late in Tuesday evenings .
The issue had been around for weeks ; it had then been fleshed out , in substantial detail , on the front page of Fridays New York Times .
But you know the culture of todays store - bought press corps !
In their store - bought , scripted world , character problems are only for Dems !
So the pundit world had been looking away — but to his credit , here was Carlsons introduction : Long story short : Giuliani has paraded about in the past several years , vastly embellishing his personal history concerning 9/11 and the work at Ground Zero .
Yes , Russ Buettners report in Fridays Times was a masterwork of journalistic restraint .
But as Buettner began , he began to lay out Giulianis groaning veracity problems .
These problems would drive the press corps wild — if only a Dem would display them :
On at least three occasions ,  Giuliani has told the world about his own brilliant Ground Zero heroism .
He had been in the ruins at Ground Zero as often if not more than the actual clean - up workers , he has said .

What Barrett said .
Brooks and Zuckerman on the Ground Zero Hero .
And : Romneys reinventions .
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has delivered a letter to his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem in an effort to make clear Israeli position on the alleged Armenia n genocide and put bilateral relations back on track .
Levy reiterated in the letter that the Israeli government is clinging to its policy that the alleged Armenia n Genocide should be discussed by historians , not by politicians or diplomats , Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday .
The ties between the two countries became strained after two Israeli ministers said Turkey should admit the fact that Armenia ns were massacred ethnically by Turks during the first World War .
Armenia is pushing for a bill condemning Turkey and trying to win sympathy from the world .
Turkey was outraged by the remarks of the two Israeli ministers because it has claimed that the killings were the unfortunate outgrowth of deportations intended to prevent Armenia ns from assisting the invading Russia n armies at that time .
Turkey and Israel , which have had close ties since early 1990s , distanced each other after Ankara reacted by not allowing its high ranking officials to attend the Israeli national day reception held at the Israeli embassy to Turkey Levy stressed that the two ministers ' statements on the issue in no way reflected the Israeli government 's position , expressing his wish to maintain the already excellent relations with Turkey on every level .
While Israeli sources argued that the issue is now over once and for all , Turkish diplomatic sources stated that the crisis is over for the time being .
Turkish officials said that Ankara views the Armenia n genocide allegations seriously , adding that they expected not to hear further statements from Israeli ministers over the issue , which could damage close bilateral relations .
The two countries have enjoyed very good relations in recent years following the signing of agreements to boost cooperations in political , economic , cultural and even military fields .
Justice Clarence Thomas ’s new autobiography dredges up his 16 - year - old battle with Anita Hill and fulminates against liberal groups , Democratic senators and others who opposed his nomination .
The clash with Ms. Hill has grabbed most of the headlines .
But his fulminations deserve more attention .
The rage he harbors raises questions about whether he can sit as an impartial judge in many of the cases the Supreme Court hears .
When Supreme Court justices write books , which is not often , they tend to write about subjects and in ways that are consistent with the dignity of the court .
When he was chief justice , William Rehnquist wrote about the 1876 presidential election ; Justice Stephen Breyer ’s “ Active Liberty ” set forth a specific view of the Constitution .
The problem with Justice Thomas ’s book , “ My Grandfather ’s Son , ” is that it nurses bitter grudges and throws brickbats at organizations and people who opposed his nomination and might well appear before the court .
Some of his targets , like Senator Joseph Biden and Yale Law School , he mentions by name .
Others , like the American Civil Liberties Union , are not attacked as directly , but it is not hard to connect the dots .
The level of hostility is striking .
He grew up fearing the Ku Klux Klan , he says , but “ my worst fears had come to pass not in Georgia , but in Washington , D.C. , where I was being pursued not by bigots in white robes but by left - wing zealots draped in flowing sanctimony . ”
Sometimes , these guys make it too easy .
White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , yesterday , in his final appearance :
“ No , benchmarks were something that Congress wanted to use as a metric .
And we ’re going to produce a report .
But the fact is that the situation is bigger and more complex , and you need to look at the whole picture . ”
Reality , as reported last week :
It was the White House and the Iraqi government , not Congress , that first proposed the benchmarks for Iraq that are now producing failing grades , a provenance that raises questions about why the administration is declaring now that the government ’s performance is not the best measure of change .
The administration presented a to - do list and said , “ Judge us in September on these points . ”
They ’ve successfully completed three of the 18 tasks .
In response , the new line is , “ To - do lists are stupid . ”
What is most amazing is how long it has been known that body fat does n’t cause heart disease or premature death , yet how vehemently people hold onto this belief .
“ The notion that body fat is a toxic substance is now firmly a part of folk wisdom : many people perversely consider eating to be a suicidal act , ” wrote Dr. William Bennett , M.D. , former editor of The Harvard Medical School Health Letter and author of The Dieter ’s Dilemma .
“ Indeed , the modern belief that body fat is a mortal threat to its owner is mainly due to the fact that , for many decades , the insurance companies had the sole evidence , and if it was wrong they would presumably have had to close their doors . ”
That can still be said today , although the obesity interests have since grown considerably larger .
But the evidence that fatness is not especially harmful has been shown from research that dates back to the 1950s — more than a half a century ago .
While many remain incredulous , the soundest body of evidence has shown , and continues to show , that being fat is not a risk factor for heart disease or a cause of premature death , even controlling for the effects of smoking or cancer .
Ancel Keys and colleagues , for example , examined 16 prospective population studies in seven countries , as well as actual angiographic and autopsy examinations of 23,000 sets of coronary arteries which found no relationship between body fatness and the degree or progression of atherosclerotic build - up .
And the most careful studies ever since have continued to support these findings .
“ Before we delve too far into the possible connections between overweight and heart disease , we should look at the evidence to see whether they are as closely linked as they are conventionally assumed to be , ” cautioned Dr. Bennett .
“ Again , we can use major statistical trends to reassure ourselves that fatness cannot be a very important cause of cardiovascular death .... ”
He wrote that back in 1982 , pointing out how the age - adjusted rate of deaths from heart attacks and strokes since the early 1950s had dropped while weights had increased .
Biological truths cannot be reversed .
These very same findings continue today .
As was reported just last month , the health of Americans continues to improve , and heart disease and cancer rates are dropping as weights increase ; and the CDC now estimates that today ’s children will live longer than ever in our country ’s history .
“ Detailed epidemiological studies , too , show no impressive connection between obesity and cardiovascular disease , ” Dr. Bennett wrote .
By that he meant credible , carefully done studies .
Junkfood Science readers regularly see how such studies can be manipulated to give the false impression of correlations seeming to show causation by , for example , ignoring confounding factors ( like stress , social - economic factors , dieting , and prescription drugs ) or using false surrogate endpoints rather than actual clinical disease or deaths .
Also , he emphasized , “ it can not be said that fatness in itself causes hypertension ...[ and ] being fat does not , in itself cause diabetes . ”
Again , those findings continue to hold true today .
Which brings us to a study in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine , led by cardiologist Dr. Seth Uretsky , M.D. , at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt Hospital in New York .
By now , we should not be surprised that the media is not reporting on this study , like all the others that go against popular groupthink .
These researchers set out to see if the “ obesity paradox ” of lower morbidity and mortality with increasing body mass index exists with heart disease patients .
The patients were from the INVEST trial , a prospective , randomized international study of 22,576 patients age 50 and older who had hypertension and coronary artery disease .
Their heart disease was confirmed and defined as having had a documented heart attack , coronary angiogram with more than 50 % stenosis in at least 1 major coronary artery , angina pectoris , or evidence of ischemia on at least 2 different modalities of stress tests ( electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , radionuclide scan ) that were consistent .
The patients received extensive cardiovascular workups in the clinical setting including BMI calculations , and were followed for an average of 2.7 years .
The primary outcomes for this study were all - cause mortality , heart attacks and strokes .
Their findings ?
Compared to ‘ normal ’ weight patients , the thin patients had 74 % higher risk of both death and having a heart attack or stroke , whereas the ‘ overweight ’ patients had 29 % lower risk .
But the obese had the lowest risks of all , nearly half that of ‘ normal ’ weight patients .
Only at the very highest BMIs did the risks begin to creep up but they were still less than the overweight and most notably less than the ‘ normal ’ weight patients .
The reverse “ J ” curve of their graph was amazing similar to that shown earlier this year in a Stanford University - led study of women .
The most significant endpoint , all cause mortality , is where the lower risks with fatness were especially striking .
These survival benefits were seen among the fattest , even though they had the highest rates of diabetes , high cholesterol and high blood pressures ( even after treatment with medications ) .
They were also younger and less likely to have ever smoked .
So , the researchers adjusted for all of the comorbidities and health risk factors and still found that being overweight and obese was associated with lower risks , 1/3 to 1/4 that of patients of ‘ normal ’ weight .
Far more relevant was being thin ( 52 % higher risk ) ; advancing age ( a 63 % higher risk ) ; smoking ( 40 % higher risk ) ; and comorbidities ( diseases themselves , such as kidney disease and congestive heart failure ) .
They concluded : “ Our study is in agreement with previous studies that observed an obesity paradox in patients with previous cardiovascular disease ....
Our results suggest a protective effect of obesity in [ these ] patients . ”
They noted their results did n’t concur with a few earlier observational studies of the general population , although they failed to reveal the known flaws in those studies or that they have since been discredited or retracted .
Even so , they said :
In contrast with these epidemiologic studies , our analysis ... among patients with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease , overweight and class I to III obesity were associated with a decreased risk of morbidity and mortality compared with normal - weight patients , despite less blood pressure control .
This finding is consistent with the notion of an “ obesity paradox ” that has been described in patients with documented cardiac disease ( eg , heart failure ) , patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention , and patients with coronary artery disease referred for single photon emission computed tomography .
They proceeded to review the research , such as the Digitalis Investigation Group Trial which found reductions of 12 % and 19 % for all - cause deaths among the overweight and obese patients compared to normal weight patients .
And the 2002 meta- analysis of research on 7,290 patients who ’d had percutaneous coronary interventions , showing a 36 % and 27 % lower risks for death among the overweight and obese patients .
Still , in explaining their results and the paradox , they appeared to grapple with bringing themselves to suggest that BMI itself is n’t a risk factor .
This was even while they proposed multiple physiological reasons for the higher risks among ‘ normal ’ weight people , such as : higher - risk coronary anatomy ; increased levels of tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory cytokines ( adipose tissue has been shown to produce receptors that neutralize the deleterious effects of the tumor necrosis factor on the heart ) ; the hemodynamics of hypertension ( hypertension in obese is characterized by a high cardiac output , an expanded blood volume , and a lower systemic vascular resistance compared to normal weight patients ) ; and that when medical problems themselves are equally well managed , any deleterious effects seen with obesity are negated .
This study actually showed just that .
Fat and thin people get sick and get heart disease and other things , but when they receive equally good care for actual health problems , being fat has distinct benefits .
The belief that fat kills is simply that ... a belief , not good science .

Building with HEMP *
Using Hemp - based Insulation and Construction Materials
by Vicki Oldham
- reprinted from Mendocino Environment Centre Newsletter ( U.S. ) , Feb 95 )
In my search for info on hemp , I 've spoken to many interesting people .
The most helpful was Chris Conrad , author of Hemp - Lifeline to the Future .
The more I learn about hemp , the more hopeful I become of the potential of this wondrous plant .
Cannabis Sativa , regarded as a divine plant by the Celts , is a gift ­ the answer to many of our environmental and economic problems .
The newest and best product to be created from Cannabis Sativa Hemp , Isochanvre ( TM ) , comes from France .
Hemp , or ' Chanvre ' , is cultivated by French farmers under government contracts , as is tobacco .
French hemp manufacturers also make ropes , bags , textiles , paints , heating and lubricating oils , pharmaceutical products , animal food and abrasives from the sap , which is rich in silica .
Isochanvre is produced by Chenevotte Habitat , in René , France .
It is sold as two different products : Isochanvre Insulation and Isochanvre Construction .
Isochanvre Construction is a product that thrills me .
It is made from Chenevotte ( hurds ) cellulose obtained by removing the fibres mechanically without the use of water .
The material , formerly considered a waste product , is now used in Isochanvre Construction .
The best way to describe this product is to call it a non -toxic replacement for cement , lumber , sheetrock , plaster , insulation and acoustic tiles .
Isochanvre uses natural lime and water for binding agents .
It can be used as cement and poured directly onto soil .
Unlike cement , it is very flexible and does n't crack .
The metal wire netting that is used to give cement suppleness is too rigid for Isochanvre and would cause it to crack .
Cement is toxic , hard and breakable .
Isochanvre worked with lime is supple , water - resistant , and seven times lighter than concrete .
It can be poured directly onto an existing floor to raise the level , repair and insulate .
Moulded walls can be poured in framing .
For a rough finish , wood forms can be used .
For a finer surface , smooth or plastic casings should be used .
After the forms are removed , the surface can be smoothed with a roller and a lime wash .
The colour of Isochanvre is a creamy ochre ( the colour of hemp ) .
After it 's completely dry , it can be painted , textured or wallpapered - but this will interfere with its acoustic qualities .
It can be trowelled on in thicknesses less than 10 cm .
It seems to me that it would be an excellent product to finish straw - bale construction .
Because of its strength and flexibility , Isochanvre is an ideal construction material for areas susceptible to earthquakes , tornadoes and hurricanes .
Isochanvre petrifies itself , the hemp fibres , bound with lime , become mineral over time , making your building stronger and more valuable with age .
The product is non-flammable , fungicidal , antibacterial , waterproof and inedible by rodents and termites .
Due to the high silica content of hemp and the ability of Isochanvre to retain the plant 's qualities , it has the ability to store warmth and give it back after a while , making for very energy - efficient buildings .
So , here it is , a totally sustainable , non-toxic buidling alternative to wood and concrete .
Unfortunately , in typical fashion , Hemp is dismissed as ' a hippie thing ' .
While our countries snooze , other nations are busily constructing hemp economies and enjoying high profits and improved environments .
WAKE UP !
Please educate yourselves , your friends , and government officials .
Remember , in order to enjoy the environmental and economic benefits of hemp , we need a legal distinction between hemp fibre and marijuana .
Any cannabis sativa with less than 0.3 % THC should be classified as hemp fibre and immediately legalized .
Let 's rid this country of its ' reefer madness ' mentality .
HEMP FOR VICTORY !
" The best way to describe this product is to call it a non -toxic replacement for cement , lumber , sheetrock , plaster , insulation and acoustic tiles . "
" Because of its strength and flexibility , Isochanvre is an ideal construction material for areas susceptible to earthquakes , tornadoes and hurricanes . "

The official transcript from MSNBC of Tuesday 's debate among the Republican presidential candidates does , indeed , make it official :
The men vying to keep the White House in GOP hands appear loath to utter the current occupant 's name .
The panel of questioners made direct mention of President Bush ( or the " Bush administration " ) seven times .
The forum focused on the economy , which Bush aggressively influenced through a series of tax cuts .
And the debate included an extended discussion of the war in Iraq , the defining issue of his presidency .
Yet in their responses , Bush 's name did not escape the lips of any of the candidates with even a ghost of a chance of capturing the Republican nomination .
And this omission occurred over two hours -- longer than the usual 90 - minute face - offs .
In a particularly telling sign of the degree to which the president was treated as a nonentity , the first time a candidate invoked his surname , it referred to his father !
Sam Brownback , in talking about trade policy , noted that he had worked on that subject during the 1989 - 93 presidency of George H.W. Bush .
Brownback went on to use the term " Bush administration " -- meaning the one in office -- twice when answering questions about Iraq .
He praised it on military matters ; criticized it over efforts to create a cohesive Iraqi government .
Tom Tancredo made a negative reference to " the Bush administration " while conversing about trade .
And Ron Paul broached the president 's name sarcastically , saying , " Why do n’t we run on George Bush ’s foreign policy , of a humble foreign policy and no nation - building . "
Those were phrases the then - Texas governor frequently used to describe his views during the 2000 presidential campaign .
Paul 's comment was the last time the word " Bush " was heard on the stage in Michigan .
It causes one to wonder what sort of speaking slot the nominee - to - be will set aside for the actual president at next summer 's Republican National Convention .

These pedestrians have got happy feet after zoo keepers installed the world 's first zebra crossing for penguins .
Staff at Living Coasts in Torquay , Devon , asked the local council to paint the black and white markings to improve safety .
The attraction 's colony of 80 African penguins regularly use a public thoroughfare during feeding time .
Scroll down for more ...
Every day the birds cross a wide footpath as they make their way from Penguin Beach to meet a keeper .
Staff noticed the excited animals were bumping into visitors and so installed the zebra crossing to keep therm in order .
They have now learned to use the crossing and are a regular sight waddling across the road in line .
The crossing even has miniature red triangular warning signs - complete with penguins .
Scroll down for more ...
Senior Head Keeper Tony Durkin said : " We believe this is the world 's first zebra crossing for penguins .
" Our penguins are only 2ft tall and when they see the bucket and their keeper they do tend to get excited .
" It 's hard to teach a penguin road safety , but the zebra crossing does alert visitors to the fact that the birds cross there .
" They live on Penguin Beach but are fed in the public area which means a fair bit of to -ing and fro-ing .
" The crossing has been put down to show visitors where the penguins cross the public walkway and to emphasise the need to take care .
" It was a road safety issue so we asked the council to help by bringing in the road painter .
" The crossing is working well despite the fact that it involves black and white birds using a black and white crossing . "

Cllr Chris Lewis , of Torbay Council , said the council had used a road marker to install the crossing .
He said : " We are delighted to be working in partnership with Living Coasts particularly highlighting the importance of safer crossing points . "
Several Michigan lawmakers , frustrated with the defeat in Congress of an immigration law overhaul , are proposing state laws to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants .
The lawmakers , all Democrats from the state House , offered a package of bills late last week intended to crack down on employers , making it a felony to hire an illegal immigrant knowingly .
Violation could mean fines of up to $ 250,000 and as much as five years in prison for repeat offenders .
The sponsors said the legislation would be formally introduced this month in the House .
“ We have no legal weapons right now in the state of Michigan , ” said State Representative Kate Ebli , one of the sponsors .
“ What we ’re doing is giving our state the tools that we need . ”
Adrian Vazquez , who works for the Michigan Organizing Project , an immigrant rights group , said such a plan would destroy the lives of people who had raised their families in Michigan and contributed to the economy .
Illegal immigrants , Mr. Vazquez said , should not have to pay for a broken immigration system ; the federal government should fix it .
And yes , Obama did a great thing with respect to Hans and that gets BIG points from me .
I still am a fan of Edwards , even though I am not overly excited by what he is doing – or at least what I hear when I glance a the rec list .
But he was where I was leaning , more so by default .
And Clinton , well , I can say that I ’ll be voting for her .
All that being said , I think that it is time to get serious about supporting someone whose actions back up his words and whose credentials are also rather impressive .
But , how can you NOT support Dodd if you go down a list of issues that matter to you and see his positions and actions and that he is saying and doing things because they are RIGHT , not because they are SAFE .
Today ’s action on the FISA bill was a no - brainer .
Many Congressional
Democrats who were until just recently in the minority had complained that they could n’t do anything and had no power because of the Senate rules and being in the minority .
Now that they are in the majority , they should be able to do some things that America wants them to do .
Anyone can put a hold on a bill or an action .
This week , we saw two such instances .
And , as I said above , that scored big points with me .
But with a track record of introducing bills on withdrawal from Iraq on his own as well as with others like Feingold and Reid , we know his position on Iraq .
And more importantly , we can be proud of his position AND actions he is and has been taking on this very important matter ..
What is just as important is that whole " unitary executive " issue this country is going to have to unravel , Dodd has introduced legislation called the Restoring the Constitution Act ( an idea that I am proud to share with Senator Dodd ) .
With Dodd , you are already seeing him lead and command respect .
He is taking actions , sponsoring legislation , doing what is right for America - RIGHT NOW .
He is n’t waiting until he would be inaugurated .
He may be talking about how he would lead if elected President , but he is also showing how he is leading in whatever capacity he currently can .
He has made me really want to vote for him .
He is someone that I would be proud to actively support .
He is someone that I can feel good about telling others about taking a harder look at as a candidate .
Why so many people are overlooking him is beyond me .
He deserves a good hard look .
He is acting like a leader .
And he can use your support .

Your brain on gambling Science shows how slot machines take over your mind When Ann Klinestiver , a high school English teacher in Milton , W.Va. , was first diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease , she was desperate for anything that might calm the tremors caused by the disease .
She found relief in a new drug called Requip .
" At first , the drug was like a miracle , " Klinestiver says .
" All my movement problems just disappeared . "
Over time , however , Klinestiver needed higher and higher doses of the drug in order to ease her symptoms .
That 's when she became a gambling addict .
Although she 'd never been interested in gambling before , Klinestiver was suddenly obsessed with slot machines .
Every day , she would drive to the local dog racing track and play slots until 3:30 in the morning .
After a year of addictive gambling , Klinestiver lost more than $ 200,000 .
Klinestiver 's medication worked by imitating the effects of dopamine , a neurotransmitter in the brain .
Parkinson's is caused by the death of dopamine neurons in brain areas that control bodily movement .
But dopamine also plays a central role in the pleasure centers of the brain , influencing how we see the world and respond to it .
Recent medical studies have found that anywhere from 3 to 13 percent of patients on the kind of medication Klinestiver was taking develop severe gambling addictions or related compulsions .
In early 2006 , Klinestiver was taken off Requip .
Her tremors worsened , but her gambling addiction vanished .
" I have n't gambled in 18 months , " she says .
" I still think about the slots , but the obsession is n't there . "
Stories like Klinestiver's , and research into dopamine 's role in the brain , are helping neuroscientists understand the temptation of gambling and the scourge of gambling addiction .
This research may also change the way we see casinos , and help shift the debate over whether the government should further regulate slots , roulette wheels , and other games of chance .
From the perspective of the brain , gambling has much in common with addictive drugs , like cocaine .
Both work by hijacking the brain 's pleasure centers -- a lure that some people are literally incapable of resisting .
" Gambling games grew up around the frailty of our nervous system , " says Read Montague , a professor of neuroscience at Baylor University .
" They evolved to exploit specific hiccups in our brain . "
In recent years , gambling has spread across America , with gambling generating revenues of $ 2.9 billion in New England in 2006 .
The question of gambling is of particular relevance for Massachusetts .
Last month , the town of Middleborough voted in support of a massive new gambling complex , to be built on lands owned by the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe .
Governor Deval Patrick is currently considering proposals to expand gambling across the state , and several developers are looking at sites in Boston .
The growth of the gambling industry has been accompanied by a large amount of new scientific research explaining the effects of gambling on the brain .
The neural circuits manipulated by gambling originally evolved to help animals assess rewards , such as food , that are crucial for survival .
Dopamine is the neurotransmitter involved with the processing of these rewards .
Whenever we experience something pleasurable , such as winning a hand of blackjack or eating a piece of chocolate cake , our dopamine neurons get excited .
These neurons help the brain learn about the pleasure , and attempt to predict when it will happen again .
Wolfram Schultz , a neuroscientist at Cambridge University , has exposed how this system operates on a molecular level .
He has spent the last two decades measuring the activity of dopamine neurons in the brains of monkeys as they receive rewards of fruit juice .
His experiments observe a simple protocol : Schultz flashes a light , waits a few seconds , and then squirts a few drops of apple juice into the monkey 's mouth .
While the monkeys are waiting for the sweet liquid , Schultz painstakingly monitors the response of individual cells .
At first , the neurons do n't get excited until the juice is delivered .
The cells are reacting to the actual reward .
However , once the animal learns that the light always precedes the arrival of juice , the same neurons begin firing at the sight of the light instead of the reward .
Schultz calls these cells " prediction neurons , " since they are more interested in predicting rewards than in the rewards themselves .
These predictions are a crucial source of learning , since the monkey constantly compares its expectations of juice with what actually happens .
For example , if the light is flashed but the juice never arrives , then the monkey 's dopamine neurons stop firing .
This is known as the " error signal . "
The monkey is disappointed , and begins to change its future predictions .
However , if the monkey receives an unexpected reward -- the juice arrives without warning -- then the dopamine neurons get extremely excited .
A surprising treat registers much larger than an expected one .
" A reward that 's unpredictable typically counts three or four times as much , " Schultz says .
Games of chance prey on this neural system .
Consider , for example , the slot machine .
You put in a coin and pull the lever .
The reels start to whirr .
Eventually , the machine settles on its verdict .
Chances are you lost money .
But think about the slot machine from the perspective of your dopamine neurons .
Whenever you win some money , the reward activates those brain cells intent on anticipating future rewards .
These neurons want to predict the patterns inside the machine , to decode the logic of luck .
Yet here 's the catch : slot machines can't be solved .
They use random number generators to determine their payout .
There are no patterns to decipher .
There is only a little microchip , churning out arbitrary digits .
At this point , our dopamine neurons should just turn themselves off : the slot machine is a waste of mental energy .
But this is n't what happens .
Instead of getting bored by the haphazard payouts , our dopamine neurons become obsessed .
The random rewards of gambling are much more seductive than a more predictable reward cycle .
When we pull the lever and win some money , we experience a potent rush of pleasurable dopamine precisely because the reward was so unexpected .
The clanging coins and flashing lights are like a surprising squirt of juice .
The end result is that we are transfixed by the slot machine , riveted by the fickle nature of its payouts .
" The trick of a one - armed bandit , " Montague says , " is that it provides us with the illusion of a pattern .
We get enough rewards so that we keep on playing .
Our cells think they 'll figure out the pattern soon .
But of course they wo n't . "
The irony of gambling is that it 's entertaining because it's so frustrating , at least for our dopamine neurons .
One of the big remaining questions for scientists is why only some gamblers get addicted .
While most people can walk away from the slot machines , some gamblers , like Klinestiver , ca n't resist the temptation .
For these compulsive gamblers , the misplaced predictions of their dopamine neurons become self - destructive .
These people are so blinded by the pleasures of occasionally winning that they slowly lose everything .

I ’m not really going to talk about the problem with Lisp , but only a problem .
And I ’m not really going to talk about Lisp , but Common Lisp .
So this post should be called “ A problem with Common Lisp ” , but the current title is more catchy , is n’t it ?
You are still with me ?
nice .
Because I believe I have something important to say .
A problem with Common Lisp is that you ca n’t make programs with it .
That may have been another nice catchy title : “ You ca n’t make programs with Lisp ” .
You can make libraries just fine , and package them , and distribute them , and re-use them , but not programs .
To give meaning to these statements I ’ll have to define what a program is .
A program is something that you can run from a shell ( like bash , csh , tcsh , etc ) by typing its name and pressing enter .
Or , if you want another definition , something that you can run from a C program using the function exec .
I ’ve asked this question several times on #lisp on Freenode and generally the answer is this : SBCL can generate an runable image .
Although it may be nice in some cases : like shipping an alpha version of a program to someone who does n’t have a clue what Lisp is , it is not a good way to ship a program expecting an OS like Debian or Ubuntu to include them : “ 25 MB for a hello - world ? you are crazy ” .
The size is not the only problem , upgrading the libraries get harder , because you have to upgrade the libraries in the image and not only the modules in the file system that the OS can easily upgrade with tools like aptitude or rpm .
They are just monolithic .
I can imagine ls and cp being written in Lisp , so I ca n’t imagine them being huge monolithic images .
Any other language that I know does n’t have this problem , be it Python , C , C++ , Java , Objective -C , C# , Haskell , Chicken Scheme , Erlang ( this one has its problems but I ’ve already solved some of them ) , Perl , PHP , any other ?
Other Lispers claim that you can just ship a library and the user would just run a function on it ; like ( run-checkers ) to play checkers .
This has various drawbacks .
First , not every user is a Lisper .
Most computer users do n’t even know what Lisp , so they would n’t know how to run a lisp .
They also would n’t be able to have an icon in their desktops to run the program , they ’d have to open a terminal .
For people that can do all that , finding the right function to run in one of those so - called programs can be a challenge .
My wife would n’t have even tried to run any of those programs .
Yes , I want to write software for my wife , in Lisp .
And last , even when they can do all that , they may still search for an alternative that just puts an icon somewhere and they click it .
Yes , long rant .
I hope I could convince you of the need to produce programs .
It has been said many times that Lisp needs a killer application , like ejabberd for Erlang or darcs for Haskell .
Both awesome applications that get people to approach the language ( indeed , what made me learn Erlang was ejabberd ) .
Without being able to make programs , you ca n’t make killer programs .
After pushing this issue a bit on comp.lang.

I ’ve got pointed to cl - launch by Alex Mizrahi ( I actually had to say that I was going to do something about it for someone to say “ do n’t re-invent the wheel ” ) .
I knew there had to be something out there !
I could n’t believe I was the first experiencing this .
There ’s hope !.
Unfortunately , not a single cl - launch powered Lisp program seems to be out there .
Maybe because there ’s no build - tool integration for it anywhere .
Let ’s see if I can do something about it .
Update ( 2007-09-05 ) :
Two possible solutions I posted : Solving Lisp ’s problem : a simplistic solution with make , Another simplistic solution , with SCons .
Comments at the original blog
Turns out almost $ 130,000 based on what this high credit IQ student has managed to do !
First for some background information .
As you might know I am a huge fan of credit card arbitrage .
There are two ways to do this .
( a) Build up your credit slowly and accept an offer every now and then ( my preferred approach ) or ( b ) an App - O - Rama .
For those of you who are unfamiliar with it , an App - O - Rama , is a word coined on the Fat Wallet Finance Forums ( as far as I know ) and involves applying for many credit cards in a short period of time , mostly within a day or two .
Since the credit enquiries will take at least a day to percolate back into your credit history , this gives you the best chance to get approved for multiple credit cards before your credit score takes a hit .
This is the approach taken by Paul , the student mentioned above to obtain almost $ 130,000 in credit !
Now , maybe Paul knows what he is doing .
In which case , I would like to say to him , congratulations and good luck .
He has plans of parking the cash in a high yield savings account and earning $ 600 in interest per month .
That is great !
But for every student like Paul who makes $ 600 from credit card companies , there must be a hundred or maybe thousand more that pile up $ 600 in credit card debt .
That bothers me !
Let ’s take a closer look at the credit lines Paul was approved for .
The highest credit line Paul received was $ 25 K !
There were 2 more cards with credit limits higher than $ 15 K and 6 more with credit limit in the range of $ 8 K – $ 10 K .
Agreed that not many students are going to attempt an App - O - Rama and gain access to a large amount of cash like Paul did but each of those individual credit lines , in the wrong hands is enough to ruin lives !
It might be legal for credit card companies to grant such large lines of credit to cash strapped students .
But is it moral ?
Sometime back Golbguru at Money , Matter and More Musings had written a ( sarcastic ) article saying there must be a test to qualify people for credit .
I had a good laugh at it then , but now I think I agree .
Here is an example of a student that Golbguru mentioned –
“ I had Visa , Visa MasterCard , First Financial Bank , Visa , Gap , Target ” says college senior Sara Magee .
She was lured at 18 by the promise of a free Frisbee .
A dozen credit cards later , she ’s working three jobs to pay down $ 6,000 in charges , fees and interest .
“ I did n’t understand interest and what a high APR was — I really just did n’t understand the concept , and it seemed like a good idea — like ( I ) ca n’t afford it now , but I will pay it off later , ” she says .
Now imagine if Sara was approved for credit cards with limits more than $ 10 K !
So what can we do ?
Well , the qualifier test Golbguru suggested would be a good idea , even though it might be a difficult to determine who exactly offers those tests .
Here are a few other ideas –
Parents should proactively teach children the intricacies of credit cards so they are prepared for and educated about it when it comes for them to get credit cards .
Colleges and universities should take proactive steps to ban credit card companies from luring kids to apply for credit on college campuses .
People should be required to use a debit card for a certain number of years before being allowed to apply for a credit card .
People should have small * combined * credit limits for a while and prove they can make payments on time and not carry balances before being approved for larger credit lines .
These days credit card companies do check whether you should be allowed credit based on your credit history , but instead of declining you credit , many just offer you more credit with higher interest rates .
That to me feels predatory !
Offering $ 25 K individual credit lines to college seniors ( and $ 130 K in combined credit lines ) sends out wrong signals – that it does n’t matter how long it will take you to pay it back or even if it will ever be possible , but here you go , enjoy it now !
How long before some “ party animal ” college students find out about the App - O - Rama and start abusing it ?
Here is a excerpt from Paul ’s introductory post –
I wanted to be able to have an online diary where I will be updating my progress every couple of days as I try to make thousands of dollars per year just like many others have successfully done so before me .
I will share the good the bad and the ugly as I take on this new project and hopefully it will help everyone out there trying to make a few extra bucks whether it ’s to help pay for their college , car , hour , or an expensive coke habit 🙂

The young marine lighted a cigarette and let it dangle .
White smoke wafted around his helmet .
His face was smeared with war paint .
Blood trickled from his right ear and the bridge of his nose .
Momentarily deafened by cannon blasts , he did n’t know the shooting had stopped .
He stared at the sunrise .
His expression caught my eye .
To me , it said : terrified , exhausted and glad just to be alive .
I recognized that look because that ’s how I felt too .
I raised my camera and snapped a few shots .
With the click of a shutter , Marine Lance Cpl. James Blake Miller , a country boy from Kentucky , became an emblem of the war in Iraq .
The resulting image would change two lives -- his and mine .
I was embedded with Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion , 8th Marine Regiment , as it entered Fallouja , an insurgent stronghold in Iraq ’s Sunni Triangle , on Nov. 8 , 2004 .
We encountered heavy fire almost immediately .
We were pinned down all night at a traffic circle , where a 6 - inch curb offered the only protection .
I hunkered down in the gutter that endless night , praying for daylight , trying hard to make myself small .
A cold rain came down .
I cursed the Marines ’ illumination flares that wafted slowly earthward , making us wait an eternity for darkness to return .
At dawn , the gunfire and explosions subsided .
A white phosphorus artillery round burst overhead , showering blazing - hot tendrils .
We came across three insurgents lying in the street , two of them dead , their blood mixing with rainwater .
The third , a wiry Arab youth , tried to mouth a few words .
All I could think was : “ Buddy , you ’re already dead . ”
We rounded a corner and again came under heavy fire , forcing us to scramble for cover .
I ran behind a Marine as we crossed the street , the bullets ricocheting at our feet .
Gunfire poured down , and it seemed incredible that no one was hit .
A pair of tanks rumbled down the road to shield us .
The Marines kicked open the door of a house , and we all piled in .
Miller and other Marines took positions on the rooftop ; I set up my satellite phone to transmit photos .
But as I worked downstairs in the kitchen , a deep rumble almost blew the room apart .
Two cannon rounds had slammed into a nearby house .
Miller , the platoon ’s radioman , had called in the tanks , pinpointed the targets and shouted “ Fire ! ”
I ran to the roof and saw smoldering ruins across a large vacant lot .
Beneath a heap of bricks , men lay dead or dying .
I sat down and collected my wits .
Miller propped himself against a wall and lighted his cigarette .
I transmitted the picture that night .
Power in Fallouja had been cut in advance of the assault , forcing me to be judicious with my batteries .
I considered not even sending Miller ’s picture , thinking my editors would prefer images of fierce combat .
The photo of Miller was the last of 11 that I sent that day .
On the second day of the battle , I called my wife by satellite phone to tell her I was OK .
She told me my photo had ended up on the front page of more than 150 newspapers .
Dan Rather had gushed over it on the evening news .
Friends and family had called her to say they had seen the photo -- my photo .
Soon , my editors called and asked me to find the “ Marlboro Marine ” for a follow - up story .
Who was this brave young hero ?
Women wanted to marry him .
Mothers wanted to know whether he was their son .
I did n’t even know his name .
Shell - shocked and exhausted , I had simply identified Miller as “ A Marine ” and clicked “ send . ”
I found Miller four days later in an auditorium after a dangerous dash across an open parade ground in the city ’s civic center .
Miller ’s unit was taking a break , eating military rations .
Clean - shaven and without war paint , Miller , 20 , looked much younger than the battle - stressed warrior in the picture -- young enough to be my son .
He was cooperative , but he was embarrassed about the photo ’s impact back home .
Once our story identified him , the national fascination grew stronger .
People shipped care packages , making sure Miller had more than enough smokes .
President Bush sent cigars , candy and memorabilia from the White House .
Then Maj. Gen. Richard F. Natonski , head of the 1st Marine Division , made a special trip to see the Marlboro Marine .
I was in the forward command center , which by then featured a large blowup of the photo .
“ You might want to see this , ” an officer said , nudging me to follow .
To talk to Miller , Natonski had to weave between earthen berms , run through bombed - out buildings and make a mad sprint across a wide street to avoid sniper fire before diving into a shattered storefront .
“ Miller , get your ass up here , ” a first sergeant barked on the radio .
Miller had no idea what was going on as he ran through the rubble .
He snapped to attention when he saw the general .
Natonski shook Miller ’s hand .
Americans had “ connected ” with his photo , the general said , and nobody wanted to see him wounded or dead .
“ We can have you home tomorrow , ” he said .
Miller hesitated , then shook his head .
He did not want to leave his buddies behind .
“ It just was n’t right , ” he told me later .
The tall , lanky general towered over the grunt .
“ Your father raised one hell of a young man , ” he said , looking Miller in the eye .
They said goodbye , and Natonski scrambled back to the command post .
For his loyalty , Miller was rewarded with horror .
The assault on Fallouja raged on , leaving nearly 100 Americans dead and 450 wounded .
The bodies of some 1,200 insurgents littered the streets .
As the fighting dragged on for a month , the story fell off the front page .
I joined the exodus of journalists heading home or moving to the next story .
More than a year and a half would pass before I saw Miller again .
Back home , I immersed myself in other assignments , trying to put Fallouja behind me .
Yet not a day went by that I did n’t think about Miller and what we experienced in Iraq .
National Public Radio interviewed me .
Much to my embarrassment , the Los Angeles City Council adopted a resolution in my honor .
I became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize .
Bloggers riffed on the photo ’s meaning .
Requests for prints kept coming .
In January 2006 , I was on assignment along the U.S. - Mexico border when my wife called .
“ Your boy is on TV .
He has PTSD , ” she said .
“ They kicked him out of the Marines . ”
I ’d spoken with Miller by phone twice , but the conversations were short and superficial .
I knew post - traumatic stress disorder was a complicated diagnosis .
So once again , I dug up his number .
Again , I offered simple words : Life is sweet .
We survived .
Everything else is gravy .
As the third anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion approached , my editors wanted another follow - up story .
So in spring 2006 , I traveled to Miller ’s hometown of Jonancy , Ky. , in the hollows of Appalachia .
I drove east from Lexington along Interstate 64 , part of the nationwide Purple Heart Trail honoring dead and wounded veterans , before turning south .
Mobile homes and battered cars dot the rugged ranges .
Marijuana is a major cash crop .
Addiction to methamphetamine and prescription drugs is rampant .
Kids marry young , and boys go to work mining the black seams of coal .
Heavy trucks rumble day and night .
Miller showed me around .
At an abandoned mine , he walked carefully around a large , shallow pool of standing water that mirrored the green wilderness and springtime sky .
He picked up a chunk of coal .
“ Around here , this is what it ’s all about , ” he said .
“ Nothing else .
“ It was this or the Marines . ”
Often brooding and sullen , Miller joked about being “ 21 going on 70 , ” the result , he said , of humping heavy armor and gear on a 6 - foot , 160 - pound frame .
Before he was allowed to leave Iraq , he attended a mandatory “ warrior transitioning ” session about PTSD and adjusting to home life .
Each Marine received a questionnaire .
Were they having trouble sleeping ?
Did they have thoughts of suicide ?
Did they feel guilt about their actions ?
Everybody knew the drill .
Answer yes and be evaluated further .
Say no and go home .
Miller said he did n’t want to miss his flight .
He answered no to every question .
He returned to Camp Lejeune , N.C.
His high school sweetheart , Jessica Holbrooks , joined him there , and they were married in a civil ceremony .
Then came the nightmares and hallucinations .
He imagined shadowy figures outside the windows .
Faces of the dead haunted his sleep .
Once , while cleaning a shotgun , he blacked out .
He regained consciousness when Jessica screamed out his name .
Snapping back to reality , he realized he was pointing the gun at her .
He reported the problems to superiors , who promised to get him help .
Then came a single violent episode , which put an end to his days as a Marine .
It happened in the storm - tossed Gulf of Mexico in September 2005 .
His unit had been sent to New Orleans to assist with Hurricane Katrina relief efforts .
Now a second giant storm , Hurricane Rita , was moving in , and the Marines were ordered to seek safety out at sea .
In the claustrophobic innards of a rolling Navy ship , someone whistled .
The sound reminded Miller of a rocket - propelled grenade .
He attacked the sailor who had whistled .
He came to in the boat ’s brig .
He was medically discharged with a “ personality disorder ” on Nov. 10 , 2005 -- exactly one year after his picture made worldwide news .
Back home in Kentucky , the Millers settled into a sparsely furnished second - story apartment .
Four small windows afforded little light .
The TV was always on .
Miller bought a motorcycle and went for long rides .
He and Jessica drank all night and slept all day .
He started collecting a monthly disability benefit of about $ 2,500 .
The couple spent hours watching movies on DVD , Coronas and bourbon cocktails in hand .
Friends and family gave them space .
Miller had hoped to pursue a career in law enforcement .
But the PTSD and abrupt discharge killed that dream .
No one would trust him with a weapon .
But at least he did n’t have to go back to Iraq .
He started to realize he was n’t the only one traumatized by war .
“ There ’s a word for it around here , ” Jessica said .
“ It ’s called ‘ vets . ’ ” She talked of Miller ’s grandfather , forever changed by the Korean War and dead by age 35 .
Her Uncle Hargis , a Vietnam veteran , had it too .
He experienced mood swings for years .
Sometimes , Miller ’s stories about Iraq unnerved his young bride .
He sensed it and talked less .
Nobody really understands , he said , unless they ’ve been there .
On June 3 , 2006 , the Millers renewed their vows at a hilltop clubhouse overlooking the forests and strip mines .
It was a lavish ceremony paid for by donors from across the country who had read about Miller ’s travails or seen him on television .
Local businesses pitched in as well .
His father and two younger brothers were supposed to be groomsmen but did n’t show up .
His estranged mother was n’t invited .
Miller looked sharp in his Marine Corps dress uniform of dark - blue cloth and red piping .
Jessica was lovely in white , her long hair gathered high .
Instead of a honeymoon , the young couple traveled to Washington , D.C. , at the invitation of the National Mental Health Assn .
The group wanted to honor Miller for his courage in going public about his PTSD .
Its leaders also wanted him to visit key lawmakers to share his experience .
As a boy , Miller confided , he had embraced religion , even going so far as to become an ordained minister by mail order .
He knew the Bible verses , felt the passion for preaching .
That ’s how he found his new mission : to tell people what it was like to come home from war with a broken mind .
Three days after their wedding , I tagged along as the young couple flew to the nation ’s capital .
Easily distracted by the offer of free drinks for an all - American hero , Miller stayed out until 3 a.m .
He was hung over when he met with House members a few hours later .
Miller chatted up GOP Rep. Harold Rogers , the congressman from his district .
He smoked and frequently cursed while recounting his combat experiences .
I cringed but stayed on the sidelines , snapping photos .
Miller shuffled from one congressional office to the next , passing displays filled with photos of Marines killed in Iraq .
As he told his story over and again , the politicians listened politely and thanked Miller for his service .
One congressman sent an aide to tell Miller he was too busy to meet .
No one promised to take up his cause .
After Miller picked up his award , he took a whirlwind tour past the White House and Lincoln Memorial , but his mind was elsewhere .
At a bar the night before , free booze had flowed in honor of the Marlboro Marine .
Miller wanted more .
“ Let ’s get drunk , ” he said .
I returned to Los Angeles the next morning , thinking I would catch up with Miller in a couple of months .
A week later , Jessica called .
After they got home , Miller ’s mood had become volatile .
He was OK one minute and in a deep funk the next , she told me .
Then he ’d disappeared .
She had n’t seen him for days .
Could I come to Kentucky and help ?
Why me ?
I thought .
I am not Miller ’s brother .
Or his father .
I could feel the line between journalist and subject blurring .
Was I covering the story or becoming part of it ?
I traveled all night to get to Pikeville , Ky. , and soon found myself with Jessica , making the rounds of all the places Miller might have gone .
I wanted to be somewhere else -- anywhere else .
Finally , the next morning , Jessica saw her husband driving in the opposite direction .
She did a U - turn , hit the gas and caught up with him down the road .
He got out of his truck .
A woman sat in the passenger seat .
“ Who is that , Blake ? ” Jessica demanded .
“ Who is she ? ”
He said her name was Sherry .
They had just met , and he was helping her move .
Jessica did n’t believe him .
I thought : Did n’t I attend this young couple ’s fairy tale wedding just 10 days ago ?
Now , here they were , in a gas station parking lot , creating a spectacle .
Jessica grilled Miller .
He bobbed and weaved .
He appeared sober and sullen .
Then he dropped a bomb .
He did n’t want her anymore and had filed for divorce .
“ You guys might want to go home and talk , ” I suggested .
There , the tortured dialogue escalated .
Jessica pleaded with Blake to stop and think .
They could quit drinking , she said .
They ’d get help for him and as a couple .
Maybe they could move away -- anything to work it out .
Miller slumped on the couch .
I sensed his unease and feared he would become violent , so I stayed for a while even though I felt intrusive .
But he remained strangely calm , albeit brooding and distant .
I returned the next morning .
He called his attorney and put the phone on speaker .
If uncontested , the lawyer said , the divorce would become final in 60 days .
Jessica went to the fire escape to gather herself .
Miller remained unmoved , chain - smoking .
The local newspaper had been calling him about rumors that he was getting divorced .
It was a major local story .
Finally , he wrote a statement .
He asked for compassion and respect for their privacy .
The next day , I found Miller in a back bedroom at his uncle ’s house .
He told me that he had come close to committing suicide the night before .
He had thought about driving his motorcycle off the edge of a mountain road .
He showed me the morning newspaper .
His divorce was the lead story .
I felt torn .
I did n’t want to get involved .
I desperately wanted to close the book on Iraq .
But if I had n’t taken Miller ’s picture , this very personal drama would n’t be front - page news .
I felt responsible .
Sometimes , when things get hard to witness , I use my camera as a shield .
It creates a space for me to work -- and distance to keep my eyes open and my feelings in check .
But Miller had no use for a photojournalist .
He needed a helping hand .
I flashed back to the chaos of combat in Fallouja .
In the rattle and thunder , brick walls separated me from the world coming to an end .
In the tight spaces , we were scared mindless .
Everybody dragged deeply on cigarettes .
Above the din , I heard what everybody was thinking :
This is the end .
I ’ve never felt so completely alone .
I snapped back to the present , and before I knew it , the words spilled out .
“ I have to ask you something , Blake , ” I said .
“ If I ’d gone down in Fallouja , would you have carried me out ? ”
“ Damn straight , ” he said , without hesitation .
“ OK then , ” I said .
“ I think you ’re wounded pretty badly .
I want to help you . ”
He looked at me for a moment .
“ All right , ” he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - After years of being taunted as “ bin Laden ” and “ terrorist ” at school , Osama Al - Najjar attempted suicide last July at the age of 15 .
Osama Al - Najjar , 16 , poses at his home in New York , June 4 , 2007 .
After years of being taunted as " bin Laden " and " terrorist " at school , Al - Najjar attempted suicide last July at the age of 15 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
Now 16 , he is an extreme example of the difficulties facing some Arabs in New York , the city hit hardest by the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
“ They destroyed everything nice in our life with what they did to him , ” said Suad Abuhasna , Osama ’s mother , referring to racist abuse she said was heaped on her son while he was a student at Tottenville High School in Staten Island .
Osama is now officially known as Sammy .
He changed his name in December to escape the stigma attached to the name he shares with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
“ I just wanted to make his life easier , ” said Suad , who immigrated from Jordan with her husband and four children in December 1999 .
Her eldest son has served in the U.S. Navy in the Iraq war .
Leaders of the Muslim community -- which numbers about 600,000 in New York City and is among the fastest growing groups in the city , according to a Columbia University study -- say Osama ’s case highlights an increasing distrust and fear of Islam among Americans since 9/11 .
“ There ’s become this culture of Islamophobia in American society , ” said Arsalan Iftikhar , national legal director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
“ Unfortunately , kids are not immune . ”
Among the efforts in New York to bridge the gap between Americans and the Arab world is a new bilingual Arab - English school .
But that too has faced opposition .
Fear of Islam and Arab culture has been evident in the divisiveness over the founding of the Khalil Gibran International Academy , a publicly funded Arab studies school scheduled to open in Brooklyn this fall .
“ BREAK OUT THE TORCHES ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Alicia Colon , a columnist for the conservative New York Sun newspaper , denounced the school as a madrassa , or Muslim religious school .
Evoking images of racially motivated lynchings in the U.S. South of bygone generations , she urged opponents to “ break out the torches and surround City Hall to stop this monstrosity . ”
Parents of students at its original location -- a building that houses an elementary school in Brooklyn ’s Park Slope neighborhood -- successfully lobbied to have it moved , complaining of overcrowding .
It ’s not having an easier ride at its new location in the Boerum Hill neighborhood , which already houses two other schools .
“ There are a number of parents that are concerned about ( the fact that it is an Arabic studies school ) , but the majority is concerned about whether there ’s adequate space , ” said Tom McMahon of the parent teacher association at Boerum Hill ’s Math and Science Exploratory School .
The controversy surrounding the Khalil Gibran school is nothing compared to what Osama Al - Najjar went through .
INCESSANT JEERING
His mother says Osama became increasingly depressed under the incessant anti-Muslim jeering by teachers after entering Tottenville in the fall of 2004 .
The former junior high school honor student began to fail classes , got into fights , and ran away from home on a number of occasions .
“ I did n’t want to stay in school after that , ” Osama , a thin teenager with piercing green eyes , said while nervously chewing his thumb .
He said his classmates were more tolerant than his teachers .
The school failed to halt the abuse despite repeated requests , his mother said .
The school principal declined to comment .
“ Harassment and bullying for any reason is not something we tolerate , ” said New York City Department of Education spokeswoman Dina Paul Parks .
She declined to discuss specifics of the case because of a lawsuit filed by Osama ’s family .
The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York charges the city and the school with racial and religious harassment , which it says led to the boy ’s suicide attempt .
Fearing for her son ’s wellbeing , Suad withdrew him from school in March 2006 and kept him home .
Still , the problems did n’t go away so easily , and on July 3 , he tried to kill himself with an overdose of an anti-anxiety drug and later the same day tried to hang himself with a bathrobe sash .
“ I was just sick .
I was n’t thinking straight .
I had nothing else to take the pain away , ” said Osama , who speaks Arabic but ca n’t read or write the language .
Despite the abuse , he is fiercely proud of his Arab heritage and insists that his family still call him Osama .
The Khalil Gibran school , which plans to admit about 60 sixth graders this fall , opens too late for Osama .
He now attends a program for kids with school phobias at a high school in Brooklyn and tolerates , if not enjoys , school .
“ What I wish is that the same experience does n’t happen to any other family , ” Suad said .

University of St. Thomas Law School faculty weighs in on the refusal of a speaking invitation to Archbishop Desmond Tutu ( pacifist , anti-Apartheid activist and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize ) , on grounds that his criticisms of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians are hurtful to Jewish feelings and therefore anti-Semitic .
( See also Colleen Rowley at Huffington ) .
From “ Mirror of Justice ” .
October 8 , 2007
Dear Father Dease and Dr. Rochon ,
We are members of the School of Law faculty with a variety of political and religious perspectives .
We write in our capacity as faculty of the University of St. Thomas and with respect for the leadership you provide the University .
We are concerned by the recent decision to veto an invitation to Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to speak at St. Thomas .
We urge you to reconsider this decision and to join in inviting Abp. Tutu to speak in the Twin Cities .
In general , the appearance at UST of a Nobel - Peace - Prize winner , a major figure in the nonviolent movement against apartheid , would be a magnificent opportunity for the University community .
Although the conference at which Abp. Tutu would speak is sponsored by an outside group , without a doubt his appearance here would benefit UST students , faculty , and staff , and enhance the University ’s reputation as a place engaged in dialogue with figures of international distinction .
We are distressed at the rejection of this opportunity , and especially at the rationale that the administration has publicly asserted : that the University should not host a speaker who , in comments on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , has said things that are offensive or “ hurtful to members of the Jewish community . ”
At the outset , we note that the asserted rationale here is not that Abp.
Tutu has been invited to speak directly to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict during his appearance at UST .
Rather , the administration ’s rationale , that he has made statements that are hurtful to some on other occasions , reflects a far more restrictive attitude toward hosting speakers who are distinguished but in some way controversial .
To reject a distinguished speaker based on worries that his words may cause hurt or offense to some is entirely at odds with the search for truth that should characterize a Catholic university .
Speech taking positions on controversial subjects will often be offensive or hurtful to some people .
Nevertheless , a Catholic university should be willing to open itself to such speech – and criticisms of that speech – in order to learn the truth .
Only with such an approach can a university carry out its mission of “ consecrat[ing ] itself without reserve to the cause of truth ” ( Ex Corde Ecclesiae ¶ 4 ( our emphasis ) ) .
To give controlling weight to worries about hurt or offense cannot be reconciled with the University ’s charge to pursue “ all aspects of truth . . . without fear but rather with enthusiasm , dedicating itself to every path of knowledge ” ( id. ) .
We could easily cite secular academic norms as well , for in this case they harmonize with Catholic norms .
That an otherwise distinguished speaker should be rejected because he has made statements on disputed political issues that hurt or offend some people is a principle of breathtaking scope .
Under this rationale , it appears , the University would refuse to invite former President Jimmy Carter or Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher to speak on any matter of human rights or public affairs .
Proposals for speakers who have worthwhile ideas but are less well known might fare even worse under this calculus .
We recognize that Abp. Tutu has spoken on a broad range of issues , and that his opinions do not always comport with the views of the Catholic Church .
However , Abp. Tutu was to receive no award , honor , or generalized endorsement from the University ; and his views on issues other than those he has been invited to address simply are not relevant in this particular case .
We urge that the administration issue Abp. Tutu an invitation in connection with the Peacejam conference , and in the absence of an invitation , that the University issue a statement acknowledging that it was a mistake to reject the invitation on the ground that has been offered .
Respectfully ,

Who Pays $ 731 for a Pizza ?
Under what circumstances would you be willing to pay $ 731 for a pizza ?
If your answer has something to do with raising money for charity , then you are halfway right .
But that ’s not the interesting half .
Here are a few clues :
+ The pizza was sold at auction .
+ The bidding began at $ 0 , and climbed fairly steadily to the winning bid of $ 731 , with nearly 20 different bidders .
+ The auction lasted just over three days and concluded fairly recently .
+ The identity of the buyer is n’t important ; it ’s the circumstances of the purchase that are interesting .
Have you guessed it yet ?
I seriously doubt it .
So here are a few more clues .
+ The auction concerned a pizza baked in Brooklyn .
+ The pizza in question was to be baked at a certain time … and was connected to a certain holiday .
Yes , that ’s right : someone paid $ 731 for the rights to the first pizza baked after the Jewish festival of Passover .
During the eight - day festival of Passover ( seven days in Israel ) , observant Jews do n’t eat any chametz , a category of food that includes any fermented flour and which therefore comprises bread , cake — and , yes , pizza .
( This prohibition commemorates the Israelites ’ exodus from Egypt , when they did n’t have time to let their dough rise ; this is why matzo is eaten during Passover . )
And so each year at Passover , many Jews rid their homes of all chametz .
There are all sorts of side markets arising from this practice , including the “ selling ” of chametz to non-Jews , and the repurchase thereof .
There has even been an effort to provide kosher - for - Passover gasoline , since corn is also considered chametz , and since corn - based ethanol has become a common ingredient in gas .
[ Addendum : the kosher gas story was apparently a pure spoof . ]
Anyway : the $ 731 pizza was a different story .
It represented the right to break the chametz fast with a fresh - baked pie from the renowned Pizza Time on Avenue J in Brooklyn .

Chlorine and Cholera by Eric Umansky .
The gist of it :
There is a spreading Cholera epidemic in Iraq ( already reaching major cities such as Baghdad ) .
The epidemic can spread so fast because the lack of Chlorine to disinfect the water .
Chlorine was used in terrorist attacks which caused a lot of media attention and a lot of fear in the Iraqi government despite the fact that not a single person was killed by the attacks .
So the import of Chlorine was put under restrictions .
This is really bitter irony .
But so common these days .
People do not seem to realize that terror is not about explosions but terrorising people and thus trick them into doing stupid things .
Refuse to be terrorized !

While these " squeeze " impacts are expected to occur , the real problem may be the discontinuities that occur , because of pressure on monetary systems and pressure on political systems .
These pressures can cause unexpected results such as :
We cannot know exactly what is ahead .
In this part , we look at one possible future scenario .
When we think of economic impacts , we usually think of the impacts that the squeeze of higher oil prices will bring -- such as energy price inflation , food price inflation , and the need for more mass transit .
There are three types of impacts that may occur .
In the scenario that is presented here , we will assume that they all occur .
Squeeze impacts
These are the impacts caused by gradually higher prices and slowly reducing world supply .
This type of impact is already squeezing some of the poorer countries out of the world oil market .
While this type of impact can be expected to increase over time , in this scenario , it is of far less importance than discontinuities .
Discontinuities for oil exporters
In these countries , there is the possibility of social unrest and overthrow of governments once oil production begins to fall .
This may happen because government revenues begin to decline , resulting in a cutback in governmental services and imports .
The impact is likely to be a faster decline in oil production .
Discontinuities for oil importers
Once real growth falters , the combination of increasing debt and decreasing real incomes may overwhelm monetary systems for oil importers .
The infinite growth paradigm will come to an abrupt halt .
Depending on the type of governmental intervention , the resulting discontinuity could either take the form of hyperinflation or rapid deflation .
My analysis suggests either of these may result in a decline in the amount of oil and other goods a country is able to import , because of debt and monetary problems .
2 . How soon might such discontinuities occur ?
Discontinuities could start very soon , and continue in different countries over many years .
With respect to oil exporters , Mexico , with its declining oil production , is already at risk for social unrest and overthrow of the government .
Saudi Arabia has a high risk of government overthrow , once its oil production starts clearly declining .
Because of this type of discontinuity , world oil production may begin to decline considerably faster than models based on " business as usual " would suggest .
With respect to oil importers , we indicated in Part 2 that the debt situation in the United States is already in a precarious situation .
A little more squeeze in oil availability , or a sharp drop in the value of the dollar , or even widespread knowledge of the likelihood of peak oil and its effects could further destabilize the debt market .
Faith in the ability of long - term borrowers to repay their debt could evaporate .
Depending on how the government deals with this situation , the result could be either hyperinflation or deflation .
If there are discontinuities , the timing is likely to vary from country to country , depending on the situation in that particular country .
Once there is a discontinuity in a major country such as the United States , the impact may to spread to some other countries as well .
Some countries may be able minimize discontinuity effects by finding a group of lesser - affected countries and sharing resources within the group .
3 . If there is hyperinflation in the United States , what kinds of effects might there be ?
How about massive deflation ?
With peak oil , there are likely to be many debt defaults , ultimately caused by the squeeze of higher oil prices .
( This squeeze of higher oil prices may actually cause problems before the peak arrives .
See Part 2 , Question 12 . )
If the response of the government is to guarantee payment of debt , so as to prevent business failures , the money supply may expand greatly and hyperinflation may occur .
If there are many defaults and the government does not intervene , or its intervention is unsuccessful , the money supply may contract , and deflation may occur .
Hyperinflation .
If there is hyperinflation , people and businesses will find that money in their bank accounts and fixed income retirement funds will purchase very little .
Incomes of people with jobs are not likely to rise as fast as the price of goods , so they will find it necessary to reduce their purchases .
Demand for many optional goods and services will drop .
After a short time , the government will find that its revenue is very low compared to the huge amount of debt that it has guaranteed .
Buyers for government bonds are likely to disappear , and the monetary system will collapse .
Whether or not the monetary system fails , foreign governments holding US debt will be very unhappy .
Even if there is not a default , the bonds will be redeemed with dollars that are worth much less than when the bonds were purchased .
Either way , foreign governments will feel cheated .
Massive Deflation
With massive deflation , there will be many business failures -- banks , money market funds , hedge funds , insurance companies , and ultimately businesses of many kinds .
FDIC insurance will cover some of the bank losses , but this would soon be depleted .
Many people will find their life savings wiped out .
Governmental revenue will decline in such a scenario , making it difficult for the US government to repay its debt .
Exceedingly high interest rates might be needed to attract buyers for US debt -- higher than could be afforded with the decline in revenue .
If the problems were to become severe enough , the whole monetary system could collapse .
4 . If the monetary system fails , what are the options for replacing it ?
In a scenario where the monetary system fails , there will be big problems .
In such a scenario , it seems like there is a significant chance that the government may also be replaced , because the existing government will have no money and there will be a huge number of people who are very angry about the situation .
Waiting up to four years for a new president , and up to six years for new senators , may seem unacceptable .
Open revolt seems possible .
Once we are talking about replacing the government , we are really speculating .
One question is whether the new government would cover the same 50 states as it does today , or a smaller area .
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , the governments of its constituent states remained , and these took over .
If the analogous situation happened here , we would fall back on the 50 individual state governments .
This would be the easiest new government to implement .
It is theoretically possible that the 50 state governments could each set up its own fiat monetary system .
It seems to me that this may be the most likely outcome .
5 . What kind of new monetary system would work ?
If we are talking about 50 state governments issuing currency , I would expect that the level of planning that would go into each of the new systems would be limited .
Each state would issue some type of money , good only in that state .
A governor might choose to increase the amount of money available whenever he or she found it politically expedient to do so .
With this system , money would still act as a means for facilitating the transfer of goods .
No one would reasonably expect money to be a store of value because the amount of money in circulation in the future may be quite a bit greater than today , and the amount of goods available for purchase would likely be decreasing .
In a scenario where a new 50 - state monetary system is created , the monetary system would still not act as a store of value .
The inflation rate would likely to be very high , and interest rates would not be sufficient to offset the inflation .
This result is expected because the amount of goods available to society will be decreasing over time because of peak oil and decreasing imports .
Unless someone figures out a way to keep contracting the money supply on a regular basis ( ask for 5 % back from everyone ? ) , the decrease in available goods would almost certainly result in persistent inflation .
If it is necessary to create a new 50 - state government , the length of time it takes to put all of the pieces in place -- a new government , a new monetary system , and probably a new banking system -- could be a problem .
If a new democratically elected government were to be formed , it would seem like the process could take up to three years .
We would most likely be without any monetary system at all during this time .
If some type of dictatorship took over , the timeframe might be much shorter , but there would be different issues .
6 . What kind of financial system would work with a fiat monetary system , long - term inflation , and a declining economy ?
In such a scenario , people would expect to spend money pretty much as soon as they earned it .
Banks would be primarily for convenience , rather than as a place to store money for the future .
Insurance products with a very short time horizon could be sold - for example , term life insurance , health coverage , auto coverage , homeowners coverage , fire insurance for buildings , and cargo coverage for shipping .
Loans with very short time frames might be offered -- for example , short - term financing of goods for resale .
Long term business and personal loans would generally not be available , because of the uncertainty of the value of the currency in the future , and also because of the declining economy .
( If the only problem were the variable inflation rate , variable interest rate loans might work . )
Because of the uncertain nature of money , it is possible that longer - term loans could be made to individuals that would be paid back in services rather than money .
For example , a city might pay a person 's tuition for medical school in return for his / her agreeing to work for that city for a set number of years to repay the loan .
( Does this sound a little like being an indentured servant ? )
Financing of large projects by businesses or individuals would be very difficult , because of the lack of long - term loans .
Because of this , large projects would most likely need to be undertaken by governments , and financed by tax dollars .
A country with an economy of the type described would likely be very poor .
It would theoretically be possible for the country to have a social security - type retirement program financed by a tax on workers .
Because of the poverty of the country , such an arrangement seems unlikely , however .
Instead , I would expect most people to work as long as they are able , and live with children in later life .
7 . I learned that money is always a store of value .
Is n't that what economics teaches ?
Economics may teach that money is a store of value , but unfortunately this cannot be true when an economy is in a period of long - term contraction .
Economists have developed their theories looking at an atypical period in the world 's history -- one where growth was the norm .
They have never stopped to realize that our world is finite , so infinite growth is not possible .
Their theories may hold for a specific time period , but are n't true in general .
In some ways , their assumptions are similar to the assumptions of people who once thought the world was flat .
At some time in the not too distant future , people will come to realize that the most important word in the phrase " economic theory " is the word theory .
Economic theory is really just an untested hypothesis , developed in period of long - tern economic growth .
Once this growth stops , there is no particular reason to believe that economic theory will hold .
8 . What will future trade look like in scenarios such as you are discussing ?
If we are looking at 50 state governments , each with its own type of money , future trade is likely to be pretty limited .
There will be some trade across state lines , but long - distance transport of people and goods is likely to decrease significantly .
It may be possible to import some goods from overseas , but I would expect that an equal - value export would need to be traded at the same time with the same country .
If we are looking at a unified United States , prospects for trade are better .
Trade within the United States will most likely continue unhindered .
Overseas trade may still be a problem .
For one thing , foreign countries will be unhappy about the default on US debt ( or its payment in inflated dollars ) , and will want to retaliate .
At a minimum , they will be unwilling to extend credit , unless it is clearly earned .
I expect that countries will develop a close set of allies whose credit can be trusted , and trade mostly with those allies .
In either scenario , I expect that the total amount of foreign trade will drop sharply .
As an upper bound , I would expect imports from overseas to equal about 56 % of our current imports .
( See Part 2 , Question 8 . )
This kind of drop would be needed to eliminate our current balance of payments deficit .
Even this level of imports is almost certainly unreasonably high , if our ability to produce goods for export decreases , or if there are barriers to trade .
Also , some of our trading partners ( like Japan ) are likely to have economic problems as well .
A better guess might be that overseas imports will equal 10 % of current imports .
The decline in trade is a key issue .
In a scenario where the US monetary system collapses , there will be oil somewhere in the world , but we wo n't be able to buy it .
The inability to buy the oil will cause the problems , not the lack of oil itself .
We also will find ourselves unable to buy most of the other goods we currently import .
9 . What will happen to large companies ?
In scenarios such as this , I expect that most large companies will either cease to exist , or will break into pieces that fit within a single country .
There are several issues :
• If a US company has assets in overseas locations , there is a significant possibility that foreign governments will find an excuse to confiscate those assets , as partial payment for the US default on debt .
• Business airline travel is likely to disappear very quickly , because of the squeeze effect of declining oil supply .
It will be very difficult to manage overseas locations using boats as the primary means of travel .
• Financial system problems may be a huge issue .
It will be difficult to expand operations without the availability of long - term debt .
Stock values are likely to be very low if the economy is in long - term decline , so raising funds from the issuance of stock will not work well either .
If there are 50 states with non-interchangeable currencies , business operations across state lines may be very difficult .
• The decline in imports is likely to be a real problem .
Local replacements will need to be found for raw materials and parts that were imported from abroad -- even replacement parts , to keep machinery operating .
Fuel for transportation of products will be very limited .
Customers will have difficulty visiting stores , because of limited fuel supplies .
10 .
What kind of economy can continue , without large companies , with very few imports , and with a finance system as you described ?
In such a scenario , I expect that the economy that can exist long - term would be a very simple system , with most people either growing their own food or manufacturing some type of product using local materials .
Such a system might be similar to an economy from 1900 or earlier .
If this scenario should happen now , the new economy would not work as well as the economy in 1900 in many ways , because the country would be lacking some of the things available in 1900 -- for example , draft animals for labor and farm tools that do not require fuel .
People now are also lacking the required skills to live as people lived then - knowledge of farming , food processing and woodworking , for example .
For the first several years , I expect we would be able to carry over some of our current lifestyle .
People would continue to live in houses that were built prior to the discontinuity -- perhaps two or three families in a single house , if the house is conveniently located .
Clothing and other manufactured goods would be used as long as possible .
I expect that there would be considerable trade in used household goods .
Electricity would continue to be available as long as the grid can be maintained and power plants can be operated .
I expect that if new power plants are built , they would use local materials for generation -- wood pieces where there are forests and oil where oil is produced .
The availability of electricity is likely to vary by the part of the country .
Grids are likely to be difficult to maintain , so eventually electricity is likely to be generated close to where it is used .
Many homeowners are likely to be without electricity .
11 . Will there be rationing of gasoline and diesel fuel ?
In this scenario , it is possible that there would be rationing of fuel for a few years , but I expect the whole transportation system would collapse pretty quickly , so that the need for gasoline and diesel would decline .
The reason I see a problem is the fact that our vehicles -- cars , semi- trucks , fire engines , ambulances , farm equipment , and airplanes -- have many parts that need to be replaced regularly :
• Batteries
• Oil filters
• Tires
• Brake linings
• Head lights
• Fluids such as anti-freeze , transmission fluid , and motor oil
In addition , roads and bridges that the cars and trucks use need regular maintenance .
If we are very much restricted in terms of imports , we will not be able to import the parts and raw materials that we are accustomed to .
Because of this , it will be difficult to keep the cars and trucks running and the roads repaired .
Even if we have plenty of gasoline and diesel fuel , the system will come to a stop .
Boats and trains may be better , in terms of needing fewer replacement parts .
Electric trains would seem to be OK as long as the grid is running .
Once the grid stops , electric trains will stop .
12 . How much new infrastructure would we be able to build , after the discontinuity ?
Very little .
There are a lot of things we would like to use our resources for , including :
• Building factories to manufacture all of the things we used to import from overseas , but can no longer import .
• Maintaining roads and bridges .
• Maintaining the grid .
• Transporting raw materials from one end of the country to the other .
• Building new battery powered cars .
There would simply not be enough resources to go around , since the resources we will have will be those within the country itself , plus a few imports .
Financing is also likely to be a problem , because of the lack of long - term loans .
Most of the infrastructure development would need to be undertaken by governments , because of financing issues .
13 .
If we need to use more manual labor to grow our food , how will that work ?
Right now it seems like there are a lot of huge farms .
I can think of two approaches that might be used to make the transition from large mechanized farms to farms using more manual labor .
One approach is for the government to print lots of extra money , and use the extra money to buy up the large farms .
The extra money will add to inflation .
The government will then divide the large farms into small tracts , and assign families to the tracts .
A second approach would be to keep the farms intact , and assign people to work on the farms , much like serfs .
The farm owner would assign people to tasks and keep a portion of the crops as his share .
Regardless of which approach is used , a large amount of housing will be needed in areas where farms are located .
If existing houses are located in the area , they can be subdivided and used .
If not , there will be a need for houses that can be built at low cost with local materials .
I would expect homes would be built of local materials such as straw , sod , logs , or adobe .
These new homes would lack amenities such as electricity , heat , and running water .
14 .
Which countries are likely to fare best in the transition to a scenario such as you describe ?
The countries that are likely to do best in the transition are the ones whose economies are at a fairly low level currently , so that the people have the skills and the tools needed to grow local crops , and make clothing .
It would be helpful for the countries to have fertile soil , adequate rain , and a relatively low population for the area available .
It would be best for most people to already be living in the countryside or small towns , because it is doubtful that economies will be able to support large cities after the discontinuity .
Finally , it would be helpful for the countries not to be too affected by climate change .
If climate change kills the native crops , there will be a huge problem .
15 .
What might a country do to prepare for life after the discontinuity ?
If a scenario such as the one we have discussed takes place , the world will look much like it did before the industrial revolution in not too many years .
Most products will be grown or produced locally .
Foreign trade will play a minor role .
The array of goods available will be much smaller than today .
Finance will play a smaller role than today .
If a country is to prepare for a scenario such as this , one major thing that needs to be done now is to train people for life in a low energy world - - teaching the many skills required .
It would be helpful to collect open - pollinated seeds for grains , legumes , and vegetables suitable for each area .
It may also be helpful to manufacture some tools and easy - to repair machinery for use in the future .
A country may even want to re-build some older technology like grain mills powered by waterfalls and cotton gins , since these can be built to be fairly sustainable in the future .
If a scenario such as we are discussing happens in the next few years , spending time and money on attempts to extend our current lifestyle would be counterproductive .
The decline would be so significant that we would not be able to maintain our new technologies in the years ahead .
Hopefully , a scenario such as what I have described will never happen .
Thinking about it , and why it might or might not happen , can perhaps give us better insight as to how we should prepare for the years ahead .
Monday 's story on successful primate cloning appears to be true .
Nature published the paper today along with a non-technical summary .
The researchers , led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov , discovered that dyes and ultraviolet light normally used when removing the egg 's nucleus harm the cell .
They minimzed damage to the egg by using the Oosight machine instead , resulting in the creation of 35 blastocysts from 304 attempts using DNA adult skin cells .
Mitalipov 's team then attempted to extract stem cells from 20 of the best blastocysts , with two attempts bearing fruit and producing embryonic stem cell lines .
While the rate of creating blastocysts using adult DNA is less than half that of using fetal genetic material , some researchers are very excited by the news .
Robert Lanza told Nature that this accomplishment is " like breaking the sound barrier " in primate cloning and that he hopes this success encourages regulators to change their rules and allow the work in humans .
Nature 's summary did include one confusing note toward the end when explaining why reproductive cloning is a bad idea right now :
So far , the recipe Mitalipov used for his embryonic stem - cell lines has not worked for reproductive cloning .
This April , the team tried to transfer 77 embryos into about a dozen surrogates .
The embryos ranged in their stage of development : some were 2 days old , some were 5 - day - old blastocysts .
" But no pregnancy made it even to day 25 , " says Mitalipov .
This paragraph implies that Mitalipov 's cloning method has created at least 77 embryos , compared to the 35 mentioned earlier .
If those 77 were transfered into surrogate mothers to initiate pregnancies , and 20 were used for stem cell extraction , that means the improved nuclear transfer technique has succeeded at least 97 times .
This could mean the Oregonian team has derived more stem cell lines since the paper was initially submitted .
I 'm awaiting word back from Oregon Health & Science University , where Mitalipov works , for clarification .

Hi all .
The time has come for me to make a statement about my future concerning BeOS / Haiku .
I owe you that I think , since I 've been a very regular contributor to this community upto now .
I 've been on holiday for a few weeks in Spain just now , in a tiny place where ' time stood still ' so to speak .
The old village where I stayed is situated in the mountains .
There 's nothing much to do there , except enjoying the overwhelming nature , do long walks , think , talk with the people I travelled with , eat a orange here and there , and drink a beer .
Much in contrast to my busy ' normal , daily life ' back home .
And much in contrast to ' normal ' holiday ' resorts ' I tended to visit .
Being in this village has been an experience I will * never * forget , it 's changing my life .
It 's good .
I feel it in my heart .
I have to follow this new path unfolding before my eyes .
It 's my destination .
It 's real life .
I love it , I need it .
As you all probably know , I 've spent most of my freetime on BeOS related development .
This means that other aspects of my life have been ' neglected ' a lot .
I 've always felt it deep down and I knew it had to change someday .
Well , that day has come .
So , I 'll nolonger work on all those drivers much .
Maybe even I 'll quit alltogether .
I 'll keep following Haiku progressing towards a full , useable ' replacement ' operating system for BeOS though .
I really hope it will succeed .
I love those systems .
They are intuitive and easy to use .
They make using computers a breeze .
Unlike using Windows or Linux which scare me away and make me feel frustrated .-
I 'll do one more Matrox driver release pending updated TVout support completion for G100 and G200 cards .
There 's not much work left todo for that .-
I now nolonger support any of the programs and drivers I wrote , apart from maybe tiny patches like adding cardID 's and such which virtually cost no time to do . -
For the nVidia driver I might continue to do a bit more work for now though : I 'm talking about testing a bit with 3D support for newer cards so the new Linux open DRI driver has an improved chance on success .
The efforts I 'll do are minimal though : only a few nessesities and only if I can manage this while putting in small amounts of time .-
We ( the BeOS / Haiku community ) need ( a ) new maintainer (s ) for all stuff I did , including for the nVidia driver .
I wo n't be responsible any longer for these items .
I might be able to guide someone a bit though every once and a while . -
I have a few items here that can be given to new maintainers : a VIA Nimble V5 and several Matrox graphics cards .-
n Vidia hardware I 'll probably need a bit longer for those ' final ' 3D tests .
Some cards can be given to a new maintainter in a bit of time though : and some I 'll keep because I had to purchase them .
Unless these will be payed for .- a General 3D related thought : For 3D support I suggest ' porting ' Linux DRI drivers back to Haiku ' in the end ' , including the new nVidia DRI driver that 's in the process of being developed .
My nVidia driver is probably best left alone in the end , since it 's based on an very old version of MESA .
It 's just a proof - of - concept , along with a good testing bed for hardware knowledge development ( for the new DRI driver ' for instance ' ) .
So , that 's about it !
It 's been a hell of a fun ride !
I 've given my * very * best efforts to this community , I hope you see that .
I do n't regret having done that , though it came at a cost .
This was a ( technical ) chapter I needed in my life .
it 's done now however .
Before continuing life , hopefully finding inner tranquillity ;
Before continuing life in a much more complete , sensitive , loving and personal way , I need to do some soul searching .
So , I 'm taking a time - out .
I 'll probably not respond to Email much .
Thanks for your awesome support people !!
Kind regards , and the very best to you all .
Rudolf .
You have to see it to believe it .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush 's pick for attorney general called the interrogation technique known as waterboarding a " repugnant " practice Tuesday , but again refused to say whether it violates U.S. laws banning torture .
Michael Mukasey answers questions during his confirmation hearing on October 18 .
Judge Michael Mukasey told Senate Judiciary Committee members that he has not received classified briefings on what techniques American interrogators are allowed to use and can't make a legal judgment .
" Hypotheticals are different from real life , and in any legal opinion the actual facts and circumstances are critical , " Mukasey said in a written answer to Democrats on the committee .
Mukasey offered a similar response in his October 18 confirmation hearing .
Watch why Mukasey 's answers raise concerns »
Human rights groups consider waterboarding -- a technique in which prisoners are made to feel as if they were drowning -- a form of torture .
It was specifically banned in a 2006 law passed by Congress .
Bush has acknowledged authorizing the use of " alternative " interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists .
Though his administration insists that it does not torture prisoners , it refuses to reveal which interrogation techniques may be used .
" When we find somebody who may have information regarding a potential attack on America , you bet we 're going to detain them and you bet we 're going to question them , because the American people expect us to find out information , actionable intelligence , so we can help them -- help protect them , " Bush said earlier this month .
He said his administration sticks to " U.S. law and our international obligations , " adding that " the techniques that we use have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the United States Congress . "
Mukasey 's refusal to declare waterboarding to be torture has boosted opposition to his nomination .
Sen . Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island -- who raised the issue during the Judiciary Committee hearing -- called Mukasey 's answer a " massive hedge , " and three Democratic presidential candidates have cited it as a reason to oppose his confirmation .
The top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , urged Mukasey last week to clarify his response to questions about waterboarding and the president 's authority to order electronic surveillance .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont and the committee 's chairman , said he remains very concerned that the retired federal judge " finds himself unable to state unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and below the standards and values of the United States . "
" I await his response to other written questions and letters from Republican and Democratic senators that were sent to him last week , and I will consult with Sen .
Specter and other members of the Judiciary Committee before scheduling committee consideration of this nomination , " Leahy said .
Waterboarding is not being used as part of its interrogations now , sources with knowledge of the CIA - run interrogation program have said .
But it was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who is facing trial for planning al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington , the sources have said .
In Tuesday 's letter , Mukasey restated his belief that the Constitution and federal law bar the president from ordering the use of torture .
He said the techniques Democratic senators described to him " seem over the line or , on a personal basis , repugnant to me , and would probably seem the same to many Americans . "
Mukasey promised to review any " coercive interrogation techniques " used by U.S. intelligence operatives once confirmed .
If he determines them to be torture , " I will not hesitate to so advise the president and will rescind or correct any legal opinion of the Department of Justice that supports use of the technique , " he told the senators .

AT HER Brisbane funeral yesterday , Hannah Ciobo got the wedding she had long dreamed of , with her bridesmaids , groomsmen , husband , parents and family present .
The family arrived at the funeral in a limousine , dressed in wedding attire , for the congregation to farewell their " beautiful bambina " .
For her mother , it was an occasion that must have passed in a unique , encompassing pain .
Tracey Wickham , an Olympic legend Australians have known for three decades , long ago learned to endure and conquer emotional extremes , but what could defeat this : seeing her daughter married and buried in the space of a week .
Somehow she found the words .
" Hannah loved life and life loved Hannah .
She was and still is my best girlfriend .
I learnt a lot from her , she was my teacher and she was my rock . "
ABC News , the same network that neo -cons use to further their agenda , decided to look at the question of Universal Health Care in the US .
Who better to investigate it than John " The Free Market Trumps All " Stossel ?
As is evident from the promo from last Friday 's Good Morning America , Stossel 's program looks like little more than a way to demonize Michael Moore :
Download Download
And the actual program was just more of the same : ridiculing Moore and touting the excellence that competition and profits bring our healthcare system .
Julie Pierce , whose husband was sentenced to death by their insurance company and featured in Michael Moore 's documentary , Sicko , decided she had to respond to Stossel .
We 've documented Stossel 's bottom feeding , tabloid style " journalism " in the past , from denying global warming to getting smacked down by a professional wrestler , his resume is beyond lame .
Kudos to Julie for calling this clown out for his hackery ...
Via MichaelMoore.com :
Dear John ,
My name is Julie Pierce .
My husband was Tracy Pierce .
I am featured in Michael Moore 's documentary ' SiCKO . '
In the movie , I share my deceased husband 's story — his unsuccessful battle with our insurance company to receive what could have been life - saving treatments for kidney cancer .
I just read your Wall Street Journal article written on Sept. 13 , 2007 , titled " Sick Sob Stories . "
You begin by talking about Tracy 's role in ' SiCKO , ' and claim the bone marrow transplant denied by our insurer would not have saved him .
You also accuse me of " sneering " over our situation .
In your ' reporting ' of this story , you did not contact me , and you did not contact my husband 's doctors .
I cannot believe that a publication like the Wall Street Journal would print such an accusation without talking to anyone involved — especially in such a personal matter , which resulted in the death of my 37 - year - old husband and the father of my child .
If you had contacted me , I would have told you that bone marrow transplants became a last option , only after our insurer denied many other treatments again and again and again .
I would have shown you a letter from our doctors at the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Kansas Hospital , in which they argued strongly for the bone marrow transplant , citing " strong evidence " supporting the past success of that treatment — they wrote that it could " give him a chance to achieve complete remission . "
In fact , they called the bone marrow transplant " his only chance of survival . "
Instead of calling me up and doing real reporting , all you can do is throw around studies from 1999 about the supposed inefficiency of bone marrow transplants for breast cancer patients — even though Tracy did n't have breasts .
He had kidney cancer !
I understand that you want to try to prove that private insurance in this country really is n't that bad .
And I can see that you wo n't let the facts get in the way .
You go on to claim that Tracy would n't have received his transplant in a country with socialized medicine , either .
Where is the evidence ?
Not only are more bone marrow transplants performed every year in Canada , but they invented the technology !
So much for your ridiculous claim that " profit is what has created the amazing scientific innovations that the U.S. offers to the world .
If government takes over , innovation slows , health care is rationed . "
You are simply carrying water for the for - profit insurance industry that killed my husband .
And then you have the nerve to accuse me of " sneering " about it .
My husband has only been dead since January 18th , 2006 .
It is still fresh to me and my family , and comments like this are inhumane .
I have since tried to contact you via email , but you have not responded .
I do n't expect an answer .
People like you just write with an agenda , without coming to the source or getting any facts , because your main goal is to try to discredit Michael Moore and universal health care .
I understand it 's a game — you did it without thinking about how you would hurt a family who have suffered — and are still suffering — such a tragic loss .
My family is not a " Sick Sob Story . "
We are a normal , American family that has had a significant member die from a horrible cancer that ravaged his body due to repeated denials from a health insurance company .
We will never know for sure what would have worked because Tracy was never given a fighting chance .
Over 18,000
Americans die each year because they do n't have health insurance .
I suppose theirs are " sob stories , " too .
I do n't want a hit - piece .
I want answers .
Why does our wonderful profit - driven system of medicine kill 18,000 Americans each year ?
Why do we pay far more for our health system than any other country , but have some of the lowest life expectancies and highest infant mortality rates in the Western world ?
Would you discredit the work of your late colleague Peter Jennings who , while suffering with lung cancer , did an excellent report titled " Breakdown : America 's Health Insurance Crisis " ?
I hope you have answers , but I am not optimistic .
I pray that you will never have to go through what we went through — if you did , you would n't be so quick to cheerlead the system we were victimized by .

The July 17 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) “ On the Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland ” [. pdf ] warns that al - Qaeda has reconstituted itself in the tribal areas of U.S. ally Pakistan , that it has resumed training of cadres intending to carry out “ high impact plots ” against the United States , and that the terrorist threat for the next three years continues worldwide and is even growing in places like North Africa and Britain .
As always there is a bland euphemism to define the emerging situation , in this case that the United States will be experiencing a “ heightened threat environment . ”
And to make sure that the conflation of terrorism with Iraq is not lost on the reader , the “ central front ” in Iraq makes an appearance among the report ’s “ Key Findings . ”
In a tour - de - force of misinformation disguised as fact , the report states , erroneously , that al - Qaeda in Iraq represents the principal threat for an attack on the U.S. homeland “ because it has expressed a desire to attack us here . ”
The “ attack us here ” theme has been around for several years , and it has lately been reinforced by the White House ’s incessant linkage of Iraq to al - Qaeda , culminating in a July 10 speech in Cleveland in which President Bush named the terrorist organization 30 times during comments that were ostensibly on the war in Iraq .
Anyone who follows terrorism even in a pedestrian fashion might politely suggest that the administration ’s position on the terrorism problem is nonsense .
The main threat to the U.S. comes from the real original unadulterated al - Qaeda in Pakistan .
Iraq , though a magnet and training ground for terrorist aspirants , is neither interested in nor capable of exporting its own particular brand of anarchy to America ’s shores .
Given the prominence of Iraq , the NIE is clearly more a political document than an objective assessment .
It goes on to state that the U.S. has been on the offensive against terrorism , that it has “ built new institutions ” and “ developed new tools . ”
It is “ constantly evaluating the threat ” in hundreds if not thousands of meetings in Washington .
Lots of meetings .
Lots of reviews .
Lots of worker bees working .
The irrepressible Karen Hughes at State Department has summoned her Myrmidons , “ countering al - Qaeda ’s violent message , ” challenging terrorists to cyber duels over the Internet .
It ’s Star Wars all over again .
“ We remain vigilant . ”
It ’s all there in the NIE .
But one might be forgiven for thinking , perhaps , that all is not well , that the terrorism problem is somehow worse now than it was in 2001 .
Such reflection , which would be appropriate for anyone who truly cares about the United States and its people , leads to the inescapable conclusion that the past six years of misdirection and mismanagement have made the world a much more dangerous place .
In that light , one might conclude that the NIE is more a chronicle of failure than success , an admission that the White House and Congress have , in fact , been unable to protect the American people .
It might also be observed that one does n’t get as much bang for the buck as used to be the case .
The expenditure of half a trillion dollars in a “ global war on terrorism ” ( GWOT ) that has led to the deployment of hundreds of thousands of soldiers , intelligence officers , and law enforcement personnel against no more than a couple of thousand terrorists concentrated in one of the world ’s most backward regions has not radically shifted the playing field in America ’s favor .
Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaeda carried out 9/11 .
Osama has been hanging around in Pakistan since late 2001 , and he is still there , training new terrorists and planning .
And , if something is wrong in the GWOT , as usual no one is to blame , as - finger pointing would reflect badly on the political leadership .
Retired Gen. Tommy Franks , the architect of the administration ’s failure to finish off a cornered Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan ’s Tora Bora Mountains in December 2001 , received his Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 .
He now sits on the boards of the Bank of America and Outback Steakhouse , and it is assumed that he will soon be named president of Oklahoma State University .
Ex -CIA Director George Tenet , who claims he warned Condoleezza Rice about an impending terrorist attack but , inexplicably , failed to tell the president , just received a $ 4 million book advance .
Paul Wolfowitz , whose lack of judgment guaranteed that the U.S. occupation of Iraq would not succeed , is now comfortably back at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute after his failure at the World Bank .
The blundering of the past six years in which America ’s friends overseas have been turned into enemies by arrogance and bullying , in which Washington ’s standing among nations has plummeted , has not resulted in any serious change of course .
No one is responsible .
The neoconservative architects of the Pentagon assault on Iraq that has turned that country into a failed state and a magnet for terrorism have left for greener pastures , but not a one has admitted to error or been publicly admonished .
Several , including Vice President Dick Cheney and the National Security Council ’s Elliot Abrams , are still in positions of power , advocating a new war as part of a larger conflict that will go on indefinitely , everywhere .
And it ’s always convenient to blame it on the bad guys .
Per the NIE , terrorism is not a problem because America ’s politicians , bureaucrats , and pundits stacked a hundred high in every office lining the Potomac have failed to understand the nature of the threat .
It is rather because the terrorists have “ evolved ” and “ adapted , ” hardly playing fair .
The NIE is not pleasant reading , even though it tries to make the essentially political point that everything possible is being done to protect “ the Homeland . ”
What it really is arguing is that everything that is being done should continue to be done , and more .
That means more of the bloated bureaucracy of the Department of Homeland Security and the world ’s mightiest military budget .
Another White House tactical response to the very real terrorist threat , which it does n’t want anyone to think about too much , is , predictably , to look for a diversion in the form of someone else to kick .
With Iraq and Afghanistan in shambles , there just happen to be a couple of neighbors who can be credibly accused of “ interference ” with the U.S. military ’s civilizing mission .
In the intelligence business it is sometimes necessary to use “ disinformation ” to establish a false factual basis or to create a straw man that can be used to divert attention from an unpleasant reality .
If it is too hard to catch Osama bin Laden , it might be more convenient to talk about Iran instead .
As Syria and Iran have both long been in the crosshair of the neoconservatives because of those countries ’ antipathy to Israel , it is reassuring to know that they have not been forgotten by the White House .
It is possibly no coincidence that there has been a significant increase in the anti-Iran rhetoric emanating from both the Bush administration and Congress over the past few weeks , mostly seeking to establish a casus belli by contending that Iran is masterminding lethal attacks directed against U.S. troops in Iraq and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
A tidy little war against Iran would be a useful diversion that would make everyone forget about the NIE and the inability to do anything about Osama bin Laden .

Spiders make my skin crawl , but it ’s always amazed me that , despite being mechanical and grotesque , they produce silk , which is not only one of nature ’s finest materials , but also one of the lightest and strongest .
Now it turns out that the creator of the fictional superhero Spiderman was n’t too far off the mark when he decided that the character would have the ability to spin webs from his hands : new research , published today in Nature , shows that the Costa Rican zebra tarantula ( Aphonopelma seemanni ) can secrete silk from its feet .
Stanislav Gorb and his colleagues filmed the spiders as they crawled up vertical glass surfaces , and observed that they left ‘ footprints ’ of silk threads up to 1 thousandth of a millimetre in diameter and 2.5 cm long .
These silk threads , which are secreted from nozzle - like structures on the feet , act to tether the tarantula to the surface , and were secreted when the tarantula started slipping down the glass , preventing them from slipping further .
The findings have led the authors to reconsider the evolution of spider silk .
Spiders evolved around 400 million years ago and are among the first terrestrial species .
Silk may at first have been used to provide a protective covering for spiders ’ eggs or a lining for their nests .
Later on , silk may have been used in the construction of trap doors for capturing prey .
Spiders ’ ability to weave webs probably evolved around the time when the diversification of insects and plants occurred .
Until now , it was thought that an ancestral arachnid was able to spin silk from its feet , and that , during the course of evolution , this ability was eventually lost in favour of abdominal silk - secreting glands called spinnerets .
In the light of this research , another hypothesis presents itself – that the tarantula independently evolved the ability to secrete silk from its feet , as a means of preventing them from falling to their death .
Spider silk is a viscous , proteinaceous liquid produced in , and extruded from , the spinneret ( left ) .
Most spider species have six spinnerets ( although some have four or two ) , located on the underside of the abdomen at the rear .
Each spinneret is multi-pored and can move independently of the others ; the muscles responsible for this movement also force the liquid silk to be extruded from the spinneret .
Because the liquid is under high pressure as it is extruded , and because the spider pulls on the silk during its extrusion , the liquid solidifies as it is secreted , producing a thread .
Spiders produce at least 8 different types of silk , with individual species usually producing a five or six types .
Spider silk is a natural high - performance fibre with mechanical properties which rivals , or betters , many man-made materials .
It is waterproof and elastic , and can be stronger than steel , although silk strength varies according to type .
All spiders use silk to produce a ‘ dragline ’ , which acts as a safety cord when they are moving .
Dragline silk is known to be five times stronger than steel ; it is also able to absorb five times the impact of Kevlar , the material used to make bulletproof vests , without breaking .
The structure of the silk secreted by the feet of tarantula resembles the attachment that other species use to anchor the dragline to a surface .
About half of the known 50,000 + species of spiders weave webs to catch prey .
An average web contains 20 - 30 metres of silk , but weighs less than 0.5 milligrams .
Some species use silk to catch prey in other ingenious ways .
For example , Bolas spiders ( of the species Mastophora , below right ) catch prey by dangling a silk thread with an adhesive blob on its end ; they also secrete a pheromone which attracts male Armyworm moths ( Spodoptera ) , which get stuck on the blob at the end of the silk thread .
Even more remarkable is the Ogre-eyed spider ( Dinopis guatemalensis ) , which has large , extremely sensitive eyes .
At meal times , the Ogre- eyed spider builds a silk platform from which it dangles .
It then weaves a silk net which it holds open between its legs .
When an insect crawls underneath it , the spider drops the silk web , entangling its prey .
The trapped insect is then pulled up and eaten .
The Ogre-eyed spider can even detect the vibrations created by insects flying nearby , and throw the net into the air to catch them .
Some spiders can also use silk to fly .
By weaving a length of silk during strong winds , spiders can be lifted upinto the air and transported long distances .
Spiders have been observed 1,500 km from land and 4,500 above sea level !
Hawaii is believed to have been originally populated by spiders who ‘ flew ’ over to the island in this way .
Spider brains & spider senses
The body of a spider is divided into two parts , called the cephalothorax ( or prosoma ) and abdomen .
The spider ’s central nervous system ( below ) , which consists of a single mass of tissue typically containing about 100,000 cells , is located entirely within the cephalothorax .
The central nervous system takes up most of the cephalothorax body cavity , and is separated into two by the oesophagus .
The supraesophageal region is devoted to vision , while the subesophageal region contains fused ganglia , from which project motor neurons that innervate the limbs .
The sense of vision varies greatly depending on the type of spider and the ecological niche it inhabits .
Cave spiders , for example , live in the dark and have little or no sight , depending instead on mechanoreception , whereas spiders that do not use webs to catch prey , such as jumping spiders ( Salticidae ) , wolf spiders ( Lycosidae ) and lynx spiders ( Oxyopidae ) , have an acute sense of vision .
In these species , vision is well developed ; the jumping spider is known to see in colour , for example , and its vision is thought to be almost as good as that of humans .
From Foelix ( 1996 )
For most types of spider , mechanoreception is the most important sense .
It is this sense that guides many aspects of arachnid behaviour .
It enables a spider to detect the vibrations caused by the presence of an insect which is has been caught in its web or is crawling near its nest .
It enables the Ogre-eyed spider to detect the air movements produced by insects flying overhead .
Mechanoreception also enables spiders to localize the source of a vibration .
Several types of mechanosensory organs contain mechanoreceptor neurons and enable spiders to detect vibrations and air movements .
One type of mechanosensory organ , consisting of large tactile hairs , is shown on the left .
Trichobothria are fine , smaller hairs which protrude vertically from their sockets and are particulary sensitive to currents of air and low frequency vibrations .
Lyriform slit sense organs , or sensilla , are found on the exoskeleton , movements of which they are responsive to ; they consist of a slit , flanked by puckered ‘ lips ’ on either side , in the surface of the cuticle .
The outer part of the groove contains lymph , and there is an opening in its centre containing a dendrite , which extends down through the outer layers of the cuticle .
Movement of the exoskeleton causes compression of the slit , resulting in movements of the lymph which deforms the dendrite and makes it generate action potentials .
Sensilla can be found on their own but usually occur in small groups organized in parallel rows .
They are also found around the spinneret , where they provide sensory information for the nervous control of silk secretion .
Mechanoreceptors are transducers – that is , they convert tactile stimuli into electrical signals .
Mechanical vibrations cause a deflection of bristles on the surface of of the large tactile hairs .
The action potentials produced by the mechanosensory organs are transmitted to large interneurons .
In the case of the whip spider , each leg contains several of these interneurons , each of which receives sensory inputs from up to 1,500 bristles on the surface of the leg .
These interneurons in turn transmit signals to the axon of a giant neuron , which carries the sensory information to the spider ’s brain .
Neurotransmission at peripheral synapses is mediated by octopamine and GABA , and probably other transmitters .
Arachnids are the only invertebrates to have synapses outside of the central nervous system .
The presence of these synapses suggests that much information processing takes place in the periphery .

If anyone happens to know whether any of these circumstances have since changed , and some probably have , they 're welcome to inform me .
I might or might not update this page to mention the fact .
But I 'm not especially itching to rejoin even if they have .
I just do n't see the point .
What is the ACM ?
The ACM , for those who do n't know , is the Association for Computing Machinery .
It 's a professional organization that many computer professionals join .
Why I 'm not an ACM Member
I was once an ACM member .
But I long ago renounced my membership and am now happy to have nothing to do with the organization .
Since you ’re reading this , I assume you are asking “ Why ? ”
Well , the short answer is this :
The ACM made me sign an ethics pledge to become a member , and I felt my obligations under that pledge required me to disassociate myself with ACM itself because I personally feel many of its practices are unethical .
This page discusses my reasons .
This is all just my personal opinion .
Unpaid Content
Sometimes things are not what they seem .
I used to think Disneyland was a theme park that happened to sell souvenirs .
I now , more cynically , think it 's a curio shop with a " hook " to get you to come visit — rides .
At least in that case , though , what you see is what you get .
There are some publishing houses that are not that way , however , and ACM is key among them .
I no longer view ACM as an organization of scientists who happen to have a way of publishing , but rather as a publishing house that has a clever way of making scientists think they should buy from it ... and an even more clever way of generating free content .
It " allows " aspiring authors ( who are young , ill - organized , and basically do n't know any better ) to publish their articles for free .
This is a windfall for ACM , which does n't have to pay for content in the many magazines it sells .
Further , in exchange for the " privilege " of not being paid for their work , authors are required to mark their articles as " free for copying " .
This is absurd .
They are lucky to have free content at all — they should n't be imposing additional restrictions beyond those necessary to do the publication .
Authors who want to , and who have a submission of sufficient value , should be able to charge money for copies in order to offset what ACM did n't pay them for the original article .
But the final straw is that ACM then charges authors for a subscription to the journal in question in order to obtain a printed copy of what they wrote .
I wrote a regular column , Parenthetically Speaking in its now - defunct Lisp Pointers magazine , for ACM .
I was not paid for that .
ACM charged subscribers , but I never saw a dime of it .
I even had to subscribe to the magazine in order to see myself in print .
Eventually , I decided , enough was enough .
Foonote 2009 : A more modern practice is to require authors to sign over not just a right of use to ACM , but in fact the entire copyright .
The ACM agrees to grant back certain rights , but if they think that 's sufficient , I do n't see why merely receiving certain rights would not be sufficient in the other direction .
Conference Discounts
ACM seeks to acquire members against their will by bankrolling conferences and then charging non-members a higher rate .
The difference in the rate is sometimes more than the price of becoming a member .
That means there is an active tax on being a non-member .
Footnote 2009 : Lately the discrepancy between member and non-member pricing seems smaller than I remember it being .
Nevertheless , I have still been asked to pay to register for a conference at which I was both on the program committee and asked to be part of the program .
For example , as fun as it would have been to attend the 50th anniversary of Lisp event , co-located with the ACM - sponsored OOPSLA’08 conference .
I had decided that given the US economic situation and given my other commitments to work and family , I could not afford to attend .
But then I was invited to come and be a speaker at the event and was told that my travel and airfare would be paid .
This may seem like a generous gesture , but it was still a lot of work for me to prepare , and overall did not break even monetarily .
It cost me a lot of preparation time for the talk , and later many whole days of work putting together a write - up of the talk for ACM publication ; the ACM will see revenue from that , reimbursing them , and I will not .
It was by no means a free gift .
And yet with all of that , ACM policy required organizers of the Lisp event to register me in the OOPSLA conference , a conference I did not attend , in order that I be allowed to speak .
I even volunteered not to attend any part of the Lisp50 event other than my own talk and was told I would still have to register uselessly for the ACM event if I were to be allowed to give the free talk that the ACM would charge money for , even not giving me any of the money .
I did n't need this event to make money for me , but the ACM needed me to help it make money — and it still insisted on charging me for the privilege of helping it .
Now for the International Lisp Conference I have participated on the conference committee , spending quite a number of hours reading over my Christmas vacation reading papers so that there could be a useful program .
Often in recent years I have done this for workshops that have been too far away to attend .
I do n't ask for compensation for that .
But this workshop is close enough that I wo n't have to pay travel to attend .
And I am due to be on a panel of speakers at the workshop .
And yet , I received this notice from the conference organizer : I have been asked to send this reminder to all authors :
If you are attending the 2009 International Lisp Conference , whether as a presenter or not , then you do need to register for the conference .
You can register online at [...]
Note in particular that it does not say “ If you are speaking , you will be allowed as a courtesy to attend free only for the day on which you speak . ”
It also does not even say “ If you are speaking , you will be allowed to enter from the rear door and do just your talk and then to exit without talking to anyone after .
If you want more than that , you 'll pay like everyone else . ”
Rather , it says that if you want to speak at all , you 'll register .
And the registration form offers no special price for anyone who 's speaking .
The assumption is perhaps that you work for some company or educational institution that would be happy to see you speak , and to pay for the privilege of having you there .
But that involves a lot of assumptions .
Some schools may not have such money , and certainly some companies may not .
But people often write about things on their own time these days , not necessarily for their employer .
Generous offers are often made by conference organizers to help people who are in dire financial situations to work around these policies .
But this involves the indignity of exposing one 's financial situation to scrutiny and it still endorses the basic notion that it is moral and ethical for an organization to be asking volunteer / contributed work of others , taking in money itself , and charging the volunteer for the privilege of contributing .
For an organization that requires ethics of its members , I find that more than a bit inappropriate .
Dead Trees
The ACM substantially delayed its entry into the world of e-communication , I think because its primary business is cutting down trees ( i.e. , publishing ) .
At the time I exited the organization , I had gone years asking for a paperless membership , but was unable to obtain one .
( I think they 've partly corrected this problem since , although I still think you can't get a CACMless membership . )
CACMless memberships impossible
I suspect because it makes money advertising and wants to claim a large base , ACM requires subscribing to CACM as part of membership .
I did n't want CACM .
I did n't read it .
I do n't like the wasted paper on my behalf .
I felt it was both unethical of them to claim me as a subscriber and unreasonable of them to charge me money for the subscription .
Sleazy invoicing
ACM used to routinely request certain kinds of " volunteered " contributions and / or subscriptions on my annual invoicing .
They would do this by adding the things they wanted me to do ( without my requesting it ) and make me have to line out the items I did n't want .
Anyone not paying careful attention might accidentally pay the higher amount thinking they were just paying for their normal annual load , and not realizing that ACM was continually jacking up their normal contribution .
I repeatedly asked that this not be done and but could not seem to affect it .
For all of these reasons , I am proud to no longer be an ACM member .
I do not recommend the organization to others .
The use of LSD in psychotherapy is to be studied for the first time in 35 years
The use of LSD ( d- lysergic acid diethylamide ) in psychotherapy is to be studied for the first time in 35 years .
A trial to determine whether patients with anxiety relating to advanced - stage illnesses can be safely given LSD - assisted psychotherapy and whether it improves their anxiety symptoms has been approved by a Swiss ethics committee .
The trial will be a randomised , active placebo controlled double - blind dose - response , Phase II pilot study with 12 subjects , conducted in Switzerland by Peter Gasser , psychiatrist , psychotherapist and president of the Swiss Medical Association for Psycholytic Therapy .
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( Maps ) in the US is sponsoring the study as part of its goal for LSD to be available for prescription use by trained and licensed psychiatrists and psychotherapists in regulated clinics .
The organisation is donating at least $ 50 000 of the estimated $ 150 000 cost and plans to raise the remainder .
Gasser hopes to start the trial by the end of the year and anticipates it will last about two years .
Before he can begin , approval is also needed from SwissMedic , the Swiss drug regulation authority .
’ We have had informal conversations with officials within SwissMedic , ’ said Rick Doblin , president of Maps , ’ and believe that SwissMedic will approve a study that has already obtained approval from a Swiss ethics committee . ’
He expects to get approval before the end of the summer .
The trial will restart research that was stopped by regulatory agencies around the world in the early 1970s , mainly because of political concerns and in response to large - scale use and abuse of LSD at the time .
LSD is classified as a psychedelic drug or hallucinogen .
It produces sometimes intense changes in perception , cognition and emotion that last for up to 12 hours .
Previous clinical research and anecdotal reports suggest it could be used to treat psychiatric conditions that emerge after a life - threatening illness is diagnosed .
Reports cite changes in perceptions of the self and the world , including ego dissolution , feelings of transcendence or transformation , and decreased distress that may help people grappling with physical deterioration and impending death .
While LSD can produce both negative and positive emotions , the researchers hypothesise that the combination of LSD within a therapeutic setting will reduce anxiety afterwards .

A dose of dirt could be the best medicine for preventing allergies in kids who 've never had them .
While avoiding excessive contact with germs can help prevent the spread of infections , going overboard with cleanliness could be at least partly responsible for an increase in allergies among children , mounting research suggests .
" We ’ve developed a cleanlier lifestyle , and our bodies no longer need to fight germs as much as they did in the past , " said Marc McMorris , a pediatric allergist at the University of Michigan Health System .
" As a result , the immune system has shifted away from fighting infection to developing more allergic tendencies . "
More than 50 percent of Americans ages 6 to 59 years are sensitive to at least one allergen , according to a national survey conducted from 1988 to 1994 by the National Institutes of Health .
That 's two to five times higher than rates found in a previous 1976 to 1980 survey .
Recent research has found evidence for the so - called hygiene hypothesis , which explains how more sterile environments can lead to higher rates of illness .
For instance , scientists in Germany recently found children exposed to farm animals ( and the associated bacteria and other microbes hiding out there ) were about half as likely as other children to develop the autoimmune illness Crohn 's disease .
More animal helpers
Allergies are a reaction by the body 's immune system to foreign , yet generally innocuous , substances , including pollen , mold , animal dander , dust and certain foods that it deems harmful .
If your immune system has never or rarely detected even the natural background level of such substances , it can go haywire when contact does occur .
" Allergies are on the rise because our society has changed the way we live , " McMorris said , adding that " as a result , people with allergies are having children with others who have allergies , which in turn creates a natural increase in the prevalence of allergies in our society . ”
In addition to exposure to farm animals , dogs and cats kept as pets could also help children avoid developing allergies .
A study published in a 2002 issue of JAMA concluded that children living in a house with two or more dogs or cats during their first year of life were much less likely to develop allergic diseases compared with children raised without pets .
" Epidemiology would suggest if there are 10 cats in the homes , [ kids ] are less likely to develop allergies , " said Bruce Bochner , director of the Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine .
More research is needed , however , to pin down exactly what 's going on .
Bochner said one flaw with these studies is that homes with pet-allergic kids are not likely to have lots of pets .
The dirty truth
From the constant use of anti-bacterial soap for dish - and hand - washing to air - tight seals around doors and windows , some modern homes have become shrines to hygiene .
Add vaccinations and antibiotics to the mix and the body 's immune system can get too much artificial reprieve from nature .
" The natural immune system does not have as much to do as it did 50 years ago , because we 've increased our efforts to protect our children from dirt and germs , " McMorris said in a statement released this month .
Plus , the atrophy of family size means children get exposed to fewer germs than the more kid -filled homes of yesteryear .
Families with three or more children , a dynamic that was common decades ago , tend to have fewer allergies as they are exposed to more bacteria - and virus - harboring siblings , McMorris said .
The battle against bugs does n't have to come to an end , but finding a balance between healthy living and clean living is a must , scientists advise , although Bochner notes the jury is still out on the over - exposure approach .
" We do n't know at this point whether we should be exposing people to lots of allergens at an early age and get them tolerant [ or not ] , " Bochner said in a telephone interview .
" All we really know is once you become allergic , since exposure triggers symptoms , the best way to deal with that is to reduce your exposure . "
McMorris says we 've gone too far though with germ - avoidance .
" I do n't think we should put kids in a bubble , " McMorris told LiveScience .
At the end of the day , he said , parents should just let kids be kids .
Zaki points us to the phenomenon of the Dabbawalla .
These men deliver thousands of lunches every single day in Mumbai … from the person ’s home to their office , hot and fresh .
The reported error rate is one in six million .
How is this possible ?
How do you create and run a service with thousand of employees , no technology and a poorly - educated workforce and have better than six sigma quality ?
Simple : the dabbawallas know their customers .
If they rotated the people around , it would never work .
There ’s trust , and along with the trust is responsibility .
By creating a flat organization and building relationships , the system even survives monsoon season .
Many – particularly on this site - argue that economics has little that is intelligent to say about peak oil .
Yet the very definition of economics is the study of scarcity , and in particular , the study of the efficient allocation of scarce resources .
What more relevant subject could there be for studying the effects of peak oil ?
Sceptics rightly point out that this bell has been rung before .
In the mid 1980s , world oil reserves were forecast to last about 20 years ; and yet here we are in 2007 , with near record production levels .
Historically , we have always found new sources of oil – in Alaska , in the North Sea , in the Gulf of Mexico , and off the coast of Africa – to satisfy our addiction .
There are prospects in the future too : there may well be ( very substantial ) new discoveries in the Middle East , ultra - deepwater drilling holds promise , as does the development of new areas such as the South Atlantic , and increased enhanced oil recovery will certainly play a role .
This misses the point : finding new oil reserves may push out peak production , but it does not invalidate the concept .
Our planet does not contain an unlimited amount of oil .
The world ’s oil supplies are not unlimited .
Unless the abiogenic theory of oil is correct , then reserves will one - day dwindle , and production will decline .
New barrels cannot be “ magic -ed ” by some trick of economics .
Extraction of any fossil fuel extraction is limited .
Peak oil is inevitable .
Of course , there is debate about when production hits its highs ; it may have already happened , perhaps it will come in the next few years , and just possibly , it will be in 2020 or later .
But make no mistake about it , we are not endowed with infinite amounts of the stuff .
This is the second ( the first can be found here ) in a series of guest posts by Robert Smithson , a portfolio manager at a London based investment fund .
Over the past fifty years , mankind has prospected for and found enormous quantities of oil .
These discoveries and their development have relentlessly pushed the oil supply curve to the right .
That is , at any given price point , more oil will be supplied .
Simultaneously , we have seen economic growth ; people have become richer , and with more money comes greater levels of demand for oil ( petrol for their new cars , kerosene to fly them to their second homes in Florida or the South of France ) .
The demand curve has also been pushed to the right .
The result is that – until the last few years – we have seen constantly rising oil supply and demand , while pricing has remained broadly stable in real - terms .
This process appears to have broken down in the last few years .
Oil prices have risen , while the quantity supplied has not .
In other words , the demand curve has moved to the right , while the supply curve has stayed broadly in the same place .
Economic theory suggests this should lead to greater investment in prospecting and development .
Yet persistently high oil prices – by historical standards – have not led to any increase in capacity .
There are a number of reasons why this might be : suppliers might be waiting for evidence that the demand curve has moved sustainably to the right ( those who invested in oil shale projects in the 1970s did poorly ) , or projects might simply take long - periods before new oil comes to market ( the Sakhalin II project was signed in 1996 for instance ) .
Alternatively , we may be at or approaching a peak in global oil production .
This may be Hubbert ’s Peak .
Are We There Yet ?
Oil watchers tend to discount the evidence of the market , often accusing it of being “ blind ” .
But they would do well to keep an eye on one of the more interesting indicators , the oil forward curve .
This measures what people will pay for a barrel of oil to be delivered at various points in the future .
These forwards are the only way to bet on long - term movements in the price oil .
The two charts below show forward pricing for oil ( NYMEX ) futures , and are taken from Bloomberg :
In August 2002 , the markets forecast oil prices would fall , and keep on falling .
You could buy oil for August 2007 delivery for under $ 23 a barrel .
That would have been quite a trade .
The current chart is more interesting ; it sees oil prices trough at the end of 2010 and then begin to rise .
For the first time in all my experience in looking at oil forward curves , there is a long - term upward bias .
As recently as February of this year , the long - term curve pointed downward .
These charts do not , of course , show that peak oil has been reached .
( The market was woefully wrong in August 2002 , so its predicative power should not be over - stated . )
What they do show is that the market does not expect new sources of oil – be they from oil sands , or from ultra - deepwater – to move the supply curve sufficiently to the right to mitigate rising demand from China and India .
In other words , the market is forecasting a period when oil becomes less abundant .
What Does it Mean ?
Let us be bold : let us assume that the market is not only right that oil will become less abundant , but that overall supplies will start falling .
( This is not an unreasonable assumption : after all , production in Mexico , in the US and in North Sea is declining . )
What does this mean ?
Well , firstly , it does not mean oil stops being pumped !
On the contrary , it merely means that the supply curve stops moving to the right .
For any given price there will be less oil supplied .
In the short - term , demand curves will not change : the pressures from economic growth in India , China and the like will not have abated .
In other words , prices will rise .
But they will not spike due to some sudden “ realization ” , because the price dynamics have not fundamentally changed .
Realization means nothing to the spot price of oil .
That price will continue be the level which causes ( slightly diminished ) supply and demand to meet .
( The argument that speculators would or could use large underground “ reservoirs ” to store oil is spurious : the cost of doing so , once one includes the capital charge for owning the oil , would be enormously prohibitive .
If you wanted to bet on rising longer - term oil prices , you ’d simply buy the 2012 futures . )
The other thing worth noting is that the decline in total oil volumes produced suggested by Peak Oil is relatively modest , at least initially .
The chart reproduced below is from Hubbert ’s 1956 Paper “ Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels ” , and suggests that production will only have fallen 20 - 25 % by 2030 ( although it does fall off more steeply after that ) .
As we described in the reaction of the world to the 1970s oil shocks , increased awareness of higher long - term oil prices , will cause the demand curve will change .
Before going into the details , let us not forget that between 1973 and 1985 ( just 12 years ) , world per capita oil consumption fell from 5.45 to 4.40 – a 19 % reduction , a period during which world GDP still increased at a 2 % + rate .
The Price Elasticity of Oil
There is still a great deal of skepticism about whether demand for oil is price elastic .
Much is written about “ Minimum Operating Levels ” of oil , below which a modern economy simply cannot function ; and while there may be a minimum level of oil required – although I suspect there is actually more of a minimum level of energy – it is well below current levels , particularly for developed economies like the US .
This can be demonstrated by looking at the “ oil intensity ” of various developed nations .
According to the CIA World Factbook , the United States currently uses 68.8 barrels of oil a day per 1,000 people .
This compares to 43.8 in Japan , 32.2 in Germany , and 30.1 in the UK .
While some of this might be explained by the greater distances people have to traverse in the US , it can hardly be the only reason - after all , there are large distances to cover across Europe .
The point of this data is that the US and Canada are anomalies : their economies use more oil per person , and more per unit of GDP than comparable countries .
There is ample opportunity to become more energy efficient without causing significant economic damage .
The other interesting piece of the puzzle is the driver of oil usage .
Looking at countries with similar GDPs and population densities , but different oil per capita oil consumption , it is clear that gasoline pump prices are the largest determinant of oil usage .
In other words , where the price of oil ( gasoline ) is high , consumers use less .
And this difference in consumption ( which can be in the order of 40 - 50 % ) has little to no effect on GDP .
The following tables ( based on 2004 data ) illustrate this :
Developed Countries
Price per Litre Oil Consumption per Person
UK 156 30.1
Germany 146 32.2
Spain 121 38.9
Ireland 129 44.4
Greece 114 40.7
US 49 68.8
Developing Countries
Morocco 110 5.0
Tunisia 68 8.7
Russia 55 17.7
Saudi Arabia 24 66.8
Kuwait 21 133.7
( There are some countries – although surprisingly few - which clearly do not fall into this pattern :
The Netherlands has some of the highest petrol prices in the world , but also has high per-capita oil “ consumption ” .
This is due to the Port of Rotterdam , and its associated petrochemical industries . )
For those who think these numbers are somehow cherry - picked , or contrived , the chart below tells the tale in a different way .
On the x-axis is the GDP at purchasing - power parity created by each barrel of oil , and on the y - axis is retail price of gasoline ( US$ , March 2005 ) .
Countries where gasoline is more expensive , use it more efficiently .
Or , to put it another way , consumption reduces surprisingly efficiently in response to higher prices .
The evidence is clear : people respond to higher prices of petroleum products with reduced consumption , and this reduction does not necessarily result in economic catastrophe .
Consumers are rational ; their consumption of oil depends on its price .
And oil products are surprisingly price elastic – at least over long - periods .
Reducing world oil consumption by 25 % in the next 25 years , with the price mechanism as the driver , can and will happen .
It may not be pleasant , and it may well result in lower economic growth and higher unemployment , but it will not be a disaster .
The Energy Supply Curve
Do we really demand oil ?
Or do we really demand usable energy ?
Oil is not the only source of energy in the world .
There are alternatives .
Forty years ago , oil was commonly used to generate electricity .
Today , outside oil exporting countries and the occasional peaking power plant , it is virtually unknown .
It is just not economically efficient to generate electricity from oil .
Electricity generators are rational consumers : when the price of one input got too high , they switched to another .
Of course , this happened over a long - time , but the impact was relatively modest .
When we think of oil as something unique and irreplaceable , we make a great mistake .
Oil is just a store of calories , in the form of long chain hydrocarbons .
When it is burnt , it releases those calories as heat , which can be harnessed to turn a turbine for electricity , move a car , or fly a plane .
But it is by no means the only store of calories .
Even just taking other hydrocarbons ( so - called fossil fuels ) , there are supplies of coal , tar , oil sands , methane , gas hydrates , and other gases .
The total calorific value of these supplies outweighs that held in traditional crude oil .
In addition , there are alternative energy technologies : wind , biomass , geothermal , nuclear , solar .
Mankind can extract calories from each of these , and in the case of the latter two , there is the possibility of almost limitless supplies of energy .
We think of the oil market as monolithic , as standing on its own .
It 's not .
Oil is just an incredibly convenient source of calorific energy .
It has an infrastructure already in place , and a reasonably efficient mechanism ( the internal combustion engine ) for translating its energy into motion .
If the oil price exceeds the price of alternatives ( and it already has in baseload electricity generation ) , then alternatives will substitute it .
The long - term price of oil is determined by the price of alternative energy supplies .
That said , this convenience should not be underestimated .
In terms of energy density , there is nothing – except nuclear power - to match oil products .
Gasoline has 47 m joules of energy per kilogram , and 35 m per litre .
Even the best batteries are an order of magnitude worse .
( Interestingly , liquid hydrogen has fairly good characteristics from an energy density perspective , and can be generated – albeit not particularly efficiently – from electricity .
This is why there is so much focus on hydrogen power – whether fuel cells or a straight hydrogen burning engine .
There is , of course , no infrastructure in place for the distribution of hydrogen . )
Living in an Oil Constrained World
According to forecasts from the Energy Information Administration , world consumption of oil will rise from a little over 150 quadrillion BTUs in 2003 to almost 250 quadrillion in 2030 .
While anything is possible , this would require extraordinary discoveries ; indeed even assuming continued improvements in recovery rates , the world would need to discover the equivalent of all the oil extracted ever in the next 20 years .
Good luck .
That wo n’t happen .
We ’re going to live in a more oil constrained world .
But we ’re also going to discover that this is n’t the end of the world .
These articles have focused on demand destruction caused by higher prices ; perhaps it is more helpful to think in terms of more efficient use of energy .
People will drive less .
When they do drive , they will use more fuel efficient cars .
100 miles per gallon is not unachievable .
More energy will be consumed from the grid ( where nuclear will make up an ever greater share of generation ) .
When we go off - grid , we ’ll use batteries more , and fuel oil less .
Public transport – particularly buses and trains - will look better value , while airlines will look for more fuel efficient ways of flying .
( Ultra - high bypass engines – aka Propfans – which have 20 - 30 % fuel savings over traditional jet engines may enter widespread use as fuel efficiency becomes more important than speed . )
Even so , the price of air travel , which has been on a downward curve for the last quarter century , looks set to rise .
People will respond by traveling less .
Consumers will react in predictable ways .
If getting to out of town shopping malls is difficult , they will instead head into towns for their consumer goods .
Likewise , businesses in cities will have an advantage ( it is easy to commute into cities by public transport ) .
Indeed , the demise of the high street is mostly the consequence of cheap personal transportation ; i.e. the car .
So Cities will look more like they did 70 years ago , with central areas preferred over suburbs .
We will become more reliant on telecommunications networks , and the economy will become more service focused .
It is fortuitous that video conferencing and the Internet are maturing and improving at the same time our oil supplies are beginning to dwindle .
We will need to spend on grid infrastructure : on HVDC lines to reduce transmission losses .
There will be investment in nuclear power stations , with commercial fast breeder reactors , and a move from Uranium and towards Thorium .
Biofuels , from sugarcane , will become more prevalent .
There may be commercial algae farms in the next decade .
Oil will not stop flowing just because peak oil has been reached .
We are fortunate that the downward curve of production will probably be as gentle as the upward one .
Even in a hundred years time there will probably be commercial production ; it will just be an irrelevancy as a percentage of global energy usage .
We are given an awful lot of time to adapt to an oil constrained world .
More important that what will happen when we pass peak oil is what will not happen : there will be no queues at the gas station ( why should they : we have rationing by price ) , the electrical and water networks will not cease to function ( they were there before we got our present oil dependence ) , and some people will continue to buy gas guzzling SUVs and Ferarris ( there will just be very few of them , and they ’ll pay extraordinary sums for the privilege ) .
The government will not collapse .
Democracy will not come to an end .
Economic growth will not end .
Our lives will not look so very different to how they do : or at least they ’ll look no odder than our lives would to those who grew up two generations ago – in an age before the automobile was ubiquitous .
Economics does not provide an answer to declining oil supplies .
Its models try and explain – however imperfectly – how people will react to a scarce commodity becoming scarcer .
The price mechanism is a powerful thing : it forces people to prioritize and choose , and it performs a rationing system .
This is not to say a transition away from oil as a primary energy source will be painless .
But we must avoid the trap of thinking there are no alternatives , and we must avoid the conceit of thinking these alternatives are costless or easy .
There used to be four common life phases : childhood , adolescence , adulthood and old age .
Now , there are at least six : childhood , adolescence , odyssey , adulthood , active retirement and old age .
Of the new ones , the least understood is odyssey , the decade of wandering that frequently occurs between adolescence and adulthood .
During this decade , 20 - somethings go to school and take breaks from school .
They live with friends and they live at home .
They fall in and out of love .
They try one career and then try another .
Their parents grow increasingly anxious .
These parents understand that there ’s bound to be a transition phase between student life and adult life .
But when they look at their own grown children , they see the transition stretching five years , seven and beyond .
The parents do n’t even detect a clear sense of direction in their children ’s lives .
They look at them and see the things that are being delayed .
They see that people in this age bracket are delaying marriage .
They ’re delaying having children .
They ’re delaying permanent employment .
People who were born before 1964 tend to define adulthood by certain accomplishments — moving away from home , becoming financially independent , getting married and starting a family .
TAIPEI , Oct 16 ( Reuters ) - Taiwan 's Asustek 2357 .
TW said on Tuesday it will sell its new low - cost laptop PCs to consumers for as little as T$ 7,999 ( $ 245 ) apiece , as it takes aim at more casual users in developed markets .
The new line of notebooks , called Eee PCs , will retail from T$ 7,999 to T$ 13,888 , with Asustek targeting women and children for consumer sales , President Jonathan Tsang said at an event to launch the new line .
In developing markets , the company will target larger buyers such as governments and educational organisations , selling the Eee PCs for as little as US $ 199 apiece .
“ Because these are coming out relatively late , we expect to ship 200,000 this year , ” he said .
“ That should be reasonable .
Next year we ’re going to ship over 3 million units . ”
The new line of PCs will initially be available in English and classical Chinese versions , the latter for sale in Taiwan .
Versions in simplified Chinese , which is used in China , and French , German and Italian , will follow .
In a significant development , Asustek said it would also offer a version of the ultra low - cost PCs with Microsoft's MSFT .
O Windows operating system , after initially saying that all the computers would carry the open - source , free Linux system .
Windows versions of the computer would cost about T$ 1,000 more than Linux versions , leading many to say that Microsoft had offered the Windows systems at a big discount from its usual price of T$ 2,000 to T$ 3,000 for mass buyers .
The Eee PCs will carry Asustek 's brand name , as the Taiwan firm seeks to follow in the footsteps of hometown rival Acer 2353 .
TW in trying to develop a globally recongised brand .
The firm is in the process of separating its branded business from its manufacturing business , the latter of which makes laptops for not only the Asustek line , but also major global vendors like Apple Inc AAPL.O and Dell Inc DELL.O .
Among the 7 million notebook PCs the company aims to ship this year , some 4.2 million laptops will carry its own name , up sharply from 2.7 million units last year .
Asustek Chairman Jonney
Shih said the company has high hopes for the Eee PC line , which could possibly make up as much as 20 percent of the global market for laptop PC sales by 2010 .

It seems that for many of us life is such that we have become so hungry for some levity in our lives that we will take even vulgarity as humor and call it good ... if that is all we can get [ Isa. 5:20 ] .
And that is all we get in The Simpsons Movie -- bizarre , empty vulgarity that fogs the mind and obscures wholesomeness , painting immoral as amoral .
[ Eph. 5:4 ]
These " Babylonians " , these destroyers from within are here to stay [ Jer. 37:9 ] as long as we continue [ Ps. 12:8 ] to partake of their delicacies [ Ps. 141:4 ] .
Maybe our acceptance of such vulgarity is because " We have become so drugged by the narcotics of extremes in and as entertainment that what once was morally unacceptable has become morally invisible : what was once immoral is now amoral . "
--TC
For those of you who have been with us for years , you know that the CAP analysis model treats animated behaviors as influential as onscreen behaviors by live actors / actresses if the behaviors demonstrated by the animated characters may reasonably be duplicated by or subjected to a child .
With that in mind , The Simpsons Movie may be best described as pediatric pornography since it includes much male adolescent nudity including full frontal nudity .
The Simpsons Movie is fully equivalent to most R- rated films in magnitude or influence envelope in five of the six CAP investigation areas .
I guess that makes it a " kiddie R " .
I am not going to " dignify " this film with a commentary of its plot or story .
The " plot / story " was little more than a vehicle to transport the vulgarity to you : a device to enable imparting filth .
I should think reputable environmentalists would be offended by being associated with this film by being part of the target of it .
With a final score of 15 out of 100 , I have nothing good to say about any of the parts that just might have a positive statement ( as most films do ) because , however few they are , positive elements are so deeply embedded in animated manure they are nearly invisible .
The immoral screaming of this film drowns out the gossamer whispers of good .
The caliber of this film could also be compared to filling a theater auditorium with manure two inches deep then sprinkling a drop or two of perfume in three of four places .
While sitting in your chair are you going to be able to smell the perfume ?
Even if you are sitting next to where the perfume landed ?
Wanton Violence / Crime ( W )
The violence / crime content of this film was intense or dense enough to cause loss of all the starting 100 points in this investigation area , leaving an area score of zero .
Three drowning deaths .
Eye impalement with the claw of a claw hammer .
A father choking a child .
Gunfire to kill .
Arrow impalement .
A hanging staging .
More .
[ Prov. 16:29 ]
Plus a baby - killing video game .
Impudence / Hate ( I )
In addition to the obligatory uses of profanity [ Col. 3:8 ] , The Simpsons Movie presented many matters of family friction and " shock value " distortions of right : the son firing pellets at the father ; the father daring the son to skateboard nude ; the mother telling the daughter that since she is female she is free to hold on to anger forever ; the father calling the daughter " an accident " ; more .
[ Luke 17:2 ]
This investigation area found enough ignominy to cause the loss of all but 9 of its starting 100 points .
Sexual Immorality ( S )
Sexual immorality content in this film not only presented things such as posterior cleavage , crotch hit , a homosexual kiss , masturbation innuendo , implied intercourse , a female pointing the direction to go by swinging her breasts and , of course , characters in underwear plus self - touching , this film portrayed long sequences of full adolescent nudity .
Once with anatomically correct full frontal nudity centered on the groin .
While the French fry scene in the trailers was there , a scene without the French fry was also there . [ 1 John 2:26 , 1 Ths .
4:1 - 3 , Rev. 22:15 ]
The content of the film in this investigation area also caused the loss of all its starting 100 points .
Drugs / Alcohol ( D )
Mainly because of issues of adolescent intoxication and addiction to alcohol , this film earned the lowest possible score ( zero out of 100 ) in this investigation area .
And because of the vulnerability of the target age stratum , I am going to make a big deal of the alcohol - related content of The Simpsons Movie .
The drinking and drunkenness are of significant danger in this film suggested by the MPAA as being fit for the middle school age stratum .
A study by the American College of Physicians ( ACP ) revealed that adolescent exposure to drinking and smoking in and as entertainment leads to undeniable abuse of alcohol among underage kids .
The finding entitled Relation Between Parental Restrictions on Movies and Adolescent Use of Tobacco and Alcohol reports that of 4544 youths from grades 5 through 8 of fifteen Vermont and New Hampshire middle schools ( 90 % were under fourteen years old ) only 16 % were completely restricted from viewing R- rated movies .
The researchers selected R-rated movies because they assumed R- rated movies typically present more drinking than movies of other classifications .
This assumption is no longer true .
The researchers were not aware of the matter of " R - 13 " proven by this ministry ( see R - 13 ) and four years after us by Harvard University scientists ( see Harvard Agrees With Us ) .
The bottom line ?
The focus is the influence of adolescent exposure to drinking ( and smoking ) in and as entertainment is undeniable regardless of the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) classification .
Within the ACP study population , the prevalence of having tried alcohol without parental knowledge was
46 % for those with no restrictions
16 % for those with partial restrictions
four percent for those with complete restrictions .
Rather revealing of the influences of the entertainment industry would n't you say ?
And emboldening children to sin with drink in and as entertainment screams of violating Luke 17:2 .
Even the University of Connecticut corroborates our finding and that of the ACP .
[ Eph. 5:18 ]
I can add to the ACP study that reveals films which present drinking and drunkenness contribute to underage substance abuse .
I submit that it is not so much the presence of alcohol in films or the rating of the film (s ) that embolden youth to abuse it , but is rather the attitude portrayed : the attitude of freedom form authority , freedom form accountability and freedom for consequences .
PG - 13 and R - rated films , sometimes lesser rated films , are typically heavy with attitude .
Our report on this , ATTITUDE : In Perspective -- Investigation Area Scoring and Trend in CAP Entertainment Industry Investigations , Special Report -001 may provide more understanding of the point .
This investigation area also found enough content to cause the loss of all its starting 100 points .
Offense to God ( O )
Lo and behold !
Five points out of 100 !
That is the score earned due to content of this film in this investigation area .
While the use of God 's name in vain is often , once even with the four letter expletive [ Deut. 5:11 ] , as one character convulses on the floor another character fans through the pages of the Bible while desperately groaning " This book does n't have any answers . " [ 2 Tim. 3:16 ] Contempt for God , faith and the Scriptures were present throughout .
[ Ps. 31:18 ]
Murder / Suicide ( M )
An impalement murder plus a video game murder and a personified robot graphically committing suicide by gunfire to the head with the head contents spewing probably should have caused the Murder / Suicide score to be lower , but the analysis model will not let me inject any of my subjective opinions into the scoring distribution .
What was the MPAA thinking !?

Eph. 5:4
Nor should there be obscenity , foolish talk or coarse joking , which are out of place , but rather thanksgiving .
Ps. 141:4
Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil , to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers ; let me not eat of their delicacies .
Prov. 16:29
A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good .
[ As a bad influence does not have to be real to influence badly , a " violent man " does not have to be real to influence violently .
It took years for the American professional health agencies to finally understand what God was telling them .

But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these : anger , rage , malice , slander ( injurious speech ) , and filthy language [ aischrologia : foul speaking , low and obscene speech ] from your lips .
1 John 2:26
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
[ " These things I have written " includes lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes from 1 John 2:16 .
An example of " them that seduce you " includes they who demonstrate sexual sin , however innocuous it may seem , in and as entertainment which can " seduce " the viewer , can lead one astray by desensitizing one and emboldening him / her to believe sexually immoral deeds , thoughts and display are acceptable OR by eroding one 's natural inhibition against sexually immoral deeds and thoughts .
And anything in and as entertainment that draws the viewer 's attention to sexuality , sexual deeds , nudity and the private parts clothed or not , seen or not is sexual . ]
1 Ths .
4:1 - 3 Finally , brothers , we instructed you how to live in order to please God , as in fact you are living .
Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more .
For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
It is God 's will that you should be sanctified : that you should avoid sexual immorality ; ... Rev. 22:15 Outside [ of Heaven ] are the dogs , those [ unforgiven ] who practice magic arts , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
Eph. 5:18 Do not get drunk on wine , which leads to debauchery .
Instead , be filled with the Spirit .
[ Since " drunk " is methusko { meth - oos ' - ko} : to intoxicate ; make drunk ; to get drunk ; become intoxicated , " wine " can be any intoxicating substance including illegal drugs or abuse of prescription drugs .
The issue is do not abuse the body by intoxicating it .
Though it is not a sin to drink , it is a sin to get drunk OR to influence to get drunk OR to drink in defiance such as underage drinking .
Deut .
5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain : for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
[ Vain is shav' { shawv} : emptiness , nothingness , vanity , such as an expletive .
With or without the four letter expletive , the use of God 's name in any way other than respect , reverence or thoughtful discussion is in vain .
That includes the popular three syllable sentence with His name trailing it AND the misuse of Jesus ' name . ]

The wicked freely strut about [ e.g. , create progressively vile / offensive entertainment with impunity and no consequences and present it to younger and younger audiences every year ] when what is vile is honored among men [ when enough people continue to defend it , embrace it , enjoy it , want it , submit to it .

For there are certain men* crept in unawares [ secretly slipped in among us ] , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation [ whose condemnation was written about long ago ] , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness [ a license for immorality ] , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .

Now you ’ve worked a couple nights and you ’re starting to get comfy with the club and dancing naked .
But the more comfortable you get the more you see how much you have to learn .
You want to sell more dances , you want to learn to sell VIP ’s , and you still ca n’t figure out what to say when they ask what your boyfriend thinks of you doing this .
Let ’s talk about making money .
Now that you ’ve used that hit and run hustle for a few nights , I bet you ’re starting to get a better feel for who has money .
Soon you ’ll be able to smell it on them .
But now that you know how to do a basic hustle , start choosing your targets better and putting a little more into it .
Look for fat , middle aged guys wearing comfy shoes and a nice watch .
Approach slowly , and flirt with your eyes .
While you ’re talking to him keep that strong , sexy eye contact , puff your lips out a little , and run a hand softly up and down your leg or your other arm .
When you know he ’ll say yes run a couple fingers lightly up his arm or thigh tell him how much you ’d love to dance for him right now .
Once you ’ve got him back there , do n’t let him go .
Up sell him .
After your lap dance say “ I would have so much more fun in the VIP / Champagne Room / whatever with you .
It ’s much more intimate , and we do n’t have to worry about time and bouncers .
Letâ€™s go . ”
If your club does n’t have anything to up sell , do n’t worry , just keep selling him more dances .
While you ’re making all that money , be sure to save some .
Someday you ’ll be too old to dance , or maybe you ’ll start hating it , or maybe you ’ll break your knee and not be able to work .
What then ?
Do you want to be stuck as a wage slave for the rest of your life , wistfully remembering the days when you made a full day ’s worth of minimum wage in two songs ?
You owe it to your future self to save some money now .
There are two Hobo Stripper Cash Stashing Formulas .
If you have debt you ’ll use the first , which goes like this : at the end of the night divide your money up into three equal piles .
One pile is for long term investment and retirement , one pile goes towards your debt , and one pile is for living on right now .
If you have no debt , use the second Hobo Stripper Cash Stashing Formula : two equal piles , one for retirement and one for living on .
Do n’t worry ; you ’ll still have plenty of money to live on , even if you only work intermittently like me .
For now , just stick your retirement money in an online savings account with high interest , like ingdirect.com or emigrantdirect.com .
It ’ll get the same interest it would in a CD , but I bet you can get better interest somewhere out there if you read some investment books .
Let ’s talk about boundaries .
Like I said before , you probably need to start out with very clear cut , set in stone boundaries .
Know what you will do and what you wo n’t do , and do n’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable .
Think about these things .
How do you feel about a guy sucking on your toes for an extra hundred bucks ?
Are you willing to let them play at almost touching your boobs in the Champagne Room ?
Maybe you work in an air dance club with no Champagne Room and you do n’t need to consider these things , but there are other things to be clear about .
Will you sit with a guy for free and let him tell you what you should be doing with your life ?
Will you talk about loving getting ass fucked to keep a guy in the Champagne Room for another hour ?
Boundaries are not what happen when you say no .
Boundaries are your own knowledge of yourself , of where you end and other people begin .
In a strip club you have total control , if you take it and even if you do n’t .
If you do something that traumatizes you , you are the only person you have to blame .
Do n’t abuse your own sexuality .
If your like most women in our culture you probably need to do some work on boundaries , which means you need to inhabit yourself very fully and very consciously .
Exercise is good for this .
Touching yourself is good for this , not just masturbation but consciously touching , stroking , and massaging your whole body .
When you consider a new situation or a new person , check in with your whole body .
How does your cunt feel about it ?
Is your tummy protesting ?
Move up slowly through your chakras ( or just your body , if you prefer ) and make sure you know exactly how you feel about it .
Practice .
It ’s important .
Then there ’s your stripper image .
There are archetypes of sexuality .
Cat woman , the nurturer , warrior princess , down home girl from the farm , blond haired Barbie , sexual priestess , retro pin-up girl , pale dark haired beauty , etc .
Pick one , or a couple , that suits you .
Try to shape your outfits and make - up around that archetype , and really tap into it when you work .
It makes a difference .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department 's inspector - general announced Wednesday he would recuse himself from decisions involving security contractor Blackwater , after admitting his brother serves as an adviser to the company .
A destroyed car sits at the location of the September 16 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad .
Howard Krongard already was under scrutiny by the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee , led by California Democrat Henry Waxman .
Waxman said Krongard 's oversight of construction of the nearly $ 600 million U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , Iraq , was conducted with " reckless incompetence , " and that he refused to pursue allegations of fraud and labor trafficking by contractor First Kuwaiti .
Republicans on the committee accused the Democratic majority of conducting a " drive - by " investigation .
During a hearing Wednesday morning , Krongard first denied that his brother had any role with Blackwater -- but reversed himself after being confronted with evidence that his brother had attended a Blackwater advisory board meeting this week .
" I had not been aware of that , and I want to state on the record right now that I hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with Blackwater , " Krongard told the committee after calling his brother during the break .
In a separate development , the FBI has not yet interviewed five " key " members of a Blackwater security team involved in the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqis , a Blackwater spokeswoman said Wednesday .
In addition , a senior U.S. official who asked not to be identified told CNN that " most , if not all , of the shooters " in the September 16 incident " have not been interviewed . "
An FBI team has been in Baghdad investigating the shootings by Blackwater security contractors who were hired by the State Department to protect U.S. diplomats .
" To the best of our knowledge , the key people in this incident have yet to even speak with investigators , " said Blackwater Worldwide spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell .
She said it was her understanding that none of the five " key " Blackwater employees involved in the incident have been interviewed by the FBI .
An FBI representative refused to comment on Tyrrell 's statement .
The North Carolina - based firm says its guards came under fire while protecting a State Department convoy and acted properly in self - defense , but Iraqi authorities have called the killings " premeditated murder . "
Some Blackwater employees who 've given statements to State Department investigators in exchange for limited immunity have refused to answer FBI questions , according to government sources close to the investigation .
The State Department investigators promised the employees that their statements would not be used against them in a criminal prosecution .
Watch the latest legal wrinkles in the case »
The killings placed the operations of Blackwater and other security firms under scrutiny in Iraq , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq , security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law .
See details about security contractors in Iraq »
Several , if not all , of the Blackwater guards involved in the shootings have returned to the United States from Iraq , said a highly placed industry source .
The killings have angered members of Iraq 's government and prompted demands in the U.S. Congress that American security contractors be held accountable for their actions abroad .
" We have always supported stringent accountability and continue to support stringent accountability , " Tyrrell said .
" If it is proven that there was wrongdoing , we want that person or persons held accountable . "
Iraqi officials said 17 people , including women and children , were killed and 27 were wounded when Blackwater guards fired on motorists around Nusoor Square .
But Blackwater has said its contractors fired in self - defense .
" It 's very clear that they were faced with deadly force throughout the morning , " Tyrrell said .
" As you recall , there was the massive car bomb earlier in the day . "
The shooting began when the Blackwater security team was stopped in a jammed traffic circle while on its way to assist another Blackwater team that was escorting a State Department official .
That official was rushed back to the U.S. Embassy after a roadside bomb exploded near where the official was in a meeting .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice sent a high - level team to Baghdad to conduct an inquiry , which resulted in new rules and procedures for diplomatic security teams operating in Iraq .
A team of FBI agents flew to Baghdad to assist in the case , but the bureau eventually opened its own criminal probe .
While State Department agents took statements from Blackwater employees involved in the incident , they promised them they would not share their statements with criminal investigators .

A spectre is haunting the net but , outside of techie circles , nobody seems to be talking about it .
The threat it represents to our security and wellbeing may be less dramatic than anything posed by global terrorism , but it has the potential to wreak much more havoc .
And so far , nobody has come up with a good idea on how to counter it .
It 's called the Storm worm .
It first appeared at the beginning of the year , hidden in email attachments with the subject line : ' 230 dead as storm batters Europe ' .
The PC of anyone who opened the attachment became infected and was secretly enrolled in an ever - growing network of compromised machines called a ' botnet ' .
The term ' bot ' is a derivation of ' software robot ' , which is another way of saying that an infected machine effectively becomes the obedient slave of its - illicit - owner .
If your PC is compromised in this way then , while you may own the machine , someone else controls it .
And they can use it to send spam , to participate in distributed denial - of - service attacks on banks , e-commerce or government websites , or for other even more sinister purposes .
Storm has been spreading steadily since last January , gradually constructing a huge botnet .
It affects only computers running Microsoft Windows , but that means that more than 90 per cent of the world 's PCs are vulnerable .
Nobody knows how big the Storm botnet has become , but reputable security professionals cite estimates of between one million and 50 million computers worldwide .
To date , the botnet has been used only intermittently , which is disquieting : what it means is that someone , somewhere , is quietly building a doomsday machine that can be rented out to the highest bidder , or used for purposes that we can not yet predict .
Of course , computer worms are an old story , which may explain why the mainstream media has paid relatively little attention to what 's been happening .
Old - style worms - the ones with names like Sasser and Slammer - were written by vandals or hackers and designed to spread as quickly as possible .
Slammer , for example , infected 75,000 computers in 10 minutes , and therefore attracted a lot of attention .
The vigour of the onslaught made it easier for anti-virus firms to detect the attack and come up with countermeasures .
In that sense , old - style worms were like measles - an infectious disease that shows immediate symptoms .
Storm is different .
It spreads quietly , without drawing attention to itself .
Symptoms do n't appear immediately , and an infected computer can lie dormant for a long time .
' If it were a disease , ' says one expert , Bruce Schneier , 'it would be more like syphilis , whose symptoms may be mild or disappear altogether , but which will come back years later and eat your brain . '
Schneier thinks Storm represents ' the future of malware ' because of the technical virtuosity of its design .
For example , it works rather like an ant colony , with separation of duties .
Only a small fraction of infected hosts spread the worm .
A much smaller fraction are command - and - control servers ; the rest stand by to receive orders .
By only allowing a small number of hosts to propagate the virus and act as command - and - control servers , Storm is resilient against attack because even if those hosts shut down , the network remains largely intact and other hosts can take over their duties .
More fiendishly , Storm does n't have any noticeable performance impact on its hosts .
Like a parasite , it needs the host to be intact and healthy for its own survival .
This makes it harder to detect , because users and network administrators wo n't notice any abnormal behaviour most of the time .
And instead of having all hosts communicate with a central server or set of servers , Storm uses a peer - to - peer networking protocol for its command - and - control servers .
This makes the botnet much harder to disable because there 's no centralised control point to be identified and shut down .
It gets worse .
Storm 's delivery mechanism changes regularly .
It began as PDF spam , then morphed into e-cards and YouTube invites .
It then started posting blog - comment spam , again trying to trick viewers into clicking infected links .
Similarly , the Storm email changes all the time , with new , topical subject lines and text .
And last month Storm began attacking anti-spam sites focused on identifying it .
It has also attacked the personal website of a malware expert who published an analysis of how it worked .
At the moment , nobody knows who 's behind this .
Is it a Russian mafia operation ?
An al - Qaeda scheme ?
The really creepy thing is that , to date , the controllers of Storm have used it for such relatively trivial purposes .
The suspicion has to be that they are biding their time , waiting for the moment when , say , 100 million naive Windows users have clicked on an infected link and unwittingly added their machines to the botnet .
Only then will we know what a perfect storm in cyberspace is like .

A group of Brazilian physicists is trying to launch a boycott by the country 's academic community to fight Dell Computer 's war on terror .
The campaign is a response to Dell 's security checks , which take a hard line against Anti-American scheming with an impregnable barrier of drop down options and radio buttons .
The story was first reported by Brazil 's daily Folha de Sao Paulo , and spotted by the folks at The Economic Times
Dell 's methods quite reasonably depend on the honesty and forthrightness of Enemies of Freedom™ to identify their intentions to use Dell products in the production of weapons of mass destruction .
When a customer proceeds to checkout , they get hit with a probe such as this :
Still , it beats waterboarding .
Dell demands its products not be handed over to citizens of Cuba , Iran , Sudan , Libya , North Korea and Syria , and others deemed hostile to the United States .
The company says the export compliance document is a standard government requirement .
But Brazilian nuclear physicist Paulo Gomes of the Federal Fluminense University is n't satisfied .
" I do not have to justify my actions before anyone , and I am not obliged to follow US policies .
I am a buyer .
I am not receiving a donation .
Besides , I have ties with Cuban physicists and will not renounce those , " he said .
Gomes will return the two computers if Dell provides a refund and sends a letter to the Physics Institute at UFF justifying the restrictions , The Economic Times reports .
Gomes sent a report on his displeasure to the Brazilian Minister of Science and Technology and the Brazilian Physics Society to recommend the boycott to its members . ®
BERLIN — The United States and Britain ranked at the bottom of a U.N. survey of child welfare in 21 wealthy countries that assessed everything from infant mortality to whether children ate dinner with their parents or were bullied at school .
The Netherlands , followed by Sweden , Denmark and Finland , finished at the top of the rankings , while the United States was 20th and Britain 21st , according to the report released yesterday by UNICEF in Germany .
One of the study ’s researchers , Jonathan Bradshaw , said children fared worse in the United States and Britain — despite high overall levels of national wealth — because of greater economic inequality and poor levels of public support for families .
“ What they have in common are very high levels of inequality , very high levels of child poverty , which is also associated with inequality , and in rather different ways poorly developed services to families with children , ” said Mr. Bradshaw , a professor of social policy at the University of York in Britain .
“ They do n’t invest as much in children as continental European countries do , ” he said , citing the lack of day care services in both countries , and poorer health coverage and preventive care for children in the United States .
The study also gave the two countries low marks for their higher incidences of single - parent families and risky behaviors among children , such as drinking alcohol and sexual activity .
Britain was last and the U.S. second from the bottom in the category focusing on relationships , based on the percentage of children who lived in single - parent homes or with stepparents , as well as the percentage who ate the main meal of the day with their families several times per week .
That category also counted the proportion of children who said they had “ kind ” or “ helpful ” relationships with other children .
On average , 80 percent of the children in the countries surveyed live with both parents .
There were wide variations , however , from more than 90 percent in Greece and Italy to less than 70 percent in Britain and 60 percent in the United States , where 16 percent of adolescents lived with stepfamilies .
Both the U.S. and British governments criticized the report .
Wade Horn , an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services , said the study ’s standard of measuring poverty differed from that of the United States .
A family of four is defined by the United States as living in poverty if its combined income is less than $ 20,650 a year .
The poverty threshold used by the report was an income of $ 35,000 a year for a family of four , he said .
“ I think when you try to compare nations in a report like this , you tend to ignore so many other factors specific to those nations that the comparison becomes somewhat meaningless , ” Mr. Horn said .
Britain said the report did not take account of recent improvements to education , health and general living standards in the country .
Some of the statistics also went back as far as 2001 , it said .

Pliny relates that Cicero once saw the 15,693 - verse Iliad of Homer written “ in so small a compass as to be wholly enclosed in a nutshell . ”
A certain Pierre - Daniel Huet , later Bishop of Avranches and long a skeptic of this anecdote , demonstrated in the 1670s that the feat was indeed entirely possible if one used both sides of a common leaf of paper , 40 verses to a line , 240 lines per page .
And in the same century , when John Aubrey set out to write the epitaph for the tomb of the Tradescants , the greatest collectors of curiosities in seventeenth - century England , he chose the metaphor of the Iliad in a nutshell — the macrocosm contained — to represent their encyclopedic collection :
Whilst they ( as Homer ’s Iliad in a nut )

Cafferty : I trust government to guard our privacy , do n't you ?
Greg Wasserstrom and Mike Aivaz
Published : Tuesday November 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This CNN's Jack Cafferty of the Cafferty File joined CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday to discuss a Bush Administration intelligence 's official suggestion that the American people need to " redefine privacy " in order to confront the threats of the 21st century .
In late October , as the Associated Press reported , Donald Kerr , Principal Deputy Directory of National Intelligence , delivering the keynote address at GEOINT 2007 ( the annual United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation symposium ) , said that today 's times called for a new definition of privacy .
" Too often , privacy has been equated with anonymity ; and it's an idea that is deeply rooted in American culture , " Kerr said .
" The Long Ranger wore a mask but Tonto did n't seem to need one even though he did the dirty work for free .
You 'd think he would probably need one even more .
But in our interconnected and wireless world , anonymity -- or the appearance of anonymity -- is quickly becoming a thing of the past . "
Kerr added , " We need to move beyond the construct that equates anonymity with privacy and focus more on how we can protect essential privacy in this interconnected environment ....
I think all of us have to really take stock of what we already are willing to give up , in terms of anonymity , but what safeguards we want in place to be sure that giving that up does n't empty our bank account or do something equally bad elsewhere . "
According to Kerr , privacy should mean only that government and business are safeguarding people 's sensitive information , rather than relying on anonymity .
" Of course , I trust the government to do that , do n't you ? "
Cafferty asked facetiously .
Cafferty went on to explain how , in his view , Congress ' handling of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance act demonstrates that the government may not have the people 's best interest in mind when it comes to privacy .
" Remember last summer when it was threatened they might be held and not be able to go on their break in time , they hastily changed the law and gave the government powers to eavesdrop inside the United States without a warrant as long as one of the parties was reasonably believed to be outside the United States . "
" Reasonably believed , " Cafferty added .
" That 's a loophole you could drive a train though . "
Cafferty asked CNN viewers to weigh in on the privacy debate .
" The question then for this hour is this : A top intelligence official says it 's time for people in the United States to redefine privacy , " Cafferty said .
" The question is : why should we ? "
One viewer wrote in , " Good God , I would n't want my personal information to fall into the hands of a bunch of unsavory characters .
So I better do everything in my power to keep it out of the government 's hands . "
Another opined , " Redefining privacy is a bit like redefining virginity .
Once it 's gone , it 's gone . "

How to Get a Job Like Mine
Talk , as prepared , for the Tathva 2007 computer conference at NIT Calicut .
( Additional notes . )
Translations : 日本語
The American writer Kurt Vonnegut used to always title his talks " How to Get a Job Like Mine " and then proceed to talk about whatever he felt like .
I 'm in a bit of the opposite situation .
I was told I could talk about whatever I felt like and I decided that , instead of pontificating for a while about the future of the Internet or the power of mass collaboration , the most interesting thing I could talk about was probably " How to Get a Job Like Mine " .
So how did I get a job like mine ?
Undoubtedly , the first step is to choose the right genes : I was born white , male , American .
My family was fairly well - off and my father worked in the computer industry .
Unfortunately , I do n't know of any way of choosing these things , so that probably is n't much help to you .
But , on the other hand , when I started I was a very young kid stuck in a small town in the middle of the country .
So I did have to figure out some tricks for getting out of that .
In the hopes of making life a little less unfair , I thought I 'd share them with you .
Step 1 : Learn
The first thing I did , which presumably all of you have already got covered , was to learn about computers , the Internet , and Internet culture .
I read a bunch of books , I read enormous numbers of web pages , and I tried stuff .
First I joined mailing lists and tried to understand the discussions until I felt comfortable jumping in and trying to participate for myself .
Then I looked at web sites and tried to build my own .
And finally I learned how to build web applications and I started building them .
I was thirteen .
Step 2 : Try
The first site I built was called get.info .
The idea was to have a free , online encyclopedia that anyone could edit or add things to or reorganize , right through their web browser .
I built the whole thing , added lots of cool features , tested it on all sorts of browsers , and was very proud of it .
It actually won even a prize for one of the best new web applications that year .
Unfortunately , the only people I knew at the time were other kids in my school , so I did n't really have anyone writing a lot of encyclopedia articles .
( Luckily , several years later , my mother pointed me to this new site called " Wikipedia " that was doing the same thing . )
The second site I built was called my .info .
The idea was that instead of having to scrounge around the Internet for news from all sorts of different web pages , why not just have one program that went and grabbed news from all those web pages and put them in one place .
I built it and got it working , but it turned out I was n't the only one who had that sort of idea at the time -- lots of people were working on this new technique , then called " syndication " .
A group of them split off and decided to work on a specification for this thing called RSS 1.0 and I joined them .
Step 3 : Gab
It was summer and I was out of school and did n't have a job , so I had a lot of free time on my hands .
And I spent all of it obsessively reading the RSS 1.0 mailing list and doing all sorts of odd jobs and whatever else they needed someone to do .
Soon enough , they asked me if I wanted to become a member of the group , and I ended up becoming a co-author and then a co-editor of the RSS 1.0 specification .
RSS 1.0 was built on top of this technology called RDF , which was a bit of a source of heated debate on the RSS lists , so I started looking more into RDF , joining the RDF mailing lists , reading things and asking stupid questions and slowly starting to figure things out .
Soon enough , I was becoming known in the RDF world and when they announced a new working group to develop the next RDF spec , I decided to sneak on .
First I asked the working group members if I could join .
They said no .
But I really wanted to be on that working group , so I tried to find another way .
I read the rules of the W3C , which was the standards body that operated the Working Group .
The rules said that while they could reject any requests to join from an individual , if an organization that was an official member of the W3C asked to put someone on the working group , they could n't say no .
So I looked down the list of W3C member organizations , found the one that seemed friendliest , and asked them to put me on the Working Group .
They did .
Being a Working Group member meant weekly phone calls with all the other members , lots of mailing list and IRC discussion , occasionally flying off to odd cities to meet in person , and lots of all - around getting - to - know people .
I was also a true believer on the subject of RDF , so I worked hard to get other people to adopt it .
When I saw that professor Lawrence Lessig was starting a new organization called Creative Commons , I sent him an email saying he should use RDF for his project and explaining why .
A few days later he wrote back saying " Good idea .
Why do n't you do that for us ? "
So I ended up joining Creative Commons which ended up flying me out to all sorts of conferences and parties and so on where I ended up meeting even more people .
Between all of this people were starting to know who I was and I was starting to have friends in lots of different places and fields .
Step 4 : Build
And then I left it all and went to college for a year .
I attended Stanford University , an idyllic little school in California where the sun is always shining and the grass is always green and the kids are always out getting a tan .
It 's got some great professors and I certainly learned a bunch , but I did n't find it a very intellectual atmosphere , since most of the other kids seemed profoundly unconcerned with their studies .
But towards the end of the year , I got an email from a writer named Paul Graham who said that he was starting up a new project , Y Combinator .
The idea behind Y Combinator is that you find a bunch of really smart programmers , fly them out to Boston for the summer , and give them a little bit of money and the paperwork to start a company .
They work really really hard on building something while you teach them everything they need to know about business and hook them up with investors and acquirers and so on .
And Paul suggested I apply .
So I did and I got in and after lots of pain and toil and struggle I found myself working on a little site called Reddit.com .
The first thing to know about Reddit was that we had no clue what we were doing .
We had no experience in business .
We had hardly any real experience in building production software .
And we had no idea whether or why what we were doing was working .
Every morning we woke up and made sure the server was n't down and that our site had n't been overrun by spammers and that all our users had n't left .
When I first started at Reddit , growth was slow .
The site was put online very early -- within weeks of starting work on it -- but for the first three months it hardly got above three thousand visitors a day , which is about baseline for a useful RSS feed .
Then , in a couple weeks of marathon coding sessions , we moved the site from Lisp to Python and I wrote an article about it for my blog .
It got a lot of attention -- Hell hath no fury like a Lisp fan scorned -- and even today I still run into people at parties who , when I mention that I worked at Reddit , say " Oh , the site that switched from Lisp . "
Around that time traffic really started taking off .
In the next three months , our traffic doubled twice .
Every morning we'd wake up to check our traffic graphs and see how we were doing -- whether the new feature we 'd launched had gotten us more attention , whether word of mouth was still spreading our site , whether all our users had abandoned us yet .
And every day the number grew higher .
Although we could n't shake the impression that we seemed to grow faster whenever we took a break from doing actual work on the site .
We still had no idea how to make money .
We sold t- shirts on the site , but every time we made a little bit of money on those we spent it on ordering more t- shirts .
We signed up with a major Web ad representative to sell ads on our site , but they never seemed to be able to sell any ads for us and we rarely made more than , literally , a couple of dollars a month .
Another idea we had was licensing the " Reddit technology " to let other people build sites that worked like Reddit .
But we could n't find anyone who wanted to license it from us .
Soon , Reddit was getting millions of users every month -- a number that far surpassed the average American magazine .
I know that , because I was talking to a lot of magazine publishers at the time .
They all wondered how Reddit 's magic could work for them .
@@
At first , we just said yes to everything they suggested .
And , fortunately for us , that worked out , since we could program faster than they could write up an official contract for what they wanted .
In addition , online news sites started noticing that Reddit could send them vast amounts of traffic .
They somehow thought they could encourage this by adding " reddit this " links to all of their articles .
As far as I know , adding such links does n't actually improve your chances of being popular on Reddit ( although it does make your site look more ugly ) , but it did give us lots of free advertising .
Soon enough , the partnership talks turned to talks of acquisition .
Acquisition : the thing we 'd always dreamed of !
No longer would he have to worry about making money .
Some company out there would take over that responsibility in exchange for just making us all rich .
We dropped everything to negotiate with our acquirers .
And then it stayed dropped .
We negotiated for months .
First , we argued over the price .
We prepared plans and spreadsheets and went to headquarters to make presentations and had endless meetings and phone calls .
Finally , they refused our price , and we walked away .
Then they changed their tune and we finally shook hands and agreed on the deal -- only to begin negotiating on some other key point , only to walk away again .
We must have walked away three or four times before we finally got a contract we could agree to .
We must have stopped doing real work for six months .
I started going crazy from having to think so much about money .
We all started getting touchy from the stress and lack of productive work .
We begun screaming at each other and then not talking to each other and then launching renewed efforts to work together only to have the screaming begin again .
The company almost fell apart before the deal went through .
But eventually , we went into the offices of our lawyers to actually sign all the documents and the next morning the money was in our bank accounts .
It was done .
We all flew out to San Francisco and begun working at the offices of Wired News ( we were purchased by Condé Nast , a big publishing company which owns Wired , along with many other magazines ) .
I was miserable .
I could n't stand San Francisco .
I could n't stand office life .
I could n't stand Wired .
I took a long Christmas vacation .
I got sick .
I thought of suicide .
I ran from the police .
And when I got back on Monday morning , I was asked to resign .
Step 5 : Freedom
The first couple days without a job were odd .
I hung around the house .
I took advantage of the San Francisco sunshine .
I read some books .
But soon I felt like I needed a project again .
I started writing a book .
I wanted to collect together all the interesting studies I 'd found in the field of psychology and tell them , not as research results , but as stories .
Every day I went down to Stanford to do research in their library .
( Stanford is a great school for psychologists . )
But one day I got a call from Brewster Kahle .
Brewster founded the Internet Archive , an incredible organization which tries to digitize everything it can get its hands on and put it all up on the Web .
He said he wanted to get started on a project we 'd talked about in the past .
The idea was to collect information on all the books in the world in one place -- a free wiki .
I got right to work and over the next couple months I began calling libraries , roping in programmers , working with a designer , and doing all sorts of other odd jobs to get the site online .
That project ended up becoming Open Library and a demo version is now up at demo.openlibrary.org .
Much of it was built by a very talented Indian programmer : Anand Chitipothu .
Another friend , Seth Roberts , suggested we try to find some way to reform the higher education system .
We could n't really agree on a good solution , but we did agree on another good idea : a wiki to tell students what different jobs are like .
That site should be launching soon .
Then another old friend , Simon Carstensen , sent me an email saying he was graduating college and wanted to start a company with me .
Well , I 'd been keeping a list of companies I thought were good ideas and pulled the top one off the list .
The idea was this : make building a web site as easy as filling in a textbox .
Over the next few months we worked and worked to make things simpler and simpler ( and a little more complex as well ) .
The result , which launched a couple weeks ago , is Jottit.com .
I also signed up to mentor two Summer of Code projects , both of which were stunningly ambitious and with much luck should be launching soon .
I also decided I wanted to get into journalism .
My first print article got published the other week .
I also started a couple blogs about science and begun working on an academic paper of my own .
It builds upon a study I did a while back about who actually wrote Wikipedia .
Some people , including Jimmy Wales , the kind of public spokesman of Wikipedia , claimed that Wikipedia was n't such a big distributed project after all but instead was only written by around 500 or so people , many of whom he knew .
He had done some simple studies to back this up , but I ran the numbers more carefully and found the opposite : the vast majority of Wikipedia was created by new editors , mostly people who did n't even bother to create accounts , adding a couple sentences here and there .
How did Wales make such a big mistake ?
He looked at the number of changes each user made to Wikipedia , but did n't look at the size of the change .
It turns out there is this group of 500 who makes an enormous number of changes to Wikipedia , but all of their changes are quite small : they do things like fix spelling and change formatting .
It seems much more reasonable to believe that 500 people went around editing much of an encyclopedia than it does to think they wrote it .
Words of Advice
What 's the secret ?
How can I boil down things I do into pithy sentences that make myself sound as good as possible ?
Here goes :
Be curious .
Read widely .
Try new things .
I think a lot of what people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity .
Say yes to everything .
I have a lot of trouble saying no , to an pathological degree -- whether to projects or to interviews or to friends .
As a result , I attempt a lot and even if most of it fails , I 've still done something .
Assume nobody else has any idea what they 're doing either .
A lot of people refuse to try something because they feel they do n't know enough about it or they assume other people must have already tried everything they could have thought of .
Well , few people really have any idea how to do things right and even fewer are to try new things , so usually if you give your best shot at something you 'll do pretty well .
I followed these rules .
And here I am today , with a dozen projects on my plate and my stress level through the roof once again .
Every morning I wake up and check my email to see which one of my projects has imploded today , which deadlines I 'm behind on , which talks I need to write , and which articles I need to edit .
Maybe , one day , you too can be in the same position .
If so , I hope I 've done something to help .
Ever wondered what Google would say if it could talk ?
Wonder no more .
Enter three or four words and Google will finish your thoughts by searching for what comes next after these words .
[ Broken ]
Unfortunately this project no longer works .
It relied on the Google Search API and Google has decided to shut that down , so no more Chat bot .
You can have a look at my twitter bot , which does something similar but using the twitter API .
The idea was quite simple : A user types in a few words and the program searches at Google for those words and looks at what the most common next word is in the those search results .
It will then remove the first word from the search string and add the new word to it and repeat the operation , searching for a three or four word sentence each time .
It essentially uses Google as a hidden markov model to generate text .
Google indexes all the web so has a pretty good idea of the relative frequency of words .
Unfortunately Google also took away our nice toy .
There 's some results below though .
In the examples below , the seed text in bold , what Google returns is not .
You can use Google Talk as an oracle by starting sentences and have Google Talk finish them .
For example :
You want to know what a good programmer is , so you type : a good programmer is .
Google Talk answers : A good programmer is a lazy programmer
Or , you want to know how to better the world
Better the world by consolidating character in societies , families , and individuals
Also , you can find out who stars in a movie by typing the name of the movie followed by starring :
The Godfather starring Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan , Robert Duvall , Arthur Hill , Bo Hopkins , Mako , Gig Young .
Dir. Sam Peckinpah .

It starts to trash after while
Or have Google Talk write your contracts :

A new report from the Government Accountability Office ( PDF ) takes a look at FCC rulemaking procedures from the last five years to see if the agency is following its own guidelines .
While the answer is generally yes , the report focuses on one troubling finding : FCC staffers routinely release privileged information to companies that lobby the agency before that information is made publicly available .
The GAO 's examination concluded that groups which routinely participate in FCC rulemaking procedures often know when votes will be taken on specific rules , even before the information is made public .
These schedules are not supposed to be released outside of the FCC until a formal announcement is made , and less - connected stakeholders must wait for these announcements .
It may not sound like a big deal , but the FCC prevents groups from lobbying the agency on particular issues once those issues are scheduled for a vote .
This means , in the words of the GAO report , that " stakeholders with advance information about which rules are scheduled for a vote would know when it may be most effective to present their arguments to FCC , while stakeholders without access to this information may not . "
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) , who requested the report , expressed unhappiness with the finding .
" The FCC has a duty to be above - board in developing and implementing its rules , " he said in a statement after receiving the report .
" When the ' corporate insiders ' and ' K - Street ' crowd have the inside track on decisions critical to telecommunications , media , broadband or wireless policy , then the public and consumers are at an inherent disadvantage .
Both the law and the public interest require that rulemaking decisions adhere to principles of openness and objectivity . "
The report also revealed that the agency makes plenty of rules .
Between 2002 and 2006 , FCC commissioners made 1,835 decisions .
That 's not bad , but it 's absolutely dwarfed by the 17,406 decisions made in the various FCC bureaus over the same time period .
The report recommended that the FCC tighten up its practices so that all members of the public have equal access to information .
The GAO also suggested that the FCC develop a set of sanctions that would apply to staffers who breach the rules .
While the Cannes advertising festival is playing , I am inviting you to have a look at this video .

Top 10 Myths About Thanksgiving

Rick Shenkman is the editor of HNN .
MYTH # 1 The Pilgrims Held the First Thanksgiving
To see what the first Thanksgiving was like you have to go to : Texas .
Texans claim the first Thanksgiving in America actually took place in little San Elizario , a community near El Paso , in 1598 -- twenty - three years before the Pilgrims ' festival .
For several years they have staged a reenactment of the event that culminated in the Thanksgiving celebration : the arrival of Spanish explorer Juan de Onate on the banks of the Rio Grande .
De Onate is said to have held a big Thanksgiving festival after leading hundreds of settlers on a grueling 350 - mile long trek across the Mexican desert .
Then again , you may want to go to Virginia ..
At the Berkeley Plantation on the James River they claim the first Thanksgiving in America was held there on December 4th , 1619 .... two years before the Pilgrims ' festival .... and every year since 1958 they have reenacted the event .
In their view it 's not the Mayflower we should remember , it 's the Margaret , the little ship which brought 38 English settlers to the plantation in 1619 .
The story is that the settlers had been ordered by the London company that sponsored them to commemorate the ship 's arrival with an annual day of Thanksgiving .
Hardly anybody outside Virginia has ever heard of this Thanksgiving , but in 1963 President Kennedy officially recognized the plantation 's claim .
MYTH # 2 Thanksgiving Was About Family
If by Thanksgiving , you have in mind the Pilgrim festival , forget about it being a family holiday .
Put away your Norman Rockwell paintings .
Turn off Bing Crosby .
Thanksgiving was a multicultural community event .
If it had been about family , the Pilgrims never would have invited the Indians to join them .
MYTH # 3 Thanksgiving Was About Religion
No it was n't .
Paraphrasing the answer provided above , if Thanksgiving had been about religion , the Pilgrims never would have invited the Indians to join them .
Besides , the Pilgrims would never have tolerated festivities at a true religious event .
Indeed , what we think of as Thanksgiving was really a harvest festival .
Actual " Thanksgivings " were religious affairs ; everybody spent the day praying .
Incidentally , these Pilgrim Thanksgivings occurred at different times of the year , not just in November .
MYTH # 4 The Pilgrims Ate Turkey What did the Pilgrims eat at their Thanksgiving festival ?
They did n't have corn on the cob , apples , pears , potatoes or even cranberries .
No one knows if they had turkey , although they were used to eating turkey .
The only food we know they had for sure was deer .
11 ( And they did n't eat with a fork ; they did n't have forks back then . )
So how did we get the idea that you have turkey and cranberry and such on Thanksgiving ?
It was because the Victorians prepared Thanksgiving that way .
And they 're the ones who made Thanksgiving a national holiday , beginning in 1863 , when Abe Lincoln issued his presidential Thanksgiving proclamations ... two of them : one to celebrate Thanksgiving in August , a second one in November .
Before Lincoln Americans outside New England did not usually celebrate the holiday .
( The Pilgrims , incidentally , did n't become part of the holiday until late in the nineteenth century .
Until then , Thanksgiving was simply a day of thanks , not a day to remember the Pilgrims . )
MYTH # 5 The Pilgrims Landed on Plymouth Rock According to historian George Willison , who devoted his life to the subject , the story about the rock is all malarkey , a public relations stunt pulled off by townsfolk to attract attention .
What Willison found out is that the Plymouth Rock legend rests entirely on the dubious testimony of Thomas Faunce , a ninety - five year old man , who told the story more than a century after the Mayflower landed .
Unfortunately , not too many people ever heard how we came by the story of Plymouth Rock .
Willison 's book came out at the end of World War II and Americans had more on their minds than Pilgrims then .
So we 've all just gone merrily along repeating the same old story as if it 's true when it 's not .
And anyway , the Pilgrims did n't land in Plymouth first .
They first made landfall at Provincetown .
Of course , the people of Plymouth stick by hoary tradition .
Tour guides insist that Plymouth Rock is THE rock .
MYTH # 6 Pilgrims Lived in Log Cabins No Pilgrim ever lived in a log cabin .
The log cabin did not appear in America until late in the seventeenth century , when it was introduced by Germans and Swedes .
The very term " log cabin " cannot be found in print until the 1770s .
Log cabins were virtually unknown in England at the time the Pilgrims arrived in America .
So what kind of dwellings did the Pilgrims inhabit ?
As you can see if you visit Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts , the Pilgrims lived in wood clapboard houses made from sawed lumber .
MYTH # 7 Pilgrims Dressed in Black
Not only did they not dress in black , they did not wear those funny buckles , weird shoes , or black steeple hats .
So how did we get the idea of the buckles ?
Plimoth Plantation historian James W. Baker explains that in the nineteenth century , when the popular image of the Pilgrims was formed , buckles served as a kind of emblem of quaintness .
That 's the reason illustrators gave Santa buckles .
Even the blunderbuss , with which Pilgrims are identified , was a symbol of quaintness .
The blunderbuss was mainly used to control crowds .
It was n't a hunting rifle .
But it looks out of date and fits the Pilgrim stereotype .
MYTH # 8 Pilgrims , Puritans -- Same Thing
Though even presidents get this wrong -- Ronald Reagan once referred to Puritan John Winthrop as a Pilgrim -- Pilgrims and Puritans were two different groups .
The Pilgrims came over on the Mayflower and lived in Plymouth .
The Puritans , arriving a decade later , settled in Boston .
The Pilgrims welcomed heterogeneousness .
Some ( so - called " strangers " ) came to America in search of riches , others ( so - called " saints " ) came for religious reasons .
The Puritans , in contrast , came over to America strictly in search of religious freedom .
Or , to be technically correct , they came over in order to be able to practice their religion freely .
They did not welcome dissent .
That we confuse Pilgrims and Puritans would have horrified both .
Puritans considered the Pilgrims incurable utopians .
While both shared the belief that the Church of England had become corrupt , only the Pilgrims believed it was beyond redemption .
They therefore chose the path of Separatism .
Puritans held out the hope the church would reform .
MYTH # 9 Puritans Hated Sex Actually , they welcomed sex as a God - given responsibility .
When one member of the First Church of Boston refused to have conjugal relations with his wife two years running , he was expelled .
Cotton Mather , the celebrated Puritan minister , condemned a married couple who had abstained from sex in order to achieve a higher spirituality .
They were the victims , he wrote , of a" blind zeal . "
MYTH # 10 Puritans Hated Fun H.L. Mencken defined Puritanism as " the haunting fear that someone , somewhere , may be happy ! "
Actually , the Puritans welcomed laughter and dressed in bright colors ( or , to be precise , the middle and upper classes dressed in bright colors ; members of the lower classes were not permitted to indulge themselves -- they dressed in dark clothes ) .
As Carl Degler long ago observed , " The Sabbatarian , antiliquor , and antisex attitudes usually attributed to the Puritans are a nineteenth - century addition to the much more moderate and wholesome view of life 's evils held by the early settlers of New England . "

Actually , witches who were executed by hanging , not burning .
Historically , worldwide , far more people were executed for heresy , not witchcraft , but many people fail to make this distinction .
John H. Lederer - 11/25/2004 " thus tending to support the claims of authors such as Randolph Roth that guns were accurate enough to hit targets . "
From the large quantity of birds I rather suspect that the firearms used were either " fowlers " or " punt guns " .
These are very large bore smoothbores that shoot a large amount of shot in the direction of a flock of birds ( usually waterfowl ) that are not flying .
Typically one might kill a dozen or two birds in a shot .
They are usually shot from a rest ( forked limb , oarlock , etc . )
Not good proof of accuracy < g >
There is a picture of one here :
http://www.joesalter.com/detail.php?f_qryitem=0411
Though this percussion fowler is much later in date , I suspect that it is a conversion from a flintlock .
Similar dimensions , less graceful lines , and a clubbier butt to the stock would probably be similar to a fowler ~ 1625 .
At the time period the ignition system was probably a mathlock , though early flintlocks would have been starting to take over .
In practice the inherent accuracy of an early firearm is not very meaningful .
In use , they are inaccurate .
It is very difficult to hit a bird on the fly with a matchlock , and quite difficult with a flintlock .
The problem is the erratic time to ignition from trigger pull and amount of commotion before the shot itself .
The shooter has to have the discipline to continue swinging the firearm on the moving target while , quite close to his face , a heavy hammer falls , and a blast of heat and white smoke comes out near his face .
The problem becomes much simpler with a percussion firearm .

I just had to comment .
One the Pilgrims did n't invite the locals .
It was the other way around because the Pilgrims were starving , the locals felt had pity on them and brought them food during their Thanksgiving ceremony .
The Native Americans have a completely , and more believable story behind the feast .
Also after a year or two of being fed by a local village , the Europeans went to the village and slaughtered most of the people , to steal their food .

And the puritans who stayed in England were NOT fun either - Oliver Cromwell banned make - up , theatre and Christmas as well as slaughtering thousands of Irish Catholics .
sccatalyst - 11/28/2003 Good on the Puritans .
Imagine that , people actually telling other people that their view is not necessarily affirmed , is harmful to the society .
You 'd better reference your propaganda though about forced labor and mutilation and I 'm not talking about someone 's home spun website .
Maybe we should be flexing like they did in this country today .

" The Sabbatarian , antiliquor , and antisex attitudes usually attributed to the Puritans are a nineteenth - century addition to the much more moderate and wholesome view of life 's evils held by the early settlers of New England . "
Was the desire to burn witches part of this ' moderate and wholesome view of life 's evils ' ?
Or was it all just good , clean fun ?

" I do n't know who or what they were giving thanks to !

A typical and expected multi-culti look back at the origins and traditions of our country and culture .
I 'm sorry if you felt belittled .
It was n't my intention to make you feel less " worthy " on thanksgiving than anybody else .
If you do n't believe in God , your thanks will be directed elsewhere , perhaps towards people , as you say .
Each to his own .
But I just wanted to make sure that , as we relentlessly rewrite the past , some simple realities will survive unscathed from this butchers cleaver .
No , my friend .
The puritans were giving thanks to God , attempts to rewrite history , and " dispel myths " , notwithstanding .
Allen Burnsworth - 11/27/2003
I do n't know who or what they were giving thanks to !
Maybe each other for helping each other survive .
Maybe to what their perception of God was at that time .
Which I doubt since I 'm pretty certain that the indian 's there at the time were n't Monotheistic .
I think we all get it Dave .
We know your a religious fundamentalist zealot .
O.K. , O.K.!
We 're not as good as you !
We get it !
But you know what .
I 'm still thankful for my family , my friends , opportunities , great sex , great rap music , great classical music , great art , all of these things that make me laugh , cry , and enjoy life with all of it 's foibles and faux pas ' as well as the excitement and exhilaration of just living .
And no I do n't need a god to tell me that .
I do n't know if there is a god .
But I 'm pretty certain that if there is He / She / It would be more concerned that we enjoy life , than whether or not we can belittle someone into thinking our way .
If the purpose of life is not to enjoy it , then I do n't know what it could be .
It 's your planet .
Do what you love ! ,

Although you may feel free to discuss the demoninational nuances between ' puritans ' , ' pilgrims ' , ' separatists ' , etc. , the fact still remains that they were a christian religious sect that arrived in America for religious reasons .
And they did n't give thanks to Indians , nor turkeys , nor did they give thanks at the Temple of No Particular Deity in the underground city of Zion .
They gave thanks to GOD , the God of the Bible .
Beth Quitslund - 11/26/2003
Yes , the Mass Bay colony was very rigid about religous conformity and particularly nasty to the indigenous people .
One of the major disagreements between the Plymouth group and the Mass one , in fact , was the treatment of native peoples : the Plymouth plantation was far more inclined to negotiate with the local tribes , and viewed the Mass Bay Colony 's unremitting hostility to the indigenous people as imprudent .
David - 11/25/2003
Who were they giving thanks to ?
The indians ?
The turkeys ?

I check it today and find that much of it had been removed .

Dave Livingston - 11/22/2003
Rick may or may not have succumbed to El Paso's C of C hype .
Nonetheless it is true , Rick is correct , that thanksgiving was celebrated by Christians in America long before Plymouth Rock .
For instance , it is said that there is a church in Santa Fe in which the Mass has been celebrarted daily , without fail , for a hundred years before Plymouth Rock .
Indeed , a few years ago in Curenevaca I went to Mass in a cathedral the foundation stone of which is said to have been laid by a fellow by the name of Cortes .
Perhaps the secular mind cannot grasp the concept , every Mass celebrated is a celebration of thanksgiving .
For us European Americans whatever harvest celebrations the Stone Age Indian celebrated prior to the arrival of the Pilgrims is beside the point that the Thanksgiving celebrated in most American homes is a Protestant religious celebration firsdt and foremost .
To whom do we give trhanks ?
God .
Without acknowledging
Him the vcelevration is meaningless .
Clearly , today 's secular mind has difficulty in grasping ( resents ? ) how pervasive was the Christian mindset in European mand in the Middle Ages & in the early modern period .
It is amusing how vexing it may be to the secular mind , hating religion , America 's traditional immersion in Christianity , that our two most important holidays in this secular society are religious : the Protestant Thanksgiving & the Catholic Christmas ( Christ 's Mass ) .

HEADLINE : Prof : Spanish colonists held first Thanksgiving
BYLINE : By Jules Crittenden
BODY :
The Pilgrims ' Thanksgiving was n't the first in the New World , a Florida professor says , and it's about time Americans put a few more seats at the table to make room for other historical traditions .
Long before the 1621 meal the Pilgrims shared with the local Wampanoag , University of Florida Professor Michael V. Gannon said , a band of 800 Spanish colonists grateful to have fended off a French attack , sat down to pray and then eat with the local Seloy tribe in St. Augustine , Fla .
That Mass of Thanksgiving took place Sept. 8 , 1565 - 55 years before the Mayflower dropped anchor off Cape Cod .
" While the holiday that observes the events in Plymouth is an important one in our national culture , let 's not forget it was preceded by a similar event 56 years earlier , " Gannon said .
" I do n't mind the Plymouth story at all .
But it overlooks the fact that there were earlier settlements and earlier Thanksgivings .
Let 's enjoy all of them . "
Explorer Pedro Menendez de Aviles and his Spanish followers probably dined on cocido - a stew made from salted pork and garbanzo beans , laced with garlic seasoning - hard sea biscuits and red wine , said Gannon .
If the Seloy Indians contributed food , then the menu could have included wild turkey , venison , tortoise , fish , corn , beans and squash , he said .
" I recommend that for an authentic Thanksgiving dinner , that 's what people have , " Gannon said .
The first Thanksgiving is recounted by Gannon in " We Gather Together , " an article published in this month 's St. Augustine Catholic , the publication of the Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine .
Gannon and Boston College historian Thomas O'Connor said the Pilgrim story won out in large part because it reflected the English and Protestant culture that dominated North America .
" It is also a homegrown celebration that 's not imported from Europe .
Behind the Spanish Thanksgiving is the Spanish church and the Spanish crown .
Behind the Pilgrim Thanksgiving is the Mayflower Compact , " O'Connor said , referring to the document that is seen as the first step toward democracy in the New World .
But O'Connor said he would not be surprised to see a Hispanic and Catholic Thanksgiving heritage become popular .
Carolyn Travers , a researcher at Plimoth Plantation , the Pilgrim re-enactment site in Plymouth , said the traditional New England Thanksgiving is also distinguished by having been celebrated every year since at least 1693 .
But she said Plymouth does n't have a monopoly on images and expressions of thankfulness .
" The more , the merrier , " Travers said .
James Lindgren - 11/28/2002
The only original account of the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth is Edward Winslow 's in the first entry here :
http://www.plimoth.org/Library/Thanksgiving/thnksref.htm
Note that fowl was the main dish mentioned , though the 90 Native Americans went out and killed 5 deer , whether before they came or ( more likely ) after 3 days of feasting is unclear .
Note also that for entertainment they exercised their arms and that four colonists shot in one day almost enough fowl for over 50 people feasting for nearly a week , thus tending to support the claims of authors such as Randolph Roth that guns were accurate enough to hit targets .
Here is the account :
" Our Corne did proue well , & God be praysed , we had a good increase of Indian Corne , and our Barly indifferent good , but our Pease not worth the gathering , for we feared they were too late sowne , they came vp very well , and blossomed , but the Sunne parched them in the blossome ; our harvest being gotten in , our Governour sent foure men on fowling , that so we might after a more speciall manner reioyce together , after we had gathered the fruit of our labors ; they foure in one day killed as much fowle , as with a little helpe beside , served the Company almost a weeke , at which time amongst other Recreations , we exercised our Armes , many of the Indians coming amongst vs , and among the rest their greatest King Massasoyt , with some nintie men , whom for three dayes we entertained and feasted , and they went out and killed fiue Deere , which they brought to the Plantation and bestowed upon our Governour , and upon the Captaine , and others .
And although it be not alwayes so plentifull , as it was at this time with vs , yet by the goodneses of God , we are so farre from want , that we often wish you partakers of our plenty . "

Not many writers who are of the European ancestory write about the truth plain and clear , its beautiful .
Michael Grace - 4/25/2002
It is a good bet that the Pilgrims brought the Thanksgiving celebration with them from England / Britain .
Bearing in mind that these people were not Americans but expat English in effect , they would have no doubt wanted to retain old customs of home on the North American soil .
A thanksgiving celebration has been in existence in Britain since pre Christian times and is still know to this day as Harvest Festival but is also referred to as thanksgiving .
So what does one mean by the first thanksgiving ?
Clearly thanksgiving predates Europeans reaching N. American soil .
Ronald Dale Karr - 11/23/2001 Even Gura 's getting a bit dated .
Especially in English scholarship , the term " Puritan " or " puritan " has been subject to a lot of questioning , with some arguing that the term is so difficult to define that it provides little historical meaning .
( One conference I attended featured a paper by an English scholar that included the phrase , " It 's Puritanism , Jim , but not as we know it ! " )
Certainly the recent scholarship on the Family of Love throws into question a lot of what we thought we knew about English religious radicalism .
In the English context , separatists such as the Pilgrims fell clearly into the Puritan camp .
Once here , the Mass Bay Puritans , despite their protestations to the contrary , quickly adopted a system of congregational churches that differed hardly at all from that of Plymouth ( that is , whenever Plymouth actually had a minister ! ) .
The statement that the Pilgrims " wanted nothing to do with the non-separarting congregationalists of the Bay Colony " distorts the complex relationship between the two English colonies that ultimatlely led to the creation of the New England Confederation .
John P. Bloom - 11/22/2001 Historian Shenkman is doing a disservice to history in proposing : " To see what the first Thanksgiving was like you have to go to : Texas .... "
He has succumbed to an El Paso Chamber of Commerce hype .
If capital - T Thanksgiving has any reality in the US , it has to be based ( centuries back ) on the harvest festivals held by many peoples , and / or on the various proclamations by US Presidents referring to events staged by early English colonists .
The main element of Oñate 's ceremony in April ( sic ) 1898 near present El Paso was to proclaim possession of the area for the Spanish crown .
Sure , they were glad to have reached the Río Grande in their journey , but they gave similar thanks at other stages of their trip to colonize New Mexico , so El Paso can assert no uniqueness in that .
They also held other ceremonies proclaiming possession for the crown as they went along .
PLEASE !-- do n't spread a new myth abroad in looking for ways to poke fun at schoolchild myths !
( Now , the Virginia claim is something else ....)
Ref for instance David Weber , _ The Spanish Frontier in North America_ , pp. 77ff .
John Stahler - 11/21/2001 Regarding myths 9 & 10 : The non-separating congregationalists living in the bay Colony during the mid-17th century were fruitful and multiplied , so they had to have sex at some point .
However , if they enjoyed it , there was nothing communicated about it .
Also , regarding # 10 , the Puritans were anything but nice people .
They established an ecclesiastical oligarchy , and were very totalitarian in the way they governed .
By the mid-1650s , they were engaging in a brutal suppression of all who disagreed with their point of view .
This suppression included large fines , confiscation of both real property and chattel , forced hard labor , banishment , imprisonment , mutilation ( having body parts removed or a hot poker stuck through your tongue ) and execution .
Unfortunately , these were not isolated instances of overzealous persecution , but regular and recurring actions by those in power .
So many were banished to Rhode Island ( which they referred to as the " sewer of New England " ) , that church membership actually declined .
They were not a lot of fun to be around ...
John Stahler - 11/21/2001
The " Pilgrims " were NOT Puritans , but Leydon separatists , and wanted nothing to do with the non-separarting congregationalists of the Bay Colony .
As for the work of Perry Miller , a much more accurate and comprehensive view of the Puritan society during the mid-17th century can be enjoyed in " A Glimpse of Sion 's Glory " , 1982 , Wesleyan University Press , by Philip F. Gura .
He holds a Ph.D. from Harvard , and researched much of his fascinating book at Harvard and other Boston area archives utilizing many original documents .
The views of Miller , et al , while not discredited , warrant serious revision based upon Dr. Gura 's work .
CG - 11/21/2001
The statement that the " Pilgrims " were not Puritans is untrue .
They were simply a different set of Puritans who came to North America via the mainland of Europe , where they 'd lived for some years before 1620 .
A good discussion of the distinction between Plymouth Puritans ( " Separating Separatists " ) and Massachusetts Bay Puritans ( " Non-Separating Separatists " ) can be found in Perry Miller 's _ Orthodoxy in Massachusetts_ .
The Bible says there is only one way to heaven .
Jesus said , " I am the way , the truth , and the life .
No one comes to the Father , but by Me . "

Overlooked pollutants might be having a bigger effect than we thought .
Chemicals that are n't exhaled can accumulate in mammals such as polar bears .
Getty
Efforts to control chemical pollution may overlook thousands of toxins that concentrate as they march up the food chain , say researchers .
Compounds that do not accumulate in fish can still build up in marine birds and mammals — and possibly the people that eat them , they have found .
The finding puts up to a third of industrial chemicals — including some perfumes and pesticides — under suspicion .
Regulations should be changed , says environmental toxicologist Frank Gobas of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby , British Columbia : " We have to re-evaluate how we are assessing these substances . "
Some organic chemicals — such the pesticide DDT and PCBs , which have been used as coolants — are known to build up when one animal eats another , a process called biomagnification .
The most common measure of a chemical 's propensity to bioaccumulate is how easily it passes through water .
The less soluble a chemical , the harder it is for an animal with gills to expel it .
The concentration of PCBs in fish , for example , can be 100 times that found in the algae at the base of the food chain .
But to study bioaccumulation in birds and mammals , you must also measure how easily a chemical passes through the air , say Gobas and his colleagues .
Studying more than a dozen animals , including ducks , beluga whales and polar bears , they fingered several compounds that regulators have overlooked because they can escape into water , but not air .
Chemical traps
“ We have to re-evaluate how we are assessing these substances . ” Frank Gobas , Simon Fraser University , Barnaby , British Columbia .
For instance , hexachlorocyclohexane , an ingredient of the pesticide lindane , has the same concentration in algae , shellfish and fish , but accumulates to high levels in polar bears .
" These chemicals get stuck in our bodies because they cannot get out through exhalation , " says Gobas .
The study , published in Science1 , did not address the health effects of any of the chemicals .
A computer model of the diet of Inuit populations in northern Canada found that some chemicals could concentrate 2,000 - fold compared with their levels at the base of the food chain .
The Inuit , who hunt marine mammals such as Beluga whales , and are known to contain high levels of PCBs , are especially vulnerable to biomagnified pollutants , the researchers believe .
Substance abuse
Derek Muir , an environmental toxicologist at Environment Canada in Burlington , Ontario , supports incorporating the findings into chemical risk assessment .
But he wonders whether regulators will act .
" It 's one thing to be aware of it , and another to actually rewrite regulations .
That 's a tougher challenge , " he says .
Governments may be waiting for better data on how the chemicals are metabolized — something the new study did not address — before they act , he says .
If an animal breaks down a pollutant before it has a chance to move up the food chain , no biomagnification occurs .
ADVERTISEMENT
The use of the most toxic chemicals such as dioxin and DDT is covered by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , signed by 131 countries in 2004 .
To address subtler threats , governments have begun assessing the toxicity , persistence and bioaccumulation of tens of thousands of industrial compounds .
A new Stockholm Convention is needed to convince governments they should look at biomagnification in mammals , Gobas says .
Individual countries are unlikely to go it alone , he believes .
" They are now so busy dealing with the existing criteria that their appetite for new criteria is limited . "

Nobel laureate James D. Watson , the renowned co-discoverer of the structure of DNA , resigned Thursday as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the aftermath of an uproar over racial comments he made recently .
The lab ’s board of directors suspended him last week after comments that he made in an interview appeared in the Oct.
14 Times of London .
The board said its members “ vehemently disagree with these statements and are bewildered and saddened . ”
Watson , 79 , said in an e-mail statement that the change in leadership was “ overdue . ”

“ The circumstances in which this transfer is occurring , however , are not those which I could ever have anticipated or desired , ” he continued .
Board Chairman Eduardo
Mestre said : “ For over 40 years , Dr. Watson has made immeasurable contributions to the laboratory ’s research and educational programs .
The board respects his desire to retire at this point in his career . ”
Nobel laureate Thomas R. Cech of the University of Colorado said , “ It is very unfortunate what has transpired . ” Watson transformed Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York from “ a sleepy place ” to what is now “ a really remarkable institution , unique in the world both in terms of its impact on biomedical science and the way it brings together scientists from all over the world through its conference programs and workshops , ” Cech said .
Watson ’s “ charisma and his intense focus and his scientific taste was impeccable , ” he added .

The controversy arose while he was in Europe to publicize his book “ Avoid Boring People . ”
In the Oct. 14 article , his former protege Charlotte Hunt - Grubbe wrote : “ He says that he is ‘ inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa ’ because ‘ all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours -- whereas all the testing says not really .’ . . .
He writes that ‘ there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically . ’ ”
A firestorm of criticism erupted , and London ’s Science Museum canceled a sold - out lecture he had scheduled .
Watson apologized “ unreservedly , ” saying , “ This is not what I meant . ”
But the damage had been done .
He was forced to cut his trip short and return home , where various groups issued highly critical statements .

Dr. Francis Collins , director of the National Human Genome Research Institute , said : “ I am deeply saddened by the events of the last week , and understand and agree with Dr. Watson ’s undoubtedly painful decision to retire in the aftermath of a racist statement he made that was both profoundly offensive and utterly unsupported by scientific evidence . ”
The Federation of American Scientists said Watson was promoting “ personal prejudices that are racist , vicious and unsupported by science . ”
Watson shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Francis Crick and Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins , both deceased , for identifying the double - helical structure of DNA .
He will be replaced as chancellor by Dr. Bruce Stillman , the laboratory president .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In Saudi Arabia gasoline costs about 45 cents a gallon .
In Iran it 's 33 cents .
Venezuelans pay less than a quarter .
These absurdly low prices are a direct result of massive government subsidies .
While these numbers are not adjusted for cost of living , it 's fair to say that drivers in those countries are getting a good deal .
But it 's straining government budgets .
More importantly , it 's not allowing the free market to do its job .
Higher prices on the open market are not leading to a drop in demand , which is keeping the cost of oil high for everyone else .
" Roughly two - thirds of new oil demand is coming from countries that have subsidized oil markets , " said Christopher Ruppel , a senior geopolitical analyst with the consulting firm John S. Herold .
" So demand is not going to be affected if oil goes from $ 60 a barrel to $ 80 . "
By no means does this let motorists in the United States off the hook .
Gasoline consumption in this country has been rising even faster than normal , around 2.5 percent annually over the past couple of months , despite average prices in excess of $ 3 a gallon , close to an all - time record .
But countries where consumption is rising the fastest may be surprising .
With its white - hot economy , it 's no surprise China tops the list .
The country 's oil demand is projected to grow 7.5 percent this year , according to statistics provided by Ruppel .
Ruppel said China still has gasoline subsidies , although lately the government has been trying to whittle them back .
The average price for a gallon of gas in Beijing is $ 2.44 , according to the research group AIRINC , which provided all the gasoline price numbers in this story .
But the second - highest demand growth is n't in the fast - growing economies of India or Brazil .
It 's Saudi Arabia , projected to consume 5.6 percent more oil next year , according to Ruppel .
Iran is number three , guzzling 3.3 percent more .
Russia and Egypt , which Ruppel said both have heavy gas subsidies , are also high on the list .
And the raw numbers are n't small either .
The Saudis used more than 2 million barrels of oil per day in 2006 , and the Iranians used 1.7 million .
India , a faster - growing economy with far more people , used 2.5 million .
( By comparison , the United States used about 21 million barrels a day , nearly 10 times as much as India , despite having a population barely a fourth as large , although the U.S. economy is 16 times as large .
See correction . )
" Maybe it 's adding up , " said Lou Pugliaresi , president of the Energy Policy Research Foundation .
Pugliaresi said his group had n't done any particular studies on subsidies and how they relate to worldwide demand growth and prices but added , " There are places where it 's serious , and some of those populations are big enough to make a difference . "
Katherine Spector , head of energy strategy at JPMorgan , ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) said the bank did a study on price supports and demand a couple years back .
Not only was demand rising fastest in countries that had subsidies , it also greatly scaled back once the subsidies were reduced , as happened in Thailand and Indonesia .
" A subsidy tells consumers they do n't need to adjust their behavior , " said Spector .
Of course , subsidies are just one contributor to high oil and gas prices , noted Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank .
Sieminski pointed to all the the other reasons why oil prices are high , among them rapid worldwide economic growth , limited supply and not enough refining capacity .
But , he added , " to the extend that it creates demand , it 's helping push prices higher for everyone . "

An earlier version of this story misstated the size of the Indian economy relative to the U.S. economy .

California Republicans seek to rig 2008 presidential vote
By our reporter
27 August 2007
In a transparent effort to rig the outcome of the 2008 presidential election , the California Republican Party has launched a petition drive to place a referendum on the ballot in June 2008 that would split the state ’s huge bloc of electoral votes rather than awarding them based on the traditional winner - take - all formula .
Since Democratic candidates have carried California in the last four presidential elections , and are heavily favored to do so again in 2008 , the goal of the ballot drive is to shift 20 or more of the state ’s 55 electoral votes to the losing Republican , making it more likely that in a close national vote a Republican who loses the popular vote could still win the Electoral College , as Bush did in 2000 after the Supreme Court awarded him Florida ’s electoral votes .
The ballot proposition was drafted by a Republican - backed group taking the name “ Californians for Equal Representation , ” set up by Thomas Hiltachk , a lawyer who was involved in the 2003 recall petition that ousted Democrat Gray Davis and installed Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Sacramento statehouse .
Hiltachk filed the language of the referendum with state attorney general Jerry Brown in late July and supporters have begun gathering the 454,000 signatures required to win a place on the June 3 , 2008 ballot .
The plan would award one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district and two additional votes to the statewide winner .
Since 19 of the state ’s 53 congressmen are Republicans , a Republican presidential candidate in 2008 could win the electoral votes of most of those districts and a few held by conservative Democrats if the referendum is approved by voters next year .
If the proposed system had been in effect in 2004 , President Bush would have gained 22 electoral votes in California and guaranteed his reelection even if he had lost the closely contested state of Ohio , which provided his actual margin of victory in the Electoral College .
The ballot drive is a political dirty trick , not only in its content , but in its timing .
The petition would force a vote in June 2008 , the traditional presidential primary date in California , which was abandoned earlier this year when the legislature voted to move up the presidential vote to February 5 .
The result is that only local offices and statewide referenda will be on the ballot in June , making a low turnout very likely .
The ballot proposition is also deceptively marketed as an effort to ensure “ election fairness . ”
When given only this description , respondents to a recent poll in California supported the measure 43 percent to 31 percent .
After an explanation that the effect would be to greatly increase the electoral votes available to the Republican presidential candidate , support dropped considerably .
In a further effort to “ game ” the result of the June 3 ballot , right - wing groups have launched other petition drives to place anti-abortion and anti-gay - marriage proposals on the ballot to drive up turnout among Christian fundamentalists .
According to the US Constitution , state governments may determine how their electoral votes are awarded .
They may — although no state has done so in more than a century — even award the electoral votes by decision of the state legislature , without a popular vote .
That is what the Republican - controlled Florida state legislature threatened to do in 2000 before the US Supreme Court stepped in to halt a recount that would have given the state to Democrat Al Gore .
Currently two small states , Nebraska and Maine , award their electoral votes district - by - district in the manner proposed in California .
Because of the political homogeneity of the states , their electoral votes have never actually been split , since the same candidate has prevailed in each district and statewide .
Maine has only two congressional districts and Nebraska three .
The electoral college system is inherently undemocratic , not so much in its winner - take - all feature , as in the fact that small states have inordinate weight .
Every state has electoral votes equal to its combined total of congressmen and senators .
Since each state has two senators regardless of population , there are far more electoral votes per capita in Wyoming or Vermont than in California or Illinois .
The Republican campaign in California has nothing to do with making the electoral vote system more democratic .
It is rather an effort to manipulate the outcome of the 2008 presidential election under conditions where the Republican Party is plunging in opinion polls .
Asa Raskin , the son of the late Jef Raskin , recently gave a presentation at Google on the work his company , Humanized , is doing .
It 's largely a continuation of the work of his father .
One of the most interesting aspects of Jef 's work was zoomable user interfaces .
Asa 's demo of zoomable interfaces starts at 1:05 in the video .
You can interact with the very same flash demo on this page ; scroll down to " Launch the Zoom Demo " , and be prepared to wait a bit , as it's an 8 megabyte Flash file .
Although popularized by Jef Raskin , Humanized is n't the only company working on zoomable user interfaces ; Microsoft has Seadragon :
You can experience the Seadragon technology in Photosynth , which is also being ported to Microsoft 's Silverlight .
According to Microsoft , zoomable UI has these advantages :
Speed of navigation is independent of the size or number of objects .
Performance depends only on the ratio of bandwidth to pixels on the screen .
Transitions are smooth as butter .
Scaling is near perfect and rapid for screens of any resolution .
Zooming user interfaces are rare in current operating systems and applications , but there are a few .
You 're probably already using at least one zoomable user interface without thinking much about it .
What really struck me about zoomable UI is how intuitive and usable it is in the right situation .
The zooming metaphor is central to the new real - time strategy game Supreme Commander ; you 're constantly zooming into the battle to take control of individual units , then zooming back out to get a larger , strategic view of what 's happening on the battlefield .
It 's totally natural and completely intuitive .
You do n't have to think ; it just works the way you 'd expect it to .
I 'm not sure when the mouse scroll wheel became standard equipment on computer mice , exactly , but I 'm awfully glad that it did .
Zooming is a natural metaphor that people adapt to as easily as they do to scrolling .
Zoomable UI is woefully underused today , but I think it should be an integral part of our desktop operating systems in the future .
It is difficult to know when looking at the claims of many alternative medicine web sites , whether the people involved are a ) deluded or b ) fraudulent .
For my part , and being a good natured soul , I tend to believe most people are just into weird things and are rather locked into their strange world view .
They genuinely feel they are helping people by selling their products and services .
To challenge their own beliefs and let in new arguments would mean risking abandoning so much about how they define themselves – and how they earn a living .
A journey through quackland is a salutary reminder of how we need to guard ourselves against false beliefs .
The existence of quackery ably demonstrates that the easiest person to fool is yourself and that if you want to fool someone else , it is best to fool yourself first .
But undoubtedly there are the deeply cynical and fraudulent out there .
And every now and again you come across a product or site that really tests my belief that most quackery is the result of simple delusions .
The QLink pendant is a good example of this .
The QLink is a device that claims to ease the stresses caused by exposure to ‘ electrosmog ’ .
There is a growing belief by the public that the radio waves given off by everyday appliances and electronic devices can somehow be harmful .
People report having violent headaches and other symptoms in the presence of TVs , mobile phones and WiFi routers .
The problem is that the evidence to date does not support any of this .
Firstly , there is a plausibility problem in understanding how exposure to low doses of non-ionising radiation can affect you in any way at all .
And secondly , when these ‘ electrosensitive ’ people are tested in controlled ways ( such as exposing them to a mobile phone , without them knowing if it is on or off ) then the symptoms are unrelated to the exposure .
Whilst few deny that the symptoms of sufferers of ‘ electosensitivity ’ are real , there is huge doubt that they are caused by ‘ electrosmog ’ .
There is something else going on and it may be psychological .
So , even if electrosensitivity were real , could the QLink do anything about it ?
Uh , no .
Radiowaves are going to get to you whether or not you are wearing it .
You can protect yourself against exposure , but you need to be completely enclosed within a box with a conductive surface , e.g. an iron clad room .
The claims of some QLink sellers that the device works on a ‘ quantum level ’ are just plain hogwash .
So , the device appears to be a cure that can never work against an illness that is probably purely psychological in nature .
At best , the device will function as a placebo in pendant form .
But maybe a placebo for those affected by electrosensitivity is exactly what they need ?
A complex question .
But that does not mean that companies selling QLink should be pushing at the worried well , sports - people and animals ?
That looks like a plain rip - off .
What amazes me about this , is that the sellers of QLink are not just a ‘ lone - genius ’ with a strange theory to sell to the world , but a fairly large company with many people involved in the sale .
You must have the original product designers , a manufacturing plant , marketing people , distribution channel managers and finally , the direct and indirect sales force .
The product is widely distributed through QLinks own sites or through re-sellers such as Patrick Holford .
Do all these people in this complex chain really believe what they are doing is for real ?
Is everyone just deluded ?
It many ways , it does not really matter if there is deliberate deception or just mass delusion .
The end result is the same .
People spend lots of money on stuff of marginal benefit to them .
They also acquire delusional beliefs that may not help them in the future when they really could do with some medical intervention .
Are the deluded people in this chain culpable ?
We might easily forgive and say these delusions are harmless , but delusions can lead to reckless beliefs where real harm might be done .
Another QLink seller rather outstanded me this week with their range of products .
The UK company Electronic Healing sells all sorts of gadgets and devices , many of which look as doubtful as the QLink .
One product that really took my breath away was a homeopathic first aid kit .
The blurb says …
An essential first - aid remedy kit for the home , car and workplace specifically formulated to be used in even the most severe emergency and accident situations .
Cripes !
Most Severe !
Now I was under the impression that that homeopathy is a ‘ gentle healing ’ method that requires an ‘ individualised approach ’ and , usually , a lengthy consultation to provide a ‘ holistic remedy ’ .
This does not look likely in an emergency situation .
Indeed , I would strongly suggest that application of homeopathy in a life - critical situation could severely detract from the absolute need to establish and maintain an airway , ensure breathing and prevent shock .
To have one of these kits and believe that it can help is a delusion of the reckless variety .
I ’ve emailed the Society of Homeopaths about this .
Would they endorse such a product ?
Let ’s wait and see .
Judge denies Craig 's motion to withdraw plea in bathroom bust arrest Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 4 , 2007

Print This Email This Update : Craig says he 's staying in Senate A Minnesota judge has denied Sen .
Larry Craig 's attempt to withdraw his guilty plea after he was caught up in a public - restroom sex sting , but the Idaho Senator says he continues to explore his legal options and will not leave the Senate .
Craig 's guilty plea to disorderly conduct was " accurate , voluntary and intelligent " and " the conviction is supported by the evidence , " according to the judge 's opinion , which was released Thursday .
" I am extremely disappointed with the ruling issued today .
I am innocent of the charges against me .
I continue to work with my legal team to explore my additional legal options , " Craig said in a statement released by his office .
" I will continue to serve Idaho in the United States Senate , and there are several reasons for that .
As I continued to work for Idaho over the past three weeks here in the Senate , I have seen that it is possible for me to work here effectively .
The Idaho Republican 's legal saga began in June when he was arrested for what police said were attempts to solicit an undercover officer in a men's room at the Minneapolis airport .
He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge in an apparent attempt to keep the story of his arrest hidden .
After news of the arrest broke in August , Craig first said he would resign by Sept. 30 , then changed his mind and stayed in office while he fought the guilty plea .
Now that his legal options appear exhausted , Republicans are expected to renew their attempts to push Craig from office .
Craig 's office did not return RAW STORY 's calls seeking clarification of his future plans .
Idaho 's Republican governor would replace Craig if he decides to step down , meaning his resignation almost certainly would not tip the balance of power in the Senate .
The saga sparked by Craig 's " wide stance " has made him a laughing stock in political circles , although he did have his defenders .
A property rights group called the senator 's arrest akin to " war on the west " , and the American Civil Liberties Union said Craig , along with every other American , has the same right to solicit sex in a bathroom as they do in a bar , as long as the actual sex would happen in private .
Craig has denied that he is gay and fiercely refuted allegations he did anything inappropriate in the bathroom where he was arrested .
Police say Craig peered into an undercover officer 's stall for two minutes before entering an adjoining toilet , where he tapped his foot and reached under the stall divider in ways suggesting he wanted to engage in lewd behavior .
The guilty plea Craig entered six weeks after his June 11 arrest was not intelligently made , the senator argued , because he was facing pressure from a local newspaper 's investigation into his sex life .
Judge Charles Porter Jr. shot down that reasoning and said that Craig did not have cause to withdraw his plea because the pressure was not being applied by police or prosecutors .
" The Defendant , a career politician with a college education , is of , at least , above - average intelligence .
He knew what he was saying , reading , and signing ,  Porter wrote , according to the Idaho Statesman , which published an article questioning Craig 's claims of heterosexuality after his bathroom arrest was revealed .
A spokesman for the Minneapolis / St. Paul International Airport , where Craig was arrested , released a statement praising the judge 's decision soon after it was announced Thursday .
 We are pleased with Judge Porter 's order upholding Senator Larry Craig 's guilty plea .
The ruling continues to hold Senator Craig accountable for his conduct in a Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport restroom in June , " spokesman Patrick Hogan said .
" In determining that Senator Craig 's plea is just and binding , the court ensures the plea negotiation process can continue to serve as an effective , efficient tool in the criminal justice system . 
Developing ...
There were concerns that the mural , The Mild Mild West , which shows a teddy bear about to hurl a petrol bomb at riot police , could be lost when the block in Bristol was made over .
Instead it is to be incorporated into the new development and will form the centrepiece of an atrium with an organic cafe .
The mural , one of Banksy 's most celebrated , will be protected from the elements and attack from vandals by glass .
Gavin Carpenter , of Connolly and Callaghan , which owns the building in Stokes Croft , said the atrium would be open to everyone .
" I think people assumed the worst when they heard about the development .
They thought the mural would go .
But Banksy is very much the man of the moment and this will bring some kudos to the development . "
Banksy has a huge local following , and The Mild Mild West took almost half the vote in a recent BBC poll to find the city 's favourite alternative landmark .
The development in Stokes Croft has yet to secure planning permission .
But one city councillor said having a Banksy mural was a good way of deterring graffiti vandals .
Gary Hopkins said : " Where there is good quality street art , other graffiti does not tend to encroach .
That 's why we commission various murals around the city . "
Meanwhile , it emerged yesterday that rare prints by Banksy worth nearly £ 10,000 were stolen in two raids on an art gallery in Brighton last month .
Thieves broke into Art Republic and snatched 10 pieces of work which police believe were stolen to order for a dealer or collector .
Like many people these days , I spend most of my working hours online .
At least half of those hours , I ’m doing actual work .
As millions have discovered , working at a computer with Internet access is a hazard to your productivity .
There are so many cool sites , so many ways of connecting with others , so many things to do that are fun or intensely interesting , that it ’s hard to actually get anything done .
The sites listed below are time drains , sucking up your precious hours by their amazingly cool attractions .
Should you never go on these sites ?
Are they completely useless ?
Of course not .
The reason they ’re listed here is because they are great sites or activities , but because they are so great , they can become addictive .
And while it ’s fine to use these sites for useful purposes , getting work done when you need to get work done and having fun when you can , it ’s the addiction that you need to watch closely .
Before we get into the list of time - wasters , let ’s take a look at 6 strategies to beat time - wasters and keep yourself on task .
Track time .
You might not know exactly how bad your addiction is , because the time you spend on some of these sites just flies by .
Try tracking your time , at least for a little while , to see where your problem areas are .
Page Addict is one of a number of good utilities for this , and once you see your worst time - wasters , you can also use it for the next strategy .
Block them .
Once you ’ve identified your worst time wasters , it ’s possible to block them with one of several utilities .
Stealth Kiwi and Leech Block are two of my favorites .
Unplug .
Another strategy that actually works really well is to unplug from the Internet when you really need to get work done .
When you finish you task , connect and have fun , then unplug again for some more serious work .
Go on a diet .
This is a more drastic strategy , but sometimes it ’s necessary if your addiction has gotten really bad .
Disconnect yourself from the Internet for at least a day , if not 2 - 3 days or even a week .
The worse your addiction , the longer your diet should be .
After the period of complete disconnection , follow Strategy 6 below by going on an extremely limited information diet .
Just let go .
This strategy is for those of us who feel that if we do n’t answer all of our emails , or read all of our feeds , or check our blog stats , or see what ’s happening on our favorite social sites , then somehow the world will fall apart .
Of course , we never put it that way in our head , but the urge is still there .
But what happens if you just let go , and allow your email to pile up for a day , or do n’t check your stats or your favorite forum ?
The world will go on .
This might seem obvious , but again , I think many of us have a subconscious idea that something bad will happen if we do n’t stay up to date .
Try letting go for a day , and see what happens .
Limit time .
This is actually the most sensible strategy , but of course it ’s not easy if you have an addiction .
Therefore , I recommend you use it in conjunction with one of the above strategies .
For this strategy , you decide how many minutes and how many times you are going to allow yourself to go on your worst time - wasting sites .
If email is your addiction , for example , you might decide to check email only twice a day for 30 minutes a session .
Decide on what time limit would work best for you , put it on a schedule ( 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. , for example ) , and stick to it .
If you have trouble sticking to it , try one of the other strategies .
OK , we ’ve identified some strategies for dealing with these time - wasters , so let ’s take a look at them .
Please note : if you have n’t already visited one of these time - wasters , I ’d advise that you do n’t do so now , especially if you have work to do .
Email .
Whether it ’s Gmail , Yahoo Mail , Hotmail , Outlook , or some other favorite email client , email is the king of time - wasters .
It ’s a very productive tool , of course , and a necessity for most of us these days .
However , it is also an addiction , and we often put off our work by going to check our email .
It ’s important that you turn off email notifications if you have work to do ( and you know you do ! ) , and limit your time spent checking and processing and responding to email .
Google Reader .
Any RSS feed reader , including Bloglines or Thunderbird , is included in this item .
If you have 100 + feeds to read every day , you ’ll spend a lot of time with your feed reader .
And any time you feel like procrastinating , you can open up the feed reader and see what new posts have been published .
Limit your feed reading to once a day , and cut your feeds down to a minimum .
AIM .
Or any chat client ( IRC , Googletalk , MSN Messenger , Yahoo , Skype , what have you ) .
If you ’ve always got your chat client open , even if you put your status as “ away ” or “ busy ” or something like that , you will be constantly interrupted by new messages , new people coming online , new people trying to get your attention .
Make your time yours by closing your chat client , and only opening it when you really need to chat .
Online solitaire .
Or any similar online games , including chess , sudoku , Bejeweled , whatever .
I know , it ’s addicting .
Block these games .
World of Warcraft .
Or any of the other popular MMORPGs .
People can spend days , nights , weeks on these things , as they are amazingly addicting .
In fact , they should be regulated like drugs .
Blogs .
Many people read blog posts through feed readers ( see Item # 2 ) , but many bookmark their favorite blogs and read them directly on the site , and find new blogs through the blogrolls of their favorite blogs , and spend a lot of time reading through archives and comments and also commenting on all these blogs .
It can take up your whole day .
Read Dumb Little Man and Zen Habits and a few others , and be done !
Forums .
Or newsgroups .
A favorite social hangout for many people , there are thousands of forums out there , and many of them are quite useful .
It can be a great thing to discover others who are going through the same things you are ( such as the quit smoking forum I joined a couple of years ago ) , or who are interested in the same things you are .
So I ’m not knocking forums at all .
But you should still set a time limit on how long you spend on forums , and maybe only do it once or twice a day .
News sites .
News addicts out there , you know who you are .
Some people are plugged into the news all day long .
Personally , I ’ve learned that the news does n’t benefit me at all , and I ’ve disconnected from watching the news , reading newspapers and reading news websites .
I still hear about the important stuff , but really , disconnecting from news has n’t hurt me a bit .
I ’m not saying you should go to this extreme , but you should still consider limiting your news consumption to a minimum .
YouTube .
You can spend hours upon hours watching cool stuff on YouTube , as every video has a dozen other related ones to get you to stay on the site .
And that really works .
I ’ve spent days on YouTube , to be truthful , before deciding never to do it again .
Now , I watch a video and then immediately close the tab .
Facebook / MySpace .
I ’m not an addict of either of these sites , but I can see the appeal .
My teen - age daughter is addicted , and I know many adults who are too .
There ’s no shame in that , but you should realize that it ’s an addiction , combining the appeal of blogs , email and forums .
Digg .
After spending an entire day reading the articles on Digg , and the comments , I cut myself off from Digg before a real addiction could form .
But I know first - hand that this can be very addicting .
There ’s a huge community on Digg , and there ’s always new stuff , and you could do nothing else but read through Digg .
Get off it before it consumes your life .
Productivity tools .
I ’ll admit , I ’m a victim of this .
New productivity tools are coming up all the time , from to - do list managers to contact managers to cool GTD tools to new utilities and plug-ins .
But it ’s not productive to be constantly switching tools and twiddling with them .
Online shopping .
Amazon , Ebay , and the hundreds of other popular shopping sites online .
The worst thing about these sites is that you do n’t only spend a lot of time on them ( there ’s so much stuff out there ! ) but you also end up spending a lot of money .
This was one reason I cut up my credit card .
ESPN.com .
I have n’t been a sports addict for years , but I know there are many out there who can spend a lot of time each day checking on scores , fantasy football stats , watching the action , watching replays , reading commentaries , and chatting on sports forums .
Sports fans , know that you just might have an addiction .
Humor sites .
When I find a great humor site , I can spend a long , long time reading through the archives .
If you have n’t gone to any of these sites , do n’t do it unless you have a day to waste : Maddox , Pointless Waste of Time , The Onion , The Daily Show , Comics Curmudgeon .
Wikipedia .
One of the most useful sites on the planet .
Also very addicting , especially if you become involved in contributing to the articles .
But even if you do n’t , one article leads to another , which leads to another … and there ’s your whole day .
Flickr .
People have got some great photos out there .
And they put up such personal stuff that surfing through Flickr is a new form of voyeurism .
An addicting form , that is .
IMDB .
Want to look up an actor or a movie title ?
Sure , just open up the Internet Movie Database , one of the greatest things ever invented , and do a quick search .
But hey , there ’s a link to another movie you ’re interested in , and wow , you forgot about that actor , and cool , there ’s trivia and goofs for that movie too .
Hours down the drain .
Ask MeFi .
MetaFilter has one of the best online communities around , but there ’s just so much stuff on there that you can never run out of reading material .
My favorite is Ask MetaFilter , in which you can find great answers to just about any question you can think of .
But what about this question , for all you Ask MeFi folks : “ Where did my day go ? ”
Blog stats .
If you are a blogger , there ’s a 99 % chance that you check your blog stats , and your ad stats , more than once a day .
And a very middling to good chance that you do it much more than that .
I ’m a victim of this , so I ca n’t preach , but here ’s a realization I came up with ( be prepared to be blown away ) : your stats and your ad revenues do n’t change much in 2 minutes .
And 2 minutes later , not much has changed still .
It took me way too long to realize this .

Australians tend to be easygoing people with a strong distrust of politicians of any party .
So when Sydney siders found out that we were getting kicked out of our own city for a week because we could n't be trusted , we reacted with anger .
That anger has now been going on for three months , and is going to reach it 's peak in a protest on Saturday where we will try to march along a protest route that takes us down streets that are walled off and guarded with police .
This is how much of Sydney is being shut down :
With fences like this
3 of the busiest train stations in Australia ?
Closed for 3 days .
The busiest ferry terminal in Australia ?
Closed for 3 days .
The world famous Opera House ?
Sorry , come back next week
This is the Opera House when the Queen of England visited last year
This is what it will look like when George Bush appears :
A quarter of the busiest CBD in Australia - Locked out unless you have a photopass and have consented to a security check that goes back for the last 10 years .
They were told that to obtain a photo identity they had to appear in person with photo identification .
At the Sydney Convention Centre they were confronted by a wall of police and security guards .
" You ca n't enter without your APEC photo ID passes , " a guard said , barring the way .
" But that 's what we have come to collect , " the reporters pleaded , waving emails advising that their passes had been approved .
The security officers went into a huddle before ruling the reporters could enter this time .
9 foot tall reinforced fences have appeared around all of the areas in Red .
If you take a photo of it , then police will approach and ask you to delete it .
Why ?
Well , it turns out no Australian can be trusted :
NSW Transport Minister John Watkins said that , while requiring tourists to delete photos of the APEC security fence running through Sydney 's CBD might be " over the top " , it is necessary .
He was responding today to reports that three German tourists were asked by police to delete digital photographs of the newly built fence , which stretches five kilometers through Sydney 's CBD .
He said the move was part of the efforts to ensure there was no breach during the major protests expected later this week .
" There is some concern among police that some of those protesters who are coming ... will look for weak points in the fence , " Mr Watkins told Southern Cross Broadcasting .
" And that one of the things they are doing is a recce of the fence to find where they can attack it .
" There are concerns , perhaps it 's a bit over the top , but you can understand the job of NSW Police is to keep us safe and APEC safe . "
The White House also showed how much they cared about our city when he this press release was issued
Thank you .
Good afternoon .
On Monday , President Bush will leave Washington and travel to Sidney , Australia , to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders meeting
...
But it will be the first time that he will have the opportunity to enjoy the hospitality of Sidney - siders
The embarrassing misspelling of Sydney was quickly corrected when Australian Reporters pointed it out , but Not everywhere got the memo .
The Sydney media has been increasingly critical of the circus over the last two months .
And now with the protests set to start , it will be interesting to see how the debacle is shown on the US Media .
I diaried earlier this year about Cheney 's visit to Australia , where the massed protests were ignored , but 3 people carrying a " Australia Loves Cheney " banner was headlined across the US .
Australians remember this as a time of road closures , extended traffic jams and us being locked out of our own city .
And the word from the Deputy Premier of NSW back in April was blunt .
He thinks the freeze on the CBD during APEC will be " 50 times " worse than that of the February visit of US Vice President Dick Cheney when teh Harbour had to be closed off .
Mr Watkins says the meeting should have been held in Canberra - a city custom - built to handle for big meetings and foreign VIPs .
Of course , it 's not as photogenic as Sydney .
In response , Mr Howard said he was " amazed " by the NSW Government 's attitude .
George Bush 's visit to Sydney looks like being the kiss of Death for his # 2 ally , John Howard .
We live in troubled times , where scientific research - at least in popular forums like newspapers - is only ever critiqued by ad hominem attacks on the person who did it .
Evidence showing that MMR is safe was rubbished , because some researchers once accepted a drug company ballpoint ; and similarly , when the MMR scare died in the popular imagination , it was n't because of the evidence , but because Andrew Wakefield was shown to have personally profited from legal cases and applied for potentially lucrative patents for the alternatives to MMR .
It would have been less complicated if everyone had just looked at the data .
But how bad would someone have to be for you to completely disregard the findings from their research , simply on the grounds of who they were ?
An adulterer ?
A recipient of private consulting fees ?
How about a cold - blooded racist , homophobic mass murderer ?
This Sunday a smoking ban comes into force .
In 1950 Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill published a preliminary " case - control study " - where you gather cases of lung cancer , and find similar people who do n't have the disease , and compare the lifestyle risk factors between the groups - which showed a strong relationship with smoking .
The British Doctors Study in 1954 , looking at 40,000 people , confirmed the finding .
You would n't know it , but the Nazis beat them to it .
The Germans had identified a rise in lung cancer as early as the 1920s , but they had suggested - quite reasonably - that it might be related to exposure to poison gas in the great war .
In the UK , Doll and Bradford Hill were wondering if it might be related to tarmac , or petrol .
Then , during the 1930s , identifying toxic threats in the environment became an important feature of the Nazi project to build a master race through " racial hygiene " .
In 1943 two researchers , Schairer and Schöniger , published their own case - control study in the journal Zeitschuft für Krebsforschung , demonstrating a relationship between smoking and lung cancer almost a decade before any researchers elsewhere .
It was n't mentioned in the classic Doll and Bradford Hill paper of 1950 , and if you check in the Science Citation Index , the paper was referred to only four times in the 1960s , once in the 1970s , and then not again until 1988 .
In fact , it was forgotten .
It 's not hard to understand why : Nazi scientific and medical research was so bound up in the horrors of cold - blooded mass murder , and the strange puritanical ideologies of nazism , that it was almost universally disregarded , and with good reason .
Doctors had been active participants in the Nazi project , and joined Hitler 's National Socialist party in greater numbers than any other profession ( 45 % were party members , compared with 20 % of teachers ) .
Figures on the smoking project included racial theorists , but also researchers interested in the heritability of frailties created by tobacco , and the question of whether men could be rendered degenerate by their environment .
Research on smoking was directed by Karl Astel , who helped to organise the " euthanasia " operation that murdered 200,000 mentally and physically disabled people , and assisted in the " final solution of the Jewish question " as head of the office of racial affairs .
Earlier this year this paper ran a news story in which criticism was made of Sir Richard Doll , suggesting that his impartiality was somehow affected simply because he had occasionally accepted finance from industry .
But medical statisticians like Doll save lives on a scale in the millions .
What would it take for me to doubt Doll 's data ?
If you showed me he was a cold - blooded racist mass murderer , I 'd still read his papers carefully .

A pre-production drawing of Gromit in action ( Aardman 2007 )
Nick Park interview
Aardman Animations has announced that the cheese - loving inventor and his loyal dog will star in Trouble At ' Mill - to screen on BBC One in late 2008 .
Creator Nick Park said : " The story takes Wallace and Gromit in a direction we have n't seen before - both emotionally and technically . "
Shooting starts in January at Aardman studios in Bristol .
Trouble At ' Mill is a murder mystery that sees Wallace and Gromit running a bakery business - with their house converted into a granary with ovens and robotic kneading arms .
Hollywood ' pressure '
The new film will reunite Nick Park with writer Bob Baker who co-wrote both The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave .
It is the first outing for Wallace and Gromit since The Curse of the Were - Rabbit , which won the Oscar for best animated feature in 2006 .
Mr Park said he was looking forward to making a short film after the pressure of a Hollywood feature .
I 'm making this for myself again and the people who love Wallace and Gromit
Nick Park
" This one we 're making for the BBC .
It 's going to be a seven or eight - month shoot .
That 's faster than we 've ever done it before , " he told the BBC News website .
" It 's nice to be out of that feature film pressure now .
I do n't feel like I 'm making a film for a kid in some suburb of America - and being told they 're not going to understand a joke , or a northern saying .
" I 'm making this for myself again and the people who love Wallace and Gromit . "
A video interview with Nick Park about Trouble At ' Mill can be seen at www.wallaceandgromit.com.
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Just how red - hot is the current worldwide expansion ?
" This is far and away the strongest global economy I 've seen in my business lifetime , " U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson declared on a recent visit to Fortune 's offices .
That may come as news to many Americans , whose boom - time memories are stuck in the 1990s , when Silicon Valley was the epicenter of our growth fantasies .
But the fellow now occupying Paulson 's old office at 85 Broad Street in downtown Manhattan shares that upbeat view .
Just returned from a ribbon - cutting ceremony in the Middle East , Goldman Sachs ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein waves out toward the East River as he explains how the rise of the " BRICs " has altered his strategy and his travel schedule .
( BRIC is an acronym Goldman coined in 2001 reflecting the rising economic power of Brazil , Russia , India , and China . )
" I helped make my career by being very disciplined about opening offices , " he says .
Yet in nine months Blankfein has announced or opened offices in S�o Paulo , Moscow , Tel Aviv , Mumbai , Qatar , and now Dubai .
" We 've never done anything close to that before , " he marvels .
" The week before Dubai , I was in Turkey , and before that , Russia and China .
I 'm really living the BRICs - plus - Middle East kind of life . "
These days more and more CEOs are livin ' la vida BRIC .
GE's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) Jeff Immelt devotes 12 weeks a year to foreign travel and is looking for his company to grow " twice as fast outside the U.S. as inside - 12 % a year , vs. 6 % . " Immelt expects to see even more robust growth - 20 % a year - in emerging markets , which last year accounted for $ 30 billion of GE 's nearly $ 170 billion in sales .
John Chambers , who last fall opened Cisco's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) new Globalization Center in Bangalore , seconds the notion that " this is the strongest global trend " of his career .
" There is a unique balance today , " he says .
" More than half of GDP growth is coming from emerging countries .
And yet the developed countries are also doing pretty well .
It is something we have never seen before . "
At Boeing ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Jim McNerney and his team , just back from the Paris Air Show , have booked 634 firm orders for their new 787 jet , which they will unveil in Seattle on 7/8/07 ( ah , marketing ! ) .
That 's more than for any launch in industry history , and thanks go " predominantly to Asian and other emerging - market buyers , " says Laurette Koellner , president of Boeing International .
While the current pace is n't quite a record - according to the IMF the world grew at a 5.4 % average annual rate from 1970 to 1973 , vs. a projected 4.9 % from 2003 through 2007 - there 's really no contest .
When our ties were fatter and we were thinner , total world GDP was $ 13 trillion in constant dollars .
Today it 's more than $ 36 trillion .
Not to mention , as investor Jim Rogers notes , " there are three billion people in places like Eastern Europe , Russia , India , China , and all of Asia who were n't participating last time around but who now are . "
Back then , Germany and Japan led the charge .
Now the emerging markets are running fastest , along with Europe , which has - for the first time in years - pulled ahead of the U.S. in GDP growth .
The last global good time in the 1970s , of course , ended in a nasty bout of double - digit inflation , spawning the worst stock market crash since the Great Depression , plus other horrors , such as the rise of disco .
Is that sorry past our future ?
Not necessarily .
But with nervousness rising over everything from Bear Stearns ' battered hedge funds to tightening lending standards that could clog the crowded private - equity deal pipeline , let us first explain how one can be , as we are , short - term bearish but long - run bullish on the global growth story .
When it comes to markets , we hold these truths to be self - evident : ( 1 ) It 's never different this time , and ( 2 ) Every boom leads to financial excesses that spark its undoing .
( That 's why they 're called business cycles . )
" The necessary conditions for a bubble to form are quite simple and number only two , " investor Jeremy Grantham noted in a recent newsletter headlined " The First Truly Global Bubble . "
" First , the fundamental economic conditions must look at least excellent - and near perfect is better .
Second , liquidity must be generous in quantity and price :
It must be easy and cheap to leverage . "
That pretty much sums up the world we 've been living in , a world where prices skyrocketed for Miami condos , Indian stocks , and office towers in Dubai .
Now , though , with interest rates going up , heavily leveraged hedge funds and private - equity firms - not to mention cash - short adjustable - mortgage holders and the bankers who 've lent to all three groups - have trillions of reasons to worry .
Wilbur Ross , who earned a fortune correctly timing the distressed debt market , is among those who see a " real risk " of a credit shock .
The subprime meltdown in the U.S. , Ross believes , " is n't remotely over . "
" More important , " he adds , " the same lack of discipline in extending credit has very much become prevalent in the corporate market as well . "
Since liquidity is more about crowd psychology than the actual money , a financial implosion could spook lenders , cutting off the easy financing that has fueled the record M&A and LBO booms and helped lift stocks to new heights .
( That 's why they 're called credit crunches . )
Then there 's the really scary stuff : the prospect of a conflict in the Middle East that spills into full - blown war , an act of nuclear terrorism , and the like .
Such " exogenous shocks , " in the clinical argot of economists , would likely cause far more lasting damage than any mere market correction .
In that sense " globalization remains a delicate phenomenon , " says historian Niall Ferguson , whose writings offer vivid reminders of how the chaos of world war ended the first great round of this process early in the last century - and could do so again .
Still , as long as some big geopolitical turmoil does n't break out - and we 're talking Ferguson - level large and bloody , as in August 1914 , not October 1973 - the world economy should continue to benefit from globalization .
Cross - border trade has soared since the early 1970s to record levels of world GDP .
Cross - border financial flows have grown even faster , at a nearly 11 % compound annual growth rate since 1990 , according to McKinsey & Co. ( Disclosure : I do occasional projects for McKinsey . )
Much of that investment has generated strong returns , judging by one key measure : Since 1998 , GDP per capita in the developing world has risen 4.5 % a year , twice the rate of the advanced economies .
The bottom line :
If you look past the market 's cyclical gyrations , deep secular shifts in technology , productivity , and patterns of consumption do , indeed , " change everything " - or at least change a lot of things .
Consider Cisco .
Anyone who bought its stock , now at $ 28 , near the $ 80 peak seven years ago is still hurting .
( And if you bought it on margin , God bless you . )
But though the bursting of the tech bubble vaporized trillions of dollars of wealth , the revolution marched on .
Today over 500 million households are connected to the Internet , more than double the number in 2000 - and half live in the emerging world .
Cisco itself now enjoys sales of nearly $ 30 billion ( up from some $ 19 billion in fiscal 2000 ) , and profits have more than doubled .
The long view matters .
Which is why , having made billions by betting that rising emerging - world demand would spur consolidation in the long - moribund steel industry , Wilbur Ross is now trying to ride a similar trend in auto parts .
Since August 2004 he has built up a $ 5 - billion - a - year parts supplier from scratch , mostly by acquiring companies overseas on the cheap - " without adding debt , " he hastens to add .
It 's why real estate billionaire Sam Zell , no dewy - eyed optimist but a tough , successful bargain hunter with a bad - ass nickname ( " Gravedancer " ) , even ventures to suggest how things really are different this time .
During the 1970s oil producers squandered their newfound gains by making government bank loans to " countries incapable of using it , " he says .
" Now it 's mostly going into rainy - day funds or into productive private investments in places like China and India .
That 's a whole different kettle of fish from what we dealt with in the past . "
And it's why the transformations we 've witnessed during this go - go beginning to the 21st century are mere prologue .

" We want to go global by going East , not West , " says Mohamed Ali Alabbar , the dynamic chairman of Emaar Properties , onstage at the Madinat Jumeirah resort in Dubai .
The crowd in the cavernous room divides sartorially between business - suits - and - ties and white - robes - with - burnooses .
Outside , motorized dhows ply canals lined with gleaming luxury hotels and shops .
Up and down the main road hundreds of cranes twist under the desert sun , as builders race to erect more skyscrapers more quickly than anyplace on earth - among them Emaar 's own Burj Dubai , which , when completed next year , will claim the title of world 's tallest building .
But this morning Ali Alabbar is talking mainly about the scores of malls and housing developments he plans to build in India and North Africa .
" The West has got aging populations and aging economies , " he says .
" The East is where the true glamour lies . "
Ouch .
Still , the man has a point .
As the action moves to emerging economies , think of what 's playing out as a global version of America 's postwar boom .
To catch up , these large populations first require commodities and basic building materials - witness the threefold - plus increase in prices of steel , oil , and copper since 2000 .
Then , as incomes rise , they spur vast new markets for everything from detergents to cellphones , from airports to hospitals .
The McKinsey Global Institute forecasts that over the next decade nearly 450 million newcomers will join the middle class in China and India alone .
Sam Zell is a believer : " I think this consumption story is kicking in on a worldwide basis . "
To get his share he bought big stakes in two public homebuilding companies in Brazil and Mexico and in the last year has begun investing in new low - cost housing in China and Egypt .
At the same time , growing economies give rise to a new crowd of competitors and entrepreneurs .
Think Brazilian jetmaker Embraer or Chinese PC maker Lenovo or Indian expatriate Lakshmi Mittal , who has built a steel colossus with some 10 % of global market share .
Surely it 's early days for this trend , you say ?
" I hope it 's early days , " counters Goldman 's Blankfein , " because we 're investing now from the point of view that this has crossed a tipping point .
You ignore the emergence of these new entrepreneurs at the peril not just of losing share in a local market , but of threatening your global franchise . "
Jeff Immelt is n't making that mistake .
Last fall he took a list created by Boston Consulting Group of the 100 most important companies in developing economies and arrayed it into four camps : customers , suppliers , competitors , and nonaligned .
" I tell my leadership team , ' Our goal for this group is to have lots of customers , lots of suppliers - and no competitors , ' " he says .
To stay ahead , Immelt is pushing GE hard into an advanced phase of globalization he calls " in country , for the world . "
That may sound like some celebrity ditty composed for Live Earth , but Immelt is quite serious .
He believes that by figuring out how to meet demand in these still relatively poor growth markets , he 's going to achieve hard - to - imagine price breakthroughs .
And here 's what 's truly radical :
As GE and others do this , these products wo n't just be sold in emerging markets .
Instead they 'll filter back into the rich economies - a new deflationary force that should delight buyers but devastate competitors who lack a global footprint .
Examples ?
" Water , " says Immelt .
" There 's a shortage everywhere , even in places like California and Florida .
Some systems we 're working on in the Middle East , India , and China are trying to do water desalination at $ 0.001 per milliliter , which is an off - the - charts low cost .
We 'll never hit that in the U.S.
But we 'll hit it someplace outside .
And the second we do , a huge market is going to open up inside as well . "
Immelt sees the same thing happening with coal - sequestration technology or MRI scanners , where GE is working on a product in China that could cut prices in half .
" At the right cost point , you not only sell it in China , you open up a market among the 35 % of U.S. hospitals that today cannot afford to have an MR scanner , " he says .
" We 've got 15 or 20 projects like this that are going to open up big markets around the world over the next five years . "
GE 's not alone .
Another market to watch : small cars , where the big American , Japanese , and Korean makers are now tussling with locals to grab share in China and India .
The new models that emerge will first be sold locally and then to other emerging countries .
" But believe me , the goal is n't just emerging markets , " says Hari Nair , president of international for auto parts maker Tenneco , which today gets 58 % of its sales overseas .
This intense competition is spurring innovation , such as the work Nair 's team is doing in India to help Tata Motors introduce a " one lakh " car by 2009 .
( A lakh is 100,000 , as in rupees , or roughly $ 2,500 . )
" These environments challenge you to do things you never imagined , " says Nair .
" You ca n't just rely on the traditional markets of the West .
You 've got to be part of new ways of doing business . "

" Sustaining the miracle . "
That was the theme of a conference I hosted as Fortune 's deputy editor in May 1997 in Bangkok , a few weeks before a run on the Thai baht metastasized into a vicious deflationary spiral that soon threatened all Asia - and for a time , it seemed , the global economy .
Did anyone gassing on in Bangkok see it coming ?
Ha !
It 's cold comfort to note we were n't alone .
The World Bank had just published a special report on the East Asia economic miracle .
The airwaves and op - ed pages back then were larded with paeans extolling " Asian values . "
But the truth is , we blew it .
Here 's the other funny thing , though :
Ten years later it 's clear that , despite the very real pain , it was all little more than a bad bump on an upward road .
So where does the world stand today ?
A little less complacent , at least measured by column inches and airtime .
Not a day passes that someone does n't fret about any number of potential buzz killers : protectionist sentiment in Congress ; the humongous U.S. current - account deficit ; unprecedented levels of debt buoyed up by know - nothing - and - don't - want - to lenders ; the housing slump ; and more .
On the other hand , measured by what really matters - the money - Mr. Market so far does n't seem too rattled .
Risk spreads , or the gap between historically sketchy paper , such as emerging - market debt or junk bonds , and risk - free Treasuries remain near all - time lows .
Somebody 's wrong .
Our guess - and that 's all it is - is that the next big move wo n't be up .
Alan Greenspan pondered this scenario in his farewell address at the Fed 's annual shindig in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , two years ago .
Quoth the maestro : " Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and , as a consequence , lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher asset prices .
This is the reason that history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums . "
Translation :
If a correction occurs , what went up fastest - historically more volatile things like Shanghai shares , Turkish bonds , or the last LBO through the gate , say - will go down even faster .
( On Wall Street the pros call that kind of volatility an asset 's " beta " - it 's a Greek term , but think of it this way : as in " beta beware . " )
Assuming history at some point proves yet again unkind , we do n't pretend to know how far things will fall , or when they will bounce back .
Nor are we ready to buy the notion whispered in some circles that , hey , since global growth is already so robust , if the U.S. goes into recession , ca n't the rest of the world keep chugging ?
That day may come , but it 's not here yet .
As the world 's champion buyer of last resort , the U.S. consumer right now remains the global economy 's broad - shouldered , albeit increasingly weary , Atlas .
If Atlas shrugs ... look out below .
So while it 's a wonderful world , as Hank Paulson notes , " it pays to be vigilant . "
When it comes to financial shocks , Paulson says , we have n't repealed the laws of " economic gravity , " so " it 's when , not if . "
( See more of Paulson 's comments on the world 's economy . )
Here 's how Lloyd Blankfein is reconciling that potential for short - term fear with long - term optimism .
Even as his firm expands abroad , he has lately been lengthening debt maturities ( thus lessening Goldman 's interest rate risk ) .
And he 's been making sure he has plenty of cash on hand , just in case : $ 50 billion or more by the latest count .
Sounds right .
There 's going to be a lot of growth ahead - for those who stick around to enjoy it .

The US government is turning to blogs and possibly to the virtual wasteland known as Second Life to step up its faltering information war against Islamist extremists .
But critics remain unimpressed , saying the measures are n't enough to counter a massive internet campaign that spreads pro-terrorist messages to people in Islamic countries .
On Thursday , Duncan MacInnes , of the State Department 's bureau of international information programs , told a congressional subcommittee that government spinmeisters are on the case .
In the last year , they 've launched a digital outreach team , which employs Arabic speakers to challenge anti-American misrepresentations on influential Arabic - language blogs and other places in cyberspace .
" We are currently in the process of expanding the original team of two Arabic bloggers to six , while also adding one Urdu and two Farsi ( Persian ) linguists , " MacInnes said in prepared remarks ( PDF here ) submitted to the House Armed Services Committee 's panel of terrorism .
" We are also exploring how we can use the applicability of our mission of new cyber - technologies such as Second Life and cell phone games to further advance our mission . "
He said an Arabic website used to counter violent extremism attracts more than 200,000 visitors per month from countries including Saudi Arabia , Egypt , the United Arab Emirates and Morocco .
A separate Persian site , he said , " has been highly successful , " averaging 42,000 users per week .
Critics include US Representative and chair of the terrorism subcommittee Adam Smith , who is less than impressed with the State Department 's tepid response to the extremist propaganda .
" My sense after the hearing remains that we are not adequately resourcing our online activities , both in terms of funding and in terms of giving the people on the front lines authority to act outside of a lengthy bureaucratic review process , " he wrote in this comment on Wired News .
" We 're also not doing enough to reach out to online communities and bloggers based here in the US to get the benefit of their expertise . "
Smith was largely echoing the sentiments of Wired News writer Noah Shachtman , who previewed the hearing .
" Ummmm ....
Two bloggers , and 200,000 visitors - that 's kind of small potatoes , right ? "
Shachtman wrote .
Grass roots efforts to seed pro-US sentiments would be more successful if the 180,000 American troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan were encouraged to blog about their experiences , he argued .
Alas , US army regulations require all soldiers to get a supervisor 's approval before posting information in a public forum . ®
A few people have been asking what I have been up to recently , and what I intend to do during these strange and uncertain times .
It ’s clearly difficult as an artist to display your work if people are only allowed within 2 metres of each other , but art I find always finds a way .
Obviously all galleries and exhibitions are closed across the world for the unforeseeable future – something that still sounds strange to read out loud – and it ’s difficult to predict when they ’ll next open , with many galleries being such intimate venues .
However , I still have my oils and a few blank canvases , so I will continue to create new pieces during my free time off work as I have always done .
Work in my day job had died down somewhat , but it ’s still there for me , so I am fortunate enough to be able to leave the house once in a while ( even essential workers lose their keys sometime ) – and with riots happening in the streets , crime at an all time high , and lockdown rules being eased , I find myself getting called out more and more for locksmith jobs more and more .
Unfortunately this means I have less time to spend on my art , but I feel it will be quite some time before galleries are yet to be reopened , and even creating street art would n’t be possible at the moment unless I ruin the oils by spraying the canvas with disinfectant !
Stay tuned though , the sun will rise once again .
Craig Franklin never dreamed he’d be writing a feature story for the Christian Science Monitor , just as Reed Walters never expected to see his name gracing the pages of the New York Times Op - Ed page .
There is an old rule in journalism ; when you ca n’t wring another drop of juice out of a story , flip the script–tell the world the press has been getting it wrong .
Telling the “ real story ” about Jena has become a cottage industry .
“ Jena ” has always been a disagreement between Alan Bean and Craig Franklin , co-editor of the Jena Times .
Craig and his father , Sammy Franklin devoted several gallons of ink to the noose incident and the arrest and prosecution of the Jena 6 .
My “ Responding to the Crisis in Jena , Louisiana ” narrative owed much to the copious detail of their reporting .
The Franklins publish a first class small - town newspaper .
Those of you who have been reading my posts wo n’t need to read Franklin ’s deathless prose ( you ’ve heard it all before ) or my responses ( I will touch on a few new issues , but not many ) .
But if you are new to this debate , this back - and - forth discussion should proove instructive .
My comments appear in italics .
Media myths about the Jena 6
A local journalist tells the story you have n’t heard .
By now , almost everyone in America has heard of Jena , La. , because they ’ve all heard the story of the “ Jena 6 . ”
White students hanging nooses barely punished , a schoolyard fight , excessive punishment for the six black attackers , racist local officials , public outrage and protests – the outside media made sure everyone knew the basics .
There ’s just one problem :
The media got most of the basics wrong .
In fact , I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism .
Myths replaced facts , and journalists abdicated their solemn duty to investigate every claim because they were seduced by a powerfully appealing but false narrative of racial injustice .
I would suggest that coverage of the march to Iraq would constitute a much more serious media meltdown .
As you will see from later comments , most of the “ myths ” Franklin addresses rarely appear in mainstream reporting .
Howard
Witt of the Chicago Tribune , the first mainstream journalist to cover the story on the national level , spent a week in Jena before writing a word .
Dozens of reporters have followed in his footsteps ( to the point where overwhelmed Jena residents refuse to comment ) and most of them have been equally careful .
I should know .
I live in Jena .
My wife has taught at Jena High School for many years .
And most important , I am probably the only reporter who has covered these events from the very beginning .
Actually , Abbey Brown of the Alexandria TownTalk and Tony Brown , an Alexandria journalist and talk show host , have given careful attention to this story from the day nooses appeared on a tree at the high school .
The reason the Jena cases have been propelled into the world spotlight is two - fold : First , because local officials did not speak publicly early on about the true events of the past year , the media simply formed their stories based on one - side ’s statements – the Jena 6 .
Second , the media were downright lazy in their efforts to find the truth .
Often , they simply reported what they ’d read on blogs , which expressed only one side of the issue .
Few mainstream reporters have repeated blog gossip–they prefer to copy one another .
The real story of Jena and the Jena 6 is quite different from what the national media presented .
It ’s time to set the record straight .
Myth 1 : The Whites - Only Tree .
There has never been a “ whites - only ” tree at Jena High School .
Students of all races sat underneath this tree .
When a student asked during an assembly at the start of school last year if anyone could sit under the tree , it evoked laughter from everyone present – blacks and whites .
As reported by students in the assembly , the question was asked to make a joke and to drag out the assembly and avoid class .
The “ lazy Negro theory ” was invented to address an obvious question : “ If the Jena high school courtyard is as integrated as Mr. Franklin claims , why did Kenneth Purvis ask if he could sit under the tree ?
I do not know if Mr. Purvis was laughing nervously as he asked the question , and I do n’t see that it matters .
Initially , Jena
High students , black and white , freely admitted that the courtyard has always been segregated –the sidewalk serving as the line of demarcation .
While it is true that black students occasionally wandered to the white side of the courtyard , this was not typical behavior .
Hence the question .
It should also be noted that Kenneth and a few friends tested out their new freedom by sitting under the tree after school .
Myth 2 : Nooses a Signal to Black Students .
An investigation by school officials , police , and an FBI agent revealed the true motivation behind the placing of two nooses in the tree the day after the assembly .
According to the expulsion committee , the crudely constructed nooses were not aimed at black students .
Instead , they were understood to be a prank by three white students aimed at their fellow white friends , members of the school rodeo team .
( The students apparently got the idea from watching episodes of “ Lonesome Dove . ” )
The committee further concluded that the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history .
When informed of this history by school officials , they became visibly remorseful because they had many black friends .
Another myth concerns their punishment , which was not a three - day suspension , but rather nine days at an alternative facility followed by two weeks of in - school suspension , Saturday detentions , attendance at Discipline Court , and evaluation by licensed mental - health professionals .
The students who hung the nooses have not publicly come forward to give their version of events .
There are actually three competing noose theories .
The default position is well known : the nooses were hung in response to Kenneth Purvis ’s question and the bold action of actually sitting under the tree .
Recently , Jena residents have suggested the nooses were aimed at supporters of Jena ’s next football opponent –the Mustangs .
The Lonesome Dove theory was initially freestanding : the kids watched the Western on television and were so impressed with the hanging scene , they decided to hang a few nooses of their own .
But no one could explain why they chose this particular tree , or why the nooses appeared the day after Kenneth ’s question and the Principal ’s answer .
Now we learn that the nooses were a poke at white members of the rodeo team .
We are to believe that some white kids on the rodeo team were playfully suggesting that they were going to string up other white members of the team because . . .
You see the problem .
What could possibly follow the “ because ” ?
Mr. Franklins ’ desperation is painfully evident at this point .
He ’s doing the best with what he ’s got–but he ain’t got much .
You can hardly blame the mainstream media ( or any sensible person ) for preferring the original explanation .
It has the advantage of making sense .
Finally , Franklin ’s theory can’t explain why then - principal Scott Windham was so horrified by the noose incident that he recommended expulsion for the school year .
If this was simply a white - on - white practical joke , Windham ’s response can only be seen as a bizarre over - reaction .
The logical conclusion is that Windham was never exposed to the theory Mr. Franklin is selling .
Is it just a coincidence that Mr. Windham was quickly shuffled to a less controversial position within the school administration .
Perhaps , but the timing raises questions .
The mainstream media , for better or worse , has given very little attention to this issue .
Myth 3 : Nooses Were a Hate Crime .
Although many believe the three white students should have been prosecuted for a hate crime for hanging the nooses , the incident did not meet the legal criteria for a federal hate crime .
It also did not meet the standard for Louisiana ’s hate - crime statute , and though widely condemned by all officials , there was no crime to charge the youths with .
Last week , US Attorney Don Washington , finally admitted that the noose hanging in Jena constituted a hate crime under federal law .
Richard Cohen of the Southern Poverty Law Center has argued persuasively that the act also satisfies the Louisiana definition of a hate crime .
But , like Mr. Cohen , I agree with the basic thrust of Franklin ’s argument here –the noose hangers should not have been charged with committing a hate crime because they are juveniles who did n’t understand the full import of their actions .
I have no doubt that the noose hangers would have felt remorse if the horror of the noose symbol had been adequately explained to them ; but I remain skeptical .
Now that the “ remorseful noose boys ” theory is on the table , I ’m sure the media will report it ; but this new wrinkle only surfaced last week .
Myth 4 : DA ’s Threat to Black Students .
When District Attorney Reed Walters spoke to Jena High students at an assembly in September , he did not tell black students that he could make their life miserable with “ the stroke of a pen . ”
Instead , according to Walters , “ two or three girls , white girls , were chit- chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones right in the middle of my dissertation .
I got a little irritated at them and said , ‘ Pay attention to me .
I am right now having to deal with an aggravated rape case where I ’ve got to decide whether the death penalty applies or not . ’
I said , ‘ Look , I can be your best friend or your worst enemy .
With the stroke of a pen I can make your life miserable so I want you to call me before you do something stupid . ' ”
Mr. Walters had been called to the assembly by police , who had been at the school earlier that day dealing with some students who were causing disturbances .
Teachers and students have confirmed Walters ’s version of events .
No one has ever suggested that Reed Walters threatened to make the lives of students “ miserable ” –he said he could make their lives disappear ( a slight difference in tone , you ’ll agree ) .
Also , we must remember that school assemblies in Jena have traditionally been segregated .
That ’s the way it was when the high school integrated in 1970 ; and that ’s the way it has remained .
Black students insist he was looking at the black side of the auditorium when he issued his threat ; but I do n’t think it matters where he was looking .
We are being asked to believe that an irate Reed Walters told chatty white girls that he would use the power of his office to destroy their lives if they did n’t shut up .
This is nonsense ; but even if it ’s true , is that the kind of prosecutor you want in the LaSalle Parish courthouse ?
The mainstream media has never done much with this episode–even though Reed Walters has admitted under oath that he uttered these threats four months after I attributed the words to him back in February .
Walters even explained the context of his remarks ( and it had nothing to do with talkative white girls ) .
At a June 12th hearing , Mr. Walters explained that he did n’t see why he needed to take time away from his important work simply because high school students had blown the noose incident out of proportion .
The black and white students , he testified , should have been able to “ work things out on their own ” .
Reed Walters understood why he was standing in the school auditorium .
Black students and their parents were outraged by the decision to treat the noose incident as a childish prank .
Earlier that day , virtually the entire black student body , led by the boys we now know as the Jena 6 , had taken a defiant stand under the now - famous tree .
Most white kids had no problem with this gesture–but some took offense .
Push was coming to shove .
Racially charged shoving matches had been reported .
Tensions ran high .
Reed Walters came to Jena High School to calm things down .
Like Superintendent Breithaupt , Reed Walters believed the students and their parents were making a mountain out of a molehill .
His message was simple : drop the protest or I will use my prosecutorial authority to make you wish you had .
Settle down and I ’ll be your best friend ; keep fussing and I ’ll be your worst enemy .
Given the context , that is the only message that makes sense .
What else could Walters have been driving at .
His words were addressed to the kids causing the fuss–and those kids were all black .
True , a vocal minority within the white student body took violent exception to the protest under the tree–but then , so did Mr. Walters .
Mr. Franklin neglects to mention that black parents attended a school board meeting in the wake of the disciplinary committees ’ decision to over - rule the recommendation of the principal .
The parents were refused a hearing because they were n’t on the agenda .
Shortly thereafter , the same parents made a brief presentation to the school board ( a meeting covered in detail by the Jena Times ) and were greeted with silence .
Why , if the school board had been swayed by the white - on - white hate crime theory did they not explain themselves to these parents ?
The two groups had a simple difference of opinion and eight of the nine board members were white .
They could do whatever they wanted to do , so they sat in stony silence .
Reed Walters was right about one thing–in “ Lord of the Flies ” fashion , the white and black students were left to “ work things out for themselves ” .
And sure enough , the prosecutor was waiting at the end of the trail , pen in hand .
The mainstream media , I must stress again , has never understood how damning all of this is for the DA .
Even bloggers tend to pass over the pen incident .
Myth 5 : The Fair Barn Party Incident .
On Dec. 1 , 2006 , a private party – not an all - white party as reported – was held at the local community center called the Fair Barn .
Robert Bailey Jr. , soon to be one of the Jena 6 , came to the party with others seeking admittance .
When they were denied entrance by the renter of the facility , a white male named Justin Sloan ( not a Jena High student ) at the party attacked Bailey and hit him in the face with his fist .
This is reported in witness statements to police , including the victim , Robert Bailey , Jr .
Months later , Bailey contended he was hit in the head with a beer bottle and required stitches .
No medical records show this ever occurred .
Mr. Sloan was prosecuted for simple battery , which according to Louisiana law , is the proper charge for hitting someone with a fist .
Robert Bailey Jr. did n’t wait several months to come up with the “ bottle ” theory ; that was his story when I interviewed him for two hours in the LaSalle Parish jail back in January of 2007 and he has never deviated from it .
The fact that he did n’t mention every detail of the assault in his report to the police does n’t mean it did n’t happen .
But the bottle rarely appears in mainstream reporting because the Fair Barn incident is rarely discussed .
The 22 year - 0ld white male who assaulted Robert Bailey as he entered the Fair Barn continued his aggressively violent behavior even after adult chaperons had restrained him .
Hostilities continued in the parking lot .
The “ lone assailant ” theory runs contrary to everything we know about adolescent fights .
When your buddy throws a punch , you jump in to show you ’ve got his back .
The same social dynamic was on display , with tragic consequences , at the high school a few days later .
There are several alternative explanations for the assault on Robert Bailey .
Some Jena residents have suggested that Robert was attacked because he was leaving the dance with a white girl .
Eye witness testimony lends no support to this version of events ; I mention it only to indicate the power of rumor .
The story was told , and a lot of people believed it .
The common explanation , repeated here by Editor Franklin , is that Robert Bailey was trespassing and his assailant found this offensive .
Robert claims he was allowed to enter the dance with the proviso that he not cause trouble .
That last bit adds credence to the story–it ’s not the sort of thing Robert would have invented .
Several eye witnesses back up Robert ’s account .
Let ’s leave it to the lawyers to sort this one out , but it would be surprising for the police to limit the filing of charges to Robert ’s attacker if they believed Robert had openly defied the party gatekeeper .
If that had been true , a charge of disturbing the peace or disorderly conduct would have been virtually inevitable .
The important question is never addressed : Why was Robert ’s attacker so angry ?
There is a backstory here that has never been told .
This was n’t the first encounter between the two young men .
They , and their friends , had been feuding ever since the noose incident .
Myth 6 : The “ Gotta - Go ” Grocery Incident .
On Dec. 2 , 2006 , Bailey and two other black Jena High students were involved in an altercation at this local convenience store , stemming from the incident that occurred the night before .
The three were accused by police of jumping a white man as he entered the store and stealing a shotgun from him .
The two parties gave conflicting statements to police .
However , two unrelated eye witnesses of the event gave statements that corresponded with that of the white male .
I congratulate Mr. Franklin for his frank admission that the Gotta Go incident was related to the fight at the Fair Barn .
But how are the two events related ?
Robert claims that Matt Wyndham , the boy with the shotgun , was one of the people who jumped him at the dance .
The Gotta
Go incident cannot be understood unless this connection is recognized .
Again , the mainstream media generally skips over the convenience store incident ; bloggers are much more likely to give the altercation the attention it deserves .
Everyone agrees that Robert Bailey and two friends , Theo Shaw and Ryan Simmons , were exiting the Gotta Go just as Matt Wyndham was approaching the store , that a fight ensued , and that a shotgun was involved in some way .
Two explanations have been put forward .
Mr. Wyndam seems to suggest that Robert and his friends stole his gun and then beat him up .
This is why the three boys stand accused of theft and assault .
One thing is clear : Robert was confronting a kid who had jumped him the night before .
Robert had a score to settle .
Fearing the worst , Matt Windham ran back to his vehicle to get his pistol - grip , pump-action shotgun .
It is not unusual for young men who live in the country around Jena to ride with this sort of weapon .
It is also clear that Windham had time to remove the shotgun from behind the seat of his truck before Robert arrived on the scene .
Now , imagine that you are Robert Bailey .
Maybe you just wanted to have a few words with your assailant ; maybe you wanted a taste of revenge .
Who knows ?
What we do know is that Robert followed Wyndham to his truck and saw him pull out a shotgun .
Theo and Ryan dived behind parked vehicles .
Robert would have done the same , but he was too close to the man with the gun ; so he grabbed Wyndham ’s arm and they wrestled for control of the weapon .
Now , imagine you are Theo Shaw and Ryan Simmons .
You see your buddy wrestling for control of a dangerous weapon with the kid who helped beat him up the night before .
What do you do ?
You help your friend .
In the circumstances , no other course of action is even thinkable .
Nor is it surprising that , collectively , Robert and his friends were able to get the gun away from their would - be assassin .
But now they ’ve got another problem ; what do they do with the gun ?
Hand it back ?
Of course they should have called the police .
But you ’ve got the gun now , and you just got physical with the gun owner .
How is a white officer going to interpret the scene ?
You do n’t know , but you can guess .
So you run off with the gun and stash it in the old red truck behind Robert ’s trailer .
This entire scenario is unthinkable if you take the assault at the Fair Barn out of the equation .
Robert had met white boys coming out of the Gotta
Go a thousand times ; Matt Wyndham had met black boys under similar circumstances just as often .
So why do we have a violent interlude on this particular morning ?
Because there had been a fight the night before .
And why had there been a fight the night before ?
Because two groups of boys ( white friends of the noose hangers , and black football players ) had maintained a running feud ever since Reed Walters and Roy Breithaupt made their rulings and issued their threats .
Myth 7 : The Schoolyard Fight .
The event on Dec. 4 , 2006 was consistently labeled a “ schoolyard fight . ”
But witnesses described something much more horrific .
Several black students , including those now known as the Jena 6 , barricaded an exit to the school ’s gym as they lay in wait for Justin Barker to exit .
( It remains unclear why Mr. Barker was specifically targeted . )
When Barker tried to leave through another exit , court testimony indicates , he was hit from behind by Mychal Bell .
Multiple witnesses confirmed that Barker was immediately knocked unconscious and lay on the floor defenseless as several other black students joined together to kick and stomp him , with most of the blows striking his head .
Police speculate that the motivation for the attack was related to the racially charged fights that had occurred during the previous weekend .
First , Mr. Franklin suggests that the assault on Justin Barker was an isolated incident ; then he says it may have been a carryover from the white - initiated violence of the weekend .
Which explanation makes sense ?
Franklin is certainly right that the assault on Barker should not be characterized as a “ fight ” in the usual sense ; neither should the assault on Robert Bailey at the Fair Barn .
Both boys were cold cocked –the primary difference being that Justin Barker was knocked unconscious by the initial blow while Robert Bailey was not .
The details of the assault are difficult to establish on the basis of eyewitness testimony .
( I obtained copies of the eyewitness statements before a single defense attorney had seen them . )
Only one witness , Christy Martin , a teacher , advances the barricade theory suggested above .
The same teacher is the only witness able to provide a detailed list of who attacked Justin Barker ( although she admits she did not witness the attack because of the alleged barricade ) .
A statement from yet another teacher says that he gave Ms. Martin a list of black students who had been acting up during the lunch hour .
I will leave it to defense counsel to piece all of this together , but if you see a pattern developing , your eyes do not deceive you .
The mainstream media has never minimized the extent of Justin Barker ’s injuries .
Bloggers , on both sides of this issue , have been guilty of distorting the facts to their own advantage .
Supporters of the Jena 6 frequently dismiss the incident as a schoolyard dust - up .
No one who has seen the pictures of Mr. Barker ’s bruised face would make that claim –the kid absorbed a genuine thumping .
We must remember that Mr. Barker was unconscious , and therefore defenseless , when he hit the ground .
There can be no question that he was kicked by black students ( although the identity of the kickers is difficult to establish ) .
It is also likely that anyone rushing to the scene or away from the scene ( and eyewitness accounts suggest a wild scramble in both directions ) could have added to the damage , and it is difficult to know with any certainty how the damage was done .
But just look at the pictures and you can only sympathize with Justin Barker and his family .
If my kid was beaten that badly I would be devastated , so I have never had any trouble understanding how the Barker family feels about all of this .
But the extent of Justin ’s injuries can be exaggerated .
No bones were broken ( a surprising fact considering the alleged murderous intent of the alleged assailants ) ; no organs were damaged , and although there was a great deal of bruising and swelling , few serious cuts have been reported .
My respect for the Barker family makes me reluctant to relate these facts , but at the end of the day , Justin was up and walking .
There was no spring in his step , to be sure , and his face looked almost as bad as it had looked when pictures were taken at the hospital .
His injuries , in short , were both serious and superficial ; small wonder , then , that pundits on both sides of the divide would spin things to their advantage .
The mainstream media , however , has generally exercised great caution in this regard .
Myth 8 : The Attack Is Linked to the Nooses .
Nowhere in any of the evidence , including statements by witnesses and defendants , is there any reference to the noose incident that occurred three months prior .
This was confirmed by the United States attorney for the Western District of Louisiana , Donald Washington , on numerous occasions .
Eyewitnesses did n’t mention the noose incident because they were n’t asked about it .
The primary difference between my account of the facts and Mr. Franklin’s is that he has always presented the assault on Mr. Barker as an isolated incident while I see it as the final act in a tragic string of intimately related events beginning with Kenneth Purvis ’s question .
The mainstream media falls somewhere between my version of the truth and Mr. Franklin’s .
No one should be surprised that public officials in Jena are threatened by my narrative –they should be .
If any of these cases come to trial ( and Mr. Franklin should be praying that they do n’t ) far more connective tissue will come to public attention .
Myth 9 : Mychal Bell ’s All - White Jury .
While it is true that Mychal Bell was convicted as an adult by an all - white jury in June ( a conviction that was later overturned with his case sent to juvenile court ) , the jury selection process was completely legal and withstood an investigation by the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division .
Court officials insist that several black residents were summoned for jury duty , but did not appear .
Craig Franklin is absolutely right about this .
Few black residents qualified for jury duty and most of the handful of people who did qualify did n’t show up for health reasons , because they were acquainted with the defendant , or because they knew the prosecutor would strike them .
Minority jurors are always the first strikes when , as is usually the case , the defendant is a minority .
This is all standard procedure , however , and says nothing about LaSalle Parish per se .
Myth 10 : Jena 6 as Model Youth .
While some members were simply caught up in the moment , others had criminal records .
Bell had at least four prior violent - crime arrests before the December attack , and was on probation during most of this year .
Notice that Mr. Franklin stops with Mychal Bell ’s well - publicized juvenile record .
No one in the mainstream media has suggested that the defendants were “ Model Youth ” .
In fact , the disturbing nature of the allegations would have killed this story if the strange behavior of public officials did n’t raise questions about the quality of justice the Jena 6 could expect in LaSalle Parish .
These are normal , small - town kids .
African Americans tend to identify with the Jena 6 because their story is so familiar , not because they see these kids as latter day incarnations of sister Rosa .
Black Americans know that ordinary kids can get swept up in a pathological social dynamic not of their own making .
Myth 11 : Jena Is One of the Most Racist Towns in America .
Actually , Jena is a wonderful place to live for both whites and blacks .
The media ’s distortion and outright lies concerning the case have given this rural Louisiana town a label it does n’t deserve .
In general , I am in agreement with Mr. Franklin here .
Bloggers and radio personalities have frequently exaggerated the extent and the nature of the racism on display in Jena .
Civil rights leaders , for the most part , have been more cautious on this score .
I have always argued that Jena is a mirror for America , and I stand by that assessment .
It must be said , however , that LaSalle Parish has retained some disturbing vestiges of the old Jim Crow South that need to be faced honestly and openly ( although , I admit that the current environment is hardly conducive to serious self - examination ) .
Kenneth Purvis asked a question that Jena officials could n’t answer –the issue was n’t considered a proper subject for public conversation .
Did an informal , but influential , color line exist on the high school campus ?
If so , should Jena renounce that line and turn over a new leaf ?
The adults of Jena were n’t ready for these questions and now the kids , black and white , are paying the price .
Myth 12 : Two Levels of Justice .
Outside protesters were convinced that the prosecution of the Jena 6 was proof of a racially biased system of justice .
But the US Justice Department ’s investigation found no evidence to support such a claim .
In fact , the percentage of blacks and whites prosecuted matches the parish ’s population statistics .
It must be remembered that the US Justice Department is part of the American criminal justice system .
Donald Washington was right : most of what happened in Jena was legal .
That is because we have decided to gift prosecutors and judges with great discretion .
Mr. Walters ’ threat to black students , the prejudicial announcement he published in the Jena Times in mid-December , 2006 , and a number of his recent comments are clearly grounds for recusal .
Ethical standards have been violated .
But were these acts illegal ?
We ’ll see–the ethical bar for prosecutors is set very low .
Friends of Justice decided to bring this case to the attention of the nation because it illustrates what is happening , albeit in less spectacular fashion , across the nation .
We are n’t trying to get the Jena 6 off ; we ’ve been trying to get them some justice .
The next few stages in the legal process will demonstrate whether we have succeeded .
I suspect we have .
There will be no repeat of the fiasco that was the Mychal Bell trial .
Regrettably , however , the mainstream media has rarely asked what the Jena story says about the fairness of the American criminal justice system .
“ Objective ” journalists are n’t supposed to even address that question –they can only repeat the critique advanced by their sources .
And thus far , sources like Al Sharpton have n’t settled on a consistent message .
One moment , Jena is a throwback to Jim Crow justice ; the next moment , Jena is about contemporary America .
Al Sharpton et al , need to clarify their message .
The media has created the illusion that Jena is a uniquely racist community by asking Jena residents the wrong question : “ Do you think this is a racist town ? ”
Black residents , with few exceptions , do see Jena as a racist community ; white folks disagree .
Conflicting quotations give the appearance of a town divided along racial lines .
Tulia ,
Texas received the same treatment , with similar results .
Journalists should be asking if the Jena 6 can get a semblance of Justice in LaSalle Parish .
They should be asking if the plight of the Jena 6 suggests unresolved issues within the American criminal justice system .
Unfortunately , the mainstream media does n’t like that question because they fear that Middle America does n’t like it .
These are just 12 of many myths that are portrayed as fact in the media concerning the Jena cases .
( A more thorough review of all events can be found at www.thejenatimes.net – click on Chronological Order of Events . )
Click on this link and you will get an expanded version of the official - friendly history the Jena Times has been sponsoring from the beginning .
As with the Duke Lacrosse case , the truth about Jena will eventually be known .
But the town of Jena is n’t expecting any apologies from the media .
They will probably never admit their error and have already moved on to the next “ big ” story .
Meanwhile in Jena , residents are getting back to their regular routines , where friends are friends regardless of race .
Just as it has been all along .
Craig Franklin is right to compare Jena with the Duke Lacrosse imbroglio .
Mike Nifong and Reed Walters presented the public with a version of history unsupported by the facts and simple common sense .
If Mr. Nifong ’s victims had been represented by the lamentable Blaine Williams they would have been convicted at the end of a brief and unheralded trial .
Had Mr. NJifong focused on an anonymous college with low - status students , the media would n’t have paid much attention .
Thanks to highly paid , motivated defense counsel , the Duke defendants were able to clear their names .
Now that the Jena 6 enjoy the same advantage , the scales in the hands of the blind lady are beginning to tilt in the direction of justice .

IS ETHANOL GREEN ?….
There are probably some of you out there who believe that not everything in the world can be put into chart form .
On Thursday , for example , I wrote that “ corn ethanol is a boondoggle , ” and that probably seems like an un-chartable statement .
But it ’s not .
After all , one can always chart how much of a boondoggle something is .
The chart on the right , provided by Berkeley ’s Michael O’Hare from a paper he co-authored last month , does n’t quite do this , since there are many dimensions to boondogglishness .
However , it does measure one aspect of boondogglishness : whether corn ethanol actually provides any green benefits .
As you can see , the answer is “ it depends on how you make it . ”
The thing I ’ve labeled Corn 1 , for example , is “ Coal - fired ethanol production with cogenerated electricity . ”
Basically , it sucks , producing nearly as much total greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline .
Other types of corn ethanol are better , the best being “ Biomass - powered ethanol production , ” which clocks in at about half the GHG production of gasoline .
Switchgrass ethanol , the holy grail of the ethanol community , is even better .
There ’s more to corn ethanol than this , of course , since ramping up corn production requires big federal subsidies ( bad ) , drives up the price of food ( also bad ) , and demands intensive nitrogen fertilization that produces greenhouse gases of its own ( yet badder still ) .
A complete boondogglishness index would take that and more into account .
But if it ’s basic greenness you ’re interested in , this chart tells the ethanol story pretty well .
UC Berkeley ’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center is here if you want to check them out .
The full paper this chart comes from is here .
Michael has more at his own blog here .
Today the US Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation has passed S. 704 , a bill that would make it a crime to spoof caller ID .
Dubbed the " Truth in Caller ID Act of 2007 , " the bill would outlaw causing " any caller identification service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information " via " any telecommunications service or IP - enabled voice service . "
Law enforcement is exempted from the rule .
While we all probably wish this would outlaw caller - ID blocking ( think " Private " ) , it wo n't .
The proposed legislation only targets misleading caller ID spoofing , such as pranking your buddy by sending along " Bush , G.H.W. " with your next VoIP call .
" Caller ID provides critical information to those who rely on it , " said Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) in a statement .
" However , when this technology is used to deceive people it can endanger personal privacy and safety .
This bill will help strengthen the ability of the FCC and states to combat these nefarious practices . "
We all know Stevens is just sick of getting calls from " Tubes , Internet " and " Mr. Giant Truck . "
The bill was introduced in February by Senator Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) and Senator Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
A similar act has been introduced in the House and passed , making it very likely that this little bill will indeed someday become a law .
But is it needed ?
Caller ID spoofing can be annoying , and there are indeed several websites online that will happily help you prank your friends .
It 's hardly an epidemic , but then that 's what makes it an ideal law to pass : there is no pro-caller ID spoofing lobby , outside of law enforcement .
On a serious note , caller ID spoofing can be used to bypass dial - in systems that use your calling location to determine who you are .
Supposedly none other than Paris Hilton used this technique to break into Lindsay Lohan 's voicemail , but somehow we doubt the veracity of that specific claim .
Navy veteran questions why six nuclear missiles were flown on combat aircraft to staging area for Middle East John Byrne
Published : Monday October 8 , 2007

This A retired lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve who served with the Navy 's Supervisor of Salvage questioned in a little - noticed editorial Sunday why six active nuclear armed cruise missiles were being transferred to an active bomber base that " just happens to be the staging area for Middle Eastern operations . "
" The United States also does not transport nuclear weapons meant for elimination attached to their launch vehicles under the wings of a combat aircraft , " Navy veteran Robert Stormer wrote in the Texas - based Star - Telegram .
" The procedure is to separate the warhead from the missile , encase the warhead and transport it by military cargo aircraft to a repository -- not an operational bomber base that just happens to be the staging area for Middle Eastern operations . "
Six nuclear W80 nuclear - armed cruise missiles were flown to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana where they sat for ten hours undetected .
" Press reports initially cited the Air Force mistake of flying nuclear weapons over the United States in violation of Air Force standing orders and international treaties , while completely missing the more important major issues , such as how six nuclear cruise missiles got loose to begin with , " writes Stormer .
" Let me be very clear here :
We are not talking about paintball cartridges or pellet gun ammo .
We are talking nuclear weapons . "
Stormer does n't buy reports that the missiles were simply lost .
The title of his piece is " Nuke transportation story has explosive implications . "
" There is a strict chain of custody for all such weapons , " he said .
" Nuclear weapons handling is spelled out in great detail in Air Force regulations , to the credit of that service .
Every person who orders the movement of these weapons , handles them , breaks seals or moves any nuclear weapon must sign off for tracking purposes . "
" All security forces assigned are authorized " to use deadly force to protect the weapons from any threat .
Nor does anyone quickly move a 1 - ton cruise missile -- or forget about six of them , as reported by some news outlets , especially cruise missiles loaded with high explosives .
" This is about how six nuclear advanced cruise missiles got out of their bunkers and onto a combat aircraft without notice of the wing commander , squadron commander , munitions maintenance squadron ( MMS ) , the B - 52 H 's crew chief and command pilot and onto another Air Force base tarmac without notice of that air base 's chain of command -- for 10 hours . "
At the end of his editorial , he poses the following questions .
The questions that must be answered : 1 Why , and for what ostensible purpose , were these nuclear weapons taken to Barksdale ?
2
How long was it before the error was discovered ?
3
How many mistakes and errors were made , and how many needed to be made , for this to happen ?
4
How many and which security protocols were overlooked ?
5
How many and which safety procedures were bypassed or ignored ?
6
How many other nuclear command and control non-observations of procedure have there been ?

Does the Bush administration , as some news reports suggest , have plans to attack Iran with nuclear weapons ?
10 If this was an accident , have we degraded our military to a point where we are now making critical mistakes with our nuclear arsenal ?
If so , how do we correct this ?
My family owns an ambulance service in Brooklyn NY .
Midwood Ambulance if anyone knows it .
Anyway , my uncles were at “ Ground Zero ” during the attack to help the victims .
They donated their time to help with this crisis as many New Yorkers did .
A great deal of people were in shock from the devastation .
As many of you know , shock victims are supposed to drink a lot of water .
My uncle went to the Starbucks down the street to get bottles of water for the victims he was treating .
Can you believe they actually charged him for it !!
He paid the $ 130 for 3 cases of bottled water out of his own pocket .
Now , I would think that in a crisis such as this , vendors in the area would be more than happy to lend a little help by donating water .
Well , not Starbucks !
As if this country has n’t given them enough money !
Anyway , the point of this story was n’t to glorify my uncle ’s actions but to suggest a boycott on Starbucks .
Now , I love Frappaccinos as much as anyone , but any company that would try to make a profit off of a crisis like this does n’t deserve the American public ’s hard earned money .
Please forward this e-mail to any one you know and encourage them to do the same .
Times of crisis can bring out the best and the worst in people and , it appears , in businesses as well .
On 11 September 2001 , employees of the Midwood Ambulance Service were on hand at what has come to be known as “ Ground Zero , ” the rubble that once was the World Trade Center .
They approached a Starbucks near the disaster site because they needed water to treat the victims of the terrorist attack .
Starbucks was willing to help … for a price .
It sold the rescue workers three cases for $ 130 cash on the barrelhead , with the money needed to complete the transaction coming out of the workers ’ pockets .
Later , suspecting the workers had been overcharged , ambulance company officials called Starbucks and sent e-mail to the company but said their queries were ignored .
One described his call to Starbucks thus : “ When I called … to inquire about this at your ‘ contact us ’ phone number from your Web site , I was told in a rather rude way that this could not have happened and abruptly thanked for my call and dismissed . ”
Only after the text quoted above became circulated on the Internet did Starbucks address this matter .
The company eventually delivered a $ 130 check ( via messenger ) to the ambulance company , and its president , Orin Smith , called them to apologize personally .
Apology and check notwithstanding , lingering and disquieting doubts remain .
True , an employee of any firm can act in an unthinking manner that will bring embarrassment upon his employer ( and in this case one ca n’t necessarily fault the low - level Starbucks worker who was unsure about handing over his employer ’s merchandise for free without authorization ) , but that is not the real shame here ; it ’s the non-action of Starbucks management in the face of such an incident .
Perhaps a Starbucks employee was fault for messing up , but even if so , his error was the act of a lone individual .
All it would have taken to set things right at that point would have been for someone a bit higher up in the company to pony up a prompt apology and reimbursement of the money paid for the water .
The measure of a business is often found not in what it does right , but in how well and how quickly it handles matters when things have gone wrong .
Unfortunately , Starbucks ’ customer relations and management committed the real offense in that no one at any of these higher levels did anything to address the wrong until the incident became public .
When the ambulance workers called the company to inquire about the possibility of having been overcharged , they were told what they had described could n’t have happened , so thank you and good - bye .
Their letter to the president of Starbucks detailing the event went unanswered .
Calls from a Seattle journalist to
Howard Schultz ( Starbucks chairman and chief global strategist ) and Orin Smith ( president and CEO ) were n’t returned .
( Only after that journalist ’s piece about the $ 130 water ran on 25 September 2001 did Smith meet with the newsman . )
At each point where a correction could have been made , the ambulance workers were brushed off .
It took the attraction of cyberspace and media attention to prompt an offer of redress that should have been made the moment Starbucks was made aware of the incident .
The ambulance workers did eventually get their $ 130 back , but they had to jump through hoops for what should have been freely and promptly tendered .
Starbucks is n’t heartless — they did provide free coffee to rescue workers , gave $ 1 million to the September 11th Fund ( a national relief endeavor to help victims of the tragedy ) , and collects further contributions for the fund from its customers and friends .
( Other companies have made similar contributions , including $ 10 million each from Microsoft and Lilly Endowment , $ 5 million from IBM , and $ 4 million from UPS . )
It ’s thus not an unfeeling company , merely one that fell down badly on problem resolution .
Yet the question still begs to be asked :
Had the story about the ambulance workers not gotten out and had it not given Starbucks a black eye , is there reason to suppose that a check would have been written or an apology made ?
(1) The resolution was non-binding and substantively different from the 2002 use of force resolution .
Lieberman - Kyl has zero authority ; it expresses senses , not findings .
(2) Obama 's main substantive argument is about power and authority : should Congress give President Bush even a hint -- and Obama , looking at the intent of the initial sponsors , sees such a hint -- that the commander in chief has their permission to launch military strikes or continue to justify a large troop presence in Iraq on the basis of Iran 's intervention in the war ?
(3) Clinton 's main argument is that she is a senator , and according to Obama 's logic , anything that comes up for a vote could be interpreted or warped so as to give President Bush 's actions the imprimateur of legitimacy .
Clinton is on the Armed Services Committee ; Iran 's Revolutionary Guards are attacking U.S. soldiers ; the biggest beneficiary of the Iraq war being ran , it 's simply reality -- as Obama himself acknowledged -- that Iran 's actions will in some way factor into decisions about when and where and how fast to move troops out .
Clinton turned a sketchy resolution into a much better one , one that was n't bellicose and gave no hints or winks to the White House .
And , oh -- Obama did n't show up and argue this during the vote itself .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Former astronaut Rusty Schweickart has already earned his place in the history books by going to the moon with the Apollo 9 mission .
However , should an asteroid crash into the Earth anytime soon , killing millions and causing catastrophic damage , he 'll also be remembered as the guy whose warnings we ignored .
In 2001 Schweickart , now 71 , helped found the B612 Foundation ( named for the asteroid home in The Little Prince ) to raise the alarm about the potential of death from above .
The foundation has been loudly asking the world 's space agencies to locate all the near - Earth asteroids , determine if any are likely to crash into us , and make plans to deflect them if necessary .
But NASA and the other agencies have taken little action .
Wired News spoke to Schweickart about the importance and frustrations of his latest mission .
Wired News :
You 've devoted the last six years to warning people about the catastrophic possibility of a near - Earth asteroid crashing into the Earth .
Does this stuff keep you awake at night ?
Rusty Schweickart : ( laughs )
Does it keep me up at night ?
Yes , but not in the way you 're probably asking .
I do n't stay up at night worrying about an impact .
I do stay up and work over in my mind various technical issues , and think about the work that needs to be done .
WN : When did you first start thinking about the threat posed by near - Earth asteroids ?
Schweickart :
My interest came from my prior interest in astrobiology , which is the research field looking at the origins and extent of life in the universe .
When you look at the origins and evolution of life on Earth , it 's been severely affected by asteroid impacts through history .
I came to the clear understanding that this is not a historical process , or something that is no longer in effect .
It 's a continuing process , and we 're continually vulnerable to , essentially , a control - alt - delete .
Life has sustained a number of those hard boots , to continue the metaphor , the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago being only the most recent example that people are aware of .
But there have been very damaging impacts far smaller than the one that occurred 65 million years ago , and they are far more frequent .
Those are of more concern to humanity , but they 're also predictable .
If we know that something is going to happen and there 's something we can do about it , we ought to start getting prepared .
WN : You were in the news a few years back talking about the asteroid 9942 Apophis , when it appeared there was a chance that it could hit the Earth in 2029 or 2036 .
That got some media attention , until further studies reduced the likelihood of impact to nearly zero .
Were you relieved , or maybe a little disappointed that there was no urgent cause for action ?
Schweickart :
When the probability of impact in 2029 dropped to zero , I think everyone was very relieved .
There is still to this day a possibility of impact in 2036 .
It is quite low , and it will most likely drop to zero .
But Apophis has been a tremendous learning opportunity for the ( near - Earth asteroid ) community .
It exemplifies the kind of challenge we will encounter in the future .
There will be tens of thousands of near - Earth asteroids discovered in the next 10 to 20 years .
WN : The Planetary Society is still offering a $ 50,000 prize for the best plan to put a tracking device on Apophis when it swings by in 2029 .
Although it appears that will be unnecessary , do you think the design contest still serves a purpose ?
Schweickart :
In responding to that challenge , there are probably teams of people learning a great deal .
The possibility of Apophis continuing to be a real threat is one in 45,000 .
But in terms of understanding the challenge that we 're going to be facing with other near - Earth asteroids that we find – and we will definitely find some that will be more threatening – it's very useful .
The more people we have thinking seriously about this , the better .
And I 'm not talking about the general public wringing their hands , I mean technically qualified people seriously looking at the challenge of taking action .
It 's important to have people studying the orbital mechanics , the techniques we could use for deflection , and looking at the decision - making process that would be involved in deciding which asteroids to deflect .
The legal and political implications will probably be the most difficult challenges .
WN : Why is that ?
Schweickart :
Who is it that makes the decision :
Do we or do we not deflect this particular asteroid ?
Is it small enough that someone will say , " We 'll just take this hit , we wo n't deflect this one " ?
If it 's just going to impact a few counties , are they the only ones who pay for it ?
There are a million questions of that kind that will have to be answered , and not after we discover one that has our name on it , but before , so we do n't end up in a decade - long debate when we 're threatened .
WN : Some of the language from the B612 Foundation 's website sounds pretty frustrated .
Do you feel that NASA is not doing all it could to answer these questions ?
Schweickart : NASA has a responsibility which they are not really stepping up to the plate on .
Congress mandated that we find 90 percent of objects 140 meters or larger by 2020 .
The law , that was signed by Congress in 2005 and signed by the president , is not being followed .
NASA is not doing all it's required to do by law , let alone all it could .
WN : The stated goal of the B612 Foundation is to significantly alter the orbit of an asteroid , in a controlled manner , by 2015 .
If NASA is n't active on this front , do you think it 's likely you 'll meet that deadline ?
Schweickart :
It 's not only NASA who could do it .
We 're working with the European Space Agency as well .
They have a program called Don Quixote .
There are two spacecrafts involved : Sancho goes up and rendezvous with an asteroid , characterizes it , photographs it and stands off to the side to watch while Hidalgo impacts it .
That 's a program the European Space Agency has taken through the first phase of development .
It 's now sitting on a shelf , but frankly that program could be activated and funded and brought to completion by 2015 .
The sad state of affairs is , in terms of stepping up to the plate , it 's the B612 Foundation that 's leading the way .
That 's atrocious , that 's horrible ... but it 's true .
WN : I 'll ask you the question you 're probably very tired of answering .
With our planet facing more pressing problems like global warming , how can you call for spending vast amounts of money on this ?
Schweickart :
So you 're saying , if you can get run over by a bus on the way to school and also get hit by a bolt of lightning , do you only worry about the bus ?
When you know about something that 's a serious threat , you take appropriate action .
You and I pay auto insurance at a rate of about $ 4 a day , based on the one - in - 10,000 chance that we 'll have an auto accident on that particular day .
I 'm not saying that you spend all the money available on this and nothing on global warming .
It takes very , very little money to be prepared for this .
That 's one of the frustrating elements .
We 're not talking about spending billions of dollars on this .
If we were to have a magic wand and have NASA do everything we think they should be doing , it would take something like a half of 1 percent of their budget to do it .
Of course when you have to deflect an asteroid , then you have expenses that you weigh against the cost of not doing anything .
WN : Do you have trouble convincing people that it 's time to take action now , although we currently do n't know of any asteroids that pose a serious threat ?
Schweickart : I think it 's a very clear situation , not unlike Hurricane Katrina , where it 's only a matter of time before this happens .
It differs from Katrina because we can't accurately predict the future of a hurricane .
But in this case , you can predict very precisely , and you can know decades ahead of time if there 's likely going to be an impact .
And you can't deflect a hurricane , all you can do is button down or evacuate .
In this case , we could literally prevent a disaster on the scale of 10,000 Katrinas .
For humanity to have this capacity and not be prepared to use it is an anti-survival thing .
You 're rolling the dice – you 're saying , we could do something about it , but we 'll take the risk of going the way of the dinosaurs .
It seems to me that this is a very irresponsible act .
WN : It strikes me that you 've got a very optimistic view of humanity 's prospects .
You 're assuming humans will be around for a while , and will continue to have the technology necessary to deflect asteroids if necessary .
Schweickart :
This is a big picture thing – we literally are the top of the pyramid of life in the universe , as far as we know .
At least in this corner of the universe , we 're it .
And it seems to me that we have collectively a certain responsibility to see this incredible experiment in life continue .
It seems to me there is a kind of obligation , since we 're self - reflective beings , to take some responsibility for the future .
It 's not something to lose sleep over , but safeguarding the future of life , that 's something worth working on .
Visual Studio has been plagued with performance issues that have been getting worse with each version .
These problems rarely occur in small projects but can have a dramatic impact on solutions with multiple projects or even a single , very large project .
In a Channel 9 video , Cameron McColl apologized for Microsoft not thoroughly testing Visual Studio with large solutions .
He then discusses some of the specific performance problems and how they were addressed in VS 2008 .
The first issue he covers is that of stepping through code .
As many .
Net developers know , there can be a 5 to 10 second lag time between each line of code .
While this does n't occur all the time , it can be quite frustrating when it does .
He does not go into detail , but he does mention that in addition to the " crazy stuff " that they were doing , they had also stumbled onto an OS bug that added an extra second per step .
This fix is supposed to be part of VS 2005 Server Pack 1 as well as VS 2008 .
The next issue he discusses is how Visual Studio can suddenly freeze for a number of seconds as someone is typing .
This has a number of causes , several of which have been fixed .
One cause is the number of items in the task list , which includes errors , warnings , and ' to - do ' items .
Whenever the task list was updated , it refreshed each item by removing and re-adding it .
This involved an expensive calculation involving the position of the scroll bar .
Another fix involves VB 's background compiler .
The background compiler gives Visual Basic a much richer design time experience with features like up to the minute code completion and error detection .
Languages like C# and VC ++ do not have this , so often the developer has to rebuild the project just to get a clear picture of the application 's state .
A downside of this is that Visual Studio , while opening a solution , would wait until the background complier had a chance to run .
This delay was particularly bad with larger projects .
As part of this fix , the class and method drop - down lists above the code editor will now indicate when they are not ready .
Another much - needed change is that Visual Studio will now allow developers to cancel out of long - running operations .
If a certain action requires information from the background compiler , the IDE will only wait to seconds before displaying a progress bar and cancel button .
The next fix is for scenarios wherein there is a significant delay when trying to edit an aspx file in a large web application .
Like with the code editor , this was due to the IDE waiting for the background compiler .
Now the editor starts working immediately , with the tradeoff that code coloring and completion is not available until the background compiler catches up .
The final fix he mentioned deals with compiling .
For a solution in VS 2005 with 25 projects and approximately 3,000 files , a Rebuild All would take about 45 minutes .
In VS 2008 , that is down to one minute .
Why ?
Because if a project was referenced by N other projects , it would be completely cleaned and rebuilt N+1 times .

Naturally occurring structures like birds ’ bones or tree trunks are thought to have evolved over eons to reach the best possible balance between stiffness and density .
But in a June paper in Nature Materials , researchers at Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico ( UNM ) , in conjunction with researchers at Case Western Reserve and Princeton Universities , show that nanoscale materials self - assembled in artificially determined patterns can improve upon nature ’s designs .
“ Using self - assembly we can construct silica materials at a finer scale than those found in nature , ” says principal investigator Jeff Brinker .
“ Because , at very small dimensions , the structure and mechanical properties of the materials change , facile fabrication of stiff , porous materials needed for microelectronics and membrane applications may be possible . ”
Nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopic studies performed by Sandia researchers Roger Assink ( ret. ) and Dave Tallant , along with molecular modeling studies performed by Dan Lacks at Case Western Reserve University , showed that , as the ordered porous films became more porous , the silica pore walls thinned below 2 nm , re-arranging the silica framework to become denser and stiffer .
Whereas the stiffness of evolved optimized bone declines proportional to the square of its density , mechanical studies performed by Sandia researcher Thomas Buchheit working with UNM student Christopher Hartshorn showed that the stiffness / modulus of self - assembled materials was much less sensitive to increasing porosity :
For a material synthesized with a cubic arrangement of pores , the modulus declined only as the square root of its density .
The silica nanostructures — basically a synthetic analogue of bone - like cellular structures , replicated at the nanoscale using silica compounds — thus may improve performance where increased pore volume is important .
These include modern thin - film applications such as membrane barriers , molecular recognition sensors , and low - dielectric - constant insulators needed for future generation of microelectronic devices .
“ Bone , closely examined , is a structured cellular material , ” says Brinker , a Sandia Fellow and chemical engineering professor at UNM .
“ Because , using self - assembly , we had demonstrated the fabrication of a variety of ordered cellular materials at the nanoscale with worm - like ( curving cylinders ) , hexagonal ( soda straw packing ) and cubic sphere arrangements of pores , we wondered whether the modulus - density scaling relationships of these nanoscale materials would be similar to the optimized evolved materials [ like bone ] .
We found that both material structure and pore sizes matter .
At all densities we observed that the cubic arrangement was stiffer than the hexagonal arrangement , which was stiffer than the worm - like .
For each of these structures , increasing porosity caused a reduction in modulus , but the reduction was less than for theoretically optimized or naturally evolved materials due to the attendant stiffening of the thinning nanoscale silica walls resulting from the formation of small stiff silica rings .
“ This change in ring structure only happens at the nanoscale , ” says Brinker .
Sandia researcher Hongyou Fan created cubic , cylindrical , and worm - like ( or disordered ) pores to evaluate differences in stiffness resulting from these differently shaped internal spaces .
Other paper authors include Dave Kissel of UNM , Regina Simpson at Sandia , and Salvatore Torquato of Princeton .

Sunset paintings and climate change
October 12 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Following up on yesterday ’s post , I came across really fascinating news .
I ’ve always loved the Impressionist art movement – the vivid , fiery sunsets of a Turner painting ; the dappled waters of a Monet reflecting the electric blue sky ; the churning clouds ; the emerald greens of a Renoir .
I studied them in art school but have never stopped to think of Impressionist paintings against the backdrop of climate change .
Until now …
Climate change scientists are busy analysing Turner ’s paintings along with other Impressionist artists and sniffing out signs of climate change .
In 1883 , Krakatoa blew its top and coughed up rocks , dust and assorted debris that circled the globe .
For many years , stunning sunsets were seen as the retreating light was scattered by reflective particles thrown high into the atmosphere .
So the scientists have examined 181 artists who painted sunsets between 1500 and 1900 – before and after Krakatoa – and calculated the amount of material in the sky during the 1880s .
This will feed into a scientific study of a phenomenon called global dimming , which is caused by air pollution blocking sunlight .
When Mount Tambora in Indonesia blew up in 1815 there was so much stuff in the atmosphere that 1815 was referred to as the “ year without a summer ” and there were massive crop failures in Europe , which led to famine and economic collapse .
The amount of red and green along the horizon in each artist ’s painting has been calculated by a computer .
Sunlight scattered by airborne particles appears more red than green , so the reddest sunsets indicate the dirtiest skies .
And the result was most paintings with the highest red / green ratios were painted in the 3 years following Krakatoa ’s eruption .
There were 54 volcanic sunset paintings .
Interestingly , Turner was in the right place at the right time .
He lived before , during and after several volcanic hissy fits : Tambora in 1815 ; Babuyan , Philippines in 1831 , and Cosiguina , Nicaragua in 1835 and in each case the scientists found a sharp change in the red / green ratio of the sunsets he painted up to 3 years afterwards .
The team of scientists hope to check out 40 paintings from the 20th Century to see if the effects of pollution since the Industrial Revolution have been captured in sunset renditions .

Sorry , but the page requested can not be found .

The war in Iraq is a failure .
The " Global War on Terror " can not be won by military might alone .
Access to health care is a right for all .
The growing divide between rich and poor is a problem .
Torture is un-American .
The Democratic candidates for president  both mainstream and long shots  tend to agree on these and many other issues that position them as smart and compassionate alternatives to the policies and priorities of President George W. Bush and his administration .
But on the one issue that profoundly impacts all of the above , there is not enough difference .
Most Democratic candidates for president speak of increasing rather than slashing the military budget .
Since President Bush came into office in 2001 , the Pentagon ’s budget has increased by more than one - third .
The $ 481 billion proposed for 2008  the $ 459 billion appropriations plus the nuclear weapons programs of the Department of Energy  is a jump of more than 10 % over current spending .
To be clear , this is a huge figure even before factoring in the costs of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere in under the " Global War on Terror . "
A recent analysis of the emergency supplemental budgets to pay for the war by the Congressional Research Service finds that ( so far ) a total of another $ 607 billion has been spent since September 11 , 2001 .
The United States is currently spending more on the military than at the height of the Reagan military build - up ( when we had a nuclear - armed superpower rival ) or during the Vietnam or Korean wars .
Thanks to the Bush administration , the United States now spends about as much on its military as the rest of the world spends collectively , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
Given these figures  and the fact that preponderant military spending has not equaled an unassailable military or the fulfillment of the Bush administration ’s objectives  there is plenty of fodder for Democratic candidates wishing to take on the Bush administration ’s love affair with the Pentagon .
In the 2008 military budget , the White House showed its devotion to weapons manufacturers and its disdain for men and women in uniform by packing the " reconstituting the forces " area of the budget with $ 51 billion in weapons that are not only not worn out by the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan  but are n’t even relevant .
There is money for 20 F - 22 tactical aircraft originally designed to engage Soviet fighter planes in high - speed aerial dogfights .
Al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia does not have any fighter planes .
Among other useless programs was $ 74 million to continue research on an unmanned spy plane that is years away from being fielded .
A Tale of Two Budgets
While this administration justifies the spending as necessary to fight the terrorists over there so that we do n’t face them here , the numbers tell a different story  a story of two separate military budgets .
The first is bursting with billions for new fighter planes , nuclear powered submarines , and ballistic missile components .
This is the budget that has propelled spiraling profits for weapons manufacturing companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman .
The other military budget is plagued with the belt - tightening we usually see in education and social service programs .
The Army suffered a $ 530 million shortfall in 2006 that led to cuts at military hospitals and no new money for medical research on key procedures like dealing with traumatic brain injuries  the signature of the improvised - explosive - devise war in Iraq .
All the Democrats who wish to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office criticize the administration for not providing ammunition , communication systems , armored vehicles and helicopters to U.S. soldiers in the field .
They also take Bush to task for always leading with the Pentagon and not providing enough support to the State Department ’s non-military counterterrorism programs .
After $ 20 million was slashed from their counterterrorism program budget in 2007 , the State Department is requesting only $ 150 million for 2008 .
Its highly touted Regional Strategic Initiative , bringing together different agencies to collaborate on the ground , is getting a mere $ 1 million each year  the kind of money the Pentagon loses in its sofa cushions every week .
What the Candidates Say
But , in most cases , the Democrats are not taking the next step to say that the United States does not need to spend more on the military , it needs to spend smarter .
Of the leading Democratic candidates , only John Edwards has identified specific weapons systems he would red-line .
In a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations on May 23 , 2007 , Edwards vowed to root out " cronyism and waste " while " increasing efficiency in the Pentagon " and investing " substantial additional resources into maintenance of our [ military ] equipment . "
He also said that if elected , " I would direct my Secretary of Defense to launch a comprehensive , tough review of fraud , waste and abuse  and put an end to it .
One example is missile defense and offensive space based weapons , which are costly and unlikely to work . "
Pursuing this strategy as president would mean taking on the military industrial complex , which has been living high - on - the - hog throughout the Bush administration .
It would be an uphill battle , but one worth pursuing .
Obama has not talked about cutting the military budget .
In fact , when asked recently in Cedar Rapids if he would cut the military budget , he responded : " Actually , you ’ll probably see an initial bump in military spending in an Obama administration . "
He went on to explain that those resources would be used to " reset " forces worn out by war in Iraq and to cover adding as many as 80,000 soldiers and Marines to the U.S. military .
Senator Hillary Clinton is proud to be the first New York senator to serve on the Armed Services Committee and tends to overcompensate for her gender and her husband ’s reputation ( deserved or not ) as anti-military by being uncritically pro-military .
She has also gotten behind the idea of increasing the size of U.S. forces : " I have joined other Democrats and Republicans in proposing that we expand the Army by 80,000 troops , that we move faster to expand the Special Forces , and do a better job of training and equipping the National Guard and Reserves . "
None of these front - running candidates has identified the short - or long - term costs of adding troops , where the money would come from , or  perhaps most importantly  the missions these troops would be engaged in once the Democratic leadership succeeds in " bringing them home . "
Department of Peace ?
Dennis Kucinich , the representative from Ohio , is considered a very long shot for President .
In fact , Edwards and Clinton found common ground a while back in wanting to limit future debates to what Edwards called a " more serious group . "
Kucinich consistently calls for a more limited and defensive role for the U.S. military and putting more resources into diplomacy and global engagement .
His Department of Peace is one indication of the kind of vision his candidacy embraces .
There is no Department of Peace in any of the GOP platforms , but their efforts to strike a different posture than Bush and company do not include a radical revamp of the Pentagon budget or taking on the weapons manufacturers who reap the benefits of a war - without - end strategy .
Despite John McCain ’s prisoner - of - war credibility , Rudy Giuliani ’s 9/11 - forged patriotism , and Mitt Romney ’s neo-Republican suave , they and most of the other Republican hopefuls are not promoting a set of policies that would spend less for more security .
Only the libertarian " maverick " Ron Paul is calling for smaller budgets  even the military budget  as a first step to smaller government and challenges the wisdom of a " war on terrorism " by calling it a " vague declaration . "
The Unified Security Budget for the United States , a joint effort of Foreign Policy In Focus and the Center for Defense Information , outlines $ 62 billion in cuts to the military budget and another $ 52 billion that can be added to budgets for diplomacy , emergency response , infrastructure and other non-military defensive tools .
Their 38 - page report should be required reading for any presidential contender who is serious about charting a more secure and peaceful course for the United States in the decades to come .
Defeat in Peace , Victory in War What Does the PKK Want ?
It is not just anger that is growing in Turkey but also bewilderment :
What does the PKK actually want to achieve with its offensive ?
One thing is certain : the Kurdish guerrillas will do everything they can to prevent a swift political solution .

War games show no bloodbath or al Qaeda takeover after US pullout from Iraq RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email This CNN spoke on Monday with Marine Colonel ( ret. )
Gary Anderson about possible scenarios the US military has been war gaming for conditions in Iraq following a US pullout .
" You would definitely see an attempt by Shia elements ... to ethnically cleanse ... the central area , " Anderson said .
" I do n't think it 's going to be necessarily the bloodbath that conventional wisdom predicts , because the Sunnis really can't generate enough mass to make it a Bosnia type fight .
...
Once they 're out there [ in Anbar Province ] , I think the Shia will forget about them . "
He also downplayed any threat from al Qaeda , saying , " I think the other Sunni states in the region would step in to try to help the tribal sheikhs out there fight the al Qaeda . "
Anderson sees the greatest potential for violence as between pro- and anti-Iranian Shias , which " could be a very bloody , very troublesome thing . "
He expects the Iranians would definitely get more involved in Iraq but said that " the danger would be ... from their standpoint , for them to get in there and for them to get bogged down in a quagmire .

A reunion concert on November 26 offers the surviving members of one of pop music ’s most successful and influential acts an opportunity to remind the world what they can do .
Bass guitarist John Paul Jones and guitarist Jimmy Page said they , together with singer Robert Plant and Bonham ’s son Jason , got together for a secret session earlier this year to determine whether they should go ahead with the London gig .
“ It sounded like we ’ve played this every night for the last three weeks , ” Jones , 61 , said .
“ If that ’s the starting point , this is going to be great .
“ I want not just to be able to play it and play it well , I want to be able to give a really good performance . ”
The silver - haired Page , 63 , added : “ The fact is that to actually be able to play and make this thing pulse , as it sort of did straight away on the first day we got together , that ’s really something to look forward to in every respect . ”
A far cry from the rock ’n ’roll hellraisers of their 1970s heyday , the softly - spoken musicians sought to play down the hype surrounding their reunion .
They also sidestepped questions about whether the show , a charity tribute to Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun who died last year , was a stepping stone to a full comeback tour .
“ We ’re just concentrating on this show , ” Jones said .
When the concert was announced in September , the ticket Web site crashed several times as millions of fans scrambled for tickets , testament to the lasting appeal of the music .
The creators of hits like “ Stairway to Heaven ” , “ Whole Lotta Love ” , “ Communication Breakdown ” and “ Kashmir ” shot to superstardom shortly after forming in 1968 , and went on to sell an estimated 300 million albums .
“ I suppose the scale of ( the reaction ) has been somewhat overwhelming , ” Jones said .
DIGITAL OUTREACH
In addition to the concert , where Led Zeppelin plan to play a 90 - minute set , the band recently announced it would release its music online for the first time next month and has entered into a mobile phone deal .
Asked why Led Zeppelin was one of the last “ supergroups ” to release its catalogue digitally , Page replied : “ I think we were too busy to think about it .
The time was right . ”
Reflecting on the way the Internet has revolutionized music since the 1970s , Jones said record labels had missed a golden opportunity to harness new technology .
“ I think the record companies ... just dragged their feet and wasted so much time , energy and money going down a prohibition - type alley where they could have ... put all this effort into finding new business models and been at the spearhead of revolution themselves . ”
Jones said he was braced for inevitable media interest in longstanding reports of a rift between himself and Plant .
“ I was probably reluctant to do this for that same reason -- it ’s all going to start again , ” he said .
“ It ’s got nothing to do with the music .
The music is what it was all about . ”
Page recalled an interview he gave to promote a solo album in which the journalist asked repeated questions on what Plant had reportedly said about other band members .
“ After about the sixth time , I said : ‘ Could you tell Robert to shut up so I can get on with my own interview ? ’
We have n’t just had a few months of this .
This has been years . ”
Special Report : Peak Oil Sidebar : Iran in the Crosshairs Iran 's danger to America is not its nuclear program but its plan to introduce a euro - based energy exchange .
By Ryan McGreal
Published August 22 , 2005
This article has been updated .
Starting in 2006 , Iran will start up an " oil bourse " , or a stock exchange for trading energy , that will be based on the euro , not the US dollar .
While this may seem innocuous , it will be a grave risk to continued American global hegemony .
Petrodollar Hegemony
Today , most oil trading takes place on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) and the London - based International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) .
Since the 1970s , the OPEC countries have all agreed to sell oil for US dollars only .
This means every country that wants to buy oil must first acquire enough US dollars to buy what it needs .
Year after year , America imports much more than it exports .
It must pay out that difference ( its current accounts deficit ) in dollars .
Last year , the US ran a current accounts deficit of over $ 600 billion USD ; this year , it 's expected to increase to $ 700 billion .
If there were no good reason for other countries to buy all those American dollars , then the dollar would decline in value until the US economy could no longer afford to import goods from abroad .
This is what happens when other countries run large current accounts deficits over long periods .
However , the deal with OPEC means other countries have no choice but to buy all those excess American dollars , which props up the value of the dollar and allows the American " import economy " to go on year after year .
Effectively , America 's main export is US dollars , and it is absolutely imperative to preserve a captive market for those dollars among oil - consuming countries .
The continued viability of the US economy depends on it .
Americans can still afford to consume because their economy is suffused with cheap imports ; a falling dollar will raise the prices of imported goods .
At the same time , Americans enjoy some of the lowest oil prices in the world , largely due to the petrodollar arrangement .
This has skewed the American vehicle market toward gas - guzzling but profitable SUVs and light trucks .
Selling Oil for Euros
One of the major unstated reasons the United States invaded Iraq was to stop Saddam Hussein from trading oil for euros , which he had begun in 2000 .
Hussein actually made more money selling oil for euros , as the euro appreciated 17 percent against the dollar between 2000 and 2003 .
Other countries in the region , particulary Iran and Syria , began public musing about switching from dollars to euros around the same time .
All three countries were subject to a barrage of threats from the United States government , but only Iraq went through with the switch , and it was summarily invaded .
One of the US government 's first acts in Iraq was to switch oil sales back to dollars .
Now , Iran plans not just to sell oil for euros , but to create an exchange market for parties to trade oil for euros .
The oil bourse will provide a euro - based price standard , the way West Texas Intermediate crude ( WTI ) and North Sea Brent crude do today .
To the extent that the balance of reserve holdings starts to shift from dollars to euros , that 's very bad news for America 's system of dollar hegemony .
Iran is taking a calculated risk that enough countries have an interest in a petro-euro market to contain American aggression .
Many central banks are already quietly shedding their dollar reserves , nervous that America 's economic fundamentals ( $ 500 billion federal deficit , $ 700 billion current accounts deficit , $ 7.94 trillion federal debt [ see update ] , record business and personal debts , zero savings ) cannot be sustained for long , and hoping to insulate themselves from what they see as an inevitable recession .
The US dollar has declined by a third against the euro since 2000 , despite the petrodollar arrangement .
At the same time , Europe is eager to enjoy more of the " virtuous circle " that comes from supplying a major reserve currency : a ready market for its currency and guaranteed reinvestment as euro - holders plant their money in European markets .
Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , has also expressed interest in switching from dollars to euros .
Russia would benefit from getting paid in a stronger currency , and it would represent a political victory over America after fifteen years of watching its clients and assets in the oil - rich Caspian region co-opted by American expansion .
Nuclear Politics
Iran may , indeed , be attempting to acquire nuclear weapons .
However , it also has a " legitimate " interest in developing nuclear power , since its own oil reserves are already post - peak and it aims to continue in its role as an energy exporter .
Iran is a signatory in good standing to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and has openly informed the International Atomic Energy Agency of its intentions as requried by the Treaty .
However , Iran 's presumed attempt to acquire nuclear weapons is only the politically acceptable excuse for America 's threats .
The real danger is that Iran will lay down the foundation for a post - hegemonic international energy industry in which America is merely one of many players .
If Iran is , in fact , developing nuclear weapons , it is doing so to acquire a deterrent against exactly this kind of American encroachment .
Indeed , recent world events have only enforced the notion that a nation 's successful efforts to acquire nuclear weapons confer respect and status , not the opprobrium it deserves .
India , a growing economic power that possesses a nuclear arsenal and refuses to sign either the NPT or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , has just been rewarded for its efforts by US President Bush , who has agreed to " work to achieve full civil nuclear energy cooperation with India . "
This is a straightforward violation of the NPT , which forbids signatories from exchanging nuclear materials or support with non-signatories .
If Iran really is trying to acquire nuclear weapons , is it any wonder why ?
Look at the advantages that having nuclear arsenals have given to US allies India , Pakistan , and Israel , all of which have benefitted immensely from a playing field tilted in their favour by their ability to project devastating power .
As official hysteria about Iran 's intentions escalates in volume and intensity , remember the real force undermining the moral authority of the NPT : the big nuclear ' have ' countries that still refuse either to apply the ban consistently or to take any meaningful steps of their own toward " general and complete disarmament " - ostensibly the NPT 's ultimate goal .
Ironically , America originally invaded Iraq - a poor , defenseless country - partly to send a message to other oil producing countries not to rock the petrodollar system , but the real message for small countries is that they need to present a credible deterrent threat or risk being ignored and / or invaded .

On March 26 , 2007 , a new federal law restricting Americans from contacting foreigners through internet dating sites was upheld by a federal court after a Constitutional challenge by an internet dating company .
In European Connections v. Alberto Gonzales , 1:06 - CV-0426 -CC , Judge Clarence Cooper of the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed a lawsuit by European Connections which claimed that the law violated the right to freedom of speech contained in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution .
The plaintiff had failed to challenge the law based on the First Amendment right to assemble .
According to Tristan Laurent , President of the advocacy group Online Dating Rights , “ We will now have to take legal action from the point of view of the users of online dating sites .
The whole idea that it is now a crime for American men to send emails to women in other countries is so preposterous it is beyond belief .
The judge ’s ruling that there is no Constitutional violation in forcing Americans to divulge all sorts of highly personal information to a complete stranger or scammer abroad before the American can even say hello or know to whom he is writing is only exceeded in foolishness by Congress in making the law . ”
The law was originally called the International Matchmaker Regulation Act , but it did not pass Congress in previous years by that name and it was later named the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act ( IMBRA ) before it passed on December 17th , 2005 .
The law , which was attached to the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act ( VAWA ) was apparently not debated in public and Mr. Laurent says that no dating company or dating site user was invited to a closed - door Senate hearing in July 2004 .
IMBRA makes it a felony for an internet dating company , that primarily focuses on introducing Americans to foreigners , to allow any American to communicate with any person of foreign nationality without first subjecting that American to a criminal background check , a sex offender check and without first having the American certify any previous convictions or arrests , any previous marriages or divorces any children and all states of residence since 18 .
Match.com is excluded from the law , and the judge found that this exception posed no challenge to the Fifth Amendment equal protection clause because American women are supposedly not abused by American men that they meet on the internet , and thus are not in need of protection .

I tried to be reasonable with you .
At first , we had a stable relationship .
I knew you were there , and every now and then I 'd see one of you , but in general you kept quiet and had the good sense to scurry for hiding when I turned the lights on .
One of you periodically stepped out of line , and had to be squashed , and then everything went back to normal .
If you had just continued in that manner , we could have lived this entire year in peaceful coexistence .
But no , you had to get greedy .
I began to see you more frequently , and in larger numbers .
Your lights - on scurry grew slower and slower and became more of a relaxed trot , then a walk .
Eventually , you had the audacity to sit right where you were and shake your head feelers at me .
You had gone too far .
It was time for war .
I began periodic sweeps of the apartment , armed with paper towels , and squashed anything that moved .
I removed every possible food source from anywhere you might be able to reach it , even adding extra layers of wrapping to items in the fridge , just in case one of you somehow managed to make it inside .
A couple of times , I even turned the lights off and stood motionless for five minutes , then flicked them back on and rained horrible death upon whichever of you had been lured out .
I really thought this would have been enough to make my point .
However , you continued to defy all logic and reasoning , and to multiply and grow bolder .
Three of you ran across my foot once ; I killed two , but left one alive ( but severely maimed ) to tell the tale ... clearly , you were beginning to affect my sanity , and I needed to up the ante in order to regain the upper hand in the battle for control of my apartment .
So , I added the roach spray to my arsenal .
This had little effect and made my apartment smell extremely questionable ; I guess you vermin won that round .
I notified the management company , who has always been very responsive to any problem I have had with the place .
There was some vague talk of fumigating or spraying or some other unspecified pest removal solution ; somehow it kept falling through the cracks , and nothing ever happened .
Well , I 'm not sure who you bribed or threatened for that little stunt , but it was time to show you little 6 - legged thugs that I was n't afraid of you , no matter what kind of " connections " you had .
I had no alternative , I had to buy the roach poison traps .
The way these are supposed to work is this - the cockroach smells the tasty poison / food , wanders into the trap , eats , returns to his / her , and then dies .
The practical result is that they should appear to vanish from your home like magic .
However , you at my apartment had grown not only bold , but complacent .
After eating , you all just kinda decided to hang out for a while , and as a result died in an odd sort of corpse constellation across my kitchen floor .
The destruction was horrific .
Some of your dead were being carried off by those who survived , almost like soldiers dragging the wounded into foxholes .
Many of you were still twitching , apparently writhing in agony from the effects of the poison .
The ravages of war are never pretty , and being a gentle person , part of me felt a little bit of remorse .
But now you know that it is , as they say , " on " , and I 'll push you fuckers all the way back to apartment 601 if I have to ... Sincerely , Fellow Apartment Dweller / Agent of your Doom
Student protesters upset Attorney General 's Harvard reunion
Student protesters wearing hoods and Guantanamo Bay garb found their way into the US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' 25th Harvard Law School reunion Saturday .
A release sent by the group to RAW STORY claims Gonzales was " forced to leave through a back door . "
Gonzales apparently arrived unannounced .
Students met him and his fellow classmates outside the law library where the class of 1982 had posed for a photo .
As the photographer said cheese , the group said students yelled that " torture , " " resign " or " I do n't recall " might be more appropriate .
The Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment .
" When I heard he was on campus , I was stuffing envelopes with letters to Congress in an office two floors above , " said Deborah Popowski , a second - year law student , according to the release .
" I dropped everything .
Gonzales needs to know that after approving poorly - reasoned memos that distort the rule of law and justify torture , he is simply not welcome here . "
According to the group , Popowski slipped though the law library 's front doors and approached Gonzales from behind as the Attorney General 's security detail kept protesters at bay .
" On behalf of many other Harvard Law students , " she said , " I 'd like to tell you that we are ashamed to have you as an alumnus of this school .
And we 're glad you 're here to be able to tell you that . "
Gonzales thanked the student and offered to shake her hand , but was refused .
Following the photo , Gonzales was said to have entered the library , traveled to the reading room , then ducked out through a basement emergency exit and into a waiting SUV .

ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkish police foiled a bomb attack in Ankara on Tuesday , the sixth anniversary of 9/11 attacks on the United States , averting what officials said would have been a disaster for the capital .
Turkish police officers stand guard as a van packed with explosives is transferred on a police vehicle from a multi-storey car park after it was found by police in Ankara , September 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Anatolian
Ankara governor Kemal Onal said police had found a vehicle packed with explosives in a multi-storey car park in a central district of the city of four million .
Shops and offices in the area were quickly evacuated .
“ The police efforts prevented a possible disaster ...
It is too early to say who was behind this but the bomb was big and I do not want to think what might have happened if it had gone off , ” Onal told reporters .
Private broadcaster NTV said police had found about 300 kg of explosives in the vehicle , a stolen mini-bus parked on the second floor of the car park .
The state Anatolian news agency said it took experts three hours to defuse the bomb .
Kurdish separatists , ultra- leftists and Islamist militants have all carried out attacks in Turkey in recent years .
CNN
Turk quoted police as saying the device found resembled those used in al Qaeda - backed suicide bomb attacks in November 2003 on two synagogues , the British Consulate and the HSBC bank in Istanbul .
More than 60 people died in those attacks .

But the governor ’s office later said the explosives found seemed to point towards the involvement of Kurdish separatist rebels of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) .
Turkish authorities have also blamed the PKK for a suicide bombing at a central Ankara shopping centre in May that killed at least six people and injured dozens .
The PKK denied any involvement in that attack .
PANIC
Police threw a wide cordon around the car park on Tuesday after identifying a suspicious - looking minibus .
“ Police ordered us to evacuate our building .
People panicked and started running , ” said Abbas Yuksel , 38 , who works for a construction company based in the area .
Onal noted that September 11 and 12 were particularly sensitive days .
The world remembers on Tuesday al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington , while Turkey will mark the anniversary of its 1980 military coup on Wednesday -- a possible focus for leftist groups .
A U.S. air base in western Germany received a bomb threat on Monday evening , prompting a large operation by local police and American forces to secure the site , police said on Tuesday .
The base received a call from a man who spoke in German with a Russian or Turkish accent and threatened to attack the air base in Spangdahlem with bombs .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden released a tape on Tuesday praising one of the hijackers involved in the Sept 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .
Bin Laden made a passing reference in his address to Ankara , but only to mention a historic event .
He made no comment on the policies of modern Turkey , a Muslim but secular state and NATO member whose close links to the West make it a potential target for militant Islamists .
From the moment that armed police ran into my tube carriage , I have been - like it or not - part of a major public event .
What I witnessed has been described numerous times , sometimes in ways I recognise and sometimes not .
But one thing that has been consistent has been a sense that the shooting involved De Menezes and the police but no one else .
Until CCTV footage of the incident was released , you would have been forgiven for forgetting this happened in a public place .
My memory of the day is full of people .
Bodies pushing to get out of doors , a desperate scrum at the foot of the narrow stairs , the sound of screaming from other carriages .
With the witnesses removed , the shooting can be described in impersonal terms .
And while this may be the clearest way for a court to investigate , I do n't think it is the best way for this terrible event to be remembered .
If you take the people away , you lose the means to understand the true horror .
I was there ; I can tell you : " I watched someone die on a rush hour tube train .
His body was left in a pool of blood on the floor . "
To fully comprehend what happened and begin to put things right , the witnesses need to be back in the picture .
So why have we been so quiet ?
The Independent Police Complaints Commission advised witnesses not to meet or communicate , or talk to the press , for fear of interfering with future legal cases .
But while evidence from civilian witnesses appears in this week 's IPCC report , none was called to give evidence at the recent trial .
The best we could hope for in court was to be represented through other people 's words .
I have tried very hard to be a " good witness " , but the odds have not been in my favour .
I gave my first statement to police with no idea that what I was describing would turn out to be so contentious .
At the time it seemed simple - the police had caught a bomber .
I was in shock and wanted to go home , but first of all I wanted to help .
If I had n't spoken to the police on the day and had waited to speak to the IPCC , my evidence today would be stronger .
As it is , the statement I eventually gave to the IPCC will always stand alongside that first rambling statement given in shock .
I was surprised to learn that the firearms officers made their statements together and not until some days after the event .
Apparently this is standard procedure , designed to help them give the most complete account they can once the effects of shock are wearing off .
Civilian witnesses were not afforded this luxury , and this shows in our accounts .
How can it be that our evidence , from the very beginning , stood less chance of being coherent and credible than that of the officers who shot De Menezes ?
I have trusted that , in keeping quiet and apart from other witnesses , I have been doing the best I can .
But it is beginning to feel as if I 've been protecting information that has no legal purpose .
When civilian witnesses finally speak in court at the delayed inquest - nearly three years after the event , with all the information from the trial and two IPCC reports in the public domain - what use will our testimony be then ?
If the firearms officers can confer , why can't the witnesses ?
If the police can give accounts to the media , why can't we ?
There is something inhuman about the response to this incident .
You can see it in the attempts to paint De Menezes as partly responsible for his death , and in the way his family has been isolated and ignored .
And you can see it in the awkward position the witnesses hold .
Unlike others affected by major incidents , we are unable to meet or mark anniversaries together .
These are things that can bring meaning to seemingly senseless events , yet we and , crucially , the De Menezes family are denied them .
Instead , we are kept separate and silent , made to feel that what we saw should not be spoken of , that we cannot contribute to making things right .
I have left flowers at Stockwell station two years in a row , wondering if other witnesses are doing the same .
There are , certainly , lots of flowers .

I emailed David Griffin about the INSIDE JOB plastic roll banner project :
http://www.911blogger.com/node/10077
He wrote back :
There are ominous signs that the Bush - Cheney administration is planning another false - flag attack --- the warnings that al - Qaeda has regained its strength and is determined to strike America again , Chertoff ’s “ gut feeling ” that another strike is coming , and National Security Presidential Directive 51 , according to which President Bush will assume virtually dictatorial powers if if the United States , in his judgment , has suffered a “ catastrophic emergency . ”
The best way to prevent this eventuality is is getting the idea that 9/11 was an inside job into the public sphere , thereby making them fear they will not get away with another one .
David Ray Griffin
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
In a rare show of bipartisanship on Iraq , the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to make the Pentagon produce plans to withdraw U.S. troops -- but did not mandate the withdrawals .
Some House Democrats went much further than that vote , however and warned they would hold try to hold up President George W. Bush ’s latest war funding request until he agrees to a goal of ending combat operations in Iraq by the time he leaves office in early 2009 .
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , Wisconsin Democratic Rep. David Obey , said his panel would not even consider the funding request -- which Pentagon chief Robert Gates says will be about $ 189 billion -- until early next year .
Obey also threatened to try to raise taxes to fund the war , saying it was wrong to keep borrowing to pay for it .
But that idea was quickly shot down by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
The legislation that passed the House 377 - 46 , gathering votes from nearly as many Republicans as Democrats , would require the Pentagon to submit regular reports on withdrawal planning to Congress ’ defense committees .
The House has voted several times this year to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq , but the Senate -- where the Democratic majority is narrower -- is gridlocked over the issue .
With the outlook grim for breaking the Senate stalemate , House leaders decided to bring up other measures this week focused on pullout planning and cracking down on abuses by military contractors .
Tuesday ’s successful legislation was written by two Democrats -- Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii and John Tanner of Tennessee .
It was backed by 196 Democrats and 181 Republicans , including the leaders of both parties .

START TALKING
Supporters argued that lawmakers needed to start talking to the Pentagon , and to each other , about winding down the war .
“ We went into Iraq on a bipartisan basis , ” said Rep. Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican , noting that two - thirds of the House and three - fourths of the Senate voted in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq .
“ We need to leave Iraq on a bipartisan basis .
It ’s called compromise , ” Shays said .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , an Ohio Republican who backed the bill , said contingency planning was a core function of the Pentagon , and the bill just expressed the wish that it continue “ standard operating procedure . ”
Democrats who opposed the bill also said it had little real effect .
Rep. Maurice Hinchey of New York said it did nothing to get the approximately 165,000 U.S. soldiers out of Iraq , but instead required reports .
“ What we are likely to see is four , five , maybe even six reports coming out of this administration , and no responsible action taken with regards to the disastrous circumstances that occur on the basis of this illegal military occupation . ”
Last month , U.S. Iraq commander Gen. David Petraeus announced gradual U.S. troop reductions in Iraq through next summer .
Democrats said this would leave troop levels at about 130,000 -- the same as before Bush added forces this year .
Outside the House chamber acrimony over the war continued .
Obey said more war funding would not be approved unless it is linked to a plan to bring home U.S. combat troops by January 2009 .
“ As chairman of the appropriations committee , I have no intention of reporting out of committee any time in this session of Congress any such ( war funding ) request that simply serves to continue the status quo , ” he said .
Obey said he and some other Democrats also would introduce a surtax to pay for the Iraq war .
But Pelosi , a California Democrat , opposed that idea , and Republicans poked fun at their differences .
“ Finally , we found a tax that Mrs. Pelosi is not for , ” said Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri .
Only about 25 percent of Americans support the administration ’s $ 190 billion war funding request for this fiscal year that started on Monday , while about 70 percent want the proposed funding reduced , a Washington Post - ABC News poll published on Tuesday said .
Bill O'Reilly has discovered that sometimes people say stupid things on the Internet .
And he 's going to have a big story about it tonight , supposedly .
He 's decided to play David to what he imagines is a corporate Goliath , JetBlue , because they 're one of the sponsors of Yearly Kos .
This is undoubtedly happening on Murdoch 's orders : Markos led the way in getting the Democratic presidential candidates to boycott the Fox debate , and we 're going to be having a Democratic presidential candidates forum at Yearly Kos .
So they ambushed JetBlue 's CEO outside of his apartment last week , demanding to know why he was sponsoring people who are mean .
Meaning they cherrypicked the worst of the comments on Daily Kos , many which were probably from GOP trolls anyway , and found a couple of 9/11 conspiracy diaries and are trying to smear the whole of the lefty blogosphere with a handful of kooks who 've been banned from the site for being , well , kooks .
Speaking of which , I wonder how many more leads O'Reilly 's gotten on his big story of last week , the national threat of lesbian gangs ?
This is a curious gambit by Fox .
Do they really want to get into a corporate sponsor fight ?
Seems dangerous territory to tread for them .
Because if they want to have that fight , we can have that fight .
Alan Simpson , a former Senator from Wyoming who once was a strong advocate of the military ’s Do n’t Ask - Do n’t Tell policy , has a great column in today ’s Washington Post explaining why he ’s changed his mind .
There is alot to like about the column , but here ’s the money quote :
Since 1993 , I have had the rich satisfaction of knowing and working with many openly gay and lesbian Americans , and I have come to realize that “ gay ” is an artificial category when it comes to measuring a man or woman ’s on - the - job performance or commitment to shared goals .
It says little about the person .
Our differences and prejudices pale next to our historic challenge .
Gen .
Pace is entitled , like anyone , to his personal opinion , even if it is completely out of the mainstream of American thinking .
But he should know better than to assert this opinion as the basis for policy of a military that represents and serves an entire nation .
Let us end “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
This policy has become a serious detriment to the readiness of America ’s forces as they attempt to accomplish what is arguably the most challenging mission in our long and cherished history .
Good for you Senator .
Except I ’d disagree on one thing .
General Pace is entitled to his own personal opinion about homosexuals , but he serves at the pleasure of the President and as he has already admitted , it was entirely inappropriate for him to voice his personal views on this issue while speaking as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The ban on homosexuals , or at least open homosexuals , in the military is as out - dated as segration was when Harry Truman ended that stupid policy in the 1950s .
It ’s time for it to come to an end .

Two weeks .
That ’s what we have left of the August “ Summer District Work Period ” – realistically our last local opportunity to push for impeachment while ‘ our Representatives ’ are home .
If there is n’t a surge of cosigners the week following Labor Day when Congress returns to D.C. onto H. Res. 589 calling for the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and / or H. Res. 333 calling for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney and / or new articles introduced against either of them or President George W. Bush then the likelihood of anything actually moving forward drops off noticeably .
Zero or little progress in this direction would n’t be the death of the possibility of impeachment taking place and most certainly should n’t lead to the accountability and justice movement ’s heat being turned down , but clearly the momentum needed for critical mass to be reached and impeachment proceedings to begin would not have been actualized .
It ’s likely now or never .
Unbelieveably , members of the House of Representatives are still arguing with their constituents against impeachment in fear that Cheney will become President , that there are no impeachable offenses on record , that impeachment would be harmful to Democratic Party chances in the “ ˜08 elections , that impeachment proceedings will extend the Iraq War and that the proceedings would get in the way of important legislation the Democratic Congress is pushing forward .
Facts to educate your under - informed Representatives with posthaste :
1 ) . H. Res. 333 and H. Res. 589 , which call for the impeachment of Vice President Cheney and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales respectfully , are the only impeachment resolutions currently filed with the House .
There is no resolution in the 110th Congress at this time to impeach President Bush .
It makes perfect sense to impeach and remove consigliere Gonzales first to remove the Bush Administration ’s criminal shield , then go public with investigations of Cheney .
Impeachment of Bush would be a slam dunk after evidence revealed in the Cheney impeachment were front page news across the nation .
2 ) . There have been hundreds of articles written detailing the impeachable offenses of the Bush Administration .
One of the best was done in series form by my ImpeachforPeace.org cofounder Jodin Morey , entitled “ Bush ’s Impeachable Offenses ” :
PART 1 : Illegal War
PART 2 : Illegal Spying
PART 3 : Illegal Leaking of Classified Information
PART 4 : War Crimes / Geneva Violations
PART 5 : Illegal Use of Signing Statements
To argue against these facts can only be due to ignorance as a result of intellectual laziness or chronic denial .
We of ImpeachforPeace.org have not ever had a single legitimate charge - by - charge challenge of these facts .
We can only conclude that they stand on their merits .
3 ) . What is proving most harmful to Democrats in Congress is that they are revealing themselves to be far better enablers of every bad thing the Bush Administration has wreaked upon the world than the honorable defenders of the Constitution they swore an oath to be on our behalf .
My own freshman Senator Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) personally saw to it that my 4th Amendment protections against illegal search and seizure died a gruesome death on August 3rd by inexplicably voting “ yea , I favor fascism ” on S. 1927 .
It is misguided ‘ leadership ’ such as this that has many activists and the most extremely politically engaged considering running for office or pushing for third party support across the nation , setting up another “ Nader - effect ” possibility .
4 ) . The Iraq War will not end while Bush is in office .
The House does not have enough votes to override any veto , and the supposed 51 - 49 Democratic Party majority - led Senate has , for all intents and purposes , a one vote Republican majority while Tim Johnson ( D - SD ) has been ill , Political Shapeshifter Joe Lieberman ( Whatever - CT ) continues to be morally bankrupt and President of the Senate Cheney holds the tie - breaking vote .
Bush has made clear that American forces will remain in Iraq as long as he is in charge , so impeachment is the only way that we will possibly move toward peace before 2009 .
Pleading for peace without insisting upon justice through investigations leading to impeachment is akin to supplying an alcoholic with booze and begging them not to drink .
5 ) . Madame Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s ( D - CA ) grandious promises last November notwithstanding , the only meaningful legislation to have survived Bush ’s veto and signing statements is a minimum wage increase .
That important gain could only be made at the cost of more ‘ blank check ’ funding of Bush ’s war - profiteering cronies .
Far more progressive legislative progress was made during the Clinton impeachment trial .
Educating your Representatives of the impeachable offenses and negating their specious arguments against honoring their oaths is n’t all that you can do .
The benefits of pursuing justice and putting honor and integrity before political expediency are legion .
Decades from now , if man is still alive and woman should survive we may find that among the enduring benefits of the impeachment of Alberto Gonzales , Dick Cheney and George W. Bush was that the American electorate , less than half of whom had historically turned out for even the most important national elections , were suddenly made aware that indeed , America had proved to be ‘ of the people , by the people and for the people ’ despite all evidence during the Bush Administration to the contrary .
Every good thing the Pelosi-led Congress claims to be fighting for would have the tidal wave of support of the newly enfranchised citizenry .
The Democratic Dream may come to fruition after all .
It can not happen without you .
You are the one you have been waiting for .
The Sykes - Picot agreement was a secret understanding concluded in May 1916 , during World War I , between Great Britain and France , with the assent of Russia , for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire .
The agreement led to the division of Turkish - held Syria , Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine into various French and British - administered areas .
The agreement took its name from its negotiators , Sir Mark Sykes of Britain and Georges Picot of France .
The highest security will be in place during the APEC leaders ' week which includes the long weekend from September 7 to 9 .
" Our intent around communicating is to be in a position where , as much as possible , there are no surprises for anybody when it comes to Leaders Week , " she said .
" [ People will know ] whether a bus stop has been moved or that their garbage will be collected ... and that businesses know whether their staff will have access to their premises . "
Ms Ryan said staff at hotels , where important delegates and dignitaries will be staying , must pass an accreditation process and a security background check .
Journalists covering the event also have to go through a similar process .
" The NSW Police Force and the [ APEC ] Task Force are very keen for [ open communication ] to happen , but at the same time without compromising any information about security that would give any mischief - makers information that they should not have , " Ms Ryan said .
The Prime Minister 's office has said that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was conducting security assessments for APEC , including " politically motivated violence checks against ASIO databases , similar to those conducted for the aviation and maritime sectors and a string of special events including ... the 2000 Olympics and the Melbourne Commonwealth Games . "
Ms Ryan said anyone with a legitimate reason to be in the city during the summit in September would be allowed to go about their normal business .
A business group said they expected Sydney would be as quiet " as a Sunday morning " during the APEC long weekend .
" It will be like when you walk around on a Sunday morning and it's hard to find a good coffee , " the Sydney Chamber of Commerce 's executive director , Patricia Forsythe , said .
" The retail hubs will look the same , that will give you a sense of what it will be like because people do n't come in . "
Ms Forsythe expects most small retailers and businesses in the city to shut during the three - day weekend but many bars and restaurants to open .
" I have no doubt that it will be small business in the city that will find it difficult , " she said .
The chamber 's members , which comprises large corporations , were supportive of APEC and expected to carry some cost from the " inefficiencies " that the summit caused , Ms Forsythe said .
She was unable to quantify the cost of the summit to business , noting a generic figure of $ 327 million as the cost of a public holiday in NSW .
Ms Forsythe said businesses were more concerned about the " unpredictable " nature of any protests than the known disruption of security measures .
Ms Ryan said organisers have run about 400 stakeholder briefings about the event for groups such as businesses and residents in the central business district and other APEC security areas .
In its quest to out - fox Fox News , CNN is handing over its 8:00 pm time slot to conservative shill , Laura Ingraham for a week .
Ingraham is the diva that deemed that artists should “ Shut Up and Sing ” ( unless , of course , you ’re Ronald Reagan or Fred Thompson ) .
It was only a few weeks ago that CNN recruited Glenn Beck for the same duty .
Is this the beginning of a parade of rightist ideologues to audition for the role from which Paula Zahn has been ousted ?
Who ’s next ?
Rush Limbaugh ?
Michael Savage ?
Ann Coulter ?
It is more than a little puzzling that CNN would pursue this course when they already have Lou Dobbs to represent the intolerant , blowhard wing of public opinion .
And there does n’t seem to be an argument for ratings when you consider that Beck bombed , performing 23 % below the failing Zahn .
If ratings were a consideration , then why does n’t CNN try to emulate the example of a surging Keith Olbermann rather than the fading Bill O’Reilly , who has lost half his audience in the past two years .
Speaking of fading , was n’t it Ingraham who called CNN a dinosaur in an appearance on The O’Reilly Fester ?
And this is her reward .
Ingraham also impugned the character of reporters who risk their lives in war zones .
Her reward for that was a smackdown by Lara Logan of CBS .
Then there was the time Ingraham urged her radio listeners to jam the phone lines of a voter protection hotline .
If CNN considers Ingraham to be a credible host for their “ news ” network , they really are marching further down the trails blazed by Fox .
By traipsing a flock of right - wing pundits across their airwaves they demonstrate the fallacy of the liberal media myth .
It ’s not as if they could n’t pick from the likes of Ed Schultz , Randi Rhodes , Thom Hartmann , Rachel Maddow , Stephanie Miller , Sam Seder , Taylor Marsh , Jim Hightower , Laura Flanders , or other distinguished progressive commentators .
It ’s just that they do n’t want to .
And that ’s the problem .
It is repeated today by Republicans on the floor of the Senate and restated on this site , only yesterday , and it goes like this :
The Democrats have an al Qaeda problem , and this war , which was started with the Big Lie that claimed it was necessary to defeat bin Laden , must be continued to promote the Big Lie that to change the policy would help the terrorists , when the exact opposite is true .
How odd that the title of Al Gore 's brilliant film , " An Inconvenient Truth , " is used to repeat this falsehood , when Gore 's brilliant book , The Assault on Reason , was the most sweeping and devastating destruction of this lie that created 3,600 Gold Star Mothers and allowed bin Laden to escape , regroup and gain strength .
George Bush and John McCain will be proven right about Iraq ?
No , the only question left is how many must continue to die for the vile , wrong , self - destructive war and how far the Senate Republicans will go to let this travesty continue , even though most of them know it is wrong , even though it is the cancer that is destroying the Republican Party .
The new National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) is not an argument to continue the status quo disaster but an argument to end it .
The NIE makes it clear why American troops should not give their lives to perform the function of the Baghdad police supporting a corrupt Iraqi government , a death squad - infiltrated Iraq police , and an Iraqi army that after years of alleged American training has gone down in readiness after the surge , according to our own commanders .
George Bush and John McCain will be proven right ?
The NIE makes it clear that our troops should be redeployed to concentrate on the fight against al Qaeda outside of Baghdad , and to protect the borders across which arms and terrorists enter Iraq .
The NIE makes it clear that George Bush 's Iraq war has created more terrorists than it killed , diverted both our military and intelligence from the real threat , and destabilized and destroyed our global military force structures at the very moment Bush 's policies have created more terrorists and allowed bin Laden to regroup and gain strength .
Democrats have an al Qaeda problem ?
George Bush and John McCain will be proven right ?
George Bush will be morally impeached by history for that blood - stained moment when we could have killed bin Laden at Tora Bora , and George Bush said no to our Special Forces , who were pleading for reinforcements , because he was so obsessed with fighting this Iraq war that has done so much damage to our country , our troops , our credibility in the world , and the real threat that George Bush neglected .
The war against the real enemy , bin Laden , was neglected to create a war against a threat that only existed in the Big Lie talking points of neoconservative delusions , pushed by a president who is an incompetent commander in chief , promoted through fear , advanced by lies , deformed by cruel deployment of troops , pursued with torture that created countless new terroristis , covered up by commutations and protected with coming pardons , issued by leaders who fear convicted criminals and liars will turn state 's evidence against those who abused the oath of office .
The Big Lie that we had to invade Iraq because of bin Laden ; the Big Lie that have to continue this tragedy because we should be afraid of terrorism ; the Big Lie that we promote liberty and fight terrorism with torture chambers ; the Big Lie that we should be ruled by fear rather than courage ; the Big Lie that we win hearts and minds with corrupt occupations and over a hundred thousand unregulated mercenaries ; the Big Lie that we support our troops with cruel deployments and preventable deaths and scandals that plague wounded troops and disabled heroes .
Which of these will George Bush and John McCain be proven right about ?
George Bush 's Big Lie is based on the deadly falsehood that something has gone terribly and tragically wrong and we should continue it , and escalate it , and repeat the catastrophes in even larger ways , with ever greater death , and even greater damage to our military and our spirit .
No , Democrats do not have an al Qaeda problem .
America has an al Qaeda problem , and the reason is George W. Bush , who lacked the vigilance before Sept. 11 , and then shamefully exploited Sept. 11 for a policy of delusion and destruction that the American people , and our friends throughout the free world , want ended here , now , once and for all .

Colony of M. Capricolum , the recipient cells , in one of the experiments .

For the first time , scientists have completely transformed a species of bacteria into another species by transplanting its complete set of DNA .
The achievement marks a significant step toward the construction of synthetic life , with applications including the production of clean fuel in as little as a decade .
Scientists Carole Lartigue and colleagues from the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , Maryland , have published their results in a recent issue of Science .
In addition to being a proof - of - concept experiment , the researchers hope that genome transplantation will enable the production of synthetic microbes for green energy sources , pharmaceuticals , chemicals and textiles .
The scientists ’ results show that it is possible to transplant the complete set of DNA — the genome — from one species into the genome of a different species , so that the recipient organism is phenotypically and genotypically identical to the donor organism .
In their experiment , the researchers used two species of bacteria that belong to a group of organisms called mycoplasmas due to their small genomes ( making them easier to handle ) and lack of a cell wall ( enabling easier insertion of DNA ) .
In the experiment , Mycoplasma mycoides Large Colony ( LC ) served as the donor , and Mycoplasma capricolum the receiver .
Both bacteria are mild pathogens of goats , and are genetically similar , sharing about 75 % of their genomic material .
The researchers explained that the transplantation method is simple in concept , though complicated to execute .
First , the proteins were stripped from the M. mycoides LC cells , resulting in “ naked ” DNA that can be passed between cells .
Then this intact DNA was incubated briefly with M. capricolum cells , soaking in a solution that caused the M. capricolum cells to fuse together .
As two of these recipient cells fused , they sometimes encapsulated a donor DNA chromosome .
Then , the scientists treated all the cells with the antibiotic tetracycline , which is toxic to M. capricolum cells .
However , since the researchers used a strain of M. mycoides LC that was resistant to tetracycline , any M. capricolum that contained the M. mycoides LC DNA survived , which was about 1 in 150,000 cells .
The researchers then performed tests to confirm the identities of the new organism .
“ While one success in 150,000 attempts would be unacceptable in most human endeavors such as shooting free throws , in most microbiology applications such efficiency is completely OK , ” Glass explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ It is very easy for us to attempt to transplant donor genomes into 15 million or more recipient cells , which would yield hundreds on transplants .
Still , we are exploring approaches that are more efficient , but our current method is completely tractable for our current plans . ”
The scientists are n’t sure of the mechanism behind the transplant , but they have ruled out natural methods of DNA transformation , such as recombination .
They suspect that cell fusion may play an important role in mediating the transplant due to the optimal concentrations of fusion solution .
However , they do not know if other species will be able to transfer their complete DNA using the same method .
The researchers are excited about the success of the first genome transplantation because it marks a step toward the propagation of synthetic genomes .
In previous studies , Craig Venter and his colleagues have defined a minimal genome of approximately 400 genes required to sustain cellular life .
The scientists want to synthesize this genome , called Mycoplasma genitalium , using only simple chemicals .
The longest piece of DNA synthesized so far is 35,000 units , while the M. genitalium is 580,000 units , making the synthesis a realistic goal .
After synthesizing complete genomes , the scientists hope to make the genomes take control of living cells , with a genome transplant like the one in the current study .
“ To better enable rational design of new species of microbes capable of efficiently producing molecules that can solve human needs for energy , health and bioremediation , we believe we first need to better understand more fully how cells work , ” Glass said .
“ We will use our genome transplantation technology to enliven this genome [ M. genitalium ] by transferring it into a suitable recipient cell .
From that first ‘ synthetic cell ’ we will iteratively remake the genome in ever smaller simpler forms by deleting non-essential genes .
Eventually we will produce cells containing only the essential set of genes necessary for life under laboratory conditions .
These cells will be invaluable platforms for discovery of the biological roles of cellular components we currently can ascribe no function to or to components we may not even be aware of . ”
Synthetic biologists predict this research will have many applications , including production of clean alternative fuel in as little as 10 years .
Venter has also set up a company called Synthetic Genomics to create alternative fuels , which could potentially be used in the same infrastructure as petroleum and be used in today ’s vehicles .
“ We envision engineering bacteria to convert cellulosic material to ethanol , butanol , or perhaps long chain alcohols , ” Glass explained .
“ Some microbes have the capacity to convert the carbohydrate polymers that comprise cellulose into glucose and other simple sugars .
Other bacteria have the capacity to convert simple sugars into various fuels .
We envision synthesizing new chimeric bacterial species that can efficiently do both . ”

But the link is n’t disease - causing germs .
It ’s early and ample exposure to harmless bacteria — especially the kinds encountered living close to the land and around livestock and other young children .
In other words , dirt , dung and diapers .
Just as disease - causing microbes clearly bring on inflammation , harmless microorganisms appear to exert a calming effect on the immune system .
A second misconception common among vaccine - shunning parents is that there ’s something “ natural ” about the 6 to 10 respiratory infections the typical American child gets every year ( or even the two to four we adults experience ) .
Common , yes ; natural no , not if “ natural ” represents the forces that shaped the human immune system during all but the last sliver of our 250,000 years as Homo sapiens .
Colds , flus and most other contagious diseases found a central place in our lives only after we and our domestic animals began crowding together in large settlements some 5,000 years ago .
Yet the most compelling reason to get a flu shot this year is a new and deadly threat — methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , a dangerous kind of staph that has been causing outbreaks of deadly pneumonia among the otherwise young and healthy , typically on the heels of the flu .
Unfortunately , we have no practical way to eradicate MRSA .
About a third of us silently carry staph at any given time , and trying to eradicate MRSA or any other staph strain from a community of symptom - free carriers is difficult to impossible .
Worse , the experts conclude , any widespread effort to do so is certain to breed greater drug resistance .
Flu shots do n’t guarantee protection from MRSA pneumonia .
It can piggyback on other kinds of viral respiratory infections .
But protecting yourself and your children from the flu may be the best way to reduce your family ’s risk .
Whether dealing with the flu , other “ routine ” infections or even the chickenpox , the message is the same :
In a world abounding in harmless , even beneficial microbes , do n’t embrace the tiny fraction that can make you ill .

Dodgeball takes a lot of knocks in gym class for being dangerous , but it 's got nowhere near the death rate of these sports .
Here 's a look at six sports you would n't want your kids playing in gym class .
1. Pakistani Kite Flying
Every year Pakistanis celebrate the beginning of spring with Basant , a joyous festival with music , horses , flowers and kites .
Well , actually , scratch the kites ; they were banned by the Pakistani government .
The tradition of flying kites competitively on Basant was resulting in a surprising number of deaths .
Over the course of the festival , the Pakistanis created a tradition of not just flying the kites , but battling them .
Bands on the streets would play whenever someone 's kite strings were cut , which led to people replacing their kite string with razor wire to up their advantage .
The competitive nature of the kite flying has led to a shocking number of deaths , from cuts from razor wire to people falling off roofs or being hit by stray bullets .
After 9 deaths in 2004 and 20 in 2005 , the Pakistani government established the kite - flying ban .
Bowing to public opinion , the government lifted the ban for the 2007 Basant , but that only resulted in ten more deaths .
With odds like those , Charlie Brown 's probably lucky he never got his kite off the ground .
2. Pole Vaulting
When two pole vaulters were killed within five days of each other in 2002 , the chairman of the USA Track and Field pole vaulting safety committee was n't even shocked .
After all , the flaws in pole vaulting had been clear for a while .
With at least 18 deaths since 1982 out of only 25,000 participants , pole vaulting has the highest rate of death of any American sport .
Most of the deaths came from high school competitions , where the rules are n't consistent between schools , let alone states .
The size of the landing pad was the main culprit ; the American Society for Testing and Measurement recommends a landing pad more than 21 feet wide and 16 feet long , but most schools had mats far smaller .
Helmets were also an issue - there was no standardized helmet , so most competitors used a bike or skateboard helmet , if they had one at all .
Since 2002 , though , the Kevin Dare Memorial Fund ( set up after the death of Kevin Dare , one of the 2002 fatalities ) has been lobbying for increased safety and laws requiring helmets .
The efforts seemed to have worked , since no deaths have been recorded since Dare's .
3. Pro Wresting
One of the most talked - about sports stories this summer was pro wrestler Chris Benoit 's murder - suicide .
Not as talked - about were the deaths of three fellow pro wrestlers since Benoit 's death .
In fact , since 1997 , 65 pro wrestlers have died before they turned 50 , according to journalist Dave Melzer .
That 's the equivalent of 186 MLB players or 435 from the NFL .
Most of wrestling 's deaths can be linked back to steroid use , whether it's an overdose or organ failure brought on by steroids .
People are quick to blame WWE promoter Vince McMahon ( who had his own death faked earlier this year ) for the rampant drug use , since he once urged athletes to bulk up to drive up ratings .
PLUS : Ivy League football ( pre-1905 ) , and more , after the jump !
4. The Dakar Rally
The Dakar Rally sounds like something straight out of a movie : it 's an off - road race with few rules , tricked - out cars , plenty of danger and , once , the disappearance of Margaret Thatcher 's son .
The rally got its auspicious beginning in 1977 when racer Thierry Sabine got lost and decided it would be a good place to have a race .
Since then , it 's been held annually starting in Paris and ending in Dakar , Senegal ( or some approximation of those cities ) .
Even though it 's legally sanctioned , there are n't many rules , which has resulted in a whopping 48 competitor deaths , or 1.7 every year .
2005 was a particularly deadly year , with five deaths , including a five - year - old spectator who ran onto the road .
In 2007 , the organizers established speed limits to curb the deaths , which did result in a successful race , even though less than half of the contestants even made it to the finish line .
5. Football , pre-1905
Before 1905 , one of the most popular plays in football was the flying wedge , where players would form a " ˜V ' around the ball carrier and protect him down the field .
With plays like that and no passing , it should come as no surprise that football was a much more brutal sport .
In fact , it was so brutal that 18 players died in 1905 alone , including three college players .
That prompted president Teddy Roosevelt to call football 's " Big Three , "  Princeton , Yale and Harvard ( just imagine when those were football 's top schools ) , to the White House and force them to reform the rules or he would declare football illegal .
They went with the first option , getting rid of the flying wedge and legalizing the forward pass .
Even still , it took a while before all schools adopted the new rules and made football safe ( 1909 saw 33 players killed ) , but eventually the pact among schools became the formal NCAA we know today .
6. BASE Jumping
BASE jumping is a sport with very simple rules : take a parachute , find a tall object , jump .
It takes its name from the four objects athletes jump from : Buildings , Antennae , Spans ( bridges , etc. ) and the Earth ( cliffs and other natural formations ) .
Not surprisingly , a sport that involves jumping into thin air has a pretty high death rate , mostly from parachute failures .
William Harmon represented the modern era's first BASE jumping death when his canopy failed in high winds after a jump from a 1,000 - foot antenna tower .
Since his death , 114 others have died , which works out to about 4.5 every year .
As a tribute to those who died , the fatalities are all recorded at the BASE fatality list .
The Argo project has reached a milestone of 3,000 robots .
These robots monitor ocean temperatures and salinity .
The cylindrical robot descends to a depth of 2,000 meters and drifts with the current for 9 days .
the robot then rises to the surface , while gathering data .
Once at the surface it transmits the data via satellite to weather centers .
The robot then descends to 2,00 meters again and repeats the process .
The robots have been deployed in all of the major oceans .
How they avoid surfacing into or damaging boats we are not sure , but next time you are swimming in the ocean , watch out for the robots .
Many countries such as France , China , Norway and the United States participate in this program .

Many slaves are used to clear Amazonian land for cultivation
They were said to be working in inhumane conditions on a sugar cane plantation in the Amazon .
An ethanol - producing company which owns the plantation has denied allegations of abusing the workers .
Human rights and labour organisations believe that between 25,000 to 40,000 people could be working in conditions akin to slavery in Brazil .
Many farmers in the Amazon region who incur debts are forced to work virtually for free in order to repay the money they owe .
Labour ministry officials and prosecutors discovered more than 1,100 workers working 13 hours a day and living in conditions described as " appalling " .
It is the largest such raid in Brazil , a country beset by the problem of slave labour .
Officials said that the labourers lived in overcrowded conditions with no proper sanitation facilities .
Ethanol industry
The plantation was located about 250 km ( 155 miles ) from the mouth of the Amazon river near the town of Ulianopolis .
Many workers in the Amazon work on plantations to pay debts
The company which runs the plantation denies the charges against it and said that the workers were paid good wages by Brazilian standards .
But the BBC's Gary Duffy , in Sao Paulo , says many are thought to fall into debt slavery by paying for transportation to work far from where they live and by buying overpriced tools and food .
Ethanol sells in Brazil at half the price for conventional petrol and is said to be a greener fuel for cars .
Recently , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to bring industry leaders and workers together to " to discuss the humanisation of the sugar cane sector in this country " .
He was acting after being criticised for calling Brazil 's ethanol producers " national and world heroes " , despite critics accusing producers of exploiting workers in the sugar cane and ethanol industry .
The Mobile Verification Task Force , which conducted the raid on the plantation , was founded in 1995 by the Labour Ministry and claims to have freed more than 21,000 workers from debt slave conditions at more than 1,600 farms across Brazil .
The Roman Catholic Church estimates there are some 25,000 workers living in slave - like conditions throughout Brazil , most of them in the Amazon .
From today 's WSJ , " Affirmative Action Backfires " : by Gail Heriot , professor of law at the University of San Diego and a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights .
Three years ago , UCLA law professor Richard Sander published an explosive , fact - based study of the consequences of affirmative action in American law schools in the Stanford Law Review .
Easily the most startling conclusion of his research : Mr. Sander calculated that there are fewer black attorneys today than there would have been if law schools had practiced color - blind admissions -- about 7.9 % fewer by his reckoning .
He identified the culprit as the practice of admitting minority students to schools for which they are inadequately prepared .
In essence , they have been " matched " to the wrong school .
Mr. Sander 's original article noted that when elite law schools lower their academic standards in order to admit a more racially diverse class , schools one or two tiers down feel they must do the same .
As a result , there is now a serious gap in academic credentials between minority and non-minority law students across the pecking order , with the average black student 's academic index more than two standard deviations below that of his average white classmate .
Not surprisingly , such a gap leads to problems .
Students who attend schools where their academic credentials are substantially below those of their fellow students tend to perform poorly .
As a result , in elite law schools , 51.6 % of black students had first - year grade point averages in the bottom 10 % of their class as opposed to only 5.6 % of white students .
Nearly identical performance gaps existed at law schools at all levels .
This much is uncontroversial .
Mr. Sander calculated that if law schools were to use color - blind admissions policies , fewer black law students would be admitted to law schools ( 3,182 students instead of 3,706 ) , but since those who were admitted would be attending schools where they have a substantial likelihood of doing well , fewer would fail or drop out ( 403 vs. 670 ) .
In the end , more would pass the bar on their first try ( 1,859 vs. 1,567 ) and more would eventually pass the bar ( 2,150 vs. 1,981 ) than under the current system of race preferences .
Obviously , these figures are just approximations , but they are troubling nonetheless .
Under current practices , only 45 % of blacks who enter law school pass the bar on their first attempt as opposed to over 78 % of whites .
Even after multiple tries , only 57 % of blacks succeed .
The other 43 % are often saddled with student debt , routinely running as high as $ 160,000 , not counting undergraduate debt .
How great an increase in the number of black attorneys is needed to justify these costs ?
MP : One problem is that despite all of the potential problems from a " mismatch " between a law school 's academic standard and the academic abilities of minority students , law schools are under extreme pressure to enroll minorities to maintain accreditation and student - loan eligibility .
Some admissions officer may be frantic to enroll minority students in order to comply with the stringent new diversity standards of the American Bar Association Council on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar .
As the federal government 's accrediting agency for law schools , the ABA Council determines whether a law school will be eligible for the federal student - loan program .
The law school that fails to satisfy its diversity requirements does so at its peril -- as a number of law school deans can amply attest .
Decades of law students have relied upon the good faith of law school officials to tell them what they needed to know .
For the 43 % of black law students who never became lawyers , maybe that reliance was misplaced .
MP : Although the article above focuses on the " academic mismatch " problem at law school , the same analysis applies to university programs in general .
The chart above ( click to enlarge ) shows data at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor for undergraduate students , except for the last column on graduation rates , which is national data .
The UM data ( pre-Proposal 2 ) are from the Center for Equal Opportunity and clearly illustrate the mismatch problem :
A black student with a 3.2 high school GPA and 1210 SAT score has a 92 % of admission to UM vs. only a 14 % for a white student .
However , 1 ) black students ( 45 % ) are almost 6 times as likely as white students ( 8 % ) to be on academic probation at UM , and 2 ) and almost 2/3 of black students ( 64 % ) fail to graduate nationally in 6 years , vs. 42 % for white students .
Bottom Line : Eliminating affirmative action in higher education will elminate the " academic mismatch " problem , and increase minority students ' GPAs and graduation rates .

affirmative action grading
" in the Detroit Free Press from last summer .

Given any monoid there are equations satisfied by its elements .
From the above example we have that x·y=y·x and also that x·e·x=x·x .
But notice how there is a big difference between these equations .
The former does n't hold in all monads , but the latter does .
A monoid is said to be free when the only equations that hold follow from equations that hold in every monoid .
You can think of a free monoid as being a generic monoid .
It has no special properties above and beyond being a monoid .
Given a set S , the free monoid generated by S is the smallest free monoid containing the set S and with no equations relating the elements of S. Write this monoid as FS .
For example , suppose S = {x , y} .
Then we know that e , x and y are all in FS .
We also know that x·x , x·y , y·x and y·y are all in S.
Importantly we know that all 4 of these elements are distinct because we know there can be no equations connecting them beyond those that define a monoid .
In fact , it 's not hard to see that the elements of FS are essentially just the ( possibly zero length ) strings of x's and y's .
Given a set S , consider its elements to be ' labels ' for unknown variables .
In fact , just use the elements of S as variables .
Then we can also consider the free monoid generated by S to be the set of " monoid expressions " in these unknowns .
By " monoid expression " we just mean functions of these variables that can be written using the language of monoids , ie .
the symbols e and · .
If S = {x , y} then examples of such expressions are e , x , y , x·y and so on .
I hope it's not hard to see that this is simply another description of the same thing as in the previous paragraph .
Another way to think of free monoids requires a tiny bit more algebra .
Define a monoid homomorphism from one monoid , M , to another , N , to be a function f: M→N on the underlying sets such that f( e ) =e and f( x·y ) =f( x ) ·f(y ) .
A bijective monoid homomorphism is called an isomorphism .
If there is an isomorphism between two monoids then in some sense they are the same monoid .
Note that e and · are being overloaded here - we have two different monoids and these symbols have different meanings in each one .
Now we can define the free monoid generated by S to be the monoid , M , such that ( 1 ) there is a function i: S→M ( 2 ) given any monoid N , and any function f: S→N , then f can be factored as f ' o i where f ' is a monoid homomorphism .
Very vaguely , the set S lives in the category of sets .
But FS lives in the category of monoids .
FS is the closest approximation to S in the category of monoids .
The previous property gives a sense of what this means : anything that can be said about a function from S to a monoid N can be said in the language of monoids using a homomorphism from FS to N .
Do n't worry if this is too vague as I wo n't be using it below - but it may click in some people 's minds .

There is a close association between algebraic structures and monads .
I 've mentioned this in passing before but I think it 's interesting to work out some details .
Among other things , it gives us a way of converting your favourite algebraic structures into domain specific languages embedded in Haskell .
First an aside .
Haskell monads are in some sense only an approximation to mathematical monads .
In fact , Haskell is only an approximation to mathematics .
It 's easy to define a Haskell function , say , such thatbut .
Once you do such a thing you can no longer reason about Haskell functions with the assumption thatrepresents equality in the mathematical sense .
( For an example , see Saizan 's comment here .)
So in the following I 'm going to assume that we 've limited ourselves to functions such thatimplies thatandimplyand so on .
I 'd love to see some way , in Haskell , to make explicit ' promises ' about the properties of functions .
( I guess that 's what they call programming by contract .)
But for the following we 'll just assume it holds .
The first abstract algebraic structure that people study is usually the group , but I 'm going to start with something simpler , the monoid .
A monoid is a set M ( called the underlying set of the monoid ) with a binary operator , ·: M×M→M and identity element e such that e·x = x·e = x and x ·( y·z ) = ( x·y ) ·z for all x , y , z in M .
By abuse of notation we 'll often use M for the name of the monoid as well as the underlying set .
Monoids are easy to come by and there are lots of examples .
Any time you have a sequence of operations that can be applied , or not , in any order , to some system , you have a monoid .
Sequences of operations form the underlying set of the monad and the binary operator means " do what 's on the right " followed by " do what 's on the left " .
For example the set of uniform scaling operations we can perform on a circle form a monoid .
Write a scaling by a factor of x as s(x ) .
If we double the size of a circle , and then triple it we have s( 2 ) followed by s( 3 ) , written s( 3 ) ·s ( 2 ) .
Note that we have s( m ) ·s ( n ) = s( mn ) and that s( 1 ) ·s ( m ) =s ( m ) ·s ( 1 ) =s ( m ) so s(1 ) plays the role of the identity , e .
Also note that for all m apart from 0 we have s( m ) ·s ( 1 / m ) =e so every scaling apart from s (0 ) has in inverse .
Note however that this monoid is special because for all x and y in it , x·y=y·x .
This does n't always hold in monoids and when it does hold our monoid is said to be commutative
If we have a type of algebraic structure then we can often form " free " versions of that structure .
For monoids we get free monoids .
There are many different ways of looking at " freeness " and I 'm going to go through some of them informally :
The important thing here is that the operator F , ie .
the " free monoid generated by " operator , forms a monad .
It 's tempting to think that monads got their name from monoids for this reason , but I do n't think it is because just about any " free X generated by " operator forms a monad .
Haskell monads give rise to DSLs via do - notation .
So this means that algebraic structures give rise to monads , which may give rise to Haskell monads , and hence DSLs .
So now to explain why F forms a monad .
Note that just about everything I say here works with other kinds of algebraic structures ranging from monoids through groups to vector spaces .
Consider our set S={x , y} above .
For convenience , let 's drop the · and write the binary operator as multiplication in the usual way .
Given an element of S we can easily get an element of FS .
In fact , we have an embedding i: S→FS with i( x ) = x .
This is an abuse of notation .
The element on the LHS is an element of S and the x on the RHS is a variable labeled with the symbol x , but we also write this as x because v , or something like that , would be a pain in the ass to keep writing .
Now think about the elements of F ( FS ) .
These are strings of elements of FS , ie .
strings of monoid expressions in x and y .
We could write a typical member as ( xyx ) ( e ) ( xxy ) where the xyx , e and xxy are each elements of FS and I 'm using parentheses to make clear which bits they are .
It 's tempting to say that this is simply xyxxxy , but that would be wrong .
The former is an element of F ( FS ) and the latter is an element of FS .
It would be clearer that these were n't equal if we used the v notation to write v.
But in this case the oscurity is to our advantage .
Even though ( xyx ) ( e ) ( xxy ) does n't equal xyxxxy , the notation strongly suggests that we define a function that maps the first to the second .
In fact , we can define a function m: F( FS ) →FS that essentially just erases parentheses .
So we have functions i:S→FS and m: F( FS ) →FS .
Looks suspiciously like a monad .
In fact , i and m satisfy the monad laws ( exercise ! ) and make F into a monad .
So what monad is this ?
It 's probably not hard to guess : elements of FS are finite strings of elements of S .
So it 's essentially the List monad .
Unfortunately , Haskell allows you to form infinite lists and so the correspondence is n't 100 % precise .
Nonetheless , it 's good enough that if you had n't already invented the List monad ( as in Haskell monad ) , you probably would if you had considered the free monoid monad ( as in mathematical monad ) .
i is just the embeddingand m is , which essentially just erases brackets .
So you can think ofhas the Haskell way to write the monoid element xyz .
In fact , if you repeat the above discussion with other algebraic structures that I and others have discussed you 'll get other familiar monads ( modulo details like being able to create infinite lists ) .
Here 's a table ( with apologies for bad formatting caused by blogger.com ) : ( Note that the above table is approximate in the sense that sometimes you may need to restrict to instances of Eq and tweak the code slightly to make the Haskell monad behave like the mathematical one . )
Notice the gap in the " group " row .
A group is a monoid in which every element has a left and right inverse .
The monad is the " free group generated by " monad and I 'll call it G .
It does n't correspond to any of the standard Haskell monads .
So firstly - if free monoids give lists , what does the underlying datatype for free groups look like ?
Go back to our set S = {x , y} .
GS contains e , x and y as well as all of the products of x and y that appear in FS .
But additionally GS contains the inverses of x and y , xand y .
And of course you need all strings of x , y and their inverses .
But do you need more ?
What about ( xy ) y ?
Well we can expand out the inverse using ( xy ) =y .
The net effect is that the free group contains precisely all ( possibly empty ) strings of x , y , xand y , where substrings like xxand xx are removed .
We can model this in Haskell using the following type :
We 're usingto represent x andto represent x .
We implementso that it uses the inverse of product formula above .
It also ought to cancel out terms like xxbut to do that requires that we restrict the monad to instances ofand if I do that I risk castigation from Saizan .
So I 'll leave out the cancellation to get the following Haskell monad :
But what purpose might this serve ?
Try these :
The first does something almost identical to what you might expect from the ordinary list monad .
But note the ordering in the second .
This is the Gray code monad !
By usingandwe can control the direction in which future combinatorial searches are carried out .
Admittedly not the most useful monad , but it 's curious that we do get something recognisable from this abstract nonsense .
And maybe you spotted the " beautiful " Haskell implementation of the power set function on reddit recently .
Here 's a cute twist on that :
The first gives a result similar to the original , but the second lists the subsets in such a way that each element differs from the previous one by one element .
I wonder what other algebarically motivated monads are waiting to be discovered .
And I hope to write something about deriving comonads from coalgebras , as soon as I 've read this .
It looks really intriguing .
Problem is , I 'm having trouble making sense of it .
And sorry , this is a bit incoherent today .
I only get a short period of time to write this stuff up and I blew most of mine this week in traffic jams .
As usual , if the text makes no sense , you can be sure the code above works as I just tested it .
But ask questions and complain about errors ...
The tropical semiring is the proper name for the ( R , min , + ) semiring I talked about earlier Update : Saizan 's doing a great job of keeping me honest .
He noticed that I 'd omitted a step .
I was originally finding the inverse of a free group element by simply reversing the elements in the product .
But I was failing to flip the polarities of each of the elements ( so to speak ) despite having spelled out in the text exactly what I needed to do .
The code is now fixed .

When air travel was commercialized , it was a typical affair for passengers getting on board ; no baggage screening or body searches .
However , this gradually changed to what has now become air travelers ’ biggest nightmare ; “ dressing to undress ” .
Nowadays , you have to take off your jacket , and all other lose clothing , not to mention , your belt , jewelry , shoes etc have to go off too .
Of course the gradual change is still in progress , and we can easily predict the future ; we might have to undress to go through the detectors .
Damn , its like airports are gonna turn into some sort of stripping joints , and the guy behind the screens is gonna be watching the show ;
And as if thats not enough , there is that masculine security guy in gloves waiting to get his hands all over you if the ‘ faulty ’ or ‘ functional ’ machine does what it does .
Well , its done for a reason , but it degrades the innocent traveler , making them feel unwelcome , mistreated , bullied and all that .
For Pete ’s sake ca n’t someone come up with a decent method of going about this ?
For now it seems that the air travelers are bound to the ‘ dress to undress ’ ritual at the airports , unless you ’ve got that extra paper to get you on a private jet .

Super - Close Google Maps Zooms
Holy moly that is a close up zoom of a camel ( see my screenshot above ) – and it works for other place on Google Maps too !
Yes , it turns out that you can zoom in much more deeply onto Google Maps by doing this :
Select a location and switch to satellite view Zoom in as far as you can , and click “ link to this page ” at the top right Now replace the “ z ” parameter in the URL with a higher value , e.g. 20 , 22 , or 23 , and wait .
Some locations will now show more detailed imagery
The French Ecrans website and Geotrotter have more on this .
What fun images can you find ?
Please post screenshots .
Playing water ping pong .
It seems he ’s looking into the camera , actually .
This is a rare zoom level 23 , almost ( already ? ) creating privacy issues people joked about earlier .
Nobody ’s in the Googleplex pool .
Relaxing at the beach .

Google is the world ’s favorite web search engine but there are a couple of cool things that you can do only in Yahoo !.
Take a look :
1 . Compose emails from the Yahoo ! search box .
Type ! mail abc@xyz.com in the Yahoo !
search box and it will automatically compose a new email message for you in Yahoo ! mail .
2. Get Lyrics of any song or your favorite artist .
Type madonna lyrics ( for lyrics of Madonna songs ) or madonna material girl lyrics ( for lyrics of a particular song )
3 . Specifiy the order of search keywords in queries
Say you want only web pages where word x comes before y but not vice versa , then just put the search query in Square Brackets .
An example :
[ Sylvester Stallone ] - will only return web pages where the word Sylvester appear before Stallone .
4. Search your favorite websites from Yahoo! itself .
For instance , type ! wiki google in Yahoo ! search box to search Google in Wikipedia.com .
Other popular shortcuts are ! ebay , ! amazon , and ! flickr .
You can also execute these from the Firefox search box without changing the default search engine .
5 . linkdomain - An undocumented Yahoo Web search operator .
A quick question - Can you find the number of articles on Wikipedia website that link to CNN.com ?
It ’s almost impossible to get this data from Google but you can do so quite easily in Yahoo ! with the incredibly useful linkdomain operator .
The answer is :
linkdomain:cnn.com site:wikipedia.org

Entire organs could be grown from stem cells
Heart surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub , who led the team , said doctors could be using artificially grown heart components in transplants within three years .
His researchers at Harefield hospital managed to grow tissue that works in the same way as human heart valves .
Sir Magdi told the Guardian newspaper a whole heart could be produced from stem cells within 10 years .
' Common pathway '
The team who spent 10 years working on the project included physicists , pharmacologists , clinicians and cellular scientists .
You can see the common pathway of death and suffering is heart failure
Sir Magdi Yacoub
Stem cells have the potential to turn into many different types of cell .
Many scientists believe it should be possible to harness the cells ' ability to grow into different tissues to repair damage and treat disease .
Previously , scientists have grown tendons , cartilages and bladders , which are all less complex .
Sir Magdi , professor of cardiac surgery at Imperial College London , had been working on ways to address a shortage of donated hearts for patients .
He said he hoped that soon an entire heart could be grown from stem cells .
He added : " It is an ambitious project but not impossible .
If you want me to guess I 'd say 10 years . "
His team extracted stem cells from bone marrow and cultivated them into heart valve cells .
After they were placed in scaffolds formed from collagen , 3 cm - wide discs of heart valve tissue were formed .
Later in the year , these will be implanted into animals such as sheep or pigs to see how well they fare .
Business Students Protest Bank of America
Closely observed by two Bank of America employees who drove up from Los Angeles , three protestors arrived at an ATM on the UCSB campus at about 10 a.m. on Friday , November 16 , plunked down a bag of charcoal , and festooned it with yellow caution tape which read “ Global Warming Crime Scene . ”
The three then spent the next four hours trying to educate fellow students as to Bank of America ’s role in financing coal mining operations and the construction of new coal - fired power plants , which emit significant amounts of the global warming culprit carbon dioxide .
BofA is the second largest investor in coal plants after Citibank , which has no branches or ATMs near UCSB .
Other protests took place across the nation on Friday , designated a National Day of Action by the Rainforest Action Network .
In San Francisco - Bank of America ’s birthplace - protestors released banner - bearing helium balloons inside Citibank and Bank of America branch offices , and they also shut - down ATMs , though the UCSB protestors chose not to go that route .
“ We did n’t want to make people angry , ” said Chrissy Elles , a third - year student active with the Campus Democrats , and the UCSB event ’s organizer .
In the course of four hours , the UCSB students gathered 75 signatures on a petition asking CEO Kenneth Lewis , at the Bank of America ’s Charlotte , North Carolina headquarters , to stop funding coal power and invest more in renewable energy sources .
Afterward , Elles and her co-conspirators approached the two bank officials and thanked them “ for letting us demonstrate , ” she said .
“ It was kind of rewarding that they were concerned enough to send someone up from L.A. ”
Elles expressed some disappointment but not much surprise at having persuaded only about 50 percent , by her estimate , of passing students to sign the petition .
“ We are kind of an apathetic bunch , ” she said , of her generation of college students .
“ But those who did sign were upset to learn that Bank of America invests so heavily in coal . ”
Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggarty said that the bank has had a number of dialogs with RAN about their concerns , and had worked with them on various “ green opportunities . ”
She added that 50 percent of America ’s electricity comes from coal .
“ We are challenged as a nation to develop and use more renewable energies , ” she said .
As for the bank itself , she added , “ We will [ continue to ] invest in coal and power companies , and we ’re working toward investments that will help these companies use cleaner and renewable sources of energy . ”
Haggerty noted the bank ’s commitment , announced in February , of $ 20 billion to assist borrowers of all kinds to reduce climate change through the use of green building and technologies .

Disco is software for burning disks that illustrates a new approach to interfaces :
It smokes while it burns .
If you blow into your computer 's microphone , the smoke blows across your desktop .
When Steve Jobs takes the stage Monday at Apple 's programmers conference , he 's likely to give the world a glimpse of an upgraded Mac operating system that could herald the biggest changes to the machine 's interface in 30 years .
At the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , Jobs will probably show off Leopard , a Mac OS X update due in October that he has promised contains " top secret " features .
But perhaps the most important feature is one that has been overlooked by many Apple fans : a new set of tools for building program interfaces called Core Animation .
( Editor 's note : See our Leopard preview story , " Apple to Show Off Leopard 's Claws at WWDC . " )
Core Animation will allow programmers to give their applications flashy , animated interfaces .
Some developers think Core Animation is so important , it will usher in the biggest changes to computer interfaces since the original Mac shipped three decades ago .
" The revolution coming with Core Animation is akin to the one that came from the original Mac in 1984 , " says Wil Shipley , developer of the personal media - cataloging application Delicious Library .
" We 're going to see a whole new world of user - interface metaphors with Core Animation . "
Shipley predicts that Core Animation will kick - start a new era of interface experimentation , and may lead to an entirely new visual language for designing desktop interfaces .
The traditional desktop may become a multilayered three - dimensional environment where windows flip around or zoom in and out .
Double - clicks and keystrokes could give way to mouse gestures and other forms of complex user input .
The Core Animation " revolution " is already starting to happen .
Apple 's iPhone at the end of the month will see people using their fingers to flip through media libraries , and pinching their fingers together to resize photos .
The " Delicious generation " is a breed of young developers who embrace interface experimentation and brash marketing .
The term " Delicious generation " was meant as an insult , but they wear it as a badge of honor .
Image : Adam BettsShipley 's initial release of Delicious Library , with its glossy , highly refined interface , gave birth to a new breed of developers dubbed the " Delicious generation . "
For these Mac developers , interface experimentation is one of the big appeals of programming .
Applications like AppZapper have taken traditional tasks ( deleting application files ) and added a fun layer of animation to the mix – this is n't your father 's rm command .
Disco is a disc - burning program that features smoke animation that reacts to sound – blow into the mike , and the smoke blows away .
But creating animations like those in AppZapper or Disco is presently a complex and difficult task .
Leopard 's Core Animation will change that , giving the next generation of developers a set of tools that will allow them to easily create new , nonstandard , interactive interfaces .
Some Mac developers are so excited by Core Animation they are going to drop support for previous versions of their software , which wo n’t display their new interfaces on older versions of OS X .
" Our customers are going to have to upgrade their OS if they want to upgrade our program , " Shipley says .
" We realized any app we released based on Tiger ( the current version of OS X ) was going to look really pathetic when Leopard came out . "
After getting a peek at Delicious Library 2 , which has n’t yet been shown publicly , Mac programmer Scott Stevenson wrote that the program is " going to be a major eye - opener for Mac developers .
This last point is important .
Whatever you thought was state - of - the - art in Tiger is going to be blown to bits with all of the new API ( application programming interface ) available in Leopard . "
Allan Odgaard , the developer of TextMate , says the next version of the text editor will only work on Leopard .
Because of Apple 's nondisclosure agreements , most of the Mac developers approached by Wired News declined to discuss Core Animation or any interface changes they might be planning .
None would provide screenshots .
The shift toward nonstandard interfaces is n't necessarily new .
Kai's Power Tools , a set of plug-ins for Adobe Systems '
Photoshop , featured what was at the time a revolutionary interface for editing image files .
But the developer , Kai Kruse , was too far ahead of his time – the majority of Mac users disliked the novel interface , which broke with conventions and ignored Apple 's Human Interface Guidelines , or HIG .
The HIG is a set of rules published by Apple to ensure consistency across different applications .
It 's become the bible of Mac programmers .
However , with the growing popularity of " widgets " – mini , task - specific applications for checking sports scores or finding cheap gas – users are starting to accept novel interfaces .
And they often expect the sort of highly graphical interaction that Apple 's new Core Animation enables .
With many developers already moving toward smaller , single - task applications , the addition of Core Animation tools may signal a revolution in Mac application design : lightweight , heavily animated , widgetlike applications are the future of the platform .
And while some longtime Mac developers have decried the Delicious generation of apps , Apple seems to be embracing the changes .
Apple has been ignoring its own HIG for some time in applications like QuickTime , and is abandoning them completely in upcoming Leopard applications like Time Machine .
Functionality - wise , Time Machine is a banal program – a content - version - control system that makes periodic , automated backups of a computer 's hard drive .
But Apple 's take on the age - old task of incremental backups features a 3 - D visual browser that allows users to move forward and backward through time using a virtual " time tunnel " reminiscent of a Doctor Who title sequence .
It 's completely unlike any interface currently used in Mac OS X .
Spaces , also new to Leopard , lets users manage several virtual workspaces and flip between them using a navigation system that 's pure eye candy .
Austin Sarner , an interface designer and engineer at software company madebysofa , says that the new style of Apple apps is n't just about glossy effects – there 's a usability payoff as well .
" Animation in general creates continuity and more direct feedback to a user experience .
In addition to obvious graphical speed boosts , the elegance ( that animation ) can add to a UI is pretty substantial , " he says .
Sarner points to the Apple TV as an example of how animation is making interface navigation more intuitive .
" Your selection glides into place , as opposed to immediately snapping to the next item .
Midway through the split - second animation , you can neatly cancel out and go in the other direction . "
Shipley predicts the new user - interface paradigm will also include the direct manipulation of documents – instead of fumbling for a scrollbar , users will be able to grab a document and " throw " it upward with their mouse in order to scroll through it .
Upcoming small - screen devices like the iPhone will force designers to further abandon traditional elements associated with the window metaphor , such as pull - down menus and scrollbars , in favor of more innovative designs emphasizing mouse gestures and click - and - drag actions .
Core Animation will only make it easier to translate these new ways of thinking onto the desktop .
Mac developer and Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser has no doubt that developers will embrace Core Animation .
" A fast , Apple - maintained way to do the kind of animations we now rely on heavily is a brilliant and well - welcome idea , " he says .
In order to run applications that utilize Core Animation , users will need to upgrade to Mac OS X version 10.5 , as the graphics engine will only be available in the new OS .
While it seems logical to speculate that interfaces like those of Time Machine and Spaces will lead to the end of the familiar " window " framework for desktop applications altogether , many Mac developers predict that the most basic elements of the current user interface forms wo n't disappear entirely .
Flying desktops and animated scrolling actions can enhance a user interface in many instances , but applications like browsing the web and writing an e-mail will still require a traditional environment .
" I really do n't think that the desktop will ever become ' windowless , ' " says Panic 's Sasser .
" Windows present a very familiar and natural way to work and multitask , and to radically change it might just mean desktop suicide . "
Even though we 're still tied to the traditional computer desktop , Shipley agrees that the limitations of what that desktop can do are eroding .
" I do n't think we 'll abandon the old way as much as supplement our armory with a whole new arsenal of tools , " Shipley says .
" It 's an awesome time to be a Mac developer , and , by extension , a Mac user . "

Lebanon Crisis
Veteran reporter Nicholas Blanford explains what is happening in Lebanon .
1. Fath al - Islam is a splinter guerrilla group established last December that has links to the international Salafi Jihadi movement ( which some call “ al - Qaeda ” as shorthand ) .
Its leader has ties to Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
It is tiny , with at most 300 fighters , and not all of them may be Palestinian .
It is opposed by all the major Palestinian political groups , including Hamas and the PLO .
It is , according to CNN , extremely well armed .
It appears to have an international network .
One of the Fath al - Islam guerrillas killed on Sunday had engaged in a terror attack on Germany .
It is a little unlikely that this group has any significant relationship to the secular Alawi Baath government of Syria , despite what the Lebanese politicians allege .
2 . The group , which robbed a bank and functions as a small local Mafia , has used the Nahr al - Bared Palestinian refugee camp ( pop. 30,000 ) in north Lebanon as a base .
There are thousands of Palestinian refugees in the camp , displaced there from their homes in Galilee by Zionist forces in 1948 .
Once Israel was formed , these refugees from the fighting were locked out of their former home by Israeli PM David Ben Gurion .
Because Lebanon has a Christian political elite , Beirut did not give the Palestinians citizenship , since they are 85 % Sunni and it would have upset the demographic balance of the country .
Also , the Palestinians of Lebanon generally insist that they will some day go home to Palestine ( Israel ) and fiercely reject “ tawtin ” or naturalization as “ Lebanese . ”
Their stateless condition has left the Palestinian population of Lebanon poverty - stricken and barred from certain occupations , including medicine !
If you think about it a little bit , you see the analogy between their condition and that of 19th century Jews in some parts of Europe , confined to ghettoes and forbidden from certain occupations .
A clickable map of the refugee camps in Lebanon with information about each can be found here .
For an anthropologist ’s exploration of the culture of the camps , see Julie Peteet ’s article in the Journal of the International Institute at the U of Michigan .
Here is her piece with some history of the situation .
See also Professor Peteet ’s recent book .
Also
3 . A 1969 accord prevents Lebanese military forces from going into the camps .
Anyway , hand to hand fighting in them would produce a high death toll .
Firing on a camp full of civilians by the Lebanese government is deeply troubling .
Note that the Tripoli Sunni Muslim townspeople appear , however , to approve of the attack on Fath al - Islam .
The camps are locally seen as nests of criminality and breeding grounds of terror .
4 . Although it is usually said that there are 400,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon , a country of 3.8 million , Palestinian demographer Khalil Shikaki has argued that there are actually only a couple hundred thousand left there .
Many have been given temporary visas of various sorts by Germany , Scandinavian countries , etc. , and have emigrated to a precarious perch in Europe , where they seldom have a permit to work and so remain in limbo ( the Palestinians have now become the symbol of vulnerable statelessness ; in the contemporary world , not having a state is the closest thing to slavery . )
Their statelessness makes the Palestinians in their camps open to exploitation by mafias and terrorists who thrive where states cannot operate with transparency .
The camps are thus analogous to the wilderness of Sinai or the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
Until there is a comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian refugee problem , this sort of trouble will go on in the Middle East .
And all that time , the Zionist Right will blame the Palestinians for being dispossessed .
He was speaking after holding talks by phone with US President George W Bush and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao .
Burmese officials said nine people were killed on Thursday as troops fired tear gas and bullets to disperse crowds of anti-government protesters in Rangoon .
Most internet links have been severed and mobile phone networks disrupted .
''I want to condemn absolutely the appalling level of violence against the people of Burma .
People seem to be determined to continue , despite the bullets , beatings and killings .
I hear right now that shooting is still going on near our office

" I am afraid that we believe the loss of life in Burma is far greater than is being reported so far , " Mr Brown said .
He said he hoped the combined international pressure from the US , China , the EU and UN would " begin to make the regime see this cannot continue " .
Both the British and Australian ambassadors in Burma said they believed the number of dead " could be many multiples " of the number given by state media .
International outrage
Meanwhile , the White House has confirmed that the UN special envoy , Ibrahim Gambari , will arrive in Burma on Saturday .
" We have called on the Burmese to allow him to be able to meet with anyone he wants to meet , the military leaders , the religious leaders and Aung San Suu Kyi , " spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
The BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says Burma 's rulers have turned their backs on the world and the torrent of outrage their actions have provoked .
The first opportunity to communicate that outrage will be when Mr Gambari arrives in the country to persuade the generals to put a stop to the crackdown .
The violent suppression of anti-government protesters continued for a third day on Friday , with soldiers and police baton - charging crowds who tried to stage marches .
The security presence in the main city was the heaviest yet seen .
Troops sealed off the key religious sites in Rangoon , including the Shwedagon and Sule pagodas - the focal point of some of the larger protests earlier in the week .
Police also surrounded five monasteries to prevent Buddhist monks - who have been spearheading the demonstrations - from taking to the streets .
All the main roads into central Rangoon have been blocked .
Internet severed
Information from Burma has become increasingly patchy .
Internet access has been cut in Rangoon and is only partially available elsewhere .

Burmese sources told the BBC that international mobile phone signals have been interrupted and soldiers are searching people for cameras and mobile phones .
Dissidents have been using the internet to get pictures and video of the protests and the military crackdown to international news outlets - who then fed them back into Burma via the internet and satellite TV .
But eyewitnesses managed to contact the BBC on Friday to say that the government was sending bus-loads of vigilantes into the main city to attack the demonstrators .
They said a temporary prison had been set up at an old race course for the hundreds , possibly thousands , of people detained in recent days .
The atmosphere is said to be extremely tense and there is a palpable sense of fear on the streets .
Warning shots
Correspondents say Rangoon looked like a city locked down on Friday morning but at about 1300 local time ( 0700 GMT ) small groups of protesters began gathering .
Some were immediately rounded up .
Within minutes , shots could be heard - but it was not clear if they were being fired into the crowds or overhead in warning .
A witness told the BBC that a number of people were killed in Friday 's violence .
Loudspeaker trucks have been criss - crossing the city , warning people not to protect anyone fleeing arrest .
An overnight curfew for the South Okkalapa district , the scene of Thursday 's violent encounters between soldiers and protesters , was also announced .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The idea that poverty breeds terror appears obvious ; how could it be otherwise ?
And people as different as the Archbishop of Canterbury , George Bush , Jacques Chirac and Pakistan 's leader , Pervez Musharraf , have also noted a link between poverty and terrorism .
In fact , there is now robust evidence that there is no such link .
That does not mean , however , that economics is irrelevant .
First , to the question of poverty .
Of the 50 poorest countries in the world ( see list at right ) only Afghanistan ( and perhaps Bangladesh and Yemen ) has much experience in terrorism , global or domestic .
But surely that is the wrong way to look at things .
Are n't the people who commit terrorist acts poor , even if they are from countries that are not ?
No .
Remember , most of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were middle - class sons of Saudi Arabia and many were well - educated .
And Osama bin Laden himself is from one of the richest families in the Middle East .
But it goes deeper than that .
In a 2003 study in the Journal of Economic Perspectives , Alan Krueger and Jitka Maleckova reported the results of a post - 9/11 survey of Palestinians .
Asked whether there were " any circumstances under which you would justify the use of terrorism to achieve political goals , " the higher - status respondents ( merchant , farmer or professional ) were more likely to agree ( 43.3 percent ) than those lower down the ladder ( laborer , craftsman or employee ) ( 34.6 percent ) .
The higher - status respondents were also more likely to support armed attacks against Israeli targets ( 86.7 percent to 80.8 percent ) .
The same dynamic existed when education was taken into account .
In another study , 129 Hezbollah militants who died in action ( not all of them in activities that could be considered terrorism ) were compared to the general Lebanese population .
The Hezbollah members were slightly less likely to be poor , and significantly more likely to have finished high school .
Outside Palestine , there is general agreement that suicide attacks on civilians is a form of terrorism .
So where do suicide bombers fit in ?
A study looked at the biographies of 285 suicide bombers as published in local journals , from 1987 - 2002 .
And this found that those who carried out suicide attacks were , on the whole , richer ( fewer than 15 percent under the poverty line , compared to almost 35 percent for the population as a whole ) and more educated ( 95 percent with high school or higher ) than the rest of the population ( almost half of whom went no further than middle school ) .
A similar survey of terrorists in the Jewish Underground , which killed 29 Palestinians in the early 1970s , found the same pattern .
A comprehensive study of 1,776 terrorist incidents ( 240 international , the rest domestic ) by Harvard professor Albert Abadie , who was sympathetic to the poverty - terrorism idea at first , found no such thing .
" When you look at the data , " he told the Harvard Gazette , " it 's not there . "
What he did find was more intriguing .
The freest countries experienced little terrorism ; and the same was true for the most oppressed .
It was in the middle - where politics was unsettled and evolving and governments are often weak - that suffered the most .
He also found that geography contributed to terrorist destiny .
Places like Afghanistan , with its austere mountains , or Colombia , with its remote jungles , might have been designed to sustain terrorism .
So , is there no economic dimension to terrorism ?
There may , be , but not in the way the conventional wisdom would have it .
Consider a chilling , but compelling recent paper by Efraim Benmelech of Harvard and Claude Berrebi of Rand .
The two ask , in effect , what makes someone become a suicide bomber ?
Their answer : " Since there are returns to human capital in both the productive and the terror sectors , high - ability individuals will become suicide bombers if the expected payoff from suicide bombing is higher than their skill - adjusted expected lifetime earnings in the productive sector . "
They test this proposition using a data base of 148 Palestinian suicide bombers from 2000 - 05 .
And they find that older and more educated suicide bombers are assigned to higher - profile targets , kill more people , and are less likely to fail or be caught .
In short , there is a match between human capital , in this grossly distorted sense , and the desired goal .
And as for the bombers themselves , these authors argue that the bombers have made , what is for them , a rational choice :
There is enough moral , psychological and sometimes financial payoff from the act of killing many people to offset the economic loss of their death .
Therefore , the terrorist manager assigns the most deadly tasks to the highest - caliber people ; otherwise , they will not bother .
In an awful way , it makes sense , and it seems to be true .
Caught and failed suicide bombers are conspicuously less educated than those who carry out their tasks .
The argument , with its " incentive - compatibility constraints " and various formulas , does not ( and is not intended to ) come to grips with a much more elemental question .
What creates and sustains the hate to make mass killing over living an arguably rational choice ?
That is a much tougher question .
But it probably gets closer to the point than vague analogies between poverty and terrorism .
There are many good reasons to worry about poverty , and to take action to alleviate it .
But ending terrorism is not one of them .
_______________________
First , let ’s clear the air here .
This is all about Don Imus .
The Republicans are livid that Imus , who they consider one of their own , lost his job after finally being called out for his ten - plus years of vile bigotry .
Imus would publicly excoriate George Bush , and we loved him for it , so it ’s hard to see why the GOP thinks Imus is one of theirs – he ’s not .
But the GOP does have a patent on the bigot thing , so it ’s understandable why they simply figured Imus would be a Republican .
Anyway , I have to laugh when FOX News and the rest of the far - right ( read : Baptists ) have the gall to attack anyone for being intolerant of other faiths .
The far - right of the Republican party has contempt for every faith in America other than Baptist .
They call Catholics a “ Satanic counterfeit , ” Reform Judaism is roundly criticized as being too liberal and thus not serious , Episcopalians and Methodists and Lutherans ( the tolerant ones ) are called fringe and irrelevant , and we know what they call Muslims ( remember , Mohammed was a pedophile , or that ’s what the religious right leaders said ) .
So now they ’re all upset that Al Sharpton mentioned that Mitt Romney was a Mormon .
This issue , Mitt Romney ’s Mormonism , came up on CNN this past weekend when I was on Howie Kurtz ’s show .
Howie asked me , in shock , how I could suggest that it was relevant to the presidential campaign to discuss Mitt Romney ’s Mormonism .
Well , if Mitt Romney can discuss my rights as a gay American in terms of how it jibes with his understanding of the Book of Mormon , then I think I have a right to inquire just what is this Book of Mormon that Mr. Romney wants to impose on me and my private life .
Same goes for any other candidate who embraces anyone who uses their faith to tell anyone else in America how to live .
But this is the way conservatives always act .
They always try to tell the rest of us how to live , and use their own religion ( or their own screwed up , usually bigoted , interpretation of what they think their religion says ) to justify their fatwahs .
They even go so far as to tell the rest of us that our religion is wrong and theirs is right .
On gay marriage , for example , several religions , like reform Judaism and some Episcopal churches , perform gay marriages , so how can Republicans and their religious right allies justify using the Bible to ban gay marriage when some religions support gay marriage ?
They ca n’t – they ’re simply trying to legislate THEIR religion over OURS .
And that makes their religion relevant to the public debate because THEY made it relevant .
Again , these are people who say that Catholics are n’t even Christians .
They ’re people who have the nerve to tell the world ’s one billion Muslims that they worship a pedophile .
These are people who tell us that we caused September 11 because God hates fags .
These are the intolerant “ religious ” freaks that Mitt Romney is embracing , and we do n’t have the right to inquire just what Mr. Romney embraces ?
They brought religion into the picture , not us .
And PS .
If Mitt Romney were a Scientologist would his religion still be irrelevant ?
( FYI , Romney did recently say his favorite novel was “ Battlefield Earth , ” which was written by the founder of Scientology , L. Ron Hubbard . )
Without sleep , the emotional centers of our brains dramatically overreact to bad experiences , research now reveals .
" When we 're sleep deprived , it 's really as if the brain is reverting to more primitive behavior , regressing in terms of the control humans normally have over their emotions , " researcher Matthew Walker , a neuroscientist at the University of California , Berkeley , told LiveScience .
Anyone who has ever gone without a good night 's sleep is aware that doing so can make a person emotionally irrational .
While past studies have revealed that sleep loss can impair the immune system and brain processes such as learning and memory , there has been surprisingly little research into why sleep deprivation affects emotions , Walker said .
Walker and his colleagues had 26 healthy volunteers either get normal sleep or get sleep deprived , making them stay awake for roughly 35 hours .
On the following day , the researchers scanned brain activity in volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) while they viewed 100 images .
These started off as emotionally neutral , such as photos of spoons or baskets , but they became increasingly negative in tone over time — for instance , pictures of attacking sharks or vipers .
" While we predicted that the emotional centers of the brain would overreact after sleep deprivation , we did n't predict they 'd overreact as much as they did , " Walker said .
" They became more than 60 percent more reactive to negative emotional stimuli .
That 's a whopping increase — the emotional parts of the brain just seem to run amok . "
The researchers pinpointed this hyperactive response to a shutdown of the prefrontal lobe , a brain region that normally keeps emotions under control .
This structure is relatively new in human evolution , " and so it may not yet have adapted ways to cope with certain biological extremes , " Walker speculated .
" Human beings are one of the few species that really deprive themselves of sleep .
It 's a real oddity in nature . "
In modern life , people often deprive themselves of sleep " almost on a daily basis , " Walker said .
" Alarm bells should be ringing about that behavior — no pun intended . "
Future research can focus on which components of sleep help restore emotional stability — " whether it 's dreaming REM sleep or slow - wave , non-dreaming forms of sleep , " Walker said .
Many psychiatric disorders , " particularly ones involving emotions , seem to be linked with abnormal sleep , " he added .
" Traditionally people mostly thought the psychiatric disorders were contributing to the sleep abnormalities , but of course it could be the other way around .
If we can find out which parts of sleep are most key to emotional stability , we already have a good range of drugs that can push and pull at these kinds of sleep and maybe help treat certain kinds of psychiatric conditions . "
The findings are detailed in the Oct. 23 issue of the journal Current Biology .

Top US general says he 's received plan for complete Iraq withdrawal David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 2 , 2007
Print This Email This MSNBC's Hardball reported Wednesday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates was recently " in Kuwait , scoping out what will at some point be a critical staging ground for a US exit plan from Iraq . "
According to correspondent Jim Miklaszewski , " Military officials in Kuwait suggest that they could easily handle the 160,000 troops in a matter of months .
But that would be extremely risky , because a hasty retreat would increase the troops ' vulnerability to attack .
And then there 's all that equipment  one million tons  that would have to be driven out of Iraq and shipped out of Kuwait by sea .
...
It could take two years for a complete withdrawal . "
" Tonight , a top US general here in Kuwait said , from a logistics standpoint , he 's already got the plan , and he 's ready to go , " concluded Miklaszewski .
" All he needs is the president 's orders . "
The unnamed general 's willingness to discuss withdrawal plans is in contrast with the attitude of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman , who recently made headlines when he cited fears of ' reinforc[ ing ] enemy propaganda ' in rejecting Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton 's request for a briefing on troop - withdrawal contingency plans .
Vice President Dick Cheney supported his former aide , saying that contingency plans " should remain unseen by lawmakers " until ready to be executed .
The following video is from MSNBC's Hardball , broadcast on August 1 .
Embattled exec fingers GOP Senator Ted Stevens ' son in bribery trial
Former VECO Corp. CEO
Bill Allen testified in the federal trial of former Alaska House Speaker Pete Kott Thursday that he bribed three lawmakers , including the son of GOP Senator Ted Stevens , the Washington Post reports .
Former state Senate president Ben Stevens , son of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens , was implicated along with Kott and state Rep. Vic Kohring .
Allen and former VECO vice president Rick Smith have already entered guilty pleas and are awaiting sentencing .
#
EXCERPTS :
" Mr. Stevens has consistently said he's not engaged in any of the illegal activity that is alleged by Mr. Allen .
He denies it , " John Wolfe , Stevens ' attorney , told The Associated Press .
The FBI also is investigating remodeling done to the elder Stevens ' home in Girdwood .
According to at least one contractor , invoices were first sent to VECO .
Ted Stevens has said he paid all bills on the home that he received .
[ Kott ] is accused of turning in a $ 7,993 invoice , purportedly for flooring work done on Allen 's home , when in fact the money was used to hire his son as his re-election campaign manager .

The fall of the Godmongers / Praise Jesus , it 's the collapse of evangelical Christian rule in America .
Rejoice !
Oh yes , by all means please take a moment to look around , ye who might be feeling a bit hopeful and optimistic right now .
Because indeed , you 've got your wonderful and ever - accelerating green movement , your lovely mixed - blessing organic food movement and your rejuvenated attention to solar power and sustainable buildings and organic cotton and fair - trade coffee and clean energy and CFLs and urban recycling and sleek gorgeous modern vibrator design to make hip women of the world swoon .
We 've got urban smoking bans and Smart cars and women finally rising to the most powerful positions in the land .
We 've even got an increasing awareness ( BushCo , the Middle East , and China gruesomely excepted ) of industrial pollution and global warming , all maybe indicating a subtle but still profound shift away from traditional modes of waste and war and our everlasting thirst for death and all possibly pointing to a happy delicious karmic sea change toward light and health and love for all beings everywhere for all time , as the butterflies and bunnies and birds all hum and smile and sing .
Mmm , utopian .
But wait , why stop there ?
While we 're wearing these swell rose - colored glasses of momentary progressive bliss , let us go one big step further .
Because right now , there is perhaps no greater item we as a struggling human ant farm can be grateful for , no single social emetic we can look to for inspiration or hope or a happy tingly sensation in our collective groinal region indicating a possible move away from our long - standing Dick - Cheney - in - hell attitude of shrill bleakness , alarmism and religious righteousness than the simply wonderful implosion of the evangelical Christian right that 's happening right now in America .
Do you know this clenched and panicky group ?
Of course you do .
They 're the throngs of megachurch lemmings Karl Rove masterfully manipulated and rallied and whored to Bush 's very narrow advantage in two elections .
They 're the ones who 've made all the headlines and influenced all sorts of laws and national policy changes lo , this past half - decade concerning everything from stem cell research to gay marriage to evolution , sanitized school textbooks to failed abstinence programs to RU - 486 restrictions to silly anti-science rhetoric , the ones who gasped in horror at a woman 's bare nipple and made a disgusting mockery of Terri Schiavo and actually applauded when John Ashcroft spent $ 8,000 of taxpayer money to throw some heavy drapery over the shamefully exposed breasts of the bronze ( female ) Spirit of Justice statue in the Hall of Justice .
And so on .
They are , in short , responsible for a great many of the most notable social and intellectual embarrassments in America since the new millennium took hold , and rest assured , we and the rest of the civilized world shall recall their bleak accomplishments for much of our natural born lives , and shudder .
Now then , your evidence of a new hope ?
Your reason for rejoicing ?
Right here :
It seems the remaining core of politicized evangelicals , far from realizing its diminished influence and far from realizing the GOP has largely imploded and far from sensing , therefore , that it might perhaps be time to dial down some of its more unpopular , virulent agenda items , this group is actually aiming to step up its dogmatic demands from various GOP candidates this next election .
That 's right .
They want more .
Or rather , less .
Apparently , Bush 's GOP has let them down .
They have not been content with BushCo's anti-abortion , anti-gay , anti-sex , pro-abstinence , anti-women , anti-science , pro-war , God -hates - Islam stance , nor have they been content with having their trembling hands around the throat of the preceding Republican Congress for half a decade and clearly they have been insufficiently humiliated by the happy slew of right - wing preachers and politicians who 've been revealed as meth - loving , restroom - lurking , boy - fetishizing gay hypocrites .
According to the new plan , any current GOP candidate who now wants the valuable evangelical vote will have to prove himself not merely guided by conformist religious zealotry in all things ( Hi , Mitt ! ) , but will have to prove his unflappable support for the GOP stance in key issues across the evangelical board , primarily regarding the Big Duo : abortion rights and gay rights .
Or , more specifically , the total annihilation of both .
Do you see ?
This is exactly why we can now rejoice .
Because this is the delightful thing about the fundamentalist worldview ( and , for that matter just about any strict religious worldview you can name ) , the thing that absolutely and forever guarantees its frequent and eventual downfall :
It can never be sated .
It 's true .
No matter how clamped down we as a culture become , no matter how much misinterpreted Biblical dogma we 're forced to swallow , no matter how many insidious laws are passed limiting behaviors and restricting independent thought and repressing sexuality and banning dildos in Texas , it will never be enough .
And why ?
Because the fundamentalist mind - set is not so much a firm and rational set of beliefs based on thoughtful interpretation of strict Biblical screed as it is , well , a paranoid wallowing in fear .
Fear of the Other , fear of change , of progress , of the new and different and young and the sexual and the truly spiritual .
And as we all know from almost seven years of Bush , fear knows no reason .
It knows no stability .
Fear is simply insatiable , voracious , and about as un-Godlike as Jesus with a machine gun .
But let 's not get carried away .
Make no mistake , tremendous damage has indeed been done .
After all , this last batch of hotly politicized evangelicals that just passed through our nation like a giant kidney stone enjoyed one hell of a run , and much of what they accomplished will be felt for years and decades to come .
The Supreme Court , by way of just one example , has now been so front - loaded with righteous misogynists , we 've already lost great hunks of women 's rights , environmental protections and many of the cornerstones of America 's moral foundation .
Truly , the evangelical movement is still a significant enough threat , at least regionally , in areas where its megachurches still wield tremendous power and where cultural conservatism has held sway for decades and where the laws are already so misogynistic and homophobic and backwards we might as well lump them all into one giant state and call it Alabama .
But then again , the cheerful upside is tough to resist .
Jerry Falwell is dead .
Pat Robertson is so politically dead he 's become nothing more than a sad punch line , a guy who makes the devil himself smile every time he opens his " gays- caused - 9/11 " mouth .
Then there 's the truly spectacular list of scandals and meltdowns and moral collapses that have befallen the " family values " party .
Indeed , while cultural conservatives have certainly won a few nasty battles ( and they 'll doubtlessly win a few more ) , they 're very much losing the war .
But when you come right down to it , the Great Truism has been validated once again : Righteous fundamentalism , be it Christian , Islamic , or otherwise , has the seeds of its own destruction built right into its very framework , a priori and de facto and by default .
Powered by the deeply joyless engines of fear and shame , it can never quench its own impotent desires .
And for that , we can all praise Jesus indeed .

NY Times : Severe interrogation techniques are ' hidden legacy ' of Gonzales tenure at Justice David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday October 4 , 2007

Print This Email This ( Updated : White House denies New York Times report )
A secret opinion issued by the Department of Justice in 2005 authorized a vast expansion of interrogation techniques available to the CIA , including painful remedies incorporating simulated drowning , " head - slapping " and exposure to frigid temperatures .
According to the New York Times , the legal memorandum was issued soon after the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General , and permitted the " combined effects " of an array of harsh measures to gather intelligence .
White House press secretary Dana Perino , however , denied that report today .
" This country does not torture , " she told reporters , according to the Associated Press .
" It is a policy of the United States that we do not torture and we do not . "
" Asked about the story Thursday , Perino confirmed existence of the Feb. 5 , 2005 , classified opinion but would not comment on whether it authorized specific practices , such as head - slapping and simulated drowning , " AP continued .
" She said the 2005 opinion did not reinterpret the law . "
Perino insisted the 2005 memo was not inconsistent with a 2004 opinion from the Justice Department declaring torture " abhorrent . "
" We know that these are ruthless individuals who will do anything , and that they 're very patient ; that they 'll do anything to try to carry out their attacks , " Perino said .
" And this president has put in place -- all within the foursquare corners of the law -- tools in the global war on terror that we need . "
Sources also told the Times that later in 2005 , with Congress poised to pass a a so - called " torture ban " prohibiting " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment of detainees , the Justice Department quietly issued a second opinion that " declared that none of the CIA interrogation methods violated that standard . "
Perino , who admitted she had n't personally seen the classified opinions , was asked how , in that case , she could " say with assurance that we do n't torture . "
" Because we follow the law , " Perino responded .
The New York Times interviewed " more than two dozen current and former officials involved in counterterrorism , " most of whom the paper says would only speak anonymously .
Steven Bradbury , however , the head of the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel who signed off on the opinions in question , went on the record defending his office 's work , and emphasized the Department 's independence from the Bush administration .
" In my experience , the White House has not told me how an opinion should come out ,  he told the paper .
" The White House has accepted and respected our opinions , even when they didnt like the advice being given . 
Although a 2006 Supreme Court ruling found that Al Qaeda detainees must be afforded rights under the Geneva conventions , President Bush this July signed an executive order allowing for " enhanced " interrogation procedures , and officials tell the Times that " the CIA again is holding prisoners in ' black sites ' overseas . "
" The Bush administration had entered uncharted legal territory beginning in 2002 , holding prisoners outside the scrutiny of the International Red Cross and subjecting them to harrowing pressure tactics , " the story continues , and quotes former CIA deputy legal counsel Paul Kelbaugh as saying that even interrogators themselves questioned the legality of the techniques they were employing .
 We were getting asked about combinations --  Can we do this and this at the same time ? " he said .
 These approved techniques , say , withholding food , and 50 - degree temperature -- can they be combined ...
Do I have to do the less extreme before the more extreme ? " he recalls being asked .
Sources also disclosed to the Times that when Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured that " a variety of tough interrogation tactics were used about 100 times over two weeks on Mr. Mohammed . "
" Agency officials then ordered a halt , " intelligence officials said , " fearing the combined assault might have amounted to illegal torture . "
When a new head of the Office of Legal Counsel , Jack Goldsmith , arrived in 2003 -- replacing former chief John Yoo , who sources said was privately referred to by former Attorney General John Ashcroft as " Dr. Yes " for his easy compliance with White House wishes -- the Bush administration began to encounter resistance .
" Mr. Goldsmith infuriated White House officials , " according to the New York Times , " first by rejecting part of the National Security Agencys surveillance program , prompting the threat of mass resignations by top Justice Department officials , including Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Comey , and a showdown at the attorney generals hospital bedside . "
" If President Bush wanted to make sure the Justice Department did not rebel again , Mr. Gonzales was the ideal choice , " the paper said of the Attorney General to be .
Goldsmith 's successor , Bradbury , would go on to authorize the classified opinions , which the Times called " a hidden legacy of President Bushs second term and Mr. Gonzaless tenure at the Justice Department . "

Most of the cells in your body are not your own , nor are they even human .
They are bacterial .
From the invisible strands of fungi waiting to sprout between our toes , to the kilogram of bacterial matter in our guts , we are best viewed as walking " superorganisms , " highly complex conglomerations of human cells , bacteria , fungi and viruses .
That 's the view of scientists at Imperial College London who published a paper in Nature Biotechnology Oct. 6 describing how these microbes interact with the body .
Understanding the workings of the superorganism , they say , is crucial to the development of personalized medicine and health care in the future because individuals can have very different responses to drugs , depending on their microbial fauna .
The scientists concentrated on bacteria .
More than 500 different species of bacteria exist in our bodies , making up more than 100 trillion cells .
Because our bodies are made of only some several trillion human cells , we are somewhat outnumbered by the aliens .
It follows that most of the genes in our bodies are from bacteria , too .
Luckily for us , the bacteria are on the whole commensal , sharing our food but doing no real harm .
( The word derives from the Latin meaning to share a table for dinner . )
In fact , they are often beneficial : Our commensal bacteria protect us from potentially dangerous infections .
They do this through close interaction with our immune systems .
" We have known for some time that many diseases are influenced by a variety of factors , including both genetics and environment , but the concept of this superorganism could have a huge impact on our understanding of disease processes , " said Jeremy Nicholson , a professor of biological chemistry at Imperial College and leader of the study .
He believes the approach could apply to research on insulin- resistance , heart disease , some cancers and perhaps even some neurological diseases .
Following the sequencing of the human genome , scientists quickly saw that the next step would be to show how human genes interact with environmental factors to influence the risk of developing disease , the aging process and drug action .
But because environmental factors include the gene products of trillions of bacteria in the gut , they get very complex indeed .
The information in the human genome itself , 3 billion base pairs long , does not help reduce the complexity .
" The human genome provides only scant information .
The discovery of how microbes in the gut can influence the body 's responses to disease means that we now need more research into this area , " said Nicholson .
" Understanding these interactions will extend human biology and medicine well beyond the human genome and help elucidate novel types of gene - environment interactions , with this knowledge ultimately leading to new approaches to the treatment of disease . "
Nicholson 's colleague , professor Ian Wilson from Astra Zeneca , believes the " human super - organism " concept " could have a huge impact on how we develop drugs , as individuals can have very different responses to drug metabolism and toxicity . "
" The microbes can influence things such as the pH levels in the gut and the immune response , all of which can have effects on the effectiveness of drugs , " Wilson said .
The Imperial College research demonstrates what many – from X Files stalwarts to UFO fanatics – have long claimed :
We are not alone .
Specifically , the human genome does not carry enough information on its own to determine key elements of our own biology .
A recent statistical analysis strengthens evidence that human activities are causing world temperatures to rise .
Most climate change scientists model Earth systems from the ground up , attempting to account for all climate driving forces .
Unfortunately , small changes in the models can lead to a broad range of outcomes , inviting debate over the actual causes of climate change .
Physicist Pablo F. Verdes of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences in Germany has found a way to avoid the subjective flaws of climate models by applying sophisticated analysis techniques to data from the past hundred and fifty years .
The approach mathematically stitches together known facts about the global climate into a more objective and coherent picture .
Verdes , now at Novartis Pharma , examined data on temperature anomalies , the strength of the radiation emitted from the Sun , and volcanic activity .
The relatively recent increases in solar radiation , combined with reduced volcanic activity , contribute to the increase in world temperatures .
However , Verdes ' analysis demonstrates that these natural causes do not completely explain the observed warming .
Verdes calculated the amount of non-natural influence required to match the increases in temperature observed in the last 150 years .
He plotted the influence over time .
Then , he compared it to the evolution of greenhouse gasses , taking into account the cooling due to aerosols .
With allowances for error , he found that influences attributable to greenhouse gasses mirror the graph of non-natural influence needed to explain the observed temperature increase of recent decades .
His research shows that , if you look at global warming as a puzzle , and you put together the natural factors such as increased solar radiation and reduced volcanic activity , a hole remains .
The human factors of greenhouse gas and aerosol emission complete the picture .

Propeller designs have been closely guarded secrets since the days of the Cold War .
It is still common for them to be draped with tarps or removed and covered when a submarine is out of the water .
The propeller design is an integral part of a submarine 's ability to remain undetected during operations , ensuring that it can patrol the seas in stealth without giving its position away to surface ships .
The find has triggered a debate over whether online mapping services offered by the likes of Google and Microsoft should be allowed to snap and publish images of sensitive US military installations .
Reporting the discovery , the Navy Times newspaper quoted military analyst Nathan Hughes as saying that exposing the propeller was a major blunder that had compromised " sensitive naval technology " .
The paper quotes a Pentagon public affairs officer as saying that the Defence Department does not have a policy - or the legal authority - to demand the removal or blurring of commerical aerial or satellite photography .
The discovery was made by Dan Twohig , a deck officer on a ferry service in Washington State .
He made the discovery in early July when he was looking at real estate near Seattle using Virtual Earth , a mapping service similar to Google Maps and Earth .
Twohig lives in North Bend in Washington State .
Situated about 50 km east of Seattle , it was the setting for David Lynch 's landmark TV series Twin Peaks in the early 1990s .
Twohig was looking for a place closer to his work .
He subsequently posted the find on his blog , MonsterMaritime , and the story found its way into mainstream media late last month .
" You can also use the zoom in and out keys and move around the Bangor Sub Base taking a close up look at the bunkers and magazines where they keep the nuclear weapons , " he wrote in his blog .
" You would think the US government would keep better tabs on this stuff . "
Twohig 's discovery was made around about the same time that Hans Kristensen , a nuclear weapons analyst for the Federation of American Scientists , spotted an aerial image of China 's new Jin-class nuclear - powered submarine on Google Earth .
The Chinese sub , which is capable of firing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the US mainland , was snapped at the Xiaopingdao Submarine Base south of the city of Dalian - a facility named in honour of the late paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who died 10 years ago .
An article written by Paul Forsythe Johnston , Curator of Maritime History at the National Museum of American History , and posted on the museum 's website , explains the significance of submarine propeller design and the " tip vortex flowfields " the propeller creates .
" Once [ the propellers ] reach a certain speed , the blades begin to create a partial vacuum , which results in air bubbles , " he writes .
" This is a state known as cavitation .
Bubbles are noisy , and submarine propellers are designed and shaped to reduce cavitation and exploit other relevant laws of physics as much as possible and still maintain useful speeds . "

China is the leading exporter of seafood to the U.S. and in late June , the FDA finally issued an import alert and banned five species of seafood .
China lacks any effective food standards , and most of its seafood species are raised in raw sewage that is treated with drugs and chemicals , many banned by the FDA .
China tops the list of food imports being refused , but more needs to be done .
In 2006 , only 0.88 % of China 's seafood coming into the U.S. was inspected .
Some toothpaste from China has now been found to contain diethylene glycol , an industrial solvent used in paint and antifreeze .
Just a couple of months ago thousands of pets died from contaminated pet food from China .
In addition , many American and Canadian companies are using Chinese ingredients in their products , which could pose a health risk .
There is currently no safety standards between the U.S. and China on food and drugs , as well as other imports .
To put this crisis in better perspective , nearly a fifth of China 's own food and consumer products were found to be substandard or tainted .
This should serve as a wake - up call to the FDA as their current mechanisms in place are not effective and reliable enough to properly test and track foods being imported .
Instead of preventing , the FDA is only reacting to this ever growing crisis .
Yeah , I know the headline is Huckabee 's near - victory in the Christianist straw - poll .
It 's also pretty amazing how poorly Giuliani did .
But it 's staggering to me that Ron Paul did so well :
1. Mitt Romney ... 27.62 %
2. Mike Huckabee ... 27.10 %
3. Ron Paul ... 14.98 %
4. Fred Thompson ... 9.77 %
5. Sam Brownback ... 5.14 %
6. Duncan Hunter ... 2.42 %
7. Tom Tancredo ... 2.30 %
8. Rudy Giuliani ... 1.85 %
9. John McCain ... 1.40 %
I 'd say that these results show that the Christianists are far less concerned about the war on terror than the culture war .
If Thompson can't beat Huckabee , the entire point of his candidacy is moot .
You need a Southern Christianist ?
You 've already got one , guys .
Oh , and :
They really hate McCain , do n't they ?

PELOSI , FEINSTEIN BETRAYING DEMS
By Bill Gallagher
DETROIT -- The " San Francisco Democrats " are the handmaidens for President George W. Bush : feckless , short - sighted and cynical .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , both wealthy San Franciscans , are leading voices in the congressional chorus that chooses convenience over principle and perceived political advantage over certain political truth .
Pelosi wants no talk of impeachment for Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and other war criminals .
She has done nothing to block funding for the war in Iraq , the only way to end the occupation , save Iraqi and American lives and let the Iraqi people determine their own destiny .
Feinstein made sure we now have as our nation 's chief law enforcement officer a man who refuses to condemn drowning torture and believes the president has unlimited authority and need not respect the laws of the land .
The late Jeane Kirkpatrick -- once a faux Democrat and belligerent bully who went on to be Ronald Reagan 's ambassador to the United Nations -- first coined the " San Francisco Democrat " appellation in 1984 .
That year the Democrats held their convention in San Francisco and nominated former vice president Walter Mondale for president .
Kirkpatrick gave the keynote address at the GOP convention in Dallas .
The scorching heat outside rivaled the oppressive rhetoric inside the Reunion Arena , a miserable event I had to endure .
That was the year the Republican Party re-coronated Ronald Reagan and plunged deeper into the abyss of intolerance .
Rev. Jerry Falwell rode a bull at a barbecue as the party faithful bowed to him and Christian fundamentalism became the Republican state religion .
Young George W. Bush was there for his daddy 's renomination for vice president , spending most of his time in Dallas bars sucking up Jack Daniels and acting like a first - class flippant jerk .
Billy Graham and Jesus may have helped wean Dubya from the hooch , but otherwise little in him has changed .
Kirkpatrick , the godmother of the neoconservative movement , blasted the San Francisco Democrats for being weak in opposing the Soviet Union and claimed " they always blame America first . "
The combative Kirkpatrick was also slurring San Francisco 's large gay population , to the delight of Falwell and the frothy - mouthed haters then seizing the Republican Party .
Kirkpatrick went on to support selling arms to Iran and using the proceeds to illegally fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua .
She embraced the right - wing dictatorship in El Salvador that slaughtered tens of thousands , including Archbishop Oscar Romero .
Kirkpatrick argued it was in America 's interests to support " authoritarian " dictatorships in Argentina , Chile and South Africa .
She saw the U.S. invasion of Grenada as a great triumph .
In the Middle East , Kirkpatrick endorsed anything the Israelis wanted to do and advocated the disastrous deployment of U.S. Marines to Lebanon .
Her crowning glory was providing weapons and support for a band of insurgents in Afghanistan , especially a rich young man named Osama bin Laden and the band of brothers he called al - Qaeda .
That 's one hell of a foreign policy resume , but as we 'll see , Jujitsu Jeane finally saw the light and learned -- unlike her neocon progeny -- that America the omnipotent can fail and foster violence .
As wrong as Kirkpatrick was , she was forthright and bold -- traits not found in our new San Francisco Democrats .
Pelosi and Feinstein see themselves as finesse politicians , tip - toeing through the crunch issues , thinking they are so clever as Bush tramples on their flowerbed of phoniness nourished by the manure of Democratic consultants .
From the time she took over as House speaker , Pelosi has insisted impeachment would not be on the table .
Even as evidence of wholesale criminality and assaults on the Constitution grew , Pelosi would n't hear any talk about doing what is required to hold the crooks accountable .
But Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , a presidential hopeful , had the guts to buck the Democratic leadership and pressed to get his bill to impeach Cheney to the floor .
Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny " The Hack " Hoyer , D - Md. , were furious .
Kucinich forced a vote of the full House , as Pelosi and Hoyer thought they could have the resolution quickly tabled and buried .
But their gutless move failed when Republicans , intent on embarrassing the shameless Democratic leadership , joined Kucinich and his supporters in opposing the tabling motion .
Caught flat - footed , the hapless Pelosi then got enough support to send the impeachment resolution to the House Judiciary Committee .
She hopes her ridiculous " impeachment is off the table " stance will prevail , but numbskull Nancy may get another surprise , and committee chair Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , may yet hold hearings on Cheney 's serial crimes and impeachable offenses .
Pelosi demonstrably is out of stride with the American people , and especially Democrats , in protecting the Busheviks from the heat of the impeachments they richly deserve .
The latest USA Today / Gallup survey shows Bush 's approval rating is 31 percent , with 50 percent saying they " strongly disapprove " of the president , an all - time high .
Bush has finally unseated Richard Nixon as the most unpopular president in the history of the poll .
Even though Bush 's crimes are far more serious and have done more harm than Nixon's , Pelosi insists on sparing him from the constitutionally prescribed remedy .
Politics be damned !
More importantly , it is a matter of justice and principle .
Bush and Cheney deserve the stain of impeachment as a message to their successors that such egregious behavior and disregard for the Constitution , treaties and statutes will not be tolerated .
To do otherwise -- as Pelosi wants -- sends the opposite message .
Over in the Senate , the other San Francisco Democrat , Dianne Feinstein , feigned noble purpose as she wallowed in depravity , helping to grease the skids for Michael Mukasey to win confirmation as attorney general .
Feinstein joined with her pal on the Senate Judiciary Committee , the loathsome grandstander Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , as the only two Democrats on the panel to recommend Mukasey to the full Senate , thus assuring his confirmation .
Schumer helped orchestrate Mukasey 's nomination , and even when this " distinguished jurist " refused to condemn water - boarding as the torture it clearly is , Schumer was going to stick with him because he made his deal with the devil -- Bush .
Feinstein then proceeded to give some cover for Schumer so he would n't have to stand alone .
During the Senate debate last Thursday night , Feinstein made one of the most nauseating , illogical and unprincipled speeches I have ever heard .
" Judge Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales , " Feinstein assured us .
Oh , I get it .
Mukasey is not a smiling , lying son of a bitch , and so we should embrace him because he is not the most corrupt attorney general we have ever had .
And if you do n't buy that crap , try this from Feinstein 's book of low expectations :
We could do worse .
" I believe Judge Mukasey is the best nominee we are going to get from this administration , " Feinstein argued , " and that voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments , allowing the White House to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and to diminish effective oversight by Congress . "
Mukasey refuses to condemn water - boarding , because he knows that would leave Bush , Cheney and their henchmen wide open to civil suits and criminal prosecutions .
He chose to protect the torturers and patrons , and Feinstein and Schumer made that possible .
Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wisc. , a man who understands principle and decency , voted against Mukasey on the Judiciary Committee and with the full Senate .
He sees Mukasey as an enabler of those who threaten the rule of law .
" Democrats can no longer be part of the savaging of the U.S. Constitution . "
Feingold told a crowd in Madison before the vote on the nominee .
The Senate 's most ardent defender of basic liberties would not compromise and demanded an attorney general who " must be able to stand up to a chief executive who thinks he is above the law . "
Feingold wanted an attorney general " who will tell the president that he cannot ignore laws passed by Congress .
Unfortunately , Judge Mukasey was unwilling to reject the extreme and dangerous theories of executive power that this administration has put forward . "
Do n't expect such admirable standards from the San Francisco Democrats .
They 're too busy dancing , dodging , waffling and triangulating to get bogged down with principled positions .
The party leaders are lagging far behind the people , especially on the war in Iraq .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research poll , a record 68 percent of Americans now oppose the war .
Already 2007 is the deadliest year for U.S. troops since the war began , with at least 852 American military personnel killed .
But , stubbornly trying to avoid the slur of " not supporting the troops , " the San Francisco Democrats keep funding the futile war .
Even Jeane Kirkpatrick , who initially supported the war , came to her senses in her dying days .
In her last book -- " Making War to Keep Peace , " published after her death -- Kirkpatrick recognized what was happening : " Unfortunately , what we face in Iraq today is a vacuum of power , a lack of stable institutions needed to govern and the problem that the promise of democracy for which our nation stands may be lost in the essential scramble for safety and stability in the streets . "
Kirkpatrick slammed the Bush war - planners who " did not seem to have methodically completed the due diligence required for reasoned policy - making because they failed to address the aftermath of the invasion . "
This new generation of San Francisco Democrats could learn from Kirkpatrick 's crisp candor .
Wake up , shrug off careful calculations and stand for something .
More Gulf War Veterans have died than Vietnam Veterans :
The Department of Veterans Affairs , May 2007 , Gulf War Veterans Information System reports the following :
Total U.S. Military Gulf War Deaths : 73,846
– Deaths amongst Deployed : 17,847
– Deaths amongst Non-Deployed : 55,999
Total “ Undiagnosed Illness ” ( UDX ) claims : 14,874
Total number of disability claims filed : 1,620,906
- Disability Claims amongst Deployed : 407,911
- Disability Claims amongst Non-Deployed : 1,212,995
Percentage of combat troops that filed Disability Claims 36 %

NOTE : Soldiers , by nature , typically do n’t complain .
In other words , the real impact of those who are disabled from the US invasions in Iraq , Afghanistan and other Nations , is not fully reflected in the official Veterans Affairs numbers .
When soldiers are sent to murder women and children they tend to never be able to live normal lives there after .
How come the government numbers of 3,777 as of 9/7/7 are so low ?
The answer is simple , the government does not want the 73,000 dead to be compared to the 55,000 U.S. soldiers killed in Vietnam Iraq = Vietnam .
What the government is doing is only counting the soldiers that die in action before they can get them into a helicopter or ambulance .
Any soldier who is shot but they get into a helicopter before he dies is not counted .
73,000 dead amongst the U.S. soldiers for this scale operation using weapons of mass destruction is not high - we expect the great majority of U.S. soldiers who took part in the invasion of Iraq to die of uranium poisoning , which can take decades to kill .
From a victors perspective , above any major war in history , The Gulf War has taken the severest toll on soldiers .
More than 1,820 tons of radio active nuclear waste uranium were exploded into Iraq alone in the form of armor piercing rounds and bunker busters , representing the worlds worst man made ecological disaster ever .
64 kg of uranium were used in the Hiroshima bomb .
The U.S. Iraq Nuclear Holocaust represents far more than fourteen thousand Hiroshima’s .
The nuclear waste the U.S. has exploded into the Middle East will continue killing for billions of years and can wipe out more than a third of life on earth .
Gulf War Veterans who have ingested the uranium will continue to die off over a number of years .
So far more than one million people have been slaughtered in the illegal invasion of Iraqi by the U.S. Birth defects are up 600 % in Iraq – the same will apply to U.S. Veterans .
Statistics and evidence published by the government and mainstream media in no way reflect the extreme gravity of the situation .
Those working for the government and media must wake up and take responsibility for immediately reversing this U.S. Holocaust .
Understanding who is manipulating all of us is critical for all of us .
We all know the story .
Ted Haggard had it all .
He was the pastor of the New Life megachurch in Colorado Springs , CO , the Christian fundamentalist ’s Mecca , and president of the politically influential National Council of Evangelicals .
In the latter capacity , he participated in weekly phone conferences with White House staff .
It all came crashing down last November amidst allegations that ol ’
Teddy had been getting tuned up on methamphetamine and boinking a male hooker for the preceding three years .
Four evangelical preachers were appointed to oversee Ted ’s spiritual rehabilitation .
After several weeks of intensive counseling , Haggard came to the conclusion in February 2007 that “ he is completely heterosexual . ”
Thank goodness for that !
We ’re not entirely sure why he shoved his dick up that dude ’s ass , but it most definitely did NOT have anything to do with gayness .
Today ’s Rocky Mountain
News reports that Haggard and his family are now living at the Phoenix Dream Center , a halfway house for recovering drug addicts , hookers , ex-cons , etc. affiliated with an Assemblies of God church in Phoenix , AZ .
Ted says the pastor asked him to “ counsel ” male residents of the halfway house and teach a “ group ” every now and then .
Ted also sent this email to a reporter for KRDO - TV , the ABC affiliate in Colorado Springs .
Haggard advised that he and his wife , Gayle , are back in school .
Gayle is after an undergrad degree in psychology and Ted is pursuing an MS in counseling .
Ted ’s email is bereft of mention that : ( 1 ) New Life Church paid him $ 138,000 when he resigned last November ; and ( 2 ) he and his wife still own real property in Colorado Springs valued at $ 715,000 .
But never mind that shit .
The point is that Ted and his wife are full - time students and wo n’t be able to support themselves for the next couple of years , so they need help from the faithful .
Haggard informed the KRDO reporter that folks who want to give him money can sent it to a private mail service address in Scottsdale .
Ever the thoughtful Christian , Ted considered that some of the brethren might be seeking a way to make their donations tax deductible .
For them Haggard suggested making donations to the Colorado Springs post office box of an outfit called Families with a Mission .
All one need do , Ted says , is specify that the donation is for the Haggards .
Families with a Mission will send ninety percent of the donated money to Ted and Gayle , keeping ten percent to cover administrative expenses .
Trouble is , Families with a Mission is operated by a twice - convicted sex offender named Paul Gerard Huberty .
Mike Ware , pastor of the evangelical Victory Church in Westminster , CO and head of the four - preacher crew charged with Haggard ’s restoration , is more than a little miffed over Teddy Boy using a sexual predator ’s organization to raise funds .
Ware is on his way to Arizona tomorrow to get a face - to - face explanation from Haggard .
You ’re a bad , bad , completely heterosexual bitch , Ted .
Prepare for your spanking .
Lisa Moscatiello of md8 impeach sent the following message : “ Van Hollen actually met with us for an hour , going over the time after which he had said he was scheduled to rush off to a meeting with the Speaker .
I hope he told her why he was late ! ”
So do we Lisa ! ]
A town hall meeting on Capitol Hill
Maryland Congressional District 8 for Impeaching Bush and Cheney
On the morning of Thursday , September 20 , over two dozen impeachment supporters from Takoma Park , Garrett Park , and elsewhere in Maryland ’s 8th Congressional District crowded into a meeting room in Longworth House Office Building for a wide ranging discussion with Rep. Chris Van Hollen .
State Senator and constitutional expert Jamie Raskin and Takoma Park Mayor Kathy Porter were among the delegates , who also included Lisa Moscatiello , Thomas Nephew , and Hank Prensky from Takoma Park , Warren Kornberg and Jim Agenbroad from Garrett Park , and Alan McConnell from Silver Spring , to name but a few .
Rep . Van Hollen was presented with a folder containing the Takoma Park City Council impeachment resolution , a list of signatories for the Garrett Park referendum , the agenda and attendance list for the meeting , prepared statements by several of the delegates , books on impeachment by Elizabeth Holtzman and John Conyers and his Judiciary Committee staff — and , in a small gesture he appreciated , a small box of “ Impeachmints ”  candy bought at “ Now and Then . ” 
What came next was basically a town hall meeting on Capitol Hill .
In prepared statements by Lisa Moscatiello and others , as well as in frank give and take , we told Rep. Van Hollen that impeachment must be tried and can succeed .
While we regret he does n’t agree with us ( yet ! ) we ’re encouraged by the fact that he really listened to us at length — the meeting was scheduled to last just half an hour , but went to nearly twice as long — and that he promised continued dialogue with us about this issue .
Van Hollen said he agreed on the merits of the issues Lisa and others raised such as torture , warrantless wiretapping , and indefinite detentions , but felt that between the courts and congressional oversight , these issues were being addressed .
He did n’t agree that Congress had been “ silenced , ”  and argued that a failed , “ botched ”  impeachment attempt would be worse than none at all .
He thinks that impeachment might not get a majority in the House at this time — although he did say it could get a majority of Democrats .
The congressman “ “ who is head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee “ “ observed that by January the primaries would be underway .
Warning about the effect on the elections , he asserted that the political benefit was questionable “ “ impeachment appeals to the base , but not the general electorate .

Titanium , the multitalented metal used in everything from jet engines to eyeglass frames , has taken on yet another role as the crucial component of two toothbrushes that aim to shake up the staid world of dental hygiene .
One of the brushes dispenses with toothpaste , instead employing a core of titanium dioxide that generates a plaque - removing electrochemical reaction .
The other uses fine , flexible titanium bristles that can last for years .
Both are getting favorable , if preliminary , reviews from scientists , dentists and consumer testers .
The tried - and - true manual toothbrush has remained largely unchanged for generations .
In the dental field , where professionals rarely agree on anything , the new brushes take some getting used to .
“ People think it ’s hocus - pocus , ” said Erik Powers , of Powers International in Henderson , Nev. , who has recently started importing the $ 29.95 no - toothpaste Soladey brush to the United States .
The brush was invented in Japan .
“ If you put this on the shelf next to a 99 - cent toothbrush , which would you buy ? ”
The regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is in the midst of one of its largest crackdowns against public dissent in a decade .
Seven journalists have been given prison sentences in recent weeks ; more than a thousand activists of the Muslim Brotherhood , the country 's most popular political opposition , languish in jail ; and labor organizers involved in a wave of strikes at government - owned factories have been detained .
On Sunday , fighting between rival Bedouin clans in the Sinai Peninsula quickly spiraled into a riot targeting the police and President Mubarak 's National Democratic Party ( NDP ) .
While local grievances sparked the fight , regular reports of widespread police brutality and torture fed anger in the Sinai , where locals called for the police chief 's resignation , and are fueling public outrage around the country .
As the government cracks down hard in both the Sinai and on opposition activists , such as members of the Muslim Brotherhood , it is increasingly being charged with the use of torture on detainees .
The charges are being publicized on the Internet by activists eager to bring about reform in Egypt , where the government has strong support from Washington .
" It 's hard to explain why , except that torture becomes a habit , " says Aida Seif al - Dawla , a psychologist who founded and runs the Nadim Center for the Psychological Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence in Cairo .
" But there 's no question that police abuse has gone through the roof .
For the past month , we 've been getting one or two cases every day .
For every case that 's reported to us , there 's bound to be many more we never hear about . "
Nasser Sedit Gadallah is just one example .
A plumber who was on his way home in late July after finishing a job in the poor town of Amrania on the western edge of Cairo , Mr. Gadallah was waylaid by a group of local cops .
He was beaten and his cellphone and payment for his work were stolen , says his brother , Ghad .
Then , his brother says , Gadallah insisted on filing a complaint at the police station where some of his attackers , whom he recognized , worked .
He was rebuffed and warned against pursuing the matter further .
But , says Ghad , Nasser did n't heed those warnings .
He filed a complaint with the prosecutor of Giza Governorate , which was backed up by the testimony of a witness who identified some of the police .
On Aug. 8 , about 10 officers from the Amraniyah police station broke into the family 's home , tied up Ghad and another brother of Nasser 's , and tossed Nasser headfirst to his death from the family 's third - story balcony while his 9 - year - old son and his wife watched , according to a recounting of the incident by Ghad .
The family 's neighbors quickly gathered to attack the police , smashing the windows of some of their cars before the police were able to flee .
Now , says Ghad , the other witness to the initial robbery says he 's afraid to testify .
The prosecutor in Giza has n't yet decided if charges will be pressed over Gadallah 's death , and some of his brother 's alleged killers continue to work openly at the police station , according to Ghad .
" Obviously , most Egyptians are afraid to speak out against things like this , " says Ghad .
" But for us , nothing will satisfy us but justice .
People need to know that the police act like a mafia run out of the interior ministry . "
Today , his sister - in - law and her 9 - year - old son spend a few days a week with Nadim Center therapists trying to work through the trauma .
On a typical day there , the waiting room is full of patients , about half Egyptians , the rest refugees from Sudan and other parts of Africa who suffered abuse home before fleeing to Cairo .
The Egyptian government says police abuse and torture here are isolated incidents and that the guilty are prosecuted .
In an interview with a local newspaper earlier this year , Gen . Ahmed Dia el - Din , an assistant to the interior minister , accused the media of sensationalizing police abuses to stir up opposition to the government .
Those words have been followed in recent months by efforts to silence those who complain .
In September , the government closed the Association for Human Rights and Legal Aid after it helped bring a case against the government over a political activist , Mohammed al - Sayyed , who died in police custody .
Last week , the government arrested two political activists – Mohammed al - Dereini and Ahmed Mohammed Sobh , both members of Egypt 's tiny Shiite minority – following their recent efforts to expose torture in the Egyptian prison system .
Mr. Dereini's 2006 book , " Hell 's Capital , " chronicles torture in Egyptian prisons and includes firsthand accounts from his time in jail in 2004 - 2005 .
" Is police torture a bigger problem today ?
There 's no question , " says Gasser Abdel Razek , the director of regional relations for Human Rights Watch .
" Fifteen years ago , we used to say that this or that police station is bad , or if that you were an Islamist and you got picked up after a bombing , you could count on being tortured .
Today , I can't name a single police station that 's good .
And the victims are middle - class , they 're educated , they 're homeless .
It does n't make any difference . "
One case that caused particular shock and revolution was the death of a 13 - year - old boy , Mamduh Abdel Aziz , after he was taken into police custody in August in the delta town of Mansoura .
He was charged with theft .
The boy died in hospital , four days after he was beaten while in police custody .
Before his death , the nearly comatose boy was shown on a video posted to Youtube.com with extensive burn wounds in his genital area .
The boy 's mother , Saieda Sourour , has told local newspapers that government officials offered her money in exchange for her promising to keep silent about the case .
The Interior Ministry , in a written response to the furor , said an autopsy showed the boy died of an infection and said the evidence of torture was simply " allegations . "
Mr. Razek , like many Egyptian human rights activists , says the spread of torture was a natural consequence of the government 's use of violent interrogations against alleged Islamist militants in the 1980s .
What became standard doctrine for the country 's antiterrorist police units spread throughout the system as officers shifted to other jobs in the police force .
" It became a culture .
We have two generations of police who were brought up to use torture against Islamists .
But if it 's allowed and seen as effective , it spreads , " says Razek .
Razek says there has only been one successful torture prosecution of a police officer in Egypt this year , and argues that police violence is systemic , not isolated .
" We 've seen dissent spreading beyond those who are politically organized , for instance , the labor unrest ; so the regime feels it needs to make its people afraid to control its fate , " he says .
" I 'm not talking people agitating for democracy , but people who are worried about feeding themselves . "
Meanwhile , Ghad , whose brother was murdered in Amrania , says his family will continue to demand a prosecution .
" The worst has happened .
I do n't even have the energy to be afraid anymore . "
If you think the National League standings are making you blind , it could easily get worse .
Try looking at the tiebreaker scenarios .
If four teams in the East and West finish the season with the same record , we predict business will be booming at all kinds of ophthalmologists ' offices near you .
Among the fun possibilities if that happens :
The Padres theoretically could play in Milwaukee on Sunday , in Arizona on Monday , in San Diego on Tuesday , in Philadelphia on Wednesday , back in San Diego on Thursday and then in New York on Friday .
But dont write any of that in ink .
This is such a mess , MLB had to declare Thursday " Emergency Coin Flip Day , " because let 's just say some of these matchups did n't look quite this likely a couple of weeks ago .
Ready for the most crazed scenarios ?
All right , here goes :
Four - team craziness :
If the two NL East teams and the top two NL West teams all tie :
Just for the sake of discussion , let 's say the Mets , Phillies , Padres and Diamondbacks finish with the same record .
Here 's how that would work :
• The Mets and Phillies play a one - game playoff Monday in Philadelphia to decide the NL East .
• The Padres and Diamondbacks play a one - game playoff Monday in Arizona to decide the NL West .
• The losers then play Tuesday to decide the wild card .
A Diamondbacks - Phillies game would be played in Philadelphia .
A Padres - Phillies game would be in San Diego .
And if the Mets are involved , they would play Arizona or San Diego at home , but they would have to go to Coors Field if they wind up playing it off with Colorado .
Amazingly , the Mets and D - backs did n't find any of that out until Thursday , because back when the original wild - card scenarios were determined , nobody at MLB apparently envisioned that those scenarios would include New York or Arizona .
Uh , oops .
So a whole lot of frantic coin - flipping went on Thursday to sort all this out .
More four - team craziness :
If two NL West teams and the two NL East teams all have the same record :
• It 's still possible that the Phillies , Mets , Padres and a fourth team ( either the Diamondbacks or Rockies but not both ) could all have the same record .
But that creates two different scenarios -- one if there is a tie for the NL West title , another if the NL West clubs finish tied for second ( and the wild card ) .
• If there 's a tie for both the NL West and NL East titles , there would be tiebreaker games Monday in Philadelphia and San Diego .
• Then the two losers would meet Tuesday .
Here are the sites of those potential games :
• Phillies - Padres in San Diego • Phillies - Rockies in Colorado • Phillies - Diamondbacks in Philadelphia • Mets - Padres in New York • Mets - Rockies in Colorado • Mets - Diamondbacks in New York
• But if the two teams tied in the NL West finish second , we have a whole different game plan .
The only similarity is that the Phillies and Mets would play Monday in Philadelphia to sort out the NL East .
• The loser then would then move on to a three - team wild - card tournament that would work the way we laid it out above .
But here is how baseball would decide which team would get the option of one road game or two home games
• In an Arizona - San Diego - New York three - way : Diamondbacks . •
In a Colorado - San Diego - New York three - way : Rockies . •
In an Arizona - San Diego - Philadelphia three - way : Diamondbacks . •
In a Colorado - San Diego - Philadelphia three - way : Rockies .
So that 's the lay of this goofy land .
Everybody have it all straight now ?
You 'd better .
There will be a quiz in the morning .

Full - time female employees in their 20s surpassing same - age males in cities like Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis , Dallas and New York .REUTERS / Keith Bedford / files
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Young women who want to beat men to the big bucks should get a one - way ticket to the closest big U.S. city , a New York study showed .
The research , completed by the Department of Sociology at Queens College in New York , showed full - time female employees in their 20s surpassing same - age males in cities like Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis , Dallas and New York .
In Dallas , these women earn 20 percent more than men , while in New York City they earn 17 percent more .
“ After age 30 , women are no longer ahead , ” said Andrew Beveridge , a Queens College sociology professor who analyzed 2005 census data for the study , which was first published in June .
“ But that may change since there is a definite narrowing of the gap and increase in education for all women in big cities . ”
Women started to surpass men ’s salaries in urban centers only in the past seven years .
Nationwide , females have consistently trailed males by an average of close to $ 10,000 annually for 17 years .
Before that , the gap was even greater .
Women are faring the best in the Northeast and West , closing the gap in the states of Maryland , District of Columbia and Massachusetts .
In contrast , women are farthest behind in Arkansas , Louisiana , and West Virginia , according to the National Committee on Pay Equity .
The study suggested those gains might be based on the fact that women get married later in cities than in rural areas .
Women marry the latest in New York , Massachusetts and the District of Columbia .
Also , the density of corporate headquarters is greatest in urban areas , which allows young women more opportunities to scale the corporate ladder .
“ Many of the leading companies in industries like advertising or finance are in big cities , ” said Marcia Harris , director of career services at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill .
“ These employers are more conscious of affirmative action and diversity and are looking for talented women who can rapidly move up in the ranks . ”
I was watching Lieberman go off on ABC ’s THIS WEEK about how successful the surge in Iraq has been , and I remembered a roundtable discussion 2 weeks ago on the same show in which ABC ’s Martha Raddatz obliterated the very arguments – the very Bush administration talking points – that Lieberman is now “ coincidentally ” using .
Here ’s the side by the side of the two interviews ( the entire video is under a minute ) .
It ’s clear to me , from Lieberman ’s interview , that in the long term he ’s not remaining in the Democratic party .
( Yes , I know , he ’s an Independent and not a Democrat .
But he caucuses with the Dems . )
He was clearly briefed by Bush White House officials for today ’s ABC appearance , and he has no problem using their talking points – on the same show today he even accused the Democratic candidates of being bad on “ national security , ” a classic Bush talking point : “ I would say that Democratic candidates , in the larger questions of American security , have been disappointing . ”
What Lieberman means , I think , is that the Democratic candidates are n’t willing to give Israeli national security a higher priority than American national security .
This man has no intention of continuing to help the Dems .
He ’s going to become a Republican , and we need to get more seats in the Senate so that we can afford to tell Lieberman to take a hike .
( The only reason Lieberman does n’t walk now is because he ’s a committee chair on the Democratic side .
On the Republican side , he ’d be in the minority , and thus would n’t chair anything . )

WordPress is one of the most widely used pieces of blogging software on the Net .
We use WordPress everyday to spread our ideas and connect with people all around the world , but how many of you actually know who created WordPress ?
Type “ Matt ” into Google and you have your answer .
Matt Mullenweg is the # 1 most important Matt in the world , according to Google , as well as the founding developer of WordPress .
The kicker is that he is only 23 and he released WordPress 2 years ago , when he was 21 .
Matt was born in Houston , Texas and moved to San Francisco in 2005 to work for CNET Networks .
After quitting his job at CNET in late 2005 , he has devoted the majority of his time to developing a number of open source projects and is now a frequent speaker at conferences .
In late 2005 , he founded Automattic , the business behind WordPress and the spam - catching software we all love , Akismet .
In November of 2005 , WordPress stopped being invite only and opened up to the world .
Matt is also the guy behind Ping - O - Matic , the software that pings search engines when a user publishes a new blog post .
This has been instrumental in getting all of our blogs indexed by the search engines .
It is great too because Google search results have a special love for blogs that the other big name search engines do not appear to match .
Ping - O - Matic has helped our blogs reach a much larger audience , thanks to Matt ’s work .
I read an interview Matt did with Digital Web Magazine and they asked him why he chose to make WordPress and open source , GPL - license as opposed to a licensed plan .
His response was :
If you do anything for the money you end up selling out .
Do what you love , what you canâ€™t not do , and the money will follow .
I think the WordPress value to the community as a GPL extension of what came before is a million times more valuable than whatever pittance I would have gotten from doing a proprietary thing .
The benefits Iâ€™ve gotten personally from focusing on what I love have been numerous , and go beyond the purely monetary .
Matt has the attitude of a true winner .
He says , “ do what you love , what you ca n’t not do , and the money will follow . ”
He loves being able to empower other bloggers .
I think that is the best advice anyone has ever given about success – do what you love , the money will follow .
I have heard that from my dad way too many times count , but the fact is , it ’s true .
Working is less painful when you enjoy what you are doing , and as you enjoy it , you want to do more of it .
I work 10 - 12 hour days , but it ’s what I like doing , so it does n’t feel like work .
I really get a kick out of hearing about young entrepreneurs , especially those in their early twenties .
It is amazing the amount of young entrepreneurs who are changing the way we use the web .
The founder of Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , is also 23 .
Makes you think … what were you doing in your early twenties ?
Probably not changing the web .
Update – Matt Mullenweg personally thanked me for writing this article .
The real thanks goes to Matt for the amazing work he has put into WordPress .
The Difference Between Theory and Practice
McAfee's Avert Labs recently provided some very enlightening insight into the very real difference between what people believe is going on , and what is really happening - specifically with respect to how their systems are protected by a current antivirus product .
While the figures demonstrate an increase in the percentage of users over the last three years who believe that they are maintaining up - to - date antivirus protection ( weekly or daily updating ) , the percentage of users who are not actually running any protection ( or maintaining protection at the level they think they are ) have been dropping a lot slower than the first set of figures would suggest .
With more than 90 % of respondents indicating that they were maintaining daily / weekly coverage from their antivirus software , it might be somewhat of a surprise to see that 49 % of respondents were actually not running any antivirus software , or antivirus software that was not updating definitions on a daily or weekly basis .
Even with significantly growing awareness by everyday users of the need for efficient and effective antivirus / antimalware software , and the increasing market penetration achieved by the security industry , the nature of rapidly evolving Information Security threats means that the baseline of protection is outstripping the ability of users to keep up ( without some form of extra help ) .
While efforts to improve the baseline security of new systems , educate users , spread knowledge about threats , and spread knowledge about protective systems and applications is helping offset this increase in the threat to end users , it is nowhere near enough to keep up with the increasing threats .
Confusion or misunderstanding about the level of protection provided to a particular system is a critical mistake that could lead to terrible results for end users .
With users beginning to make use of their systems and the networks they are connected to for more financially and personally sensitive activities , and with companies increasing the exposure of sensitive company and client data to the greater Internet , the need to keep ahead of the threats could not be more clear .
The original survey can be found at McAfee 's site .

Buffett Hates The Dollar Too !
Its not often that Warren Buffett offers investing advice that ’s easily to implement .
According to an email I just got yesterday ,
“ We are still negative on the dollar , ” Buffett continued , shifting his focus to Berkshire ’s strategy for dealing with the troubled U.S. currency .
“ We bought stocks in companies that are earning their money in other currencies .
We are gaining foreign currency exposure . ”
His comments echo Jim Rogers ’ and Julian Robertson ’s bearishness from yesterday .
So where will the $ 52 billion man be putting his money ?
“ My impression is that the Korean market is modestly cheaper than other markets in the world .
I think the Korean market will do better for the next 10 years , ” said Buffett .
The Oracle of Omaha is currently visiting the TaeguTec facility in Daegu , South Korea .
TaeguTec is a subsidiary of Iscar — a company Berkshire Hathaway bought a $ 4 billion stake in last year .
While there , he voiced his approval of South Korean steelmaker Posco .
“ It ’s a great company , ” Buffett said of Posco , “ and great companies get worth more and more all the time . ”
I had recently sold half my PTR stake and bought ICON Asia - Pacific Region S Fund ( ICARX ) , which has quite a few korean companies in it .
But if you want to get a pure Korean play , iShares MSCI South Korea Index ( EWY ) is a good buy .
Its up 40 % + YTD !
Another good buy is the Korea Fund ( KF ) .
Like EWY , its also up 40 % + YTD .
I bought a little bit today since its paying a crazy 32 % dividend and today its going ex-dividend ( which means its the last day to buy it and get the dividend ) .
If you ’d like to buy it , it should trade at a 32 % discount on Monday ( since it ’ll be ex-dividend , it will most likely drop by the amount of the dividend ) even though the dividend wo n’t be paid out until end of November .
The advantage to buying right before the dividend is that sometimes stocks do n’t drop the full amount of the dividend or they quickly make up the loss in share price .
The disadvantage is you ’re slapped with a dividend and a tax liability immediately .
Maybe I ’ll sell the other half of PTR and buy EWY as well .
Although , according to ETFConnect , KF trades at a 5 % discount to NAV , while EWY trades at a 1 % premium .
But regardless of what you buy , you ’ve been given a chance to invest like Buffett .
" You 're either with us , or against us . "
Bush had his then - Secretary of State , Colin Powell , deliver that stark message to Pervez Musharraf after 9/11 .
" Be prepared to be bombed , " Musharraf says Powell 's number two at State , Richard Armitage , told him .
" Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . "
Faced with that bleak choice , the military dictator promised Pakistan 's cooperation in the " war on terror . "
Like Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi codenamed " Curveball , " Musharraf was nothing more than a con man .
He collected $ 10 billion from American taxpayers .
Six years later , all we have to show for it is Khalid Sheikh Mohammad , alleged Al Qaeda strategist , poster boy for waterboarding and a candidate for worst morning face ever .
But do n't blame the general for selling us a line of crap .
Allying himself " with us " was never an option .
In October 1999 I was traveling along the Karakoram Highway from Kashgar in western China to Islamabad , the Pakistani capital .
As my bus crossed the high - altitude Khunjerab Pass from China , we were startled to find the Pakistani border unguarded .
The passport control station had been abandoned in such haste the door was wide open .
A cup of lukewarm tea sat on the registration desk .
The bus driver shrugged .
We drove on into the " Northern Areas " - the section of Kashmir that had been on Pakistan 's side of the ceasefire line at the end of its 1965 war with India .
A few hundred miles south in Islamabad , Musharraf had just overthrown Nawaz Sharif , the democratically - elected prime minister .
The two men had spent the summer blaming each other for a disastrous new offensive against India .
Musharraf settled the dispute by jailing and torturing Sharif - and launching a desperate attempt to win the Kargil Conflict , also known as the Third Kashmir War .
Opening Kashmir 's border with China was beside the point .
The real action was taking place at the newly - open frontier with Afghanistan , where agents of Pakistan 's Inter - Service Intelligence Agency ( ISI ) invited the Taliban to send thousands of jihadis into the Northern Areas to fight India before winter brought an end to the war season .
As usual , Pakistan claimed it was too poor and weak to man its border posts and stop its proxy fighters .
Before long my bus was passing columns of Taliban soldiers on foot and riding pick - up trucks and tanks .
Pakistani Kashmir , an Afghan commander manning a checkpoint told me , was under Taliban control .
The Kargil War ended in stalemate .
But Musharraf 's first act as president was to forge an alliance with the Taliban and , by extension , his country 's radical Islamist parties .
The marketing of Musharraf as a bulwark against radical Islam and the Taliban is one of the biggest jokes of the post - 9/11 era .
He was n't for the Taliban before he was against them .
He was the Taliban .
I 've been writing and speaking about Musharraf 's pro-Islamist affinities since 1999 .
Perhaps now , with thousands of journalists , lawyers and political opponents imprisoned and Pakistan under martial law , Americans will take notice that he's no better than Saddam .
There 's no such thing as a " moderate dictator . "
Actually , Musharaff is worse than Saddam .
Despite occasional kowtowing to fundamentalists in Iraq 's Koran Belt , he was a secular socialist who jailed radical Islamists .
Musharraf 's political prisoners , on the other hand , are journalists , judges , lawyers , artists and peace activists .
" The first people to be arrested after the imposition of emergency were not the leaders of Pakistani Taliban , nor their sympathizers in Islamabad , " wrote Mohammed Hanif , head of the BBC 's Urdu service .
" There was no crackdown on sleeper cells that have orchestrated a wave of suicide bombings across Pakistan . "
The biggest joke of all was the war against Afghanistan , which has become a political I.Q. test .
Most of the presidential candidates , the media and therefore the American people , think Iraq was a distraction from the war we should be fighting in Afghanistan .
In fact , the war against Afghanistan is less justifiable , and even less winnable .
If U.S. officials had wanted to catch Osama bin Laden , all they had to do was call Musharraf .
On 9/11 , the Al Qaeda leader was laid up in a Pakistani military hospital in Islamabad .
If the dictator refused , invading Pakistan - if you 're into that sort of thing - would certainly have been more justifiable than Afghanistan or Iraq .
A Pakistan War could have neutralized the world 's most dangerous nuclear threat , established a valuable strategic American foothold between India and China , and - if we worked with the UN - scored us popularity points for restoring democratic rule .
Such a war would have been far more justifiable than Afghanistan or Iraq .
No country was more responsible than Pakistan for 9/11 .
Pakistan hosted Al Qaeda 's headquarters in Kashmir .
Most of its training camps were in Kashmir and Pakistan 's Tribal Areas - not Afghanistan .
On July 22 , 2004 , The Guardian reported that General Mahmoud Ahmed , chief of the ISI under Musharraf , had sent $ 100,000 to Mohammed Atta , the lead 9/11 hijacker .
The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Pakistani intelligence had financed 9/11 , but the 9/11 Commission decided not to investigate our " strategic ally in the war on terrorism . "
Since the Taliban were funded and armed by the ISI , we would have gotten Afghanistan for free in an invasion of Pakistan .
In November 2001 Musharraf was asked on PBS ' " NewsHour " why reporters were able to find and interview bin Laden .
" Why ca n't Pakistani intelligence find him or help the U.S. to find him ? " asked Robert MacNeil .
" There 's a general suspicion on - it 's surprising that maybe ISI is not contributing to the intelligence , yes - to the intelligence , " replied the military ruler .
" Now it 's not that simple .
After all , then you send in people .
They 're on the other side ; they know who they are , and they know what they have come for ...
It 's not that easy that you send your operatives in and find locations .
One is trying one 's best for that - but if a reporter goes through contact - through some contact and , after all , Osama bin Laden 's purpose is to project himself in some way and create some negative effects in the world , that maybe he would welcome receiving a reporter and projecting whatever his thoughts are . "
Musharraf was always a huckster .
Anyone who paid attention could see that , but that 's the problem : we never do .

" I was at the Kerry speech today , sitting 2 rows away from all the action .
I 'll let you know how it really went down .
The forum was going to be over at 2 pm , and Kerry spoke for so long that the Q and A portion had to be shortened .
He only got through about 7 of the 50 people who were waiting to ask questions .
While the final question was being read , some douchebag ran down the aisle , grabbed the mic from the other side of the room , interrupted the kid who was talking , and started yelling at Kerry , demanding that his questions be heard .
He started ranting about how Kerry talks in circles or something , and everyone was getting annoyed .
The cops are all over him in no time and try to escort him out , but he starts yelling and resisting .
Kerry insists that they let him stay and even agrees to answer his question .
After the interrupted guy 's question was answered , Kerry keeps his promise and lets the angry guy talk .
This is the point where people started taking their cameras and phones out .
All the videos floating around youtube start around here .
You can see in the videos that his questioning gets kind of inappropriate , so somebody cut his mic .
Instead of shutting up , he starts yelling and making an even bigger scene .
He struggled all the way up the aisle , and started violently trying to free himself .
They threatened to taze him and he wouldnt stop fighting , so he got tazed .
They only had to arrest him because he was causing a disruption and would n't leave peacefully .
He was n't being silenced for asking tough questions , trust me .
It 's a shame that they had to taze the guy , but he had a chance to calm down and did n't take it .
He probably did n't pose a physical threat to anybody in the room , but someone can't just hijack the floor of a forum like that and expect not to get kicked out .
This was n't some poor guy who was brutalized for trying to ask some tough questions .
He 's just an obnoxious guy who had a fit when there was n't time for his questions and refused to be calm even when he was given the chance to speak .
He was looking for trouble , and everyone applauded when he was forced to leave .
Nothing pisses me off more than hearing stories about power tripping cops abusing their power , unnecessarily tazing or arresting people , etc .
It 's a huge problem and I 'm glad it 's being discussed .
Just do n't mistake this for one of those cases "
But they get to use $ 200 a month in their work - study earnings as spending money to get a haircut , for instance , or go out for pizza with classmates so they do n’t feel excluded .

Mr. Jack , who is black and had never been on a plane until he flew to Amherst for his first visit , arrived as an A student , and with a steely focus .
His mother , Marilyn , 53 , had guided her son from Head Start to a gifted program in elementary school to a magnet middle school and , in his final year of high school , to the private Gulliver Preparatory School on a full scholarship .
But she never had to push Tony , she said .
“ He was on a mission from Day 1 , ” she said .
Mr. Jack ’s high grades and test scores — a respectable 1200 on the SAT — won him a full scholarship to the University of Florida .
But the median score for his Amherst class was 1422 , and he would have been excluded had the admissions office not considered his socioeconomic class , and the obstacles he had overcome .
“ Tony Jack with his pure intelligence — had he been raised in Greenwich , he would have been a 1500 kid , ” said Tom Parker , the dean of admission .
“ He would have been tutored by Kaplan or Princeton Review .
He would have had The New Yorker magazine on the coffee table . ”
“ Tony Jack is not an anomaly , ” he added .
Mr. Jack , Amherst officials say , would likely not have benefited under traditional affirmative action programs .
In their groundbreaking 1998 study of 28 selective universities , William Bowen , the former president of Princeton , and Derek Bok , now the interim president of Harvard , found that 86 percent of blacks who enrolled were middle or upper middle class .
( Amherst was not included in that study . )
The white students were even wealthier .
“ Universities have prided themselves on making strides in racial diversity , but for the most part they have avoided the larger issue of class inequality , ” said Richard D. Kahlenberg , a senior fellow at the Century Foundation .
SUBURBS do n't come much tidier than Chino Hills , 30 miles ( 50 km ) east of downtown Los Angeles .
Last year , the neighbourhood of coffee - coloured stucco houses and three - car garages boasted an average household income twice that of the nation as a whole .
In Vista del Sol , one of its quiet enclaves , every house but one has a neatly - trimmed green lawn .
And , until recently , the exception was verdant inside .
When the police went in , they found more than 800 marijuana plants — a small part of what is turning out to be an enormous harvest .
Greg Garland , a local narcotics cop , used to discover about a dozen houses a year that had been turned into marijuana factories .
So far this year he has raided more than 40 .
The production boom is not confined to the suburbs .
Since April the state 's annual “ Campaign against Marijuana Planting ” has pulled 2.9 m plants worth some $ 10 billion from back gardens , timber forests and state lands ( see chart ) .
Marijuana is now by far California 's most valuable agricultural crop .
Assuming , very optimistically , that the cops are finding every other plant , it is worth even more than the state 's famous wine industry .
The illicit crop is grown with a technical sophistication that Napa Valley 's Robert Mondavi might envy .
To supply outdoor plantations , rivers are dammed and water piped as far as two miles .
Plants are nourished with fertilisers and tended by workers brought to America specifically for the purpose .
Ageing hippies are responsible for only a few such operations .
Kent Shaw , a state narcotics officer , reckons four - fifths of outdoor marijuana plantations are run by Mexican criminal gangs .
Indoor factories , by contrast , are largely the province of East Asian entrepreneurs .
They prefer to buy houses rather than rent them , to avoid the attention of landlords .
They tend to go for big ones in good neighbourhoods : the property in Vista del Sol cost more than $ 600,000 .
Like good horticulturalists , they propagate strains of the plant that produce a high proportion of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC , marijuana 's active ingredient ) and speed their growth by means of heat and artificial light .
Why the boom ?
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows that the rate of marijuana use in California has barely risen in the past few years , whereas production has hugely increased .
Some 11 % of the state 's population indulge — just a puff over the national average , and less than every state in New England .
The likely explanation is a steady tightening of America 's borders after the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the panic over illegal immigration .
California used to import high - grade marijuana from Canada and low - grade weed from Mexico .
Both routes are now more risky .
As a result , Asian gangs have moved south from British Columbia , where they dominate the hydroponic trade .
Mexican distributors , who may handle cocaine and methamphetamine as well as marijuana , have diversified into production .
In places like Chino Hills , the boom has also been helped by demographic change .
Like many southern California suburbs , Chino Hills has been rapidly transformed from a mostly white area to a rainbow one .
Residents of such a diverse place may be more inclined to ignore odd behaviour and a funny smell emanating from the house down the road — provided that the grass is kept short .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich may have been ridiculed for saying he had seen a UFO , but for some former military pilots and other observers , unidentified flying objects are no laughing matter .

An international panel of two dozen former pilots and government officials called on the U.S. government on Monday to reopen its generation - old UFO investigation as a matter of safety and security given continuing reports about flying discs , glowing spheres and other strange sightings .
“ Especially after the attacks of 9/11 , it is no longer satisfactory to ignore radar returns ... which cannot be associated with performances of existing aircraft and helicopters , ” they said in a statement released at a news conference .
The panelists from seven countries , including former senior military officers , said they had each seen a UFO or conducted an official investigation into UFO phenomena .
The subject of UFOs grabbed the spotlight in the U.S. presidential race last month when Kucinich , a member of Congress from Ohio , said during a televised debate with other Democratic candidates that he had seen one .
Former presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter are both reported to have claimed UFO sightings .
Most turn out to be misidentified aircraft , satellites or meteors .
A panelist who once worked for Britain ’s Ministry of Defense said 5 percent of incidents cannot be explained .
But the sightings are often dismissed by authorities without proper investigations , UFO activists say .
“ It ’s a question of who you going to believe : your lying eyes or the government ? ” remarked John Callahan , a former Federal Aviation Administration investigator , who said the CIA in 1987 tried to hush up the sighting of a huge lighted ball four times the size of a jumbo jet in Alaska .
The panel , organized by a group dedicated to winning credibility for the study of UFOs , urged Washington to resume UFO investigations through the U.S. Air Force or NASA .
“ It would certainly , I think , take a lot of angst out of this issue , ” said former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington , who said he was among hundreds who saw a delta - shaped craft with enormous lights silently traverse the sky near Phoenix in 1997 .
The Air Force investigated 12,618 UFO reports from 1947 to 1969 in what was known as Project Blue Book .
Investigators concluded that the incidents posed no threat and there was no evidence of space aliens or a super technology in operation .
“ Since the termination of Project Blue Book , nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations , ” the Air Force said on its Web site .
This list was found on the net and was originally drafted by Jocelyn Selim .
VOMERONASAL ORGAN
A tiny pit on each side of the septum is lined with nonfunctioning chemoreceptors .
They may be all that remains of a once extensive pheromone - detecting ability .
EXTRINSIC EAR MUSCLES
This trio of muscles most likely made it possible for prehominids to move their ears independently of their heads , as rabbits and dogs do .
We still have them , which is why most people can learn to wiggle their ears .
WISDOM TEETH
Early humans had to chew a lot of plants to get enough calories to survive , making another row of molars helpful .
Only about 5 percent of the population has a healthy set of these third molars .
NECK RIB
A set of cervical ribs — possibly leftovers from the age of reptiles — still appear in less than 1 percent of the population .
They often cause nerve and artery problems .
THIRD EYELID
A common ancestor of birds and mammals may have had a membrane for protecting the eye and sweeping out debris .
Humans retain only a tiny fold in the inner corner of the eye .
DARWIN’S POINT
A small folded point of skin toward the top of each ear is occasionally found in modern humans .
It may be a remnant of a larger shape that helped focus distant sounds .
SUBCLAVIUS MUSCLE
This small muscle stretching under the shoulder from the first rib to the collarbone would be useful if humans still walked on all fours .
Some people have one , some have none , and a few have two .
PALMARIS MUSCLE
This long , narrow muscle runs from the elbow to the wrist and is missing in 11 percent of modern humans .
It may once have been important for hanging and climbing .
Surgeons harvest it for reconstructive surgery .
MALE NIPPLES
Lactiferous ducts form well before testosterone causes sex differentiation in a fetus .
Men have mammary tissue that can be stimulated to produce milk .
ERECTOR PILI
Bundles of smooth muscle fibers allow animals to puff up their fur for insulation or to intimidate others .
Humans retain this ability ( goose bumps are the indicator ) but have obviously lost most of the fur .
APPENDIX
This narrow , muscular tube attached to the large intestine served as a special area to digest cellulose when the human diet consisted more of plant matter than animal protein .
It also produces some white blood cells .
Annually , more than 300,000 Americans have an appendectomy .
BODY HAIR
Brows help keep sweat from the eyes , and male facial hair may play a role in sexual selection , but apparently most of the hair left on the human body serves no function .
PLANTARIS MUSCLE
Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students , the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet .
It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population .
THIRTEENTH RIB
Our closest cousins , chimpanzees and gorillas , have an extra set of ribs .
Most of us have 12 , but 8 percent of adults have the extras .
MALE UTERUS
A remnant of an undeveloped female reproductive organ hangs off the male prostate gland .
FIFTH TOE
Lesser apes use all their toes for grasping or clinging to branches .
Humans need mainly the big toe for balance while walking upright .
FEMALE VAS DEFERENS
What might become sperm ducts in males become the epoophoron in females , a cluster of useless dead - end tubules near the ovaries .
PYRAMIDALIS MUSCLE
More than 20 percent of us lack this tiny , triangular pouchlike muscle that attaches to the pubic bone .
It may be a relic from pouched marsupials .
COCCYX
These fused vertebrae are all that ’s left of the tail that most mammals still use for balance and communication .
Our hominid ancestors lost the need for a tail before they began walking upright .
PARANASAL SIN– USES
The nasal sinuses of our early ancestors may have been lined with odor receptors that gave a heightened sense of smell , which aided survival .
No one knows why we retain these perhaps troublesome mucus - lined cavities , except to make the head lighter and to warm and moisten the air we breathe .
In 1859 , Charles Darwin ( 1809 - 1882 ) published The Origin of Species , which articulated the first full - fledged theory of evolution by natural selection .
Darwin viewed the history of life like a tree , each fork in the tree ’s limbs representing a shared ancestry .
The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors shared amongst species .
To explain these relationships , Darwin contended that all living things were related and descended from a few forms , or even from a single common ancestor , in a process he described as “ descent with modification ” .
Darwin ’s view was controversial because humans did not receive special consideration in this evolutionary tree : they were merely one of its many branches .
Though he did not make this explicit at first , his friend and supporter T. H. Huxley soon presented evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestor .
The popular press of the day misinterpreted this as an assertion that humans were descended from monkeys .
Darwin ’s explanation of the mechanism of evolution relied on his theory of natural selection , a theory developed from the following observations :
1 . If all the individuals of a species reproduced successfully , the population of that species would increase exponentially .
2. Except for seasonal fluctuations , populations tend to remain stable in size .
3. Environmental resources are limited .
4 . The traits found in a population vary extensively .
No two individuals in a given species are exactly alike .
5 . Many of the variations found in a population can be passed on to offspring .
From these observations , Darwin deduced that the production of more offspring than the environment can support leads to a struggle for existence , with only a small percentage of individuals surviving in each generation .
He noted that the chance for surviving this struggle is not random , but depends on how well - adapted each individual is to its environment .
Well - adapted , or “ fit ” individuals will more likely leave a greater number of offspring than their less well - adapted competitors .
Darwin concluded that the unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce leads to gradual changes in the population as the traits which help the organism survive and reproduce accumulate over generations and those that inhibit its survival and reproduction are lost .
Darwin used the term natural selection to describe this process .
The variations in a population arise by chance mutations in DNA , but natural selection is not a process of chance : the environment determines the probability of reproductive success .
The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments .
Natural selection does not involve progress towards an ultimate goal .
Evolution does not necessarily strive for more advanced , more intelligent , or more sophisticated life forms .
For example , fleas ( wingless parasites ) are descended from a winged , ancestral scorpionfly , and snakes are lizards that no longer require limbs .
Organisms are merely the outcome of variations that succeed or fail , dependent upon the environmental conditions at the time .
In reality , when the environment changes , most species fail to adapt and become extinct .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British censors on Tuesday banned a video game for the first time in 10 years , rejecting U.S. - published “ Manhunt 2 ” for what they described as an unrelenting focus on sadism and brutal slaying .

British censors on Tuesday banned a video game for the first time in 10 years , rejecting U.S. - published " Manhunt 2 " for what they described as an unrelenting focus on sadism and brutal slaying .

The decision by the British Board of Film Classification , or BBFC , means the game , from publisher Take - Two Interactive Software , which made the controversial “ Grand Theft Auto ” series , cannot be legally supplied anywhere in Britain .
The ban prompted one U.S. family group to start lobbying for a rating to ensure major American retailers cannot sell the game in which players become an insane asylum escapee sneaking up on enemies and killing them in gruesome ways .
In a statement on the board ’s Web site , BBFC director David Cooke said rejecting a work was a very serious action and not taken lightly .
He said the board preferred to consider cuts or changes but that was not possible in this case .
“ ‘ Manhunt 2 ’ is distinguishable from recent high - end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing , ” he said .
“ There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game , ” Cooke said .
Take - Two could not immediately be reached for comment .
The BBFC noted it was the first game to be denied a classification since 1997 , when “ Carmageddon ” was rejected for having players run down pedestrians .
That decision was overturned on appeal .
The BBFC said the Take - Two label Rockstar Games that created “ Manhunt ” had the right to appeal the decision .
“ Manhunt 2 ” is a follow - up to the 2003 original , which was classified in Britain for people aged 18 and over .
The original game created a storm in Britain in 2004 when the parents of a 14 - year - old boy who was stabbed to death blamed the game for inspiring his 17 - year - old killer .
The U.S. nongovernmental organization that evaluates games , the Entertainment Software Rating Board , has not yet given a rating for “ Manhunt 2 , ” which is slated for a July 10 release .
The Boston - based Campaign for a Commercial - Free Childhood urged people to write the ESRB and demand an “ Adults Only ” rating , which means it could not be sold by major retailers .
“ An “ Adults Only ” rating is the only way to limit children ’s exposure to this unique combination of horrific violence and interactivity , ” group co-founder Susan Linn said in a statement .
Joseph Priestley *
Illustration : Ellen Sharples * 1774 : Oxygen gas is discovered for at least the third time .
This one sticks , however , when its latest discoverer , Joseph Priestly , publishes a paper on the subject that appears to predate the claims of priority made by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier .
In any case , Priestly did isolate the element oxygen , reportedly on this date , calling it " dephlogisticated air " and describing it as " five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration . "
He tested the pure oxygen on a couple of mice and when they did not die as expected , he tried it out himself :
" The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for sometimes afterwards .
Who can tell but that , in time , this pure air may become a fashionable article in luxury .
Hitherto , only two mice and myself have had the privilege of breathing it . "
Priestly delivered his oxygen paper the following year and then included it as part of his Experiments and Observations on Air , published in 1776 .
It 's largely on the basis of this paper and this book that Priestly 's claim of priority lies .
Since then , Priestly 's status has been challenged by others arguing that Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius described oxygen as early as 1604 .
Whether he was or was n't the true discoverer of oxygen , Priestly 's place in history is secure .
Tinkering with air was only one of his pursuits .
In the realm of political science and theology , Priestly will be remembered as a fervent humanist , an influential advocate of religious tolerance and civil rights .
Which , in the end , makes breathing the air a lot sweeter .

Critic : CDC Lab Breakdown Could Have Exposed Workers to Deadly Diseases
Robert Boroffice , leader of Nigeria 's NASRDA , sees endless opportunity in a burgeoning space program . *
Photo : Mark Anderson * Nigeria , a country whose best - known technological export is probably the flowery e-mail output of its " 419 scam " artists , is ramping up a scrappy space program that 's working wonders with a relatively small investment .
Robert Boroffice , leader of Nigeria 's National Space Research and Development Agency , or NASRDA , looks to the sky to solve his country 's earthly problems of hunger and disease .
The country has launched satellites on the cheap to aid agricultural and medical initiatives and is seriously contemplating building an international spaceport .
These are just some of the grand plans kicking around in the mind of Boroffice .
His defense to charges of misplaced priorities – wasting money on space technology when Nigeria faces so many other pressing problems – is as disarming as it is forward - thinking : Space is one of the smartest micro-investments a developing nation can make , he said .
Boroffice , a former biology teacher who will address the PopTech conference Friday in Camden , Maine , must at times contend with the accusation that he is overseeing a gross mistake .
( Wired News is covering the PopTech conference on the Underwire blog . )
Africa 's most populous country , Nigeria is saddled with a sub-Saharan developing nation 's standard - issue burdens : disease , poverty , corruption and malnutrition .
Boroffice thinks space technology is the key to addressing such woes relatively cheaply and efficiently .
For example , NASRDA spent $ 13 million , less than 0.1 percent of the nation 's budget , in the 2003 launch of NigeriaSat - 1 , an advanced imaging satellite that punches its weight with 1990s satellites in the $ 300 million class .
NigeriaSat - 1 – the first satellite to provide close - up images of the after - effects of Hurricane Katrina – helped sow the seeds of technological development in a nation that needs engineers , infrastructure and IT .
Today , Nigeria imports food for its booming population while Nigerian farmers ' yields depend on seasonal variations in things like water availability and soil fertility .
NigeriaSat - 1 beams up - to - date agricultural data back to NASRDA mission control in Abuja every day , and Nigeria 's space support program helps farmers make use of the information to make smart decisions , said Boroffice .
" There are seminars and workshops to teach farmers how to read ( NigeriaSat - 1 ) maps and how to identify areas where they can plant rice , when to plant and when to harvest and also to provide a system for monitoring the health of the rice ( crop ) , " Boroffice said .
The challenge for NASRDA now , said Martin Sweeting of Surrey Satellite Technology , which built NigeriaSat - 1 , is reaching the point of self - sufficiency so Nigerian engineers can build , launch and operate satellites from within the country 's borders .
Surrey Satellite , which also designed and built the successful imaging satellite 's successor – NigeriaSat - 2 , which is set to launch next year – is training some of Boroffice 's top science staff .
With the successful launch earlier this year of Nigeria 's first communications satellite , NigComSat - 1 , Boroffice wants to expand both the role of space technology in the country and the economic viability of NASRDA .
Telemedicine is now possible , Boroffice said , thanks to Nigeria 's new bird in the sky .
" Most of our doctors do n't want to go to rural areas , " he said .
" So we have created primary health - care centers , and we link them to two teaching hospitals .
And these two hospitals , with videoconferencing , can provide high - quality medicine to these remote ( areas ) . "
Boroffice also pines for the day when a Nigerian spaceport is inaugurated , enabling local launch of NASRDA spacecraft .
( Previous craft have launched from Russia and China . )
Nigeria 's proximity to the equator means it has a natural aerospace resource many nations might want to buy into .
" ( Nigeria has ) a location that 's ideal for launching satellites into geostationary and polar orbits , " Sweeting said .
" This is something that they could clearly exploit at any time . "

If you need someone to build you an extensible , elegant and demonstrably functional application in a hurry then the Law Faculty at Cambridge University is currently the place to be .
The building , one of the modern steel and glass blocks that nestles close to the much - reviled Seeley History Library on the university ’s Sidgwick site , is currently home to the 2007 International Lisp Conference , and the lower ground floor is thronged with developers who like to create the ‘ ill - defined , complex and dynamic ’ applications that Wikipedia claims Lisp is good for .
Most of the hundred or so delegates are men , many of them would seem to be of an age to remember the good old days of minicomputers – if not mainframes – and enough have long hair and beards to make your correspondent feel at home , but this should n’t detract from the importance of the work that takes place in Lisp or the enhancements they are making to this much - loved language .
Invented in 1958 , Lisp sits with COBOL and FORTRAN as one of the oldest languages still in regular use for production systems , and over the last decade Common Lisp has become a hidden jewel for developers who need to build flexible applications in a wide range of domains .
Those who arrived in Cambridge on Saturday got a beautifully sunny afternoon for their introduction to the city , with a punt trip on the Cam to get them into the mood for four days of tutorials , presentations , networks and parenthesis counting .
Keeping the language alive means investing in training , and Sunday was dedicated to practical work , with a range of tutorials for those who wanted to learn more about the language , but the real action started today with a brutally early 0830 kickoff .
Despite the hour the room was full for Herbert Stoyan ’s romp through the history of the language , demonstrating the sort of dedication that has made Lisp a real survivor .
Talks range from the discursive to the entirely practical , like Peter Herth ’s presentation of how to use LTk , a Common Lisp binding for the Tk graphics toolkit , which included code fragments and onscreen editing , while Robert Strandh showed us how to re-implement EMACS in Common Lisp , primarily just to show that it could be done .
The variety of talks is partly because this is neither an academic conference nor an industry event designed to sell tools but a cross-community event .
Christophe Rhodes , from Goldsmiths College in London , was pleased to see such a wide range of people , ‘ from hobbyist to industrial users to academics ’ , as he put it .
‘ They come together in a way that you do n’t get at university conferences , where you just have academics , ’ he said .
‘ Here we have users who use Lisp as a tool , as well as people who do language development . ’
The view was reinforced by Marie Burton - Aimar from the EPITA research and development lab , who added that ‘ there are two generations of Lispers – the old ones who been programming for twenty years and those new to Lisp ’ .
She felt that bringing them together in one conference was good for the long - term prospects of the language , even if there were differences of opinion and approach .
As well as bringing the community together , the conference includes the announcement of the results of the Lisp programming contest ( covered in El Reg on Feb 3 ) .
Entrants had to write a program to play the game of ‘ Continuo ’ , a card game where players place coloured cards on the table and score points .
Each card has a 4 by 4 grid of coloured squares , and you score points by building connected regions .
The first entry arrived the day after the competition was announced , and prizes were distributed as liberally as parentheses in a badly - written Lisp program .
Christophe Rhodes got one for obscure use of Lisp for ‘ relying on the non-nil return value of ( digit - char - p ) ’ , while Frank Buss got the ‘ first half - decent entry ’ award and Guido Witmond won for learning the language just in order to enter the competition .
Conference organiser Nick Levine , who lives locally and works at software house Ravenbrook , sees the event as a way to bring the two elements of his life together .
" I ’ve made a living from Lisp for almost twenty years and lived in or around Cambridge for nearly thirty " , he says .
" Now I can bring the two together – even if organising the conference has taken over my life ! "
The conference continues until Wednesday , finishing with Jans Aasman ’s paper on scalable Lisp applications , while delegates can also look forward to talks from community superstars John Mallery from the AI Lab at MIT and Ralf Moeller from Hamburg University of Technology .
Another highlight will be Manuel Serrano ’s attempt to bridge the cultural divide between the sort of applications we typically associate with list processing and the brave new world beloved of the venture capitalists with HOP , a Lisp - based environment for developing Web 2.0 Applications .
It could get messy in there , although at least the parentheses will balance .

MSNBC : Libertarian Ron Paul has become ' an Internet sensation ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This MSNBC's David Shuster marvelled on Tuesday that anti-war libertarian Rep. Ron Paul " has managed to develop a huge fan base online ... especially among college students " in his bid for the GOP presidential nomination .
There are almost 30,000 Ron Paul videos on YouTube , and Paul has more than 64,000 friends on MySpace .
Many articles about Paul on RAW STORY have received unusually high numbers of hits at story - recommending sites like Digg and Reddit , as well .
( For example , Ron Paul : Republicans need Reagan 's courage , MSNBC 's Tucker Carlson invites Ron Paul to give ' freedom tutorial ' , and Ron Paul teams up with Dem candidate to end war . )
" I ca n't explain it , " Paul told Shuster .
" I 'm bewildered but surprised and pleased as anybody else .
But all I can say is maybe the message of liberty is very popular with young people . "
Paul said that if he had the kind of money the front - runners enjoy , he would use it to promote his message of a non-interventionist foreign policy and personal liberty .
" We do n't need the Patriot Act , and we do n't need warrantless searches and we do n't need secret prisons , " Paul stated .
Paul said he would support the Republican nominee in 2008 only " if I can find one that 'll take the same position I have on the war , that we ought to end it and come home . "
When asked what he would do with his growing support if he is not the nominee , he answered , " I guess the question is , what are they going to do with me ? "
" They 've sort of joined me spontaneously , and I 'm delighted , but I would work hard to keep them together and to continue the process , " Paul continued .
Though he cautioned that he had no interest in a third party candidacy , he emphasized that " this group of people now can be very influential .
... I do n't think this is going to be just put away .
I do n't think we can close these ideas off . "

The result for the well - meaning company is harsh .
Its advertising might hurt the rival in the sense that consumers pay fewer fees there , but it is increasing the number of sophisticated consumers and teaching them to choose the other guys .
It is unlikely to draw in the sophisticates .
“ That business wo n’t make much money once you understand how the world works , ” Mr. Laibson said .
“ What ’s the benefit to the company ? ”
It is a far better business strategy to have the naïve subsidize the sophisticated .
The way the market solves this problem , in other words , is not by educating consumers , but by having the sophisticated consumer exploit the opportunities .
Sophisticated consumers are not really taking advantage of companies , nor are companies taking advantage of consumers , as much as companies are helping those sophisticated consumers take advantage of the less sophisticated consumer .
For example , you see an offer for a room at Nontransparent Hotel for $ 75 ( which costs the hotel $ 100 to provide ) .
The guy checking in behind you also rents a room , but will rack up $ 70 in fees from the minibar , the phone and garage parking ( all of which cost the hotel $ 20 to provide ) .
You , on the other hand , were not tempted by the minibar , used your cellphone for calls and took public transportation to the hotel .
The other guy subsidized your room .
Smart consumers now have a strategy .
They should go to the company offering the discounted product even if the company has loads of hidden fees .
The sophisticated consumer then exploits the company by taking the below - cost product and shunning the fees .
“ It ’s a perpetual battle between the firm that fools consumers into paying fees and the smart consumer who can avoid them , ” Mr. Laibson said .
Getting cheaper goods and services subsidized by the naïve consumers works as long as you know what you could be charged .
But it does not pay if too many people know the same thing .
Shrouding of information rarely goes away because there are new generations of myopic consumers and even the sophisticated consumers are forgetful or distracted and end up paying for add - ons .
The professors say that new shrouding techniques constantly evolve as companies find fresh ways to generate additional revenue .
“ Now that the world is more complicated with more products , there are more opportunities for people to make mistakes , ” Mr. Gabaix admits .
That said , outsmarting companies is hard work .
Hewlett - Packard does not tell consumers the price - per - page cost of its printers on its Web site , for example .
You have to hunt for the information and do the math yourself .
Hotels in South Florida rarely tell you while you are making reservations or checking - in that you will face a $ 25 “ resort fee , ” which is ostensibly imposed to cover your use of the pool and deck chairs .
A recent study of purchases on eBay showed that consumers responded to direct costs more than to shipping costs .
Michael Bond was reacting to criticism over the decision to use the marmalade - loving bear in a TV advert for the yeast - based spread .
And he dismissed the accusation that he was paid to write the commercial .
Paddington and Co , which owns the rights to the bear 's image , gave permission for the bear to be used in the advert .
In a letter to the Times , Mr Bond dismissed a claim that he was paid a " vast sum of money " for the commercial .
' Built in stone '
" I should be so lucky - particularly since I did n't write it .
In fact , I have to report that although Paddington found the sandwiches interesting , bears are creatures of habit , " he wrote .
" It would require a good deal more than the combined current withdrawals from Northern Rock to wean him off marmalade , if then . "
Mr Bond told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that Paddington would not give up marmalade for good .
Michael Bond based the character on a teddy he bought for his wife
" Certainly not .
He never would convert , " he said .
" The thing about children 's characters is that these things are built in stone . "
Mr Bond 's daughter , Karen Jankel , who is managing director of Paddington and Co , defended the company 's decision .
She said people had " read the headlines and jumped to conclusions " .
" Unilever wanted to encourage people to try Marmite in their sandwiches , and they were looking for a character famous for eating sandwiches , " she said .
" The point of the advert is that Paddington always has marmalade in his sandwiches .
He simply tries Marmite . "
The advert features Paddington , wearing his usual hat and carrying his battered suitcase , sitting on a step at the side of the street .
He tries the Marmite sandwich and feeds some of it to a pigeon .
Paddington first appeared in the book A Bear Called Paddington in 1958 and became the star of a hit animated series , narrated by Sir Michael Hordern , in the 1980s .
A quick legal update for a Monday morning , as the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has upheld the decision of Judge Stewart Dalzell in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania which confirmed that the owner of a website cannot be held liable for defamatory posts on his site made by its users .
Tucker Max , a New York - based aspiring celebrity and lothario - in - training , had encouraged his bulletin board ’s readers to savage Philadelphia ’s Anthony DiMeo III , heir to a blueberry farm fortune , for a 2005 New Year ’s Eve party DiMeo promoted at a local restaurant which ended in a shambles when the bar ran out of alcohol well before midnight .
" You threw an absolutely disastrous party on New Year 's Eve precipitated by false advertising and possible fraud , " wrote one of the site ’s few anonymous commenters that I can quote unexpurgatedly .
Others insulted DiMeo ’s appearance , or made various profanity - laced , hyperbolic suggestions to DiMeo , some suggesting acts that are both illegal and anatomically impossible .
( Read the court 's opinion at p 4 - 6 for more . )
In response , DiMeo ( himself an aspiring celebrity ) sued Max for defamation , seeking to hold him liable for " negligently , carelessly , recklessly and / or intentionally publish[ing ] said libelous statements . "
In dismissing the suit , Judge Dalzell relied heavily on 47 U.S.C. § 230 , a portion of the Communications Decency Act , which states that " [ n ] o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider . "
This provision , passed in 1996 , is a relic of the pre-Internet era , during which the interactive computer services under consideration were large , corporate - sponsored sites like America Online , CompuServe and Prodigy .
The provision was designed to encourage such sites to self - regulate , editing and screening offensive content in order to protect minors , by removing perverse disincentives that might otherwise have discouraged website owners from taking a more active role in policing themselves .
Judge Dalzell determined that this regulation also protected individual bloggers like Max who operated smaller , less formal sites than those contemplated by the bill ’s sponsors .
The Court held that Section 230 protected TuckerMax.com both as an provider and a user of an interactive computer service – namely , the Internet .
As such , Max could not be held liable for defamation no matter how crude or malicious the statements on his site were .
In a footnote , however -- and pay attention , folks , because this is where you come in -- Judge Dalzell maintained that individual posters could themselves still be held personally liable for defamatory statements they made online .
The question , obviously , then becomes whether a poster 's claimed right to anonymity supersedes an alleged victim of defamation 's right to determine who her attacker is , and the obligation of website operators and internet service providers to assist the alleged victim in identifying that individual .
[ The major case on this topic I know of is Doe v Cahill , a 2005 decision .
In that case , the Delaware Supreme Court determined that since " the possibility of losing anonymity in a future lawsuit could intimidate anonymous posters into self - censoring their comments or simply not commenting at all , and that " a defamation plaintiff , particularly a public figure , obtains a very important form of relief by unmasking the identity of his anonymous critics , " the best balancing of rights meant that before a defamation plaintiff could obtain the identity of an anonymous defendant through the compulsory discovery process , he must undertake efforts to notify the anonymous poster that she is the subject of a subpoena , including posting notice on the board where the defamation occurred , and must prove to to the court 's satisfaction that her statements were sufficiently defamatory to create a prima facie case for liability . ]
Some odd incentives remain .
In assessing whether these particular remarks could have been deemed defamatory , Judge Dalzell noted that Pennsylvania law required them to be viewed in the context of the site as a whole , based upon the " effect the [ writing ] is fairly calculated to produce , the impression it would naturally engender , in the minds of the average persons among whom it is intended to circulate . "
As such , the more reputable a site attempts to be and the higher its level of discourse , the more amenable it becomes to facing a defamation suit .
Max ’s commenters , on the other hand , were virtually immune from liability because no one could possibly mistake them for contributors to the op - ed page of the New York Times .
In other words , the same remark -- published on two different websites -- could be found defamatory on one but not the other , and that the best way to avoid defamation liability is in fact to run a website that lacks even the pretense of accuracy or good taste .
In upholding Judge Dalzell 's opinion last week , the Third Circuit had no problem agreeing that " Max ’s website is an interactive computer service because it enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server " aand that because " DiMeo does not allege that Max authored the comments on the website or that he is an information content provider , " Max is immune from suit for his commenters ' speech .
Any questions ?
Let me know .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 1  A Blackwater USA employee under investigation in the killing last December of an Iraqi bodyguard in an off - duty confrontation was so drunk after fleeing the shooting that another group of guards took away the loaded pistol he was fumbling with , a report to a House committee said Monday .
The guards , employees of Triple Canopy , another private military contractor , returned the weapon to the Blackwater employee , who smelled of alcohol , and escorted him away from their guard post in the fortified Green Zone , the report said .
Shortly afterward , the police detained the man , a 26 - year - old firearms technician whom the report did not name , at the Blackwater camp inside the Green Zone , but determined he was too intoxicated to be interviewed .
Within 36 hours , the report said , Blackwater fired the man for possessing a firearm while drunk and arranged with the State Department to fly him back to the United States , angering Iraqi officials who said the Christmas Eve shooting was murder .
The acting ambassador at the United States Embassy in Baghdad suggested that Blackwater apologize for the shooting and pay the dead Iraqi man ’s family $ 250,000 , lest the Iraqi government bar Blackwater from working there , the report said .
Blackwater eventually paid the family $ 15,000 , according to the report , after an embassy diplomatic security official complained that the “ crazy sums ” proposed by the ambassador could encourage Iraqis to try to “ get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their family ’s future . ”
It 's one of the great paradoxes of television sitcom history : How did Alex P. Keaton — a character in the 1980s sitcomportrayed by actor Michael J. Fox — the son of mellow hippie parents , become an uptight Republican who idolizes both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan ?
" In the past , people thought that [ political leanings were ] all environmentally influenced , a combination of biological dispositions as well as cultural shaping , " says David Amodio , an assistant professor of psychology at New York University .
However , a new study , led by Amodio , indicates that political bent " is not just a choice people have , but it seems to be linked to fundamental differences in the way people process information . "
Amodio and colleagues report in Nature Neuroscience that they scanned the brains of 43 subjects during 500 trials of a task designed to test their ability to break from a habitual response .
Prior to beginning the experiment , volunteers were asked to rate their political leanings based on a scale from – 5 ( extremely liberal ) to +5 ( very conservative ) .
They were then given a computerized test in which they were shown one of two stimuli for 100 milliseconds ( 0.1 second ) .
If an " M " popped on the screen , the respondent had 500 milliseconds ( a half second ) to press a key on the keyboard before him or her ; if a " W " appeared , the person was told to do nothing .
The task , known as Go / No - Go , is an example of " conflict monitoring , " which Amodio says , " came about as a way to explain how we realize that we need to pay more attention . "
In this version , subjects became accustomed to pressing the button when they saw an " M , " which appeared 80 percent of the time during the trials .
Thus , when a " W " cropped up , participants faced a conflict between their trained response and a new stimulus .
Amodio says that the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , a forebrain region , " serves almost as a barometer for this degree of conflict . "
" People who have more sensitive activity in that area , '' he notes , " are more responsive to these cues that say they need to adapt their behavior , " reacting more quickly and accurately to the unexpected stimulus .
On average , people who described themselves as politically liberal had about 2.5 times the activity in their ACCs and were more sensitive to the " No - Go cue ' ' than their conservative friends .
" They are more sensitive to the need for change and more sensitive to the need to change their behavior , " Amodio says about the politically left - leaning subjects .
He plans to repeat the experiment with subjects who give views on specific hot - button political issues , such as gun control .

Could the root of an African shrub hold the key to getting millions of addicts off heroin , coke , and crack – oh , yeah , and cure alcoholism in its spare time ?
Can a single dose of an extract from the mysterious shrub 's root bark be worth years on a therapist 's couch ?
Some of the answers may soon be found in a three - bedroom house on the Sunshine Coast .
Tucked away there on a hill , with a stunning view of the ocean and surrounded by tall trees , is the Iboga Therapy House .
Forty years after globetrotting backpackers introduced a substance called ibogaine into the U.S. drug culture , the extract from western Africa 's Tabernanthe iboga shrub has become an underground rage among drug - addled Hollywood celebs willing to plunk down between $ 3,500 and $ 10,000 for ibogaine treatment at any one of about a dozen unregulated clinics worldwide , including the one in B.C .
Because ibogaine is illegal in the U.S. – one of just three countries to ban the substance , along with Belgium and Switzerland – clients have to travel to clinics in countries such as Canada , Mexico , Costa Rica , and Slovenia for an " ibogaine experience " .
Advocates liken the miracle drug – which can unleash a reality - shattering trip so powerful it has been described as " dying and going to hell 1,000 times " – to the Holy Grail of addiction cures , comparable in importance to the discovery of penicillin .
Although ibogaine 's alleged ability to quickly cure opiate addiction without withdrawal symptoms was discovered relatively recently , the substance has long been used in Gabon by hunters to stay alert and , in larger doses , in week - long sacred ceremonies in the Bwiti religion .
Yet despite the extraordinary claims about ibogaine 's powers , a B.C. study launched last February is the first time the drug 's therapeutic benefits for opiate addiction are being measured systematically in a public investigation .
( Other clinics have n't released data . )
Preliminary results from the Sunshine Coast clinic have justified much of the hype .
" I 've witnessed people 's lives being turned around , " said Leah Martin , one of the study leaders .
Of 20 pre-study clients who took ibogaine at the facility in 2004 , 13 were found to be abstaining when evaluated later , after an average interval of six months .
The abstainers included six out of seven cocaine or crack addicts , three of eight opiate addicts and four of five people with other addictions , including to meth and multiple substances .
With an overall abstinence rate of 65 percent , ibogaine does way better than the 10 - percent average of conventional drug - treatment programs , Martin said .
What 's more , the clients at the B.C. facility are usually the hardest cases .
" People who contact the Iboga Therapy House have already done every type of program in their city and are scouring the Internet [ for help ] .
They 've been in detox multiple times and are highly resistant to other therapy .
They say , ' This is my last hope , ' " she said .
Ibogaine works in two ways .
It eliminates cravings for heroin and other drugs in many people , but it also often works at a deeper level , getting them to revisit life experiences–good and bad–and helping many find ways to heal and ensure cravings do n't come back .
Scientists say it 's like hitting a reset button for your brain .
Traces of the drug remain in the body for up to six months , continuing to ward off addictive urges in unknown ways .
" It truly is its own category [ of drug ] , " Martin said .
" Right after , it 's common for people to say , ' Whoa , what was that ? '
But a month later , people might wake up and remember something and be able to move forward . "
Ibogaine appears to work on " every neurotransmitter system we know about " , Kenneth Alper , a psychiatry professor at New York University School of Medicine , told the Journal of the American Medical Association in a 2002 story on ibogaine .
Alper , who is also a co-investigator in the B.C. study , has called the use of ibogaine " one of the biggest paradigm shifts regarding treatment for addiction in the span of my career " .
In a testimonial on the Iboga Therapy House 's Web site , one client says of the trip : " I pretty much died to my old self .
I yelled , I kicked , I screamed ( inside myself ) but this new knowledge is too powerful to ignore . "
Says another : " I believe Iboga brings you into and through the land of the dead , to the land of the Gods . "
The Georgia Straight connected with Martin early one morning near the end of her 8 p.m. - to - 8 a.m. shift as a program worker at a Downtown Eastside residential detox centre run by the Portland Hotel Community Services Society .
She spoke about her own ibogaine trip : " I felt as a facilitator I should know what it was like , to be able to relate . "
An ibogaine experience usually lasts 24 to 36 hours , most of which is , typically , spent on your back because of impaired muscle coordination and perception .
The first four hours usually involve plenty of vomiting , coupled with hallucinations and strange physical sensations .
This is n't a drug for clubland .
Next is eight hours of what Martin called the " cognitive phase : the beginning stages of insights .
You 're remembering things or events .
It tells a very interesting story of yourself and your life . "
The intense visions are dreamlike , Martin said , but " if you find yourself in a vision you do n't like , you can just open your eyes .
There is a lot of randomness along with insights .
It truly was a reflection of my mind and the things I obsess about .
I laughed at myself a lot , realizing how ridiculous people can be . "
This is the phase that can give people with addictions deep new insights into their troubles .
" If you had trauma , people can relive that .
After they 're traumatized , sometimes they shut themselves off from the pain , and that 's why they adopt certain habits .
But to be able to see it in a healing way [ with ibogaine ] can be beneficial . "
Then comes another 12 to 24 hours of " residual stimulation " as the person keeps dreaming but slowly comes down , often falling asleep .
Advocates say the drug is n't addictive itself partly because the trip is so hellacious .
" It is not a recreational drug , " said Rick Doblin , president of the California - based Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies , which is helping to fund the Iboga Therapy House study .
Doblin is also the principal investigator .
The ibogaine work is just one of MAPS 's stable of groundbreaking research projects .
The group is also funding the first - ever studies of therapy involving ecstasy , LSD , and magic mushrooms to deal with mental - health issues like posttraumatic stress , end - of - life anxiety , and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
The U.S. studies all have an official okay from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and even of the drug warriors at the Drug Enforcement Agency , and are attracting interest from the U.S. military for treating PTSD among Iraq vets .
Early results show ecstasy is not only safe for therapeutic purposes , but it can also help people who do n't respond to conventional therapy or treatment with the pharmaceutical drugs normally given for posttraumatic stress : Zoloft and Paxil .
Doblin described the ecstasy results as " dramatic " –far better than those from the standard treatments .
The work has still met ferocious resistance from the DEA , however .
MAPS is battling the agency in court to get permission for scientists to grow marijuana in order to study its use for pain relief , control of nausea , and other medical purposes .
Last February , a judge ruled in MAPS 's favour , but the DEA has filed a series of objections , citing security concerns and likening Doblin to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar .
Speaking over the phone from his home in Boston , Doblin said he owes much of his doggedness and success to his own ibogaine trip in 1985 , a year before he founded MAPS .
" I feel it 's been a major contributor to what I 've been able to accomplish , " he said , describing the experience as " lasting , powerful and very positive , although at the time it was horrendous " .
Back then , already active in drug - policy reform , he said he suffered from a neurosis common to many activists – " a certain arrogance , that we know the better world " .
An underground therapist suggested ibogaine could help him grow personally and become a more effective activist .
Doblin took it one morning at the oceanfront house of a therapist , who stayed at his side .
He lay in bed with his eyes closed all day , vomiting constantly , coughing and feeling like he was choking .
The barf brought out complex emotions : " a line between self - criticism , self - perception , and self - hatred " .
He started to blame his intense nausea on his inability to just chill out and unwind .
" I thought this was all my doing –that I could n't relax .
If only I was better , I could be a better tripper , " he said .
Then came realization : here was a metaphor for his struggles with his arrogance .
" I was crucified on the cross of my own self - perfectionism , " he said , laughing .
Twelve hours later , the stars came out , his guts relaxed , the upchucking stopped and everything got good .
" I had one of the most blissful nights of my life .
It felt like transcendence through exhaustion , " he said .
" I 'm forever grateful for that experience .
I think about it often . "
The experience helped Doblin work out the arrogance thing ; it also enabled him to develop the confidence to strike out and found MAPS .
Yet he does n't believe it 's the easy wonder drug some suggest , and he supported the B.C. study partly because of the underground myths about ibogaine .
" We 've been deluded for a long time with the miracle - cure approach , " he said .
One problem is many ibogaine clinics that offer the expensive treatment are happy to let potential clients believe it will solve all their problems , Doblin said .
The clinics have little incentive to follow - up with clients or study the treatment 's effectiveness , which , he said , is widely overestimated .
First off , he said ibogaine is n't for everyone .
It requires one to be " open to the self - reflection that ibogaine permits .
It takes a certain courage to go through an ibogaine experience . "
Even for these folks , he said , the trip has to be supported by aftercare and , possibly , a second dose .
There may also be safety concerns .
About a dozen deaths have occurred during the 3,600 recorded ibogaine treatments that have taken place outside Africa since 1990 .
Advocates say pharmaceutical drugs also cause adverse reactions .
Also , coroner reports in most of the cases placed the blame not on ibogaine , but on conditions like heart or liver disease and , in one case , a man choking on his vomit while eating a sandwich after the session had ended .
Just the same , the Iboga Therapy House screens potential clients for several medical conditions like ulcers , liver problems , blood clots , and heart trouble .
Patients start with a small test dose and are observed for an hour for adverse reactions before the rest of the gram - sized full dose is given .
Gone , however , are the halcyon days when the clinic used to offer free ibogaine .
In 2005 , its founder , Vancouver pot entrepreneur Marc Emery , ran out of cash to fund the facility , so it had to close .
Last February , the clinic reopened with money from MAPS .
It now hopes to become self - sustaining by charging $ 4,700 for a five - to seven - day treatment session for dependence on heroin , methadone , and other opiates , cocaine , crack , or alcohol .
( Shorter , cheaper sessions are also offered for spiritual or strictly therapeutic trips . )
Aside from the ibogaine , which the clinic buys for $ 700 a dose from a distributor in Spain , the sessions include therapy , massage , acupuncture , mild yoga , and elements of the traditional Bwiti ceremony to set the mood for the ibogaine session .
Only one client or couple stays at the house at any time , and staff are on hand around the clock to monitor them .
Doblin said the B.C. ibogaine clinic is inexpensive when compared to hospital programs .
Besides that , the cost does n't seem high compared to addiction 's drain on people and society .
Almost 10 percent of the B.C. government 's budget is spent on substance abuse and problem gambling , according to a 2005 drug - policy report by the City of Vancouver .
That report recommended alternative treatments for drug dependency , including the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs like peyote and ayahuasca .
Although ibogaine was n't mentioned specifically , Zarina Mulla , a city drug - policy planner and report coauthor , spoke enthusiastically about it in a phone interview from her office .
" It helps users analyze some of the issues behind the drug abuse .
Perhaps this is the most important thing because you can relapse and go back to the drug , " she commented .
Mulla said alternative approaches are vital at a time when the Harper government has announced a new Canadian drug policy modelled on the U.S. police - and - prisons approach , which she called " a failure ” ¦There 's such a large amount of money for enforcement [ in the Harper policy ] and none for harm reduction and only a little for prevention and treatment . "
Leah Martin , for her part , said she 's not holding out hope for any federal funds for the ibogaine clinic .
It did apply once , but was rejected .
" They were looking for teens that do [ drug - education ] tables at raves .
We were a bit too obscure for them .
People generally do n't know about [ ibogaine ] . "
And in the current climate , that 's not all bad .
" We 're lucky ibogaine is unscheduled [ not banned ] in Canada .
We play our cards so we kind of stay off the radar . "
I have a theory on why Glenn Beck is on the air .
With apologies to those who deal with very real disabilities , I suspect that the reason Beck has a national platform because he has the Republican version of Tourette's .
He has no filter for which he can keep himself from blurting out these ridiculous things .
The problem is , he 's just a buffoon with the analytical depth of an amoeba .
So despite the fact that his ratings are less than half of his nearest competitor , Glenn keeps going with his fact - free rants so other pundits ( Tucker Carlson , excluded ) do n't have to look so puerile .
Case in point : how many smears and nasty innuendo without any facts can you count when Glenn discusses Hillary Clinton 's newly announced health care plan ?

Ugh , just makes you want to take a shower to watch him , does n't it ?
And then Glenn proves his acute grasp of foreign policy by responding to Greenspan 's now infamous quote that Iraq was all about the oil with a resounding " And ....? "

This is the voice and opinion that CNN thinks -- despite the reality of his ratings -- that Americans want to see and refuse to give any progressive voice ( hell , let 's just say intelligent or fact - based voice , there 'd be a change ) a chance .
Curious , do n't you think ?
Want to ask them why ?

Jacob Loshin has an interesting draft paper on intellectual property among magicians .
Stage magic is a form of technology , relying on both apparatus and technique to mislead the audience about what is really happening .
As in any other technical field , innovations are valuable , and practitioners look for ways to cash in on their inventions .
They do this , according to Loshin , without much use of intellectual property law .
This makes magic , like cuisine and clothing design , a thriving field that operates despite a lack of strong legal protection for innovation .
Recently legal scholars have started looking harder at such fields , hoping to find mechanisms that can support innovation without the cost and complexity of conventional intellectual property law , and wondering how broadly those alternative mechanisms might be applied .
What makes magic unusual is that practitioners rarely rely on intellectual property law even though magic tricks are protectable by patent and as trade secrets .
Patent protection should be obvious : patents cover novel mechanisms and methods , which most magic technologies are .
Some classic tricks , such as the saw - a - person - in - half trick , have been patented .
Trade secret protection should be obvious too : how to do a particular trick is valuable business information whose secrecy can be protected by the inventor .
( The audience sees the trick done , but they do n’t really see the secret of the trick . )
Yet Loshin , and apparently most magicians , think that patent and trade secret are a poor fit .
There are basically three reasons for this .
First , part of the value of a trick is that the audience can’t figure out how it ’s done ; but a patent must explain the details of the invention .
Second , tricks are subject to “ reverse engineering ” by rival magicians who watch the trick done , repeatedly , from different parts of the audience , then do experiments to try to replicate it ; and of course trade secrets are not protected against reverse engineering .
Third , there ’s a sort of guild mentality among magicians , holding that knowledge can be shared within the profession but must not be shared with the public .
This guild mentality can’t easily be implemented within current law – a trade secret must be carefully protected , and so cannot be passed around casually within a loosely defined “ community ” .
The result is that the guild protects its secrets through social norms .
You ’re accepted into the guild by demonstrating technical prowess and following the guild ’s norms over time ; and you ’ll be excommunicated if you violate the norms , for example by making a tell - all TV special about how popular tricks are done .
( There ’s an exception for casual magic tricks of the sort kids do . )
The system operates informally but effectively .
As a policy guy , I have to ask whether this system is good for society as a whole .
I can understand why those inside the profession would want to limit access to information – why help potential competitors ?
But does it really benefit society as a whole to have some unelected group deciding who gets access to certain kinds of information , and doing this outside the normal channels that ( at least in principle ) balance the interests of society against those of inventors ?
It ’s not an easy question .
( To be clear , asking whether something is good or bad for society is not the same as asking whether government should regulate it .
A case for regulation would require , at least , that the regulated behavior be bad for society and that there be a practically beneficial way for government to intervene . )
The best argument that magicians ’ guild secrecy benefits the public is that tricks are more valuable to the public if the public does n’t know how they are done .
This is almost never the case for other technologies – knowing how your iPod works does n’t make it less valuable to you – but it just might be true for magic , given that it exists for entertainment and you might enjoy it more if you do n’t know how it ’s done .
But I have my doubts that publishing information about tricks actually makes them less entertaining .
Goldin ’s patent on the saw - a - person - in - half trick – which explains pretty clearly how to do the trick – was issued in 1923 , but the trick is still a staple today .
In theory , anybody can read Goldin ’s patent whenever they want ; but in practice hardly anybody has read it , and we all enjoy the trick despite suspecting how it ’s probably done .
And do we really need to read Gaughan ’s patent to know how a “ levitating ” magician stays up in the air ?
Gaughan ’s cleverness is all about how to keep the audience from seeing the evidence of how it ’s done .
One effect of the guild ’s secrecy is that the public rarely learns who the great innovators are .
We know who puts on a good show , but we rarely know who invented the tricks .
The great innovators may be venerated within the profession , but they ’re unknown to the public .
One has to wonder whether the field would move faster , and be more innovative and entertaining , if it were more open .
The Conservative Soul : How We Lost It , How to Get It Back by Andrew Sullivan HarperCollins , 294 pp. , $ 25.95
Like so many parties that go on past their proper bedtime , Karl Rove ’s Republican Party has lately begun to break out in fights , as neocon theorists , Goldwater - style libertarians , the corporations , and grassroots Christian fundamentalists come to the aggravating discovery that they ’re more defined by their differences than by what they hold in common .
On climate change , government spending , stem - cell research , reproductive rights , and the Iraq war , to name just a few of the triggering issues , self - styled conservatives find themselves at loggerheads with other self - styled conservatives , each claiming the mantle of true conservatism for himself .
As both symptom and diagnosis of this interesting — one might say promising — development , Andrew Sullivan ’s The Conservative Soul is as engaging as it is provocative .
Sullivan is an odd duck .
Born in England in 1963 to an Irish immigrant family , he grew up in East Grinstead , a town long associated with a cho-leric , class - based brand of reactionary Toryism .
Whenever letters appeared in the Daily Telegraph demanding the return of the birch or the noose , the chances were good that they ’d be signed by Colonel Blimp ( retd. ) of East Grinstead , Sussex .
But that was never Sullivan ’s style of conservatism .
A beneficiary ( as I was ) of the 1944 Education Act , he passed the eleven - plus exam and went to Reigate Grammar School , where he became a “ teenage Thatcherite ” and sported a Reagan button in 1980 .
From there , he won a scholarship to Oxford , becoming the first member of his family to attend university .
He was elected president of the Oxford Union and , in 1983 , or so he has boasted , threw a champagne party to celebrate the arrival of Pershing II missiles in Britain .
An exemplary product of British meritocracy , he went on to Harvard , where he completed a Ph.D. with a dissertation on the British conservative thinker Michael Oakeshott .
Its title , “ Intimations Pursued : The Voice of Practice in the Conversation of Michael Oakeshott , ” played on the title of Oakeshott ’s 1959 essay “ The Voice of Poetry in the Conversation of Mankind . ”
As someone committed — almost , it seems , from the cradle — to minimal government , maximal personal liberty , and a “ strong anticommunist foreign policy , ” Sullivan ’s natural habitat was the United States .
In the 1990s he was the youngest - ever editor of The New Republic ; he is now a blogger , columnist , and ubiquitous guest on radio and cable TV talk shows , where he speaks in a peculiar creole , half English , half American , an accent from a region located somewhere on the sea floor of the Atlantic , midway between the Azores and Flemish Cap .
This highly idiosyncratic mongrel voice tells one something about the character of Sullivan ’s conservative journey , on which he has been , variously , Irish among the English , a scholarship boy among the sons and daughters of privilege , an Englishman among Americans , an HIV - positive gay man among right - wing homophobes , and a liberal Catholic among fundamentalists — good training for a chameleon , as for a combative gadfly , and Sullivan is both .
Along the …
Regardless of how you felt about its cliffhanger ending , there 's no denying that Halo 2 was a gigantic success that raised the bar for what we , as a game - playing society , expect out of a good console - based first - person shooter .
In the years that followed , plenty of games attempted to duplicate the Halo formula , with varying degrees of success .
But there 's still nothing quite like the genuine item .
Luckily for all involved , Halo 3 is a positively amazing package that offers extreme satisfaction across all of its different parts .
Maybe now you can finally retire your Halo 2 disc and really move into the next generation of games .
Halo 3 manages to feel familiar while also packing in a good amount of new material .
Halo 3 is an interesting mix of established protocol and intriguing new stuff .
For example , the gameplay does n't stray too far from Halo 2 , which , in turn , did n't exactly reinvent the original Halo .
Do n't take that as a negative , because it means that Halo 3 plays extremely well , with the same types of light tactical considerations that have made the series stand apart from other , faster - paced shooters .
The balance between your guns , your grenades , and your melee attack has always given
Halo a unique feel in the genre , and those same considerations apply today , both in the campaign mode and in multiplayer .
You 'll also have new weapons and items to consider , such as a host of Brute weapons .
One example is the spiker , which is an exciting automatic pistol that fires quickly and decimates opponents , especially if you 're holding a pair of them .
Another is the mauler , which is a one - handed shotgun that can level enemies up close .
You 'll even find weapons so huge that your movement speed slows when you carry them .
When you use these weapons , the camera pulls out to a third - person perspective so you can see your missile pod , plasma cannon , or flamethrower as it fires .
And then there 's the gravity hammer .
Originally shown in Halo 2 ( where it was n't usable by the player ) , the gravity hammer is a large melee weapon that will wipe out most regular enemies in one swipe .
Needless to say , it can be especially fun in multiplayer settings .
The end result is gameplay that feels wholly familiar without retreading the same ground too heavily .
The campaign is structured in much the same way as past Halo games , with multiple chapters and effective streaming that ensures you 'll see load times only between chapters .
There are also lengthy vehicle sequences to break up the on - foot action .
You 'll pilot the classic Halo vehicles , such as the Ghost , a hovering one - person craft that 's fast and deadly , and the Warthog , a dune buggy with a turret mounted in the back .
You 'll also see new vehicles , such as the Brute Prowler , which is a two - person vehicle with turrets .
Like in previous games , the vehicles are fun to use .
Also similar to previous games , the artificial intelligence can't drive very well , so if you 're playing alone , you 'll usually want to grab the steering wheel rather than the weapons .
The concept of " equipment " is new to the series .
These deployable special items have a variety of effects .
The most obvious example is the bubble shield :
You ( and your enemies ) can walk through it , but bullets and explosions bounce right off .
It 's especially entertaining when your enemies use it , given that you can just walk through and bash them with the butt of your gun .
You 'll also find items that make your shields regenerate more quickly , and others that drain enemy shields and stop their vehicles dead in their tracks .
These items also show up in multiplayer , where they 're a little more interesting .
Halo 2's ending was widely criticized for being too much of a cliffhanger and leaving you with no sense of progress or resolution whatsoever .
It 's good news , then , that Halo 3's story does n't suffer from that problem at all .
It opens immediately following the events of Halo 2 : The Covenant is on its way to Earth , continuing its religious zealotry and attempting to activate the floating space weapons known as Halos , which could destroy civilization as we know it .
The Master Chief and the other Earth forces of the UNSC are in hot pursuit to stop them , with newfound allies such as the Arbiter coming along for the ride .
We 'll spare you the specifics because they 're quite compelling and should be seen firsthand .
All you really need to know if you 're on the fence about Halo 3's campaign is that it's a delicate balancing act that manages to provide satisfying closure for the trilogy , make perfect sense of all the cryptic events in Halo 2 , and leave you filled with anticipation for more adventures set in the Halo universe .
Not bad for a game that will take most players between 10 and 15 hours to finish on one of four difficulty settings .
But you 'll probably go through the campaign more than once , thanks to the inclusion of a strong co-op mode .
Previous
Halo games have let two players go through the campaign ; Halo 3 ups that number to four players and lets you do the whole thing over Xbox Live , if you so choose .
This is a really fun way to experience the campaign 's nine chapters , and you can choose to go through them in any order , provided you 've already played through it alone .
Furthermore , this method of play ( which you can also do alone ) lets you turn on scoring in campaign mode , in which you earn points for kills and lose them for dying .
This adds a sense of competition to the co-op , and there are also achievements associated with finishing chapters with high point totals .
You can also customize the experience a bit by turning on a series of unlockable modifiers that open up as you collect hidden skulls .
The skulls are stashed around the game , and some of them do things such as increase the amount of damage you 'll need to deal to take an enemy down , remove the heads - up display and make your weapon invisible , and so on .
This gives the story - driven section of the game some more replay value , although it does n't get significantly more difficult as you scale up the number of players .
Consequently , finishing the game on legendary difficulty is a breeze if you 're rolling through with three experienced fellow triggermen .
You can earn the campaign achievements in co-op mode , which makes the legendary difficulty a lot easier to manage .
In addition to the four - player co-op action , you can also play competitive solo and team - based multiplayer matches with up to 16 players on 11 different maps .
There 's a lot of depth to the multiplayer modes , ranging from simple stuff such as deathmatch and team deathmatch ( still referred to as slayer and team slayer here ) , to more objective - based gameplay such as capture the flag .
Another similar mode is called territories , in which the two teams fight to defend or attack various control points around the map .
You 'll also find a mode called infection , where a percentage of the players start as sword - wielding zombies and must convert the members of the other team by killing them , until only one non-zombie remains .
Each of the maps can handle any of these game modes .
Like in Halo 2 , you can customize these game types , and there 's more to customize this time around .
You can change things like starting weapons , the weapons that appear on the map , whether the motion sensor is active , the force of gravity , the game speed , whether the players all have active camouflage or not , and much , much more .
The multiplayer is as strong as it has ever been thanks to the addition of new weapons and tweaks to old ones .
Swords have been made much more interesting this time around :
If two players run at one another with energy swords and attack at the same time , the swords clash and the players bounce off one another .
This makes all - swords matches totally wild .
The gravity hammer is also big fun in multiplayer matches , both because it crushes enemies that are foolish enough to get too close , and because you can smack incoming rockets to bat them away , which makes for an interesting game of baseball .
The weird thing about this last concept is that , with the addition of the Forge , you 'll actually be able to build some sort of crude baseball variant if you want .
Forge mode is a map editor , but not in the 3D modeling sense that you 're used to seeing in PC shooters .
You can't edit level geometry with Forge , but you can spawn , remove , and move objects and items around the level .
All of the editing is done in real time , and you can pop in and out of edit mode by pushing up on the D pad .
You can also play this mode with other players , letting everyone run around in edit mode to spawn Warthogs , rocket launchers , and whatever else is already on the map .
On the surface , that does n't sound so exciting .
But in practice , it 's a weird and potential - rich addition to the game because there are a ton of little secrets and tricks you can use to manipulate the objects in ways the developers may not have intended .
The Forge might not sound like much at first , but when you figure out how to play with it , it becomes one of the game 's most impressive features .
For example , take the fusion core .
It 's Halo 's version of the exploding barrel , and by default , it blows up when you shoot it or drop it from a significant height .
It also takes 30 seconds to respawn .
You can modify it to respawn every 10 seconds and , with help from another player 's rifle fire , you can coax it into respawning in midair , where it tumbles to the ground and explodes every 10 seconds .
Naturally , if you surround that spot with more stuff that explodes , you 'll have a fun little physics - based bomb that respawns and explodes every 10 seconds .
If you 've ever messed around with Garry 's Mod , a similar physics - based toolbox for Half - Life 2 , then you 'll recognize this as a simplified take on that idea when you start using it for more than simply adding a few weapons to a map or moving spawn points around .
Though many players probably wo n't get hooked on Forge tinkering , it 's an extremely powerful addition that may just take over your life .
You 'll be able to easily share your Forge creations with other players via a handy file - sharing system that lets you quickly send map configurations and gameplay types to your friends .
You can also set a certain number of items as publicly shared , and users can go to Bungie 's Web site to browse and rate the shared items .
Additionally , you can flag items for download on that Web page , and the next time you fire up Halo 3 , it'll download the items you 've marked .
It 's a very slick interface that makes moving stuff around very easy .
You can also use the file - sharing options to send screenshots and saved films .
Saved films are replays of action from any of the modes in the game , from campaign to multiplayer to Forge sessions .
The game automatically stores the last 25 or so sessions , and you can choose to save them more permanently from there .
Once you 've got them , you can edit them down to key kills , weird single - player behavior , or the strangest Forge stuff you can come up with , and then save them for sharing , just as you would with a map or game mode .
Much like Forge , the saved - films feature does n't really sound like much , but Halo 3 is a very replay - worthy game , and you 'll probably run into plenty of little moments that you 'll want to save for posterity .
Another nice touch is that the films are n't locked to one perspective .
You can detach the camera from your player and fly anywhere on the map , or change it to any other player 's view , as well .
The only real issue is that rewinding and fast - forwarding are a little clunky .
So if you 've got something you want to save that 's at the end of a 45 - minute session , you 'll have to hold down the fast - forward button for a long time to get to that moment , and if you miss it , rewinding can be a real pain , too .
Once you 've figured out the little idiosyncrasies of footage manipulation , it 's not so bad .
Halo has always had a very strong artistic vision , and the graphics have always been just good enough to convey the necessary imagery without becoming huge technical powerhouses .
That 's not to say that the game is n't technically impressive , because it maintains a smooth frame rate throughout , and looks very sharp overall with plenty of great lighting and other nice effects .
But the visual design overpowers its technical side and really stands out .
Given that the game takes place in a wider range of locales than the previous two games , you 'll see a lot of different , colorful environments , including deserts , snow , jungle settings , great - looking building interiors , and more .
The enemies , many of which are returning from past games , also look great .
The audiovisual portion of Halo 3 is definitely impressive , with great art , sharp effects , and terrific music .
The sound in Halo 3 is a good mix of old and new , much like the rest of the game .
You 'll hear the familiar Halo theme music and variants thereof .
You 'll also hear plenty of great new music , including one suspenseful track with a heartbeat - like sound that manages to get your heart pounding as well .
Most of the voice cast from Halo 2 returns to voice their respective characters , and they again turn in terrific and believable performances .
You 'll also hear a ton of combat dialogue , both from the marines that fight by your side as well as the enemies you 're fighting , who do n't seem to appreciate it when you kill one of their comrades .
Our favorite line from the Covenant was probably " You 've killed my brother for the last time , " which is pretty hilarious .
As games start to consider user - generated content , it 's becoming clear that more and more games will be ready to give you back just as much as you 're willing to put into them .
On the surface , Halo 3 is every bit the sequel you would expect it to be , in that it delivers meaningful upgrades to both the story - driven and competitive sides of the package .
However , it 's the addition of the Forge level editor and the saved films that give the game an even longer set of legs , legs that will probably keep you running at full speed until Bungie figures out where , exactly , to go from here .
