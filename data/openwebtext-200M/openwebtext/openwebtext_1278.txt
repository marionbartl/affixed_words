Windows 7 was released in October Malware has been blamed for a problem with the Windows 7 operating system , dubbed the ' Black Screen of Death ' .
Some Windows users are confronted by a totally black screen after they log on to their system .
Initially it was thought that Microsoft 's own security update could have caused the problem but that has now been ruled out .
The software firm that suggested the security update was the problem has apologised for its claims .
Reports suggest the problem also affects Windows Vista and XP .
In a blog posting on its security site , Microsoft said that it had investigated the claims and " found that our November Security Updates are not making changes to the system that these reports say are responsible for these issues " .
The firm said that the behaviour was associated with malware , such as Daonol , and that this was probably the root cause .
Software firm Prevx , who had said the November update may have been to blame , have since retracted their statement , saying it had been a " challenging issue " to identify the cause .
" Having narrowed down a specific trigger for this condition we 've done quite a bit of testing and re-testing on the recent Windows patches including KB976098 and KB915597 as referred to in our previous blog , " the firm wrote on its website .
" Since more specifically narrowing down the cause we have been able to exonerate these patches from being a contributory factor . "
Prevx apologised to Microsoft for " for any inconvenience " its earlier claims may have caused .
The firm has issued a fix for the problem , which it says could affect " millions " of computers .
" Users have resorted to reloading Windows as a last ditch effort to fix the problem , " the firm 's David Kennerley wrote in a blog post .
" We hope we can help a good many of you avoid the need to reload . "
Unknown problem
The firm said its fix did not work in all cases .
" There can be many causes , " said Mr Kennerley .
" But if your black screen woes began in the last two weeks ... or after running any security program ( including Prevx ) to remove malware during this time , then this fix will have a high probability of working . "
Mr Kennerly said the firm had identified " at least 10 different scenarios which will trigger the same black screen conditions " .
" These appear to have been around for years now , " he said .
The firm reports that the problem affects editions of Windows 7 , Vista , XP , NT , and Windows 2000 .
Microsoft said that people who are affected by the problem should contact its customer service line .
The " black screen of death " moniker is a play on the " blue screen of death " , which appears when Microsoft operating systems crash .

...[ Scientists ] have put the assumptions about innate temperament on firmer footing , and they have also demonstrated that some of us , like Baby 19 , are ... born predisposed to be anxious ...
...[ other scientists ] all have reached similar conclusions : that babies differ according to inborn temperament ...
Teenagers who were in the group at low risk for anxiety showed no increase in activity in the amygdala when they looked at the face , even if they had been told to focus on their own fear .
... In the high - risk kids , even those who were apparently calm in most settings , their amygdalas lighted up more than the others ' did .
Not every brain state sparks the same subjective experience ; one person might describe a hyperaroused brain in a negative way , as feeling anxious or tense , while another might enjoy the sensation and instead uses a positive word like " alert . "
The persona can be controlled , but the anima often cannot ...
Nathan Fox of the University of Maryland says that when the anima erupts in high - risk children , it often takes the form of excessive vigilance and misdirected attention .
In the first of his two longitudinal studies ...
The predictive power of an anxiety - prone temperament , such as it is , essentially works in just one direction : not by predicting what these children will become but by predicting what they will not .
In the longitudinal studies of anxiety , all you can say with confidence is that the high - reactive infants will not grow up to be exuberant , outgoing , bubbly or bold .
Still , while a Sylvia Plath almost certainly wo n't grow up to be a Bill Clinton , she can either grow up to be anxious and suicidal , or simply a poet .
THE head of the peak United Nations scientific body says he has not begun an investigation into the allegations of a scientific cover - up based on emails hacked from the University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit .
Speaking to an overflowing audience of scientists and media at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen , Rajendra Pachauri said the main issue was to find out who was behind the theft .
'' One can only surmise that those who carried this out have obviously done it with very clear intention to influence the process in Copenhagen , '' he said .
Dr Pachauri , flanked by the senior members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , defended the integrity of the scientific findings on climate change , backed the scientists under attack at East Anglia and warned the IPCC 's next report was likely to show grimmer news .
Last week he told the BBC the UN 's science body would '' look into ' ' the matter of the stolen emails .
But he told reporters in Copenhagen he had meant the IPCC would examine the affair to see whether the organisation needed to learn any lessons from it .

Episode of Hey Arnold !
Phoebe 's Little Problem Season 5 No. in series 94a Written by Michelle Lamoreaux
Steve Viksten Directed by
Christine Kolosov ( animation ) Tim Parsons ( storyboard ) Christine Kolosov ( animation ) Air date June 8 , 2004 Chronology Previous Next Family Man Grandpa 's Packard
Phoebe 's Little Problem is an episode in the Hey Arnold !
TV Series .
Synopsis
Phoebe gets embarrassed after she farts into a microphone in front of a huge audience .
Plot
Phoebe is given a Perfect Attendance award at P.S. 118 .
After eating the whole tin box of Arnold 's Grandma ’s homemade prune cookies on the bus to school , she accidentally " cuts the cheese " into a microphone while accepting her award .
Ironically , she vows never to return to school after facing such humiliation .
Mr. Simmons , Stinky , Rhonda , Arnold and Helga , among other offscreen classmates all try to cheer Phoebe up , but she feels even more embarrassed ever since Stinky said his poem 's last line which was ; " On account 'a y' farted . "
Eventually , Arnold tells
Phoebe that she had to face her problem head - on .
Taking Arnold 's advice , Phoebe gives a speech in the auditorium , acknowledging that she farted , but stating that she is not just " that girl who farted " , and that she is " much more than that . "
After Phoebe finishes her speech , Harold stands up and begins teasing her , and ends up laughing so hard that he wets his pants .
This incident takes the attention away from Phoebe and transfers it to Harold .
The episode ends with Phoebe smiling and leaning back in her seat , with the entire student body laughing at Harold when he runs out of the auditorium and him crying for his “ Mommy ” .
D- Wave chips could make searching much faster ( Image : Copyright © 2005 – 2008 D - Wave Systems Inc. )
Google ’s web services may be considered cutting edge , but they run in warehouses filled with conventional computers .
Now the search giant has revealed it is investigating the use of quantum computers to run its next generation of faster applications .
Writing on Google ’s research blog this week , Hartmut Neven , head of its image recognition team , reveals that the Californian firm has for three years been quietly developing a quantum computer that can identify particular objects in a database of stills or video .
Google has been doing this , Neven says , with D - Wave , a Canadian firm that has developed an on -chip array of quantum bits – or qubits – encoded in magnetically coupled superconducting loops .
Advertisement
The team set themselves the challenge of writing an algorithm for the chip that could learn to recognise cars in photos , and reported at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Vancouver , Canada , this week that they have succeeded .
Chasing cars
Using 20,000 photographs of street scenes , half of which contained cars and half of which did n’t , they trained the algorithm to recognise what cars look like by hand - labelling all the cars with boxes drawn around them .
After that training , the algorithm was set loose on a second set of 20,000 photos , again with half containing cars .
It sorted the images with cars from those without faster than an algorithm on a conventional computer could – faster than anything running in a Google data centre today , Neven says .
Classical computers use what is known as a von Neumann architecture , in which data is fetched from memory and processed according to rules defined in a program to generate results that are stored .
It is pretty much a sequential process , though multiple versions of it can run in parallel to speed things up a little .
Quantum computers , however , promise much faster processing , by exploiting the principle of quantum superposition : that a particle such as an ion , electron or photon can be in two different states at the same time .
While each basic “ bit ” of data in a conventional computer can be either a 1 or a 0 at any one time , a qubit can be both at once .
Quantum argument
D - Wave ’s Chimera chip launched to great media interest .
But there has been some dispute over whether it is actually a quantum computer , which Neven acknowledges .
“ It is not easy to demonstrate that a multi- qubit system such as the D - Wave chip exhibits the desired quantum behaviour , and physicists are still in the process of characterising it , ” he writes .
Google ’s quantum move is understandable , says Winfried Hensinger , reader in quantum , atomic and optical physics at the University of Sussex in Brighton , UK .
“ Quantum computing has the potential to make search problems much easier to solve – so it is no surprise that Google finds it extremely important to get involved in this emerging area , ” he says .
“ I expect more and more companies to pursue research in quantum computing due to its vast potential not only in search but also for a multiplicity of other problems , ” he adds .
However , he expects that while questions remain over the exact capabilities of D - Wave ’s hardware , future developments will centre on different hardware .
“ It is widely accepted that trapped ions are the most successful implementation of quantum technology . ”

The annual cost of flooding is rising in the US , the study says Reconnecting flood - plains to rivers will help reduce the risk of future flooding , suggest US scientists .
A study by US researchers said allowing these areas to be submerged during storms would reduce the risk of flood damage in nearby urban areas .
Pressure to build new homes has led to many flood - prone areas being developed .
Writing in Science , they said the risks of flooding were likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change and shifts in land use .
" We are advocating very large - scale shifts in land use , " said co-author Jeffrey Opperman , a member of The Nature Conservancy 's Global Freshwater Team .
" There is simply no way economically or politically that this could be accomplished by turning large areas of flood - plains into parks , " he told the Science podcast .
" What we are proposing in this paper is a way that this strategy can be compatible , and even supportive , with vibrant agricultural economies and private land ownership . "
Control infrastructure prevents high flows from entering floodplains , thus diminishing both natural flood storage capacity and the processes that sustain healthy riverside forests
Jeffrey Opperman ,
The Nature Conservancy For example , the authors explained , the flood season and growing season in California did not occur at the same time .
This meant that allowing the land to be submerged by floodwater would not result in a permanent loss of farmland or crops being destroyed .
In their paper , they said that man-made flood management systems , such as levees , also had an ecological impact .
" Control infrastructure prevents high flows from entering flood - plains , thus diminishing both natural flood storage capacity and the processes that sustain healthy riverside forests and wetlands , " they observed .
" As a result , flood - plains are among the planet 's most threatened ecosystems . "
' Ecosystem services '
The reconnection programmes would deliver three benefits , they added : • Reduce the risk of flooding •
Increase in flood - plain goods and services • Greater resilience to potential climate change impacts
In other parts of the world , Dr Opperman said that there was a range of agricultural strategies for private landowners that would be compatible with allowing areas to be flooded .
" There are emerging markets for ecosystem services , such as carbon sequestration and nutrient sequestration , " he explained .
" These are services that flood - plains do provide , so with various climate policies there will be a price for carbon . "
The researchers cited the Yolo By - pass , in California , US , in their paper as a successful demonstration of the idea they were advocating .
The scheme absorbed 80 % of floodwater during heavy storms , they said , protecting the nearby city of Sacramento .
" During a March 1986 flood , the by - pass conveyed [ about ] 12.5 bn cubic metres of water , more than three times the total flood - control storage volume in all Sacramento basin reservoirs .
" Without the by - pass flood - plain , California would need to build massive additional flood - control infrastructure , " they observed .
The Yolo by - pass was created back in the 1930s , when a 24,000 hectare flood - plain was reconnected to the Sacramento River .
The scheme was introduced when it became apparent that a " levees only " approach would not offer the required flood protection .
" It 's connected in an engineered way , which mean that when the river reaches a certain volume it flows over a weir and enters the flood - plain , " Dr Opperman explained .
He added that the scheme also had numerous additional ecological benefits : " In recent decades , people began to notice that this area was a phenomenal habitat for birds .
" In the past 10 years , people recognised that native fish were moving from the river on to the flood - plain , and deriving all of the benefits that fish get from natural flood - plains .
" It was an excellent place for fish to spawn , and for juvenile fish to be reared . "

The mobile browser has been in development for the last year and a half
The first mobile phone version of the popular web browser Firefox is " days away " from launch , the head of the project has told the BBC .
The browser , codenamed Fennec , will initially be available for Nokia 's N900 phone , followed by other handsets .
It is currently going through final testing and could be released before the end of the year , said Jay Sullivan at Mozilla , the group behind Firefox .
The open - source browser will be able to synchronise with the desktop version .
Apple is very restrictive .
It does n't allow other browsers
Jay Sullivan
Mozilla Software will mean that any web pages open in a user 's desktop browser will automatically open in the mobile version .
" At the end of the working day you can walk away from your computer and keep on going on your phone , " Mr Sullivan told the BBC .
" It encrypts all of the information and sends it back through the cloud between your desktop and mobile . "
He said that providing there were no " show stoppers " , the software could be available to download " within the year " .
Desktop success
The browser will be available to download from the Mozilla website and then offered in Nokia 's Ovi store , so that N900 owners can download the software .
The organisation is also developing versions for Microsoft 's Windows mobile and Google 's Android operating system .
Internet explorer is still the world 's most used desktop browser However , he said that it would be some time before iPhone users would be able to use the browser .
" Apple is very restrictive . " he said .
" As it 's a pretty closed platform we do n't see that happening soon . "
Apple only allows browsers based on its Webkit engine , which is used to power its Safari browser , to be loaded on to the iPhone .
Firefox uses alternative technology .
When it launches , Fennec will compete with browsers such as Opera , which is the most popular mobile browser according to analytics firm Stats Counter .
Safari , which comes bundled with the iPhone , is the second most popular , whilst Nokia 's own browser is third .
The mobile version of Firefox will hope to follow the success of its desktop browser .
Stats Counter has reported that the latest version of the Firefox browser has overtaken Internet Explorer 7 ( IE7 ) as the World 's most popular browser with 21.93 % of the market , compared with IE7's share of 21.2 % .
However , other firms suggest IE still has the lead on Firefox , whilst most agree that the various versions of Explorer combined still dominate the web browser market .
App craze Fennec has been in development for the last year and a half .
The new software has many of the features of the desktop version , such as tabbed browsing , and an address bar that doubles as a search box .
Opera is currently the most popular web mobile browser
However , the mobile version will also scale pages to fit the device and will support functions such as tapping the screen to zoom in on a page .
Mr Sullivan said it would also be the first mobile browser to have " add - ons " , small pieces of software that add functionality to the browser such as news readers or online games .
They can also be used to customise the look and feel of the browser .
" Because it is a browser for a mobile device , the add- ons will be different , " said Mr Sullivan .
" You 'll see ones that use geo-location and exploit how the device is tilted . "
The add - ons will add functionality to the phone that is currently offered by mobile apps .
These small specialist pieces of software have become increasingly popular .
For example , Apple now offer more than 100,000 apps in its store ranging from games and social networks to news readers and tools that allow people to use sites such as eBay or Amazon on the go .
Blackberry , Google , Nokia , Symbian and Microsoft all offer their own app stores .
However , he said that he did not think that the browser would completely replace these apps .
" They will co-exist , " he said .

That beautiful , sunny , smiling face belongs to Jessica Bucher , a twelve year old middle school student in Northern California .
At a time when most parents are worried about their twelve year old 's grades , or first forays with the opposite sex , or cell phone usage , Jessica 's parents have a much more urgent goal : keeping Jessica alive and pain - free .
Jessica Bucher was diagnosed with a rare disease that is almost always fatal : juvenile onset Sandhoff Disease .
Thankfully , Jessica has responded well to an experimental umbillical cord stem cell treatment , but not without saddling her parents with astronomic health care bills .
Those bills are now threatening their home to foreclosure .
It 's every parent 's Faustian nightmare : save your child and lose your home or save your home and watch your child die .
Jessica 's classmates have opted to run regular fundraisers to help offset these medical costs because we as a country offer no such safety net to the Buchers .
Likewise , Brian Holben of Chester , Virginia , has a similar dilemma and thankfully , a community willing to step in where the government wo n't :
Improve Your Game , a Richmond - based youth fitness and conditioning organization , will raise money for the Holben family with the first IYG Kid ’s Fitness Challenge , which will be held Dec. 12 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Sports Center of Richmond .
Brian Holben , who lives in Chester with his wife , Sheila , and their three sons , Zachary , Tanner and Nash , was diagnosed with a brain tumor during the summer .
Two of the family ’s sons play on baseball teams sponsored by IYG , which also offers fitness training for kids , said Charlene Frostick , who owns IYG with her husband , Joe. Brian Holben is responding well to treatment , but his recovery will be a long process and medical bills , which are not all covered by the family ’s insurance , will continue to mount , she said .
The stories grow exponentially .
PleaseCutTheCrap , from whom I read about Jessica and Brian , also mentions an uninsured Kansas teen who needs a heart transplant .
Or the attorney I spoke to last month , afraid to go to the doctors to confirm the diabetes diagnosis he suspects , because he 's sure he 'll be dropped from his insurance , like one of his colleagues .
At this point , he admits he 's controlling it with diet and careful monitoring of his glucose levels , but for how long will that work ?
This is America .
The " shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom - loving people everywhere " , but we can't offer our citizens something that every single other industrialized nation does : health care .
And why ?
Because Holy Joe would rather Jessica and Brian and the others die than give any little bit to the Democratic Party .
And even more obscenely , the White House and the Senate leadership are okay with that , willing to capitulate to the resident tantrum thrower for the sake of passing a bill , no matter how it actually affects Americans .
What can Holy Joe say to the Buchers ?
How can Harry Reid and Rahm Emanuel face the Holbens ?
How can they justify mandates to that attorney when the insurance companies get all the benefits and little restrictions ?
Joe Lieberman thinks nothing of damning Jessica Bucher and her parents to the hell of that existence of choosing between pain now or pain later .
Worse , the Democratic leadership in both the White House and the Senate is letting him get away with it .
' Legendary ' soldier who defused 64 Taliban bombs ... only to be killed by the 65th , on his last day
An army bomb disposal expert who saved countless lives in Afghanistan was killed on his final mission in the warzone .
Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid , 30 , died instantly when a roadside bomb he was trying to disarm blew up .
The Improvised Explosive Devices are the favoured weapon of the Taliban and since June Sergeant Schmid had successfully dealt with 64 of them .
Legendary figure : Olaf Schmid was renowned for his expertise in disarming explosive devices .
Colleagues described him as an inspiration
Senior military officers described the Royal Logistics Corps warrior as a ' legend ' who ' stared death in the face on a daily basis ' .
He was on his last operational day of a five - month stint when he lost his life .
He was due to fly home for a two - week break with his family this Saturday before returning to Afghanistan for a final month .
Offering a chilling insight into the mortal dangers he faced , Sergeant Schmid - nicknamed ' Oz ' - told ITN News before he deployed of the gruelling ' mental , emotional and physical challenge ' of disarming bombs .
His devastated wife Christina said last night she felt overwhelming grief but ' took comfort ' in knowing that her husband had saved dozens of lives .
Sergeant Schmid - described by officers as a man of extreme courage - was killed near Sangin in the notorious badlands of Helmand Province on Saturday .
He had been commanding a team who were tackling a roadside explosive when it blew up .
One of the Army 's busiest bomb disposal experts , he had made safe one in every 19 IEDs found by British troops this year since his tour in Afghanistan began in June .
In one 24 - hour operation to clear one of the most dangerous routes in Afghanistan , nicknamed the Pharmacy Road , he found 31 roadside bombs .
Bomb disposal experts get rid of a Taliban IED using a controlled explosion in southern Afghanistan
His expertise was also vital in Operation Panther 's Claw , an offensive to smash Taliban strongholds ahead of the flawed presidential elections .
Sergeant Schmid was born in Cornwall and lived in Winchester , Hampshire , with Christina and his five - year - old stepson Laird .
Christina said : ' Oz was a phenomenal husband and loving father who was cruelly murdered on his last day of a relentless tour .
He was my best friend and soulmate .
The pain of losing him is overwhelming .
' I take comfort knowing he saved countless lives with his hard work . '
His father - in - law John Avis , 64 , of Eastleigh , Hampshire , said : ' He was extremely brave .
I think he was quite apprehensive about what he had to do .
We all knew it was possible that he would not come back because of the danger of his job but he faced it with extraordinary courage . '
Sergeant Schmid was the 224th British serviceman to die since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 .
He is the third IED disposal soldier to be killed in the last year after Taliban fighters stepped up their use of the roadside bombs .
Lieutenant Colonel Rob Thomson , commanding officer of 2 Rifles Battle Group , which was based around Sangin , said : ' Oz Schmid was simply the bravest and most courageous man I have ever met .
' He saved lives time after time .
Superlatives do not do the man justice .
He was better than the best of the best . '
Lieutenant Colonel Gareth Bex , commanding officer of the counter - IED task force , said : ' The tag " legend " is frequently bestowed nowadays but in his case it is rightly justified .
' His courage was not displayed in a fleeting moment of time ; he stared death in the face on a daily basis .
Many soldiers and ordinary Afghans owe their lives to his gallant actions . '
Staff Sergeant Shaun Marsh , a Royal Engineer Search Advisor , a member of a team which works hand - in - hand with bomb disposal experts , said : ' Oz was an inspiration to the team ; full of knowledge and mostly his bubbly charisma and sense of humour . '
Major Tim Gould , officer commanding the Joint Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group , said : ' In all my time in the Army , I have never met , nor am I ever likely to meet , a man like Sergeant Schmid again .
He truly was a once in a generation phenomenon . '
Sergeant Schmid joined the Army in 1996 and progressed through the ranks .
He qualified as a high - threat IED disposal expert earlier this year which allowed him to operate in Afghanistan , sometimes alongside special forces .
Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said the soldier 's ' bravery , skill and selfless commitment undoubtedly saved lives ' .
● Troops have not been able to train on Mastiff armoured vehicles until they reach Afghanistan , the Tories claimed last night .
Shortages at home mean many soldiers cannot familiarise themselves with the trucks until they reach the warzone , said Tory defence spokesman Gerald Howarth .
Mastiffs are designed to provide better protection against IEDs .
He raised the issue during defence questions in the Commons but Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell said the ' priority ' was getting the Mastiffs to the battlefield .
Plowing through more than 50 proposed changes to its draft medical marijuana ordinance , the council also signaled that it would probably cap the total number of dispensaries at between 70 and 200 .
By the close of the daylong session , the council had made substantial headway on an issue that has bedeviled it for years .
With a judge 's recent ruling that the city 's moratorium on dispensaries was invalid , the city has almost no control over the hundreds that have opened .
The council , which avoided the word " sales " on the advice of its lawyers , decided that Los Angeles would allow " cash contributions , reimbursements and compensations " as long as they comply with state law .
Council President Eric Garcetti stepped in to negotiate the provision after an extended discussion .
" We have some very elegant and flexible language that will adjust as state law is defined , " he said .
City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich and Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley had urged the council to explicitly ban the sale of marijuana .
William Carter , the chief deputy city attorney , said his office was following state law and recent court decisions , which led to the conclusion that collectives could only cultivate marijuana , not sell it .
" Until they change the law , what we 're stuck with is this collective model , not the drive - through Starbucks model , " he said .
Several members harshly criticized the city attorney 's office .
Councilman Ed Reyes , who oversaw the effort to write an ordinance , accused the office of pressing " a political point of view that has nothing to do with objective advice , " while Councilman Paul Koretz , who helped write the state law as an assemblyman , said : " I think we 're getting advice from one direction . "
Council members expressed a clear interest in caps , most likely distributed among the city 's 21 police divisions .
The council , though , remains unsure whether to give preference to the 186 dispensaries that registered with the city when the moratorium was adopted in 2007 .
Councilman Richard Alarcon said he saw nothing " magic " in the number , while Councilwoman Janice Hahn said it would be " fair and reasonable " to favor those who had followed the law .
The council rejected an amendment from Koretz and Reyes that would have required the police to get a court order to review the records kept by dispensaries .
Councilman Jose Huizar and several other members objected vociferously to the proposal , saying that they feared it would undermine efforts to try to cull bad dispensaries .
The city attorney 's office and the Police Department , noting that other cities have similar requirements , argued that ready access to the records was essential to determine whether the collectives were following the law .
" An inspection is problematic if you create too many limits on it , " LAPD Cmdr .
Pat Gannon said .
The council asked city officials to draft language to ensure that police have no access to patient medical records .
The council also had a heated discussion about whether to eliminate the ordinance 's requirement that collectives possess no more than five pounds of marijuana and grow it on - site .
Huizar argued against the change .
" We are encouraging a black market , " he said .
" This is a dangerous path . "
Exasperated , Reyes shot back that the current restriction would not work .
" I 'm not advocating for the black market , gangs , cartels to take advantage of this , " he said , " But we can't choke it to the point where it does not function . "
Reyes then withdrew his amendment and asked Huizar to come up with an alternative .
The council also approved an amendment to limit operators to one dispensary and an amendment to limit patients and caregivers to membership in one collective , but allow for emergency purchases .
The restriction on membership drew protests from medical marijuana advocates .
" If you go to your favorite dispensary , and they 're out of what you need , you have to go someplace else , " said Degé Coutee , the head of a patient group .
The council readily adopted a series of amendments , most of them offered by Koretz and borrowed from West Hollywood , that added more protections for neighborhoods .
Dispensaries would be required to have unarmed security guards who would patrol a two - block area , to provide a contact name to police and residents who live within 500 feet , and to deposit cash once a day .
The council also called on the state attorney general to clear up the confusion over whether state law allows the sale of marijuana .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown issued guidelines on medical marijuana last year , but several court decisions since then have raised questions about his conclusion that properly operated nonprofit dispensaries may be legal .
Brown 's interpretation came up several times as the city attorney 's office , council members and some speakers cited a local radio announcer 's report that the attorney general had said all sales were illegal .
A spokesman for Brown said the report was inaccurate and Brown has not changed his position .
The council also tangled over an amendment to put a $ 100,000 cap on salaries at dispensaries .
It was offered by Alarcon , who said the dispensary downstairs from his office was making $ 12,000 a day .
" That 's a lot of money , " he said .
" That 's too much money . "
The council decided to try to find another way to limit salaries , such as applying standards set by United Way .

Does the latest generation of energy - saving light bulbs save energy ?
A comprehensive study conducted by Osram , the German lighting company , provides evidence that they do .
While that may seem self - evident , until the release of the report on Monday the answer remained unclear .
That is because no one knew if the production of LED lamps required more energy than needed for standard incandescent bulbs .
While it is indisputable that LEDs use a fraction of the electricity of a regular bulb to create the same amount of light , if more energy were used in the manufacturing and distribution process , then the lighting industry could be traveling down a technological dead end .
The study results show that over the entire life of the bulb  from manufacturing to disposal  the energy used for incandescent bulbs is almost five times that used for compact fluorescents and LED lamps .
Please note that this article uses the older version of the Robot API .
A newer release ( version 2.0 ) of the Robot API is out and is recommended by Google .
An updated article that uses the new Robot API version 2.0 is published here .
Welcome to Episode 7 of this series .
Hope that the series has been interesting for you so far .
In this episode , we plan to jump onto the Google Wave bandwagon .
Google Wave , as you must have heard is a collaborative messaging platform from Google .
A Wave is a collaboration between several participants ( humans and non-humans ) using threaded conversations / documents / gadgets to achieve their task .
The task could be as simple as chatting among themselves to figure out where to dine tonight to as complex as achieving a Return Order process between a purchaser and seller .
I will not delve into the specifics of Google Wave and will assume that you have a high level idea of what it is .
In fact , a great online book has just been released that covers Google Wave in depth .
I strongly recommend you to read it if you want to look into Google Wave in detail .
The book is named The Complete Guide to Google Wave and you can read it here .
What does this episode cover ?
In this episode , we are going to look at how you can write a Google Wave Robot using the Google plugin in Eclipse .
We will then deploy it and host this robot in the Google App Engine cloud .
This Robot is then live and can be added to any Wave and participate in the conversation .
It helps to see the final result before we start out .
Even if you do not understand whats going on , just bear with me .
So here is the screenshot :
Let us dissect this screen and in the process , I can hopefully explain to you some Google Wave terminology in a straightforward manner without too many details .
The main points are :
1 . What you see in the screen above is a Google Wave that me ( the person with the photo created ) .
A Wave is a collaboration between one or more participants ( human or Robots ) .
2 . Since we need participants to make it meaningful , you can add one or more of them .
All you need to do is click the + sign that you see on the top .
And you can add one or more participants who are also signed up for Wave .
In this case , my Robot GAEJ Application is hosted at http://gaejrobot.appspot.com and so I can add gaejrobot@appspot.com as a participant .
3 . On adding the Robot participant , Google wave system pulls up its profile ( image , etc ) and adds it as a participant in the Wave that I created .
4 . The Robot can receive events and it can respond to them .
We shall see how to write them later ( source code ! ! ) , but at this point it is enough to understand that the Robot can choose what events to listen to as the Wave collaboration happens and it can then react to them .
So in the case of my GAEJ Robot , I have specified that I am interested in knowing when participants come and leave the Wave and when someone has submitted a message .
5 . So you can see that the GAEJ Robot was notified when it was added to the Wave , so in response to that it printed out the message “ Hi ! Your GAEJExperiments Bot ….. ” at the bottom .
Similarly , when I finished typing the message ( Hello GAEJ Robot ) , the GAEJ Robot got notified .
It then took the message and along with some metadata like ID and Creator Name , it simpy echoed back what I typed .
Hope this makes things clear .
But a few more terms first : Wave , Wavelet and Blip .
Let me keep it simple .
In the above example , the Wave was the entire container .
A Wave consists of one or more Wavelets .
A Wavelet can be thought of as a threaded conversation that can go on within the wave ( both public and private ) .
And each Wavelet consists of one or more messages known as a Blip .
A Blip is the actual message that was typed and submitted by the user .
So when I typed “ Hello GAEJ Robot ” above , it was a Blip .
I have simplified things a bit here but even if things are not clear at this point , do not worry .
Once you get your code working , things will fall in place .
A final note above Google Wave Extensions .
Extensions are the mechanism by which you can extend Google Wave by adding your own creations .
Extensions are of two types : Gadgets and Robots .
Gadgets are like mini-applications that run within the Google Wave client .
They can be typically thought of as a UI which several participants can share at the same time .
A Robot is a full blown participant in the Wave .
It can be aware of most things happening in the Wave by subscribing to Events .
It also has a lot of potential to modify things in the Wave like messages , etc .
This article focuses on writing a Robot .
If you are interested in a good summary of Google Wave Extensions and some key differences between a Gadget and a Robot , read it here .
OK , so enough of theory .
Let us get down to coding .
If you are new to developing with the Google Plugin for Eclipse , please read the earlier episodes to setup your environment ( Episode 1 and Episode 5 )
Create a New Project
We need to create a New Project first .
Follow the steps below :
1. Either click on File –> New –>
Other or press Ctrl - N to create a new project .
Select Google and then Web Application project .
Alternately you could also click on the New Web Application Project Toolbar icon as part of the Google Eclipse plugin .
2 . In the New Web Application Project dialog , deselect the Use Google Web Toolkit and give a name to your project .
I have named mine MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot and I suggest you go with the same name so that things are consistent with the rest of the article .
The Screenshot is shown below :
3. Click on Finish .
This will generate the project and also create a sample Hello World Servlet for you .
But we will be writing our own Servlet .
So I suggest that you can delete the Servlet Java class and the mappings made in the web.xml or you can leave it for now since we are going to write our own .
The directory structure for your project should now look like this .
Adding Google Wave Robot JAR files to your Project Path
Since we are going to be writing a Wave Robot , we need some additional files on the client side .
These additional files ( JAR files ) are required for the additional Wave API ’s and also for deployment in your WEB - INF \lib folder , so that they are correctly deployed and available to the run-time engine .
These JAR files do not ship along with the Google Eclipse plugin , so you will need to download them for a website .
The Google code website for the JAR files is :
http://code.google.com/p/wave-robot-java-client/downloads/list
The web page when you navigate to the above URL is shown below :
Download all the above files to your machine .
Once you have downloaded the files , follow these steps to setup your Project Build Path and runtime correctly .
1. Copy all the 4 JAR files to the WEB - INF \lib folder of your Eclipse Project .
After copying you should see the files as shown in the project hierarchy below :
2. Right - click on the Project in the Project Hierarchy .
Select Properties and then Java Build Path .
Click on Add JARs and then select the 4 JAR files from your Project WEB - INF \lib folder as shown below and click on OK .
3. Your Project Build Path should like the screenshot below .
Click on OK to proceed .
This completes your Build Path setup with the Google Wave Robot JAR files .
Writing the Google Wave Robot Servlet : MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot.java
Let us first create our Robot Java class .
The steps are straightforward and given below .
All we need to do is write our class that extends the com.google.wave.api.AbstractRobotServlet class and provide an implementation for the processEvents method .
Follow these steps :
1. Create a new Java class within the same package .
The New Java Class dialog is shown below .
I have named the class MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot as shown below .
Click on the Browse button to select a Super Class .
2 . In the Superclass Selection dialog shown below , type the word AbstractRobot ( some part of it is also OK as the screenshot shows below ) in the Choose a type field as shown .
This will bring up the correct Matching items i.e. com.google.wave.api.AbstractRobotServlet .
Click on OK
This will generate the code as shown below in your Eclipse IDE .
Simply overwrite it with the code shown below :
package com.gaejexperiments.waverobot ; import com.google.wave.api.AbstractRobotServlet ; import com.google.wave.api.Blip ; import com.google.wave.api.Event ; import com.google.wave.api.EventType ; import com.google.wave.api.RobotMessageBundle ; import com.google.wave.api.TextView ; import com.google.wave.api.Wavelet ; public class MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot extends AbstractRobotServlet { @ Override public void processEvents ( RobotMessageBundle bundle ) { Wavelet wavelet = bundle.getWavelet ( ) ; if ( bundle.wasSelfAdded ( ) ) { Blip blip = wavelet.appendBlip( ) ; TextView textView = blip.getDocument ( ) ; textView.append ( " Hi !
Your GAEJExperiments
Bot is waiting for your command ... " ) ; } for ( Event e : bundle.getEvents ( ) ) { if ( e.getType ( ) == EventType.BLIP_SUBMITTED ) { // Get the Blip that was submitted Blip blip = e.getBlip ( ) ; // Extract out MetaData information like ID and the creator of the Blip String strBlipMetaData = " Blip Id : " + blip.getBlipId( ) + " , " + " Blip Creator : " + blip.getCreator ( ) ; // Extract out the text that was entered in the blip String strBlipText =
" You typed : " + blip.getDocument().getText ( ) ; // Echo that out by creating a child within the submitted blip blip.createChild() .getDocument() .append(strBlipMetaData + " \r
" + strBlipText ) ; } } } }
Let us discuss the main points of the source code :
1. A Robot class needs to extend the com.google.wave.api.AbstractRobotServlet class
2 . The only method that you need to implement to get going is the processEvents ( ) method as shown above in the code .
In this method , all we need to do is process the Events that we are interested in and take some action .
3 . What we want our Robot to do is to announce itself to everyone when it is added to the Wave .
This event is also pumped into the processEvents method but the API provides us a nice convenient method to detect if we have been added to the Wave via the bundle .
wasSelfAdded ( ) method .
The code snippet is shown below :
public void processEvents ( RobotMessageBundle bundle ) { Wavelet wavelet = bundle.getWavelet ( ) ; if ( bundle.wasSelfAdded ( ) ) { Blip blip = wavelet.appendBlip( ) ; TextView textView = blip.getDocument ( ) ; textView.append ( " Hi !
Your GAEJExperiments
Bot is waiting for your command ... " ) ; } //... Rest of processEvents method }
So the first thing we are doing is determining if we ( i.e. the Robot has been added to the Wave .
If yes , we need to add a message to the Wavelet ( Threaded Conversation ) .
Remember a message is known as a Blip .
So we append a new Blip to the current wavelet .
And now we need to set the message text for the Blip .
To do that , we need to get the handle to a TextView for the Blip and then we append our Text to it .
As simple as that .
4 . Then we have the main Events loop in which we navigate through the events that are pumped into the loop by the Google Wave system .
The code snippet is shown below :
for ( Event e : bundle.getEvents ( ) ) { if ( e.getType ( ) == EventType.BLIP_SUBMITTED ) { // Get the Blip that was submitted Blip blip = e.getBlip ( ) ; // Extract out MetaData information like ID and the creator of the Blip String strBlipMetaData = " Blip Id : " + blip.getBlipId( ) + " , " + " Blip Creator : " + blip.getCreator ( ) ; // Extract out the text that was entered in the blip String strBlipText =
" You typed : " + blip.getDocument().getText ( ) ; // Echo that out by creating a child within the submitted blip blip.createChild().getDocument() .append(strBlipMetaData + " \r
" + strBlipText ) ; } }
If the EventType is BLIP_SUBMITTED i.e. someone has submitted a message , then we first get the handle to the Blip .
The Blip is not just the Text but a lot of other useful metadata .
I simply demonstrate here two kinds of information about the blip , a BlipId and a Blip Creator .
The blip creator is the name of the participant that created this blip .
Then as we saw , we get to the Text of the Blip , by getting a handle on the getDocument ( ) and then the getText ( ) method .
This gives us the text that was typed by the creator of the Blip .
Finally , I insert a child Blip inside the Blip so that it looks like a response to that blip within the Google Wave .
The response is nothing but a text appended with the metadata extracted and the echoing of the text that the creator typed .
Using this boiler plate of code , you can do your own thing .
You could interpret commands given in a Blip by anyone and execute them and append the responses to their Blip .
You could look up data on Amazon or any other web site if given the ISBN .
The possibilities are limitless if you wish to modify the above code and make your Robot do something else .
That is all to writing a Robot but we still have some configuration to do to let Google Wave know that we have a Robot running in our GAEJ Application .
And we will do that through the standard servlet entries in the web.xml file along with new XML configuration file that you need for the Robot called the capabilities .xml file .
Configuring the Robot Servlet
We need to add the Robot Servlet < servlet / > and < servlet - mapping /> entry to the web.xml file .
This file is present in the WEB - INF folder of the project .
The necessary fragment to be added to your web.xml file are shown below .
< servlet > < servlet-name>MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot</ servlet - name > < servlet-class>com.gaejexperiments.waverobot.MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot</servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet-name>MyFirstGoogleWaveRobot</ servlet- name > <url - pattern>/_wave/robot/jsonrpc</url-pattern> </servlet - mapping >
In the above fragment , you will note that url - pattern / _wave / robot / jsonrpc has to be mapped to the Robot Servlet that you have written .
This is because the Google Wave system will invoke this url to communicate with your Robot using its protocol .
Creating the Robot capabilities.xml files
We need an additional file to describe the capabilities of the Robot that we have written .
This file is called the capabilities .xml and it needs to reside in a certain location .
You need to create a _wave directory inside of the war directory of your project .
The location of this file is shown below under the war / _wave directory .
You will need to create the _wave directory and create the capabilities .xml file over there .
The capabilities file shown below is pretty straightforward .
Two items are of interest .
One is the a < capability > element for each EVENT that you wish your Robot get notified about .
If you go back to the Source code of our Robot , you will notice that we were primarily interested in two events :
1. BLIP_SUBMITTED : Take a look at the source code .
You will find that we checked for this event in our Events Loop and once a Blip ( Message ) was available , we extracted information and sent back a child Blip .
2. WAVELET_PARTICIPANTS_CHANGED :
Take a look at the source code .
This event was fired and we used a convenience method called bundle .
wasSelfAdded ( ) to find if we were added .
In fact , you can put in an if else clause and catch this event in the Events loop too to get notified whenever anyone joins or leaves the Wave .
Now that it is clear that we need these two events , we subscribe to them by specifying the events in the capabilities .xml document .
Any other events ( Look at the com.google.wave.api.EventType class ) that you are interested in should be mentioned here , otherwise your robot will not get notified about them .
The other element is the < version > element .
If you change any capabilities in your robot , then it is recommended that before you deploy , you change the version value over here , so that Google Wave can detect that there is a newer version and hence it can then query for your modified capabilities if any .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < w:robot xmlns:w= " http://wave.google.com/extensions/robots/1.0 " > < w:capabilities > < w : capability name = " WAVELET_PARTICIPANTS_CHANGED
" content =" true " /> < w: capability name= " BLIP_SUBMITTED " content =" true " /> </w:capabilities > <w:version>1</w:version > </w:robot >
Writing our Robot Profile Servlet ( not required but nice )
This is not a required step but it would be good practice to do so to make your Robot look more professional .
A Profile Servlet is used to tell the following about your Robot :
1. A Name for your Robot
2 . A custom image for your Robot
3 . A profile page for your Robot ( a URL )
If you provide these , then the Google Wave client is able to retrieve them and set it for your Robot when it is added as a participant .
This makes the Robot look more professional .
This profile information needs to be provided by you by writing a Profile Servlet .
The Profile Servlet is nothing but extending the com.google.wave.api.ProfileServlet class and providing simple implementations for the overwritten methods .
Follow these steps to write the Profile Servlet :
1. Create a new Java class within the same package .
The New Java Class dialog is shown below .
I have named the class GAEJRobotProfileServlet as shown below .
Click on the Browse button to select a Super Class .
2 . In the Superclass Selection dialog shown below , type the word ProfileServlet in the Choose a type field as shown .
This will bring up the correct Matching items i.e. com.google.wave.api.ProfileServlet class .
Click on OK .
3 . This will generate a GAEJRobotProfileServlet.java file .
The simplest way to generate the stubs for the required methods would be to go to Source –> Override / Implement Methods .
This will bring up the dialog box as shown below and you only need to select the 3 methods to override as shown :
Click on OK .
This will generate the stubs , which you can then overwrite with the code shown below .
The code is easy to understand , all we are doing is providing values for the Name , Avatar ( Image ) and the Profile Page URL .
Note that for the Avatar , we are providing a file myimage . jpg present in the WAR / _wave folder .
You will need to copy an appropriate image file for yourself and make sure that it is physically copied to the folder locally in your Eclipse project before you deploy your application .
You should also replace the word gaejerobot in the source code below with your Application ID .
package com.gaejexperiments.waverobot ; import com.google.wave.api.ProfileServlet ; public class GAEJRobotProfileServlet extends ProfileServlet { @ Override public String getRobotAvatarUrl ( ) { return " http://gaejrobot.appspot.com/_wave/myimage.jpg " ; } @ Override public String getRobotName ( ) { return " GAEJ Robot " ; } @ Override public String getRobotProfilePageUrl( ) { return " http://gaejrobot.appspot.com " ; } }
Configuring the Profile Servlet
We need to add the Profile Servlet < servlet / > and < servlet - mapping /> entry to the web.xml file .
This file is present in the WEB - INF folder of the project .
The necessary fragment to be added to your web.xml file are shown below .
< servlet - name > GAEJRobotProfileServlet</servlet-name > < servlet-class>com.gaejexperiments.waverobot.GAEJRobotProfileServlet</servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet- name > GAEJRobotProfileServlet</servlet-name > <url - pattern>/_wave/robot/profile</url-pattern> </servlet - mapping >
In the above fragment , you will note that url - pattern / _wave / robot / profile has to be mapped to the Profile Servlet that you have written .
This is because the Google Wave system will invoke this url to get hold of your profile .
Deploying the Application
To deploy the application , you will need to first create your Application ID .
The Application Identifier can be created by logging in at http://appengine.google.com with your Google Account .
You will see a list of application identifiers already registered under your account ( or none if you are just getting started ) .
To create a new Application , click on the Create Application button and provide the Application Identifier as requested .
Please note this name down since you will be using it for deployment .
For e.g .
I have registered an application identifier named gaejrobot .
To deploy the application , follow these steps ( they should be familiar to you now ) :
Click on the Deploy Icon in the Toolbar .
In the Deploy dialog , provide your Email and Password .
Do not click on Deploy button yet .
Click on the App Engine Project settings link .
This will lead you to a dialog , where you need to enter your Application ID [ For e.g. my Application Identifier gaejrobot ] Click on OK .
You will be lead back to the previous screen , where you can click on the Deploy button .
This will start deploying your application to the GAEJ cloud .
You should see several messages in the Console window as the application is being deployed .
Finally , you should see the message “ Deployment completed successfully ” .
GAEJ Robot in Action
Your application is going to be available at the http://yourapplicationid.appspot.com.
In my case , the application is available at http://gaejrobot.appspot.com.
You can test for the presence of your robot capabilities file by simply typing in the following :
http://yourapplicationid.appspot.com/_wave/capabilities.xml
[ Replace yourapplicationid with the Application ID that you have ]
For e.g. when I navigate to the following url ( http://gaejrobot.appspot.com/_wave/capabilities.xml) for my robot application , I get the capabilities xml as shown below , which means that the robot is ready and serving if all is right .
< w:robot > < w: capabilities > < w : capability name = " WAVELET_PARTICIPANTS_CHANGED
" content =" true " /> < w: capability name = " BLIP_SUBMITTED " content = " true " /> </w:capabilities > <w:version>1</w:version > </w:robot >
To test out the Robot , you need to launch the Google Wave client and login in with your account by going to http://wave.google.com.
On successful login , you will be inside the Wave client from where you can create a new wave by clicking on the New Wave link as shown below :
When you do that , currently you are the only participant ( myself ) as shown in the screen below :
Click on the + sign next to your icon and you can add one or more participants as shown below :
NOTE : Your Google Wave Robot is going to be available at < YOURAPPLICATIONID>@appspot.com , hence I have added gaejrobot@appspot.com as that was my application id .
But you can replace it with your application id .
If all goes well , you will see your Robot added as a participant ( with the icon and all , since the Profile Servlet is invoked behind the scenes by the Google Wave system ) .
Since the Robot got added , it received a WAVELET_SELF_ADDED
Event and since we had coded our Robot Servlet to receive that event and print out the greeting message , you see the message saying “ Hi ! Your GAEJExperiments Bot ….. ” .
The message is shown twice at this point since there is some bug in the Google Wave system at this point in time but if it does not seem to go away , you can ignore this event and still continue to process the BLIP_SUBMITTED event .
( This issue has been fixed by Google now , at least it seems to be working fine for me )
Next I start typing a message “ Hello GAEJ Robot ” as shown below .
But note that I have still not pressed the Done button .
Till the Done button is pressed , the BLIP_SUBMITTED is not fired .
Once I click on the Done button , the BLIP_SUBMITTED event is fired and our Robot Servlet gets the event .
On receiving the event , it simply prints out some metadata and echoes back the messag
That is all there is to writing a Google Wave Robot .
The example here is not useful as such but the intent of the article is to make sure you get your Robot running and have the right setup in place .
Several examples are available over the web in which talented programmers are writing Robots that do clever stuff .
Just look around and get inspired .
Going back in Time
In Episode 2 of this series , we discussed how to write a XMPP
Bot that you could add as a friend in XMPP Chat clients like Google Talk , Spark , etc .
That bot is not ready to be added to a Google Wave since it does not implement the end - points that are discussed here i.e.
/ _wave/robot/ jsonrpc , etc .
So all you will need to do is to follow the steps outlined here and provide these Servlet implementations along with the end - points and capabilities file .
Just add them to your previous project and redeploy your Google App Engine application .
You should then have a Bot that is both XMPP compliant and also Google Wave compliant .
Parting notes
Google has posted some excellent documentation on Wave extensions over here and I recommend them to be read .
Key among them is the design aspects about the extensions which are covered here .
It is important to add a parting note that Google Wave is about collaboration .
Collaboration is a process in which participants join each other and engage in doing something .
And if your Robot is to participate in a collaboration then you need to think out well in advance how it will collaborate with the other participants and how it can add value to the process .
It has to do something that brings meaning and utility to the collaboration .
Of course one can write a fun Robot or a pretty much useless Robot that I have demonstrated here , but the key thing to take away is the immense power that a Robot could play in a collaborative process .
Imagine a Robot querying a backend system and fetching a Purchase Order or an Order just placed at a website .
Think of a recruiter asking a Robot to pull up interview slots from a backend system and then presenting that to the candidate to choose .
The possibilities are endless and it should be an exciting journey ahead to see the Robots that people come up with .
Till the next episode …as the Skipper of the Penguins in the great Madagascar movie said , “ Just Smile & Wave , Boys . …. Smile & Wave !! ”
P.S :
1. Google Wave has been thrown open to a lot of developers and I hope that you have received an invite already .
In case you do not , I still have a few invites to give away .
Just write an email to me and I shall send across the invite .
First come , First served .
2. ( Update : 5 - Nov-09 ) :
The issue of the Blip message “ Hi ! Your GAEJ Experiments
Bot is waiting ….. ” arrival message appearing twice has been fixed by Google .
So you should no longer see that message appearing twice .
2 . In the Superclass Selection dialog shown below , type the word ProfileServlet in the Choose a type field as shown .
This will bring up the correct Matching items i.e. com.google.wave.api.ProfileServlet class .
Click on OK .
news Signed and Delivered
Six days ago , we told you that City Council was about to discuss a proposed new sign bylaw and tax .
Today , they finished .
After seven years of campaigning by public space and arts activists , two years of research and work by city staff , and a day and a half of debate in the Council Chamber , Toronto now officially has a new system for regulating billboards .
In a 29 – 12 vote , Council passed a harmonized billboard bylaw that will coordinate sign placement , size , and material , replacing the hodgepodge of regulations we ’ve been stuck with since amalgamation .
Most importantly , the new bylaw will ensure that billboards maintain their place in our city without becoming overly intrusive .
The tax rate was the most controversial part of the proposed package , with some claiming it was far lower than it ought to be given the industry ’s presence in the city , and some that it was high enough to bankrupt that industry entirely .
The staff recommendation was for a tax scheme that would bring in approximately ten million dollars a year , which the economist contracted by the City to research the matter concluded would amount to a 4 – 7 % taxation rate [ PDF ] — though the billboard industry vehemently disputed that assessment .
Council decided to trust its staff over the word of the industry ( which never provided a detailed breakdown of its earnings or revenue to the City or the third - party economist ) and voted in favour of the staff ’s recommended tax rate 25 – 16 .
Chair of the Planning and Growth Management Committee Norm Kelly had proposed an amendment that would allow companies to replace existing conforming billboards with LED signs and well as build new LED signs anywhere they get permission to install a billboard at all , greatly increasing their visual impact .
Along with another motion which would cut the staff ’s recommended tax rate by 40 % , this spurred a renewed wave of the telephone and email campaign activists had been waging for weeks , flooding councillors ’ voicemail boxes and inboxes with pleas to vote for the staff recommendations untouched .
Some of his fellow councillors too found these motions unacceptable .
Said Councillor Vaughan ( Ward 20 , Trinity - Spadina ) : “ The notion that we have electronic blinking signs as - of - right in every neighbourhood in this city is unbelievable …
We have got to get a handle on this . ”
Vaughan then went on to point out that the tax rate staff recommended had been reduced , twice , over the past few months , after the industry protested that it was set too high , and that further reductions would be excessive .
In the end Council agreed with that sentiment , voting against the move watering down the regulations by allowed LED signs 26 – 15 , just as it had voted in favour of the recommended tax rate .
Staff had originally recommended that the revenue from the tax be set aside — once the bylaw ’s enforcement had been paid for — for arts funding .
This was the one major recommendation Council rejected , deciding instead to send the money into general revenues .
Recommendations as to its allocation will be made by the Budget Committee in the course of establishing the City ’s budget .
The arts activists who had campaigned so hard for this regulatory package and tax were sanguine , however .
Devon Ostrom of the Beautiful City Alliance told us that “ this tax would n’t exist if the arts community had n’t it shepherded it through the process , and the Budget Committee has the moral responsibility to see it through . ”
At core , though , is this : the City now has the ability , the resources , and the mandate to regulate an industry that has , since amalgamation and for years before , been operating largely unchecked .

On Sunday , Mr. Zahrani ’s roommates  who had lived with him for about three weeks in a three - bedroom apartment in downtown Binghamton  recounted how the suspect , who spoke of financial problems , often mentioned death and said he was being persecuted because he was Muslim .
“ I said he was acting oddly , like a terrorist , ” said one of the roommates , Souleymane Sakho , a graduate student from Senegal .
“ When I informed them , it was for them to understand that the guy was violent or he may be violent . ”
Mr. Sakho said that he told his academic adviser who is overseeing his dissertation about Mr. Zahrani , and that the adviser referred him to the school ’s counseling center .
Mr. Sakho said that the head of the counseling center told him to avoid interaction with Mr. Zahrani and said he should look to move out of the apartment .
A spokesman for Binghamton University declined to comment on what university officials may have been told by Mr. Sakho about Mr. Zahrani ’s behavior , citing a continuing investigation by the district attorney of Broome County .
The Nigerian man charged with attempting to blow up a US passenger plane on Christmas Day studied at the campus of an Australian university in Dubai just months ago .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , was studying for a master 's degree in international business at the University of Wollongong 's campus in the United Arab Emirates .
He took classes at the campus , which is affiliated with the Australian university , for about seven months until the middle of this year .
University of Wollongong vice chancellor , Professor Gerard Sutton , says the campus is licensed by the United Arab Emirates government as a stand - alone institution , but is connected to Australia .
In further developments today :
Professor Sutton says lecturers had no clue about Abdulmutallab 's background .
He says he took classes for about seven months until the middle of the year when he disappeared , and was later excluded from the university for not paying his fees .
" He commenced in January 2009 but disappeared from the residences around the middle of the year and was excluded from the second semester around August , September , October on the basis of non-payment of fees , " he said .
" He was a normal student , a student that was passing his subjects .
We had no background on any of his activities outside the university . "
Abdulmutallab is charged with smuggling explosives on board and attempting to blow up the Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day with almost 300 people on board .
The device failed to detonate properly and Abdulmutallab was subdued by passengers and crew .
Abdulmutallab , who comes from a prominent Nigerian family , is now in a Detroit jail .
He has reportedly told US investigators that Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen supplied him with an explosive device and trained him on how to detonate it .
Between 2005 and 2008 he was an engineering student at the University College London .
Before that he was enrolled at the British School in Lome , the capital of Togo .
This morning Mr Obama vowed to hunt down those behind the failed attack .
" We are doing everything in our power to keep you and your families safe and secure during this busy holiday season , " he told Americans in a televised address from Hawaii , where he has been on holiday with his family .
" Those who would slaughter innocent men , women and children must know that the United States will do more than simply strengthen our defences . "
Millions of unemployed Americans face the prospect of a huge increase in health insurance costs , thanks to the looming expiration of a government subsidy .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , passed in February , launched a temporary government program to subsidize the often crippling cost of buying health insurance through a former employer ’s plan after a layoff .
However , the so - called COBRA subsidy was designed to last no more than nine months for each person who was unemployed .
Hundreds of thousands who got this subsidy when it was first made available in March are slated to roll off the program today .
The insurance subsidy will also no longer be available for Americans who lose their jobs starting today .
If the subsidy is not extended , hundreds of thousands will lose the subsidy each month , forcing them to pay health insurance premiums that are three times higher than what they ’re currently paying .
The White House wants to extend the subsidies , an Obama administration spokeswoman said .
And some Democratic lawmakers are pushing to include an extension in legislation that party leaders are developing to boost job growth .
But finding money for an extension remains a major challenge , especially at a time when Democrats are struggling to pay for their planned healthcare overhaul .
The stimulus bill committed $ 25 billion for just nine months of COBRA subsidies .
And few believe that Congress will be able to pass a jobs bill before the end of the year , in large part because the Senate is locked in a debate on broader healthcare legislation .
There is no indication yet of whether any extension would be retroactive , helping people who lose the subsidy .
COBRA , an acronym for the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act that authorized the insurance , is generally more expensive than the premiums paid by company workers , and the new subsidy was intended to ease the burden .
Families USA , a Washington advocacy group , says COBRA insurance premiums would consume more than 83 % of the average unemployment check without the subsidy , making it impossible for most families to afford continuing health insurance coverage .
In nine states , the average COBRA premium exceeds the average unemployment benefit , according to the Families USA analysis .
“ It ’s hard to imagine that many people who are subsisting on an unemployment check will be able to keep coverage , ” said Families USA Executive Director Ron Pollack .
In California , the consumer group estimated that the average monthly COBRA premium for a family plan is now about $ 1,107 , or about 82 % of the monthly unemployment benefit .
This subsidy program was launched to avert a huge increase in the ranks of the uninsured at a time of rapidly rising unemployment .
It provides companies with government money to pay 65 % of the health insurance premiums that would normally be shouldered by former workers who choose to continue their health coverage through COBRA .
COBRA is a federal law that allows laid - off employees to stay on their former employer ’s group health insurance plan for up to 36 months .
However , COBRA normally requires that these former employees pay the full cost of coverage , plus a small administrative fee , instead of the company - subsidized rates that most workers are accustomed to .
That can make the premiums prohibitively expensive .
Only about 19 % of laid - off workers typically opt for COBRA insurance , according to an analysis done by Hewitt Associates last summer .
However , the now - expiring subsidy boosted COBRA enrollment rates to 38 % , according to that analysis .
With unemployment continuing to rise -- some 15.7 million individuals were out of work as of October -- this subsidy may be a lifeline to health insurance for nearly 6 million workers .
Legislators in both the House and Senate have submitted proposals to extend the subsidy for six months , but the legislation has not yet cleared major committees nor been amended to fast - moving legislation , as would be required to extend the subsidy without a break .
Some experts suggest that the tenuous nature of the subsidy should spur those using it to come up with a contingency plan .
“ You do n’t want to have a false sense of security , ” said Martin B. Rosen , co-founder of Health Advocate Inc. and co-author of “ The Health Care Survival Guide . ”
“ People need to prepare . ”
Those who are healthy may be able to buy affordable coverage in the individual market , said Sam Gibbs , senior vice president of eHealthInsurance.com .
The company , an online insurance broker , says that about half of its customers find family coverage for less than $ 350 per month and individual coverage for less than $ 150 per month .
A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average consumer on COBRA pays $ 398 per month for family coverage -- even after the government subsidy -- and pays roughly $ 144 per month for subsidized individual coverage .
It ’s far worse for people with existing health issues .
Individual coverage is often unaffordable -- or simply not available -- to those with preexisting medical conditions , he said .
For these people , there is little option but to budget for the possibility of vastly higher premiums when the subsidy expires .
However , Rosen notes that there are a few other tricks consumers might employ -- such as trying to enroll in their spouse ’s plan and looking for part - time work with companies that offer benefits to part - time workers , such as Starbucks , Costco and Trader Joe’s .
Additionally , some colleges that offer health insurance to students will allow parents to piggyback on their group plan , Rosen said .
College coverage is n’t always ideal , but it can be better than nothing for those who ca n’t get insurance elsewhere , he added .
If a family is covered under COBRA , but only one person has a health issue , it ’s also possible to keep that one person on COBRA , while shifting the rest of the family to less - expensive policies in the individual market , Gibbs said .
California also offers a state - subsidized high - risk pool for those who ca n’t get insurance elsewhere , but it cannot be tapped unless they have run out of COBRA eligibility and have no other option .
If all else fails , people can negotiate with their doctors when they have no health coverage , Rosen said .
Many health professionals are willing to discount their rates for customers who lose their insurance .
“ I went to the dentist and said , ‘ I do n’t have insurance anymore .
I wonder if I could pay the [ discounted ] amount you ’d normally get from the insurance company , ’ ” Rosen said .
The dentist did n’t even blink , saying yes immediately , Rosen said .
“ That was not difficult , but people do n’t even ask . ”

Michelle Wie and Tom Varndell will hope to feature in 2016 Golf and rugby sevens have been voted on to the programme for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
The International Olympic Committee 's executive board voted to include both two months ago and the full membership confirmed the decision on Friday .
Golf was passed by 63 votes to 27 while rugby sevens had 81 votes in favour and eight against .
IOC president Jacques Rogge told delegates : " Time will show your decision was very wise . "
Golf 's inclusion was welcomed by Europe 's Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie , who spoke to the IOC in Lausanne in June .
" I am so delighted to hear that golf has been approved to be in the Olympics in 2016 .
I am proud to have been a part of the process and it is a credit to everyone who has lent their support to this process , " he said .
GORDON FARQUHAR BLOG
Some members are still clearly very unhappy at the way the inclusion of the two new sports for 2016 has been handled
" I have made my support very clear and I think this is a very significant moment for the game of golf , and all of the players who are lucky enough to compete in the 2016 Olympic Games will be part of a truly unique experience . "
The Republic of Ireland 's three - time major winner Padraig Harrington told a news conference in Copenhagen that the Olympics would soon surpass the majors in importance .
" I do believe in time the Olympic gold will become the most important event in golf and I do n't believe it will take that long , " he said .
" In the four years between the Olympics there will be 16 majors , so winning gold will be that much more special . "
Bernard Lapasset , president of the International Rugby Board , said the Olympics would be " the pinnacle of our sport " .

" This is a historic moment for our sport and for the global rugby community , who were united in support of our campaign , " he added .
" We are excited and honoured to be joining the Olympic Games and I would like to thank the IOC members for believing in our Olympic vision and our values and recognising that rugby sevens is a perfect fit for the Olympic Games . "
The inclusion of the two sports was welcomed by British Olympic chief Andy Hunt , who added that both would provide medal opportunities for Great Britain in Rio de Janeiro .

" We are delighted that both golf and rugby sevens have been given the opportunity to take part in the ultimate celebration of sport at the Rio 2016 Olympics , " said the British Olympic Association chief executive .
" We currently have a wealth of talented British male and female players moving through ( golf's ) amateur ranks and are very excited at the prospect of what these young athletes could achieve at Olympic level .
" It 's encouraging for us that Wales won the men 's 2009 Rugby Sevens World Cup final in Dubai earlier this year . "
It 's win -win for both sides - golf is such a global sport
Golf star Tiger Woods Players from England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland will all be eligible to play for the Team GB sevens team and Rob Andrew , the Rugby Football Union 's elite rugby director , said England were looking forward to joining forces with the Celtic nations .
" The thought of joining with the other home unions to make a Team GB is very exciting and on behalf of the RFU and the elite rugby department I am delighted that sevens rugby for men and women has been included , " he said .
England sevens captain and IRB world sevens player of the year Ollie Phillips described it as " fabulous news " adding he was " doing cartwheels round my flat " .
The vote on the inclusion of the two sports - which includes the 2020 Games as well as 2016 - had originally been due at 1100 GMT at the IOC 's congress in Copenhagen , Denmark .
It was delayed while some IOC members expressed concern about the process by which the sports had been selected for inclusion by the IOC 's executive board .
But when the vote was finally taken both passed with flying colours , although the majority in favour of golf was somewhat smaller than that in favour of its fellow returnee to the Olympic family .
Both sports were part of the Games programme in the early part of the twentieth century before being dropped , and golf returns to the Games for the first time since the St Louis Olympics of 1904 .
One of the main issues had been whether top players would compete in the Olympics but the game 's brightest star , Tiger Woods , had indicated on Tuesday he would play .
We want to play our part in strengthening and growing the Olympic movement - rugby is reaching out
Ex -Argentina captain Agustin Pichot Golf 's presentation video included stars of past and present including Jack Nicklaus , Phil Mickelson , Ernie Els and Woods .
" It 's win - win for both sides - golf is such a global sport .
I could n't think of a better sport to be part of the Olympic Games , " said Woods .
The presentation party on the day included 16 - year - old Italian Matteo Manassero , the 2009 British amateur champion , and American Michelle Wie , who said it would be a " dream " to play in the Olympics .
Wie said : " I can dream about being an Olympian , and I can dream of doing something not even Tiger or Ernie has ever done , that is to make the putt to win the gold medal . "
Nicklaus , an 18 - time major winner , said : " All of us who have spent our lives playing and enjoying the game of golf fully understand why it deserved a spot on the Olympic programme .
" Now the sport I have always called the greatest game of all can be shared with the rest of the world on the greatest stage in sports . "
Rugby union was last part of the Olympics in 1924 in the full 15 - man version of the code , and will return to the Games in the truncated seven - a - side version .
Rugby sevens was represented on the day by stars including All Black legend Jonah Lomu , former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot , Kenya captain Humphrey Kayange and Australia women 's captain Cheryl Soon .
A number of delegates preferred to praise the sport rather than question the panel , but among the queries posed was whether the game 's top stars would play in Rio.
Lomu , a former Commonwealth Games gold medallist , said : " To see my sport in the best arena would be fantastic for rugby , men 's and women's .
We are very passionate about it - you just have to say where we have to play and the best players will come .
" I can speak for all of them - they will turn up . "
Soon said it would be " a privilege " to play in the Olympics , while Pichot added : " We want to play our part in strengthening and growing the Olympic movement - rugby is reaching out . "

It ’s four - and - a- quarter light - years to the closest planets beyond the solar system , which orbit the star Proxima Centauri .
At the speed of the fastest probe ever launched , it would take about 80,000 years to get there .
But one project plans to cover that distance in about 20 years — and not with one probe , but potentially with hundreds .
But there ’s a catch : Each probe would be the size of a postage stamp .
Breakthrough Starshot was established in 2016 .
Teams of scientists and engineers are studying the challenges of launching such tiny probes .
Each one would be powered by a “ sail ” covering a few square yards .
High - powered lasers on Earth would beam light at them .
The pressure of the light would accelerate the probes to about 20 percent of the speed of light within hours of launch .
A probe would carry everything it needed to conduct its mission , including cameras and its own laser to transmit information to Earth .
It would have a thin coating to protect it from collisions with grains of dust .
There are lots of challenges to overcome .
Today ’s lasers are nowhere near powerful enough to propel the probes , for example .
And at a large fraction of lightspeed , a probe would have a good view of its target planets for only seconds .
If technology continues to improve at its current pace , though , it ’s possible that the first probes could be launched in a few decades — zooming toward our closest planetary neighbors .

Secret Service : Threat level against Obama no greater than under Bush , Clinton
Bit of a bombshell at this morning 's Homeland Security Committee hearing :
U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan dismissed published reports that the level of death threats against President Obama are four times greater than typical threat levels against recent presidents — claiming the current volume of threats is comparable to that under George W. Bush and Bill Clinton .
" It 's not [ a ] 400 percent [ increase ] , " Sullivan said during a heated exchange with Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton ( D - D.C. ) , who suggested the service needed additional agents to protect the first African - American president .
" I 'm not sure where that number comes from , " he said , adding that the number of threats against Obama " are the same level as it has been [ against ] the last two presidents . "
Sullivan said he would get more specific in a closed - door session with members of the Homeland Security Committee .

Scenes from Socialism 2009 .

More than 200 activists , including a large proportion of youth and women , packed Kuala Lumpur ’s Chinese Assembly Hall for the first day of Socialism 2009 , an annual conference organised by the Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) .
It took place November 14 and 15 .
The focus was an analysis of “ the two - party system in Malaysia ” after the “ electoral tsunami ” in March 2008 .
With the opposition People 's Alliance ( Pakatan Rakyat ) winning five out of 13 states , it raised the possibility of an opposition group taking power in Malaysia for the first time in 50 years .
The PSM shocked the political establishment by winning a seat in the national parliament and one in the Selangor State Assembly — the first socialists elected to parliament since the 1960s .
PSM central committee member Dr Jeyakumar Devaraj , elected to the national parliament by defeating a powerful government minister , was labelled the “ giant killer ” by the press .
The PSM organised the conference as a discussion among the broader left , with the majority of attendees and speakers not PSM members .
Speakers included well - known Malaysian academics and NGO activists , as well as opposition Pakatan Rakyat leaders .
Addressing the conference , Devaraj argued that for real change was needed in Malaysia ’s political system .
He said parties are needed that are “ based on the people ” , giving Venezuela as an example of a genuine alternative under construction .
Researcher Toh Kin Woon argued for a political “ third force ” that puts the case for equality , justice and social services , beyond the two - party system .
PSM general secretary and Kajang local councillor S. Arutchelvan argued that “ real power comes from the people ” .
He said the PSM is working with the people to fight the US Free Trade Agreement , against the regressive goods and services tax , and for a minimum wage .
Arutchelvan said , despite the limitations of the opposition , the prospect of toppling the National Front ( Barisan Nasional ) government , which has been in power for five decades , excited people .
He said the PSM needs to relate to that .
The PSM was formed on May Day 1998 , by plantation workers and anti-eviction activists .
It is a relatively young party , although its tradition goes back far beyond its 11 years of existence .
The PSM was formed at a difficult time for the Malaysian left : the brutal Internal Security Act ( still in existence ) allowed for arbitrary jailing of leftists ; the Soviet Union had collapsed and capitalism was triumphantly declaring “ the end of history ” ; and a party called the “ Malay Peoples Socialist Party ” had dropped the word “ socialism ” from its name .
Despite tough conditions , the PSM has been a remarkable success .
Having applied for party registration on its day of formation , only to be denied on the grounds of being a “ threat to national security ” , the party fought a 10 - year struggle for legitimacy , culminating in victory last year in finally being officially registered as a political party , allowing it to stand in elections under its own name .
Arutchelvan said : “ The government spent 11 years trying to stop the PSM getting registered [ as a political party ] , so it must see potential there ! ”
The PSM has grown rapidly , with a 400 % increase in party membership between 2003 and 2008 .
The PSM went from two branches in 1999 to 14 branches , with offices in seven states and members across the country .
The party produces newspapers in three languages – a monthly paper in Malay , and bi-monthly papers in Mandarin and Tamil .
Sixty per cent of the PSM is under 40 years of age .
The conference was even more youthful than this , with many young people below the age of 30 .
The PSM has launched a youth organisation , despite laws outlawing politics on university campuses .
The PSM also has three local councillors – however , these positions are appointed and the PSM is campaigning for local councillors to be elected ( the PSM ’s councillors were appointed by non-socialist state representatives , reflecting the party 's standing in the movements and with the grassroots ) .
The PSM takes a very non-sectarian view towards socialists from varying traditions – seeking to incorporate various trends and contributions , rather than looking for every difference .
The PSM is putting socialism back on the map in Malaysia , and gradually eroding the socialism ``taboo '’ .
In fact , the PSM is far stronger than the Malay Peoples Party , the party which dropped the word “ socialism ” from its name in the 1990s .
Socialism is quickly becoming associated in Malaysia with those who are most active in fighting for the rights of plantation workers , students , factory workers , urban squatters and those fighting for democratic rights .
The PSM played a leading role in a 40,000 - strong anti-ISA protest on August 1 .
It is fighting neoliberalism , campaigning against the privatisation of health and water services , the goods and services tax and the US Free Trade Agreement .
The Socialism 2009 conference featured a discussion on “ fighting neoliberal attacks and capitalism in South East Asia ” , involving representatives from left groups from across the region .
Common and specific features of the anti-captialist struggle were discussed by speakers from the Peoples Democratic Party ( PRD ) and Working Peoples Association ( PRP ) of Indonesia ; Laban ng Masa and the Party of the Masses ( PLM ) of the Philippines ; Turn Left of Thailand ; and the PSM and Democratic Action Party ( part of the opposition Pakatan Rakyat ) of Malaysia .
Themes included the struggle to defend public assets including health , education , water and power from privatisation ; struggles against the degradation of the land and the environment ; the struggle for basic health , education and housing for the people ; combating capitalist ideology ; and how to involve the masses in struggle and strengthen grassroots organisation and people ’s power .
The conference was also attended by activists from KASBI ( Congress of Indonesian Union Alliance ) and KPRM ( Political Committee of the Poor ) from Indonesia ; Singapore 's Democratic Party and Democratic Youth ; and myself from the Socialist Alliance and the Democratic Socialist Party .
The next international conference , Socialism 2010 , will be held in the Philippines .

LOS ANGELES 
Even the author Ray Bradbury put up a fight , but it was not enough to save the H. P. Wright Library in Ventura , Calif .
The library , like so many around the country , had fallen on hard times as city and state budgets tightened .
Mr. Bradbury , a fierce advocate for public libraries , appeared at a fund - raiser last June aimed at helping to save the ailing branch .
While that helped the library hang on for a bit , the long - term picture was bleak , and a recent bond measure that would have helped close a $ 650,000 deficit sunk .

The library ’s final day on Nov. 30 was met with a candlelight vigil .
“ Needless to say , they put up a good fight , ” said Sydney Weisman , a spokeswoman for the San Buenaventura Friends of the Library , which tried to keep the library afloat .
“ Dan has appeared nude in the past .
There are a couple of scenes in the new film in which he will undress , but we ’re still thinking about how we present it .
If Bill Clinton - or , presumably , Al Gore ( or even Ralph Nader ) - had been President in 2001 , the Ft. Hood massacre almost certainly would n't have happened .
Because George W. Bush was president , it did .
Here 's why it 's Bush 's fault :
One of the first lessons aspiring novelists and screenwriters learn is that the goodness of a hero is defined by a single quality - the evil of his opponent .
From Superman's Lex Luthor to Batman 's Joker to Indiana Jones ' Nazis to Luke Skywalker 's Darth Vader , for a hero to be perceived as larger than life , he must have a larger than life enemy .
If Frodo in " Lord of the Rings , " for example , had n't been forced to do battle with the supernatural powers of the Ring and its minions , his story would have merely been a boring travelogue .
But with an army of supernaturally brilliant , evil , and powerful opponents , Frodo had the opportunity to display his extraordinary inner courage and resourcefulness , qualities he did n't even realize he had until they were called forth by the peril of an awesome evil .
This is a lesson that was not lost on Karl Rove and George W. Bush .
If they could recast George as the opponent of a power as great as the Ring , then the rather ordinary Dubya could become the extraordinary SuperGeorge , rising from his facileness to prevail over supernatural powers of evil .
Bill Clinton had a similar chance , but passed on it for the good of America and the world .
When bin Laden attacked us in the 1990s - several times - in an attempt to raise his own stature in the Islamic world , Bill Clinton dealt with Osama like the criminal he was .
He enlisted Interpol and the police and investigative agencies of various nations , brought in our best intelligence agents , and missed bin Laden in a missile - launched assassination attempt by a scant twenty minutes ( bringing derisive howls from Republicans that he was trying to " wag the dog " and deflect attention from the Monica investigations ) .
As Clinton left office , he and the CIA were tightening the noose on bin Laden , and his National Security Advisor , Sandy Berger , told me that when he briefed his successor , Condoleezza Rice , he told her to put bin Laden and al - Qaeda at the top of her priority list and thus finish the job the Clinton administration had nearly completed .
As we know , when Rice , Rumsfeld , Cheney , Bush , et al finally came up with the priorities for their new administration in January of 2001 , al - Qaeda had been replaced by tax cuts for Bush 's rich donors on the " A " list , and did n't even appear on the " B " list .
Thus came 9/11 , despite over fifty explicit warnings given to the President , including the infamous August 6 , 2001 CIA briefing in Crawford , Texas that in the immediate future al - Qaeda intended to hijack commercial planes and use them to attack east coast targets .
( Bush apparently took the warnings seriously - Ashcroft immediately stopped flying on commercial aircraft , and Bush moved to Texas for the longest vacation in the history of the American presidency ... and even when that was over , he preferred Florida to target - listed Washington , D.C. )
In the days after the 9/11 attacks - much as in the days after Tim McVeigh blew up the Murrah Building - America had the sympathy of the world , and the police and intelligence agencies of even normally hostile nations offered to help us track down and bring to justice its perpetrators .
Muslims all over the world were horrified at the actions of one of their own , a fundamentalist turned criminal and murderer .
Mullah Omar of Afghanistan 's Taliban first offered to arrest bin Laden and turn him over to us ( Washington Post , Page 1 , October 29 , 2001 , " Diplomats Met With Taliban On Bin Laden " by Ottaway and Stephens ) and then made an explicit offer to arrest Bin Laden and try him for the crime of 9/11 ( CNN , October 7 , 2001 , " US Rejects Taliban Offer To Try Bin Laden " ; The Guardian , October 14 , 2001 , " Bush Rejects Taliban Offer To Hand Bin Laden Over " ) .
It would have been so easy for Bush to accept Omar 's offer , which had resulted , according to the Post , in over 20 diplomatic meetings and negotiations .
The Justice Department could have arrested Bin Laden like they did McVeigh , helped the Taliban dismantle Bin Laden 's training camps and track down their attendees and sponsors , and launch an international effort to disassemble and render impotent al - Qaeda .
It probably could have been done in a year or less , given the intensity of the worldwide empathy for citizens of America and the many other nations whose people died in the World Trade Center .
Over 5000 American soldiers would still be alive , and tens of thousands would not have lost arms , legs , and eyes .
Hundreds of thousands - possibly over a million - innocent Afghans and Iraqis would still be alive .
But Karl Rove knew that George W. Bush had a problem , and saw in bin Laden the solution .
And did n't much give a damn what it would mean to American Muslims .
Bush had not defeated Al Gore fair and square , and was seen by most Americans as a spoiler , an illegitimate leader .
As soon as the details of his proposed " supply side " voodoo economics hit the press in the first months of his presidency , the markets went into a nosedive .
And already there were stories circulating in the media of his cozy relationship with corrupt oil barons like Ken Lay and the secret energy meetings in the Spring of 2001 - before 9/11 - in which Cheney , Lay , and others in the oil industry were apparently carving up the oil fields of Iraq .
Bush , in short , was seen as a buffoonish pretender , an ineffectual manager , and a sellout to big oil and other scandal - ridden industries .
He was the butt of late - night jokes , a former college cheerleader , a " dry drunk " ( except when tempted by beer and pretzels ) , an inside trader , a small man on the national and international stage .
George W. desperately needed his own Lex Luthor if he was to reinvent himself as Superman .
Rove and Bush realized that if they simply branded Bin Laden as the criminal thug that he was - the leader of an obscure Islamic mafia with fewer than 20,000 serious members - they would n't have the super - villain they needed for George W. Bush to be seen as a super - hero .
If Bush only authorized a police action , or cut a deal with Omar , he 'd miss a golden opportunity to position himself as the Battle Commander of The War Against Evil Incarnate .
And so began the building of the mythos .
Osama as evil genius .
Osama as worldwide mastermind .
Even Osama as the antichrist ( as General Boykin reminded us so candidly ) .
If the remnants of al - Qaeda tried to pull our strings by increasing " chatter " about particular flights , for example , the Bush White House hyper- reacted with many press conferences and televised appearances by Tom Ridge .
Every action was trumpeted .
Bush put " Terror Alerts " on the screens of TVs nationwide as often as possible .
The constant drumbeat was that George The Good was battling the One True Dragon .
And that Dragon was Islamic .
For George to remain SuperGeorge , Bin Laden had to be as big as Hitler in the minds of Americans .
Thus , Richard Perle wrote in his breathless and hyperbolic book An End To Evil : " There is no middle way for Americans :
It is victory or holocaust . "
But Afghanistan and Iraq were n't Germany , and Bin Laden was n't even a pale imitation of Hitler .
It was n't a nation that attacked us - it was a tiny , local , but well - funded Islamic mafia .
And that band of thugs run by Bin Laden no more represented the interests or opinions of the majority of the world 's Muslims than Tim McVeigh represented the majority of America 's Christians .
This archetypal transformation of George W. Bush from spoiled , rich - boy pretender - to - the - presidency into the caped ( well , flight - suited ) SuperGeorge , Defender Of All Things Good And Right had a powerful impact on the American people - and particularly on their perception of Muslims .
The shadow of the " good " SuperGeorge was , necessarily , the " evil " of Muslims .
They were vilified - talk show hosts called for their outright murder ( " Kill them all " said Michael Savage ) - and a steady drumbeat of suspicion was cast toward American Muslims .
Fox News and right - wing talk jumped in with both feet , feeding anti-Muslim hysteria that continues to this day with teary - eyed TV shows , a " secret Muslim " president , and Nazi-image Tea Parties .
" Be afraid , " they tell Americans every day .
" Be very afraid . "
In retrospect , it 's surprising that Major Hasan was the first to snap in all these years .
Bill Clinton knew what to do with a terrorist , be he Bin Laden or Tim McVeigh : brand them as criminals .
The countries of Europe who endured years of terrorism - from the crimes of the IRA against the citizens of Britain , to the crimes of the November 17th terrorist group against Greece , to the crimes of the Red Brigades against Italy - they were fought by investigators , intelligence operatives , and the highly effective web of police agencies that stretch across the world .
Although less filled with shock and awe , these able people could have brought Bin Laden and his associates to justice without turning him into a super - villain or demonizing Muslims .
But that would have deflated the heroic SuperGeorge action figure in the minds of average Americans , and possibly Cheny 's company Halliburton - which was on shaky ground financially before 9/11 - would have even gone under because of Cheney 's ill - thought - out purchase by that company of a bankrupt asbestos supplier .
( On December 10 , 2001 , before the bombing of Afghanistan began , Halliburton stock lost 43 % of its value in a single day because Cheney 's business decision was pushing them toward bankruptcy . )
So George and Dick made out just fine .
But Major Hasan went nuts .
And probably never would have , had somebody other than Bush / Rove / Cheney been in the White House back in 2001 .

The scientist who convinced the world that global warming was a looming danger says the planet will be better off if next week 's Copenhagen climate change summit ends in collapse .
James Hansen , considered the most distinguished climate scientist , says any agreement to emerge from the meeting will be so flawed that it would be better to start again from scratch .
His words came on the same day as the University of East Anglia announced an investigation into the thousands of damaging leaked emails emanating from its Climatic Research Unit .
Professor Hansen heads the NASA Goddard Institute earth sciences unit in New York .
In 1989 he made several appearances before Congress and did more than any other scientist to educate politicians about the causes of global warming and the urgent need to change behaviour .
Earlier this year , he was awarded the Carl Gustaf Rossby Research Medal by the American Meteorological Society .
It was awarded for his outstanding contribution to climate modelling and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena .
He certainly was not mincing his words when he gave his views to the Guardian newspaper online about the prospects for next week 's climate change conference .
" The approach that 's being talked about is so fundamentally wrong that it 's better to reassess the situation , " he said .
" I think it 's just as well that we not have a substantive treaty . "
Professor Hansen argues that the process is so flawed because it relies on cap and trade emissions trading schemes , like the one proposed by the Australian Government .
Instead of allowing polluters to buy the right to continue polluting , he prefers a tax on the price of carbon at the mine or the port .
" The whole idea that you have goals that you 're supposed to try to meet and that you have outs with offsets means that it's an attempt to continue business as usual , " he said .
Professor Hansen 's research has been put under a microscope after the leaking last month of emails sent by scientists at Britain 's University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit .
Climate sceptics have seized on the correspondence , claiming that it shows how flimsy climate science is .
It has now been revealed one of the United States president 's advisers , John Holdren , was involved in sending and receiving the emails .
Republicans accused him of being a scientific fascist .
The university 's vice chancellor , Professor Edward Acton , he is treating it as a matter of enormous importance .
" I think [ it 's ] very important that the university be sure - footed and confident about each step that it takes and I think we must now look forward to the review being undertaken , I hope swiftly , " he said .
The head of the university 's prestigious research unit stands by his data but he has stood down and an independent investigation into the contents of the emails has now been announced .
The NCAA men’s and women ’s basketball season will begin Nov. 25 , the day before Thanksgiving .
The Division I Council voted …
The NCAA men’s and women ’s basketball season will begin Nov. 25 , the day before Thanksgiving .
The Division I Council voted Wednesday to push the start date back from the originally scheduled Nov. 10 as one of several precautions against the spread of coronavirus .
The later start date coincides with the decision most schools made to send students home from Thanksgiving until January out of concern about a potential late - fall and early - winter flareup of COVID - 19 .
Closed campuses could serve as a quasi bubble for players and provide a window for nonconference games .
“ The fact our campuses will be clearing out , it will be possible to just further control the exposures , and the 25th gives us that opportunity , ” said Division I Council chair Grace Calhoun , the athletic director at Penn .
The men’s and women ’s basketball oversight committees had jointly recommended a start date of Nov. 21 , a Saturday .
Calhoun said the council wanted to avoid a weekend start date because of potential overlaps of basketball and football games on campuses .
The maximum number of regular - season games has been reduced from 31 to 27 .
“ The rationale was that during the season teams tend to play an average of two games a week , so the fact we ’re shortening the season by two weeks necessitated the reduction in games so we ’re not being counterproductive and trying to jam more in a shortened season , ” Calhoun said .
The minimum number of games for consideration for the NCAA Tournament was cut from 25 to 13 .
Calhoun said the low minimum is an acknowledgement that schools probably will experience different levels of COVID - 19 cases and have to alter schedules .
“ We fully anticipate there are going to be some issues as we go through the season , much like we ’ve seen in football , so we want there to be flexibility for institutions to put together seasons , ” she said .
Teams can start preseason practices Oct. 14 .
Beginning Monday , teams will be allowed to participate in strength and conditioning and sport - related meetings and skill instruction for up to 12 hours a week , with an eight - hour limit on skill instruction .
No scrimmages against other teams or exhibitions are allowed .
It also was recommended each team play a minimum of four nonconference games .
The council is scheduled to meet again Oct. 13 - 14 and could delay the start date and change other pieces of the basketball framework if circumstances surrounding the virus warrant .
The council also voted to extend the recruiting dead period for all sports until Jan .
1 . In - person recruiting is prohibited during a dead period , though phone calls and other correspondence are allowed .
Also approved was civic engagement legislation .
Practicing , competing and other countable athletically related activities will be prohibited on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November each year , including this year ’s Election Day on Nov. 3 .
The Division I Student - Athlete Advisory Committee proposed the legislation to provide a day each year dedicated to increasing opportunities for athletes to participate in activities such as voting or community service .

So I posted some new XSS vectors on twitter and I thought I ’d share them on the blog in case anyone missed them .
Safari , Chrome and Opera all support these now 🙂
We have a brand new way of auto executing XSS .
Normally when you find a XSS hole within a input element that has filtered < and > you ca n’t exploit it automatically without using CSS expressions .
The injection looks something like :-
< input type =" text " USER_INPUT >
Here you can do style=xss : expression ( alert ( 1 ) ) or moz - binding etc . but it only works on a limited number of browsers .
HTML5 however lets us execute like expressions but without css styles .
For example :-
< input type =" text " AUTOFOCUS onfocus=alert ( 1 ) >
We use the “ autofocus ” feature to focus our element and then the onfocus event to execute our XSS .
This works with a plethora ( I like that word ) of tags .
Any form based element it seems you can use this method :-
< input autofocus onfocus=alert ( 1 ) > < select autofocus onfocus=alert ( 1 ) > < textarea autofocus onfocus=alert ( 1 ) > < keygen autofocus onfocus=alert ( 1 ) >
A gene involved in some forms of intellectual disability has been identified by scientists at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ( CAMH ) , as published this month in The American Journal of Human Genetics .
The gene is called TRAPPC9 .
In the same journal two other international research teams independently confirm the findings of Dr. John B. Vincent , a scientist at CAMH , and his team .
" This spotlights the intense interest that genetics is bringing to types of inherited intellectual disability that , to date , have been poorly understood , " says Dr. Vincent .
" Now that we have identified TRAPPC9 as a gene that may be associated with hundreds of thousands of cases of intellectual disability world - wide , we can build on that knowledge with research to help individuals and their families , " says Dr. Vincent .
May account for many cases of intellectual disability
Unlike intellectual disabilities that are part of a syndrome with other medical conditions or physical abnormalities , TRAPPC9 is associated with non-syndromic types of intellectual disability ; these cause up to 50 per cent of intellectual disability worldwide .
" The discovery announced today sheds light on a gene for intellectual disability on one of the non-sex chromosomes , " says Dr. Vincent , " just the seventh such gene that we know of . "
The mutation in the TRAPPC9 gene identified by Dr. Vincent 's team causes the production of a truncated version of a protein and results in faulty cell function .
Findings in two families
Because there are no highly recognizable physical differences that are associated with the non-syndromic intellectual disabilities , it is more difficult to tease out the genetic mutations that may cause them .
But researchers and families themselves have long suspected an inherited factor , based on patterns observed in extended families .
Families with many affected individuals , and particular families from cultures where cousin - cousin marriages are common , have become invaluable in the search for such genes , and with recent advances in technology it is now possible to map disease - causing genes in a single family .

Dr. Vincent 's team first identified and mapped out the TRAPPC9 gene in a large family from Pakistan that had at least seven members with non-syndromic intellectual disability .
" To date , most such genes have only been found responsible for disease in a single family , " he adds .
But Dr. Vincent 's team also found a mutation in the same gene in a family from Iran , confirming the gene 's importance .
" This additional finding gives us a very strong reason to continue to explore the gene and its possible mutations , " he says .
Normal brain function
Future research may include studying how the gene is involved in normal brain function , as well as studying genes with similar functions as candidate genes for intellectual disability , and devising potential therapeutic strategies .
Dr. Vincent 's team aims to provide scientists more clues to understand , diagnose , prevent , and treat intellectual disabilities .
Intellectual disabilities , also known as developmental delay or mental retardation , are a group of disorders defined by diminished cognitive and adaptive development .
Affecting more males than females , they are diagnosed in between one and three percent of the population .
The study was funded by grants from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care and ( US ) NARSAD .
The U.S. economist who predicted in 1972 that the world was facing environmental disaster has ridiculed the Copenhagen climate change summit and says only a series of global crises will incite the world to take concrete action .
“ Copenhagen ?
I do n’t take it seriously .
The whole thing is a huge ploy , ” said Dennis Meadows , co-author of The Limits to Growth , a blockbuster report that argued the world faced catastrophe if population growth and resource use was n’t reconciled with environmental sustainability .
He said only a tiny proportion of the world ’s population is even aware world leaders , including U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper , are gathering in Denmark ’s capital city this month to seek an accord to limit climate - changing greenhouse gas emissions .
“ This conference is essentially about doing as little as possible , not as much as possible , ” Mr. Meadows , 67 , told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel this week .
“ I think 98 % of humans have n’t even heard the word Copenhagen . ”
He said it ’s critical the public do more to reduce their carbon footprint and ease energy dependence , but he said it ’s too late to do much more than slow climate change .
“ It might have been possible to prevent serious climate change in the 1970s and 1980s , but it is n’t any more , ” said Mr. Meadows , who earlier this year was awarded Japan ’s prestigious $ 500,000 prize from the country ’s Science and Technology Foundation .
“ We are on a roller coaster at the top of the hill , and all we can do is hold on tight . ”
The world will only take dramatic action when faced with “ a series of crises , ” he predicted .
“ It is only when there are abrupt climate changes , unpleasant ones , that the willingness will come about to really do something . ”
He said the world ’s population of 6.8 billion people is excessive , and only possible because such a large proportion live in poverty , unable to own the pollution - causing cars and homes with modern appliances .
“ If you think it is acceptable to have a small elite that enjoys a decent lifestyle and a large majority that is excluded from that , then the Earth can probably sustain five to six billion people , ” he said .
“ If you want everyone to have the full potential of mobility , adequate food and self - development , then it is one or two billion . ”
Mr. Meadows was among a group of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the 1972 study on behalf of the Club of Rome , a think - tank established four years earlier to advise the world on environmental sustainability .
The report , issued at a time when the world ’s population was just under four billion , used computer simulation models to assess the impact of population growth on food and industrial production , pollution , and consumption of non-renewable natural resources .
A majority of the scenarios predicted disaster if growth and consumption trends were n’t changed significantly .
The report was explosive and controversial , selling more than 12 million copies in 30 languages .
The Club of Rome credits The Limits To Growth for the creation of ministries of the environment in most of the world ’s governments starting in the 1970s .
Though the report was criticized at the time , the quality of the projections turned out to be “ amazingly good , unfortunately , ” Mr. Meadows said .
“ We are in the midst of an environmental crisis , which we predicted then .
The difference is that we have lost 40 years during which humanity should have acted . ”

The NTSB initially released the public docket for Flight 1549 on June 9 , 2009 and has since , in May of 2010 , updated that docket .
The docket contains a wealth of information that can be utilized in a full 3D reconstruction of the accident .
Our work goes deep into the underlying framework of information and encompasses the entire spectrum of accident information .
Integrating all spatial and temporal data allows us to approach this accident from a never - before - seen perspective .

Scroll to the bottom of this page to the section titled " Further Thoughts and Discussion " for some additional insight and updated talking points that have been common in the years since this accident .
Most people do n't realize this , but the birds were visible on radar , before the event occured .
After integrating the raw radar data into our 3D environment and creating motion targets representing those radar returns associated with the flock of birds , our timeline clearly depicts the intersection of Flight 1549 with birds at a time of around 1527:10 ( HHMM:SS ) .
This coincides well with the CVR transcript which indicates loud " thumps " at 1527:11.4 ( HHMM : SS.0 ) .
Based on a simple linear interpolation of the CVR Lat / Long data points , the position of bird strike is approximately N40.8462 - W73.8760 .
The NTSB Wildlife Factors Report has identified the feathers in the aircraft as Branta Canadensis ( Canada Goose ) by means of visual , microscopic and DNA analysis .
Identification of the feathers was conducted by the Smithsonian Institute Feather Identification Laboratory .
Though the errors may be intolerable , it is possible to pursue an altitude calculation for the birds by triangulation , this due to the fact that there are two separate radar facilities that reported data .
We know the altitude of the birds at the time of impact , but it may also be helpful to determine their flight profile to understand where they were going or where they departed ..
We will attempt this analysis as our work continues on the accident .
The timelapse ( 10 x ) animation below presents a detailed view in the area of the bird strike and clearly shows motion , disorganization of the flock following the bird strike , and the subsequent re-organization of the flock (s ) following the passage of a second aircraft , Eagle Flight 4718 .
Aircraft altitude is in 100's of feet .
Eagle Flight 4718 actually came quite close to birds but luckily was not on an intersecting flightpath .
We have created the presentation below combining a radar data display , audio from multiple sources ( split into left and right channels ) , a 3D perpective of the flightpath and other ancillary information .
Radar data is displayed in the upper right quadrant with aircraft identification and altitude ( 100's of feet ) .
The audio transcripts are displayed on screen for nearly all communications from the mentioned audio recordings .
Continuity is maintained with the transcript , however the audible tracks are faded in and out and selected based on perceived importance to the accident timeline .
This combination of information is not a likely candidate for final presentation because of information overload .
However , it does illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of a fully integrated reconstruction technique .
The audio presented is :
LaGuardia ATCT Cab Coordinator
LaGuardia ATCT South Terminal Control
New York TRACON South Control
Teterboro ATCT Local Control position
The time lapse ( 10 x ) reconstruction below focuses on the radar data , cockpit communications and a simple visualization of the aircraft 's flightpath .
It is not intended to simulate the radar display that the controller would see , but rather serves as a tool to visualize the data .
The flight numbers and altitudes ( 100's of feet ) are shown for most aircraft .
Primary radar returns are shown with open boxes , beacon only returns are shown with triangles and beacon reinforced data is depicted with small plus symbols .
Data for JFK and EWR radar facility are both displayed .
Data with altitude information has been slant range corrected , whereas primary returns are not corrected for altitude ( and thus do not project accurately when overlaying data from the two radar facilities ) .
Time is shown in Zulu ( UTC ) and audio captions are displayed as well ( although at 10 x speed , they have much less meaning ) .
Teterboro and La Guardia runways are highlighted to help in orientation .
A high resolution satellite image serves as the basemap to this animation .
The raw radar returns ( primary returns ) are displayed as open boxes and clearly show the movement of several flocks of birds in the mapped area .
Movement of the flocks is readily apparent , especially at 10 x speed ; however the radar controllers typically have chosen to filter these primary returns from display .
Situations faced by the controllers dictate their workload and many other operational factors would combine to determine whether or not this information should be visible .
It would be possible , for example , that a controller 's attention could be diverted from the task of maintaining aircraft separation .
A great deal of research has gone into avian radar systems in the hopes that an automated recognition and warning system could be created .
Future radar installations may have hardware or software ( or both ) upgraded .
This work has long been in the making and accidents such as Flight 1549 may just give developers the momentum they need to find a solution .
NEXRAD
Weather data has been time - correlated to our accident reconstruction and does NOT indicate that the flock of birds was observed on weather radar .
Further analysis may eventually refine this hypothesis .
Other individuals have presented images of the Level II NEXRAD reflectivity data from KOKX ( New York City , NY / Upton ) at a timeslice of 202811 ( elevation angle of the slice of 0.48 degrees ) which show a " return " that is very near the aircraft 's position at the time .
Unfortunately , the NEXRAD data is recorded at approximately 10 minute intervals , which is not enough to establish a detailed local view of birds .
We have interleaved data from KDIX ( Philadelphia ) and no obvious pattern of bird movement is apparent at this time .

The Simple Physics of Birdstrikes
The Branta Canadensis has an average mass of about 3700 grams .
At the time of impact , the closure rate between Flight 1549 and the flock of birds was approximately 120 m/s [ meters per second ] .
The kinetic energy dissipated by collision with a single bird would be approximately 27,000 Joules .
This is about the same amount of energy as a 2,000 pound object traveling 17 mph .
ATC Radar Data ( ASR - 9 Radar facilities at Newark [ EWR ] and John F Kennedy [ JFK ] )
The public docket includes the continuous data recordings ( CDR ) from both JFK and EWR radar facilities .
These sites provide tracking data to the controller 's terminals which is utilized in air traffic control functions .
The raw data files contain a wealth of information such as primary returns from debris , birds , weather and other " objects " that reflect enough radar energy to be measured and recorded .
The following data entries in the FAA 's Digital Aeronautical Chart Supplement give the location and other information about the radar facilities :
STATE / CITY / ARPT .... HT...ASR ..... VAR ... ARTS ... LATITUDE ....... LONGITUDE ....ELEV
New York ( JFK ) ..... 17... ASR - 9...13 W... III ....40 38 22.4.....073 45 59.2..12
Newark ( EWR ) ............ ASR - 9...13 W.......... 40 40 23.6 .....074 11 08.7 ..
The composite image below shows all target data ( BT , RT , RB : Beacon Targets , Radar Targets and Radar Reinforced Beacon ) as extracted from the data files provided by the NTSB .
The raw data files for each radar facility are more than 1 million lines each and must be sorted and reduced into meaningful information before they can be plotted on a map .
We have created our own custom software code to handle the data parsing for this task .
Latitude and longitude coordinates recorded by the DFDR are used in creating the baseline flightpath , seen below in green .
With further processing , these datasets are combined and interpreted to create a more accurate understanding of the events on the accident flight .
Analysis of Altitude Data
There are six distinct sources of altitude information available for this accident flight .
Three of them come from onboard the aircraft via the flight data recorder , they are : Radio Altitude 1 , Radio Altitude 2 and Pressure Altitude ( Channels 24 , 25 and 23 of the DFDR , respectively ) .
In addition , the ASR - 9 Radar facility at JFK and the Newark EWR radar site have altitude information recorded which was encoded by the aircraft 's static air system .
The last source of altitude information is very limited in scope : the video footage that shows the final seconds of flight and splashdown .
Altitude information from static air sources onboard the aircraft can be erroneous when sideslip or abnormal angles of attack are encountered .
The readings will be affected by flaps , slats , airspeed and other factors .
Extensive analysis would be required to make the best estimate of the actual static pressure at which each altitude data point was generated .
Atmospheric profiles of temperature , humidity , and pressure are needed to correct these measurements and create a true altitude measurement .
Furthermore , any instrument that measures pressure will experience a lag , because it takes time for the air to enter or escape the measurement apparatus .
Another consideration is that the altitude reported by transponders is " categorized " to the nearest 100 feet .
Depending on the setup of the individual transponder , the trip point between encoded altitudes is typically from 40 to 60 feet below or above the altitude point recorded .
Trip points for the altitude encoder may be different when approaching the same altitude point from above or below .
For example , a reported altitude of [ 2,600 ] feet may be initiated at 2,560 feet during a climb profile and at 2,640 in a descent profile .
There can be hysterisis as well , where a climbing profile going up through 2,560 may cause the encoder to report [ 2,600 ] but if the aircraft again begins descending , it may continue to report [ 2,600 ] until reaching 2,540 feet , at which time it will report [ 2,500 ] .
" Radio Altitude " is the measured height of the aircraft above ground measured by timing radar pulses emitted from the radar altimeter antenna .
On the flight data recorder , this altitude channel is sampled at high rates and is typically quite accurate .
However , the height of the ground below the flight path must be accounted for in reducing the data .
A digital elevation model is loaded into the project 's workspace and the height of the ground for the flight profile can be calculated .
Many factors need to be considered in a robust analysis of radio ( radar ) altitude .
The radar altimeter will actually determine the closest return within a pseudo - conical area .
In normal flight conditions ( limited pitch and bank , ) the instrument will simply " find " the highest ground elevation point within a given radius of a ground location directly beneath the aircraft 's flightpath .
In cases of high bank and pitch , radar altitude can be erroneous due to the fact that it is not " looking " directly beneath the aircraft .
If the aircraft 's location , pitch , bank and heading are known reasonably well , a spatial analysis tool can be utilized to identify the point of terrain that will generate the shortest return path within the radar altimeter 's cone of measurement .
In collaboration with other data sources , this is a verification and refinement tool available for the accident reconstruction .
Careful alignment and scrutiny of the altitude profiles can sometimes be a crucial tool in correcting for timing errors between data sources .
Because the aircraft only traveled on one altitude profile , there are certain ways that the available data must fit to this profile .
In some situations , just a few data points can lead to important conclusions that could possibly define a timeshift between data sources .
All altitude profiles can be plotted on a single graph and shifted in time , scale and offset which results in an overall " best fit " of the true altitude profile for the accident flight .
The images below depict the alignment of these data sets as well as the ground elevation profile of the flightpath .
Audio Recordings and Transcripts
We have processed the FAA released audio files and transcripts and aligned the individual files to a composite timeline .
It is critical for the accuracy of a reconstruction to perform a detailed temporal analysis of the data , including thorough cross-referencing each transcript .
The processed audio timeline that we create will be more accurate than any single piece of information taken out of context of the overall accident timeline ..
The transcribed times from the FAA , while approximately correct , are often far from " precise " .
When each second counts and situational awareness is important , a detailed and robust approach will be the most reliable .
With the release of the cockpit voice recorder transcript ( and hopefully the audio recording itself ) , we have been able to refine our audio analysis .
Unfortunately though , the CVR transcript for the Flight 1549 accident has been mostly recorded in whole second timing .
This is likely due to the fact that the NTSB did not feel it was necessary to use sub-second accuracy due to the circumstances of the accident .
Below are the transcripts of the various radio positions involved in the accident flight , as prepared by the FAA ( or download via FTP_Flight_1549_Audio Transcripts ) .
In addition , the FAA has released the audio recordings for these positions .
Those recordings are available from the FAA website ( or download via FTP Flight 1549 MP3 audio files ) .

Philosophical Animation Issues
A challenging question arose during preparation of this animation : whether or not to include flames and trails of smoke from the engines .
Brief review of the superficial data led us to conclude that there were flames on both engines ; some passengers on both the left and right sides reported seeing anything from " flames " to a " fireball and black smoke " .
The passenger seated in 15 F even described feeling heat from the fire on the right side of the aircraft !
Many remembered a visible smoke or haze in the cabin and almost all persons onboard recalled a smell of smoke or fire .
Without the means to directly interview the witnesses , we went through the available information and collected facts related to this issue directly .
In the NTSB Survival Factor Group Chairman 's Factual Report , a summary is provided of each passenger 's interview and statement .
There were numerous reports of fire coming from each engine , passengers seated in A , B or C seats saw fire on the left side , and vice versa for seats D , E and F .
Many passengers did not report seeing the flames but did comment that they heard others say that an " engine was on fire " .
During the NTSB 's Public Hearings ( Day 1 , Day 2 , Day 3 ) , the passenger in 25A recounted :
I actually kind of got to see your image this morning , so now I think I was about right in terms of 90 to 100 seconds after we had taken off , I did not know the altitude , but there was a large explosion and sitting on the left - hand side , I was able to see out the window and I quickly , like most of the passengers , was startled because the plane shuddered and the engine , the left engine , was on fire .
I 'd flown many flights and actually -- excuse me -- had a number of friends who are -- pilots so I 'd flown a lot and I 'd seen engines sparking and a little bit of flame coming out occasionally in other aircraft , but nothing like this .
But my best description of that engine was almost a bonfire , and it continued to flame like that pretty much until we were near impact on the river .
But , as we climbed out , I think all of us were not only concerned because of the shudder and the noticeable deceleration .
I did find that we continued to ascend a little bit but there was also a very distinctive smell of jet fuel and I think that all of us in the back were a little concerned that there might be a fire , also , inside .
The witness was directly questioned if he remembered flames from the engine during the entire portion of the flight subsequent to the bird strike and he said " definitely " and that perhaps they diminished during the later portion of the flight .
An engineer from CFM International , Les McVey , was later called to the stand to testify and was queried specifically about the above quoted testimony .
McVey stated that neither engine " flamed out " during the accident and went on to describe the phenomena that would lead to visible flames from the engine following a bird strike :
What happened on this engine was the core was severely damaged and had little airflow flowing through it .
So although it could keep the core rotating at something like 80 percent speed , the fan did n't have enough airflow through that core because of the damage to power the fan .
So what we ended up with was it was feeding it fuel and the fuel was coming out the back , out of the nozzle , the core nozzle , and once it got to the oxygen on the outside it could burn there .
So you 're seeing a fire out of the nozzle which was just unburned fuel .
It did n't catch fire as would be defined for the large bird requirement .
Despite compelling witness testimony and the engineering explanation provided by McVey , a quantitative basis is needed for the fire and smoke displayed in the reconstruction .
The flight data recorder logged engine information including N1 , EGT , fuel flow and many other parameters .
We decided that the fuel flow parameter would be an appropriate " relative " indicator of the amount of flames in each engine .
Our research also turned up a video showing a bird strike event during takeoff and the subsequent engine fire .
These data were used collectively to create what we felt was the best representation of the elements of the accident sequence .
All aspects of the animation are subject to this same level of development and must be given every consideration with respect to foundation .
Collaboration with experts who have direct experience can sometimes be required .
If there is any question as to the validity of a certain element in the reconstruction , a second manifestation that removes that element may be the only answer .
Human Factors
One of the more interesting , but less discussed , subjects regarding Flight 1549 is human factors .
Obviously there is much to learn from the cockpit but there is also a lot to learn from the passengers .
The NTSB Survival Factors Group Chairman 's Report has a summary of the interviews with each passenger .
You might also enjoy reading the NTSB study on Life Vest Retrieval published May 2003 .
These documents are among the many that contain valuable insight into human performance .
To illustrate the depth to which each aspect of the accident has meaning , consider the Captain 's choice of words , " This is the Captain , brace for impact " .
If he had said " brace for water impact " , then more passengers would be prepared to don life vests or to take a seat cushion with them .
However , had he said those words , perhaps the severity of the landing would be underestimated and more people may have been injured ?
Sully 's testimony at the NTSB hearings gives some great insight into the complex thought processes that even a simple cabin announcement may entail :
I tend to think that I wish I 'd had more time to more fully apprise the flight attendants of the situation that we faced .
I probably spent some amount of time -- I would guess I had maybe four or five seconds to decide to make the announcement and what I should say and I chose my words carefully .
My highest priority , at that moment , was to avoid passenger impact injury .
I did n't know at that moment how successful I would be in trading air speed for sink rate to cushion the touchdown , so my immediate concern , my highest priority , had to be to avoid passenger injury at landing , so I chose the word impact and brace to indicate that they needed to brace themselves to avoid impact injury .
I knew that the flight attendants would do their assessment prior to opening the doors and I wish I could 've told them there was a water landing , but had I done that , they might 've begun getting people to put on life vests and not being in the brace position at impact , so it was a balancing act for the situation that we faced and the time that we had available .
The varied conditions of each accident scenario will require complete and unbiased understanding prior to drawing conclusions .
Luckily , in this accident it is apparent that the " balancing act " , by everyone , was successful in preventing the loss of life .
The Birds
The object (s ) used in this animation to represent the " birds " have been greatly simplified from the actual geometry of a canada goose , and further , is not an accurate " flock " geometry .
Like any other visual element of a reconstruction , consideration and compromise are both required with respect to the details available and the desired end result .
The birds are modeled to a scale accurate enough to allow an approximate representation of the speed with which the aircraft encounters the birds and the duration which they might be visible to the pilots .
If human factors such as visual acuity and / or see - and - avoid become an issue in this reconstruction , it will be necessary to consult with biologists and bird experts to correctly ascertain the geometry of the birds and the pattern of the flock .
Consideration would also be given to the variation in the birds ' attitude ( heading / pitch / bank ) and wing flapping motion .
A vision expert could provide a foundation for the model and the end - representation of the birds as a visual component in the reconstruction .
Furthermore , radar experts could opine on the strength and number of primary radar returns and make a determination as to the quantity of birds that may have been present .
Collaboration among experts would be beneficial to achieving the most accurate overall visual representation of the geese .
Further Thoughts and Discussion ( 2016 re-release )
Our new re-render of Flight 1549 accident in an immersive 360 - degree view at 4 K resolution .
This project has taught pilots many lessons over time and the release of Warner Bros “ Sully ” seemed seems like perfect timing to once again share this experience .
I meticulously studied the NTSB docket to prepare this reconstruction and hopefully Eastwood , Hanks , Skiles , Sully , and others took some time to review and reflect on this data - driven timeline as they worked towards accurately portraying this story .
The radar view inset is oriented to north - up and , though difficult to read , provides some spatial and situational reference at times .
This is best viewed on two monitors at once , start two copies simultaneously and use one for radar reference and the other for exploring .
Alternative , use this video on screen number two , it 's an excellent visual of the dialog of all facilities .
On a desktop computer , click - drag to look around .
On a phone , click drag with your finger , or point your phone if it has accelerometers .
If you have Samsung Gear VR , Google Cardboard , Oculus , or other 3D gear , you ’re in for a treat .
You CAN see the birds coming before they hit , listen for when the controller just says “ everyday ” and then look to the north , ahead of the aircraft , the birds will hit about 12 seconds later .
Before further discussion , I want to acknowledge the excellent reactions and temperament of both Jeff Skiles ( the copilot , a.k.a.
“ First Officer ) , and Patrick Harten ( the Air Traffic Controller working the New York Departure frequency at the time of the accident ) .
Readers would do well reviewing their testimony , and that of others , available in the NTSB docket as well as the transcripts , video testimony , and accident timeline .
There is much more to learn than what we all see in the news .
Some important points :
1 ) Yes , he could have made it back to LaGuardia or to Teterboro , but only if he turned immediately and even then , it was n’t going to be guaranteed .
2 ) Yes , the birds were available on raw radar returns .
No , FAA / ATC do n’t have adequate systems for processing this “ noisy ” data .
Yes , it is completely feasible to further process raw data and recognize the signatures of birds from primary radar returns .
When reconstructing the accident and doing a best - fit analysis , I was able to predict and subsequently confirm the time of collision to within a few seconds .
3 ) Sully and Skiles had met for the first time a few days prior and this was their first flight together .
Skiles had never flown this particular model of aircraft except in a simulator .
These two facts alone speak volumes about the training and policies that airlines use .
4 ) Both Sully and ATC incorrectly called the flight number as 1529 or 1539 ( 1549 being the actual number ) .
5 ) At least one of the flight crew and at least one passenger commented that they did not know the aircraft landed on water and assumed they were back at LaGuardia .
6 ) Skiles did an awesome job of reverting to checklists , supporting the Captain with information callouts , and doing what a crewmember does best – collaborative problem solving .
7 ) There was NO checklist for dual engine failure at low altitude and the only available checklist was designed for use at high altitudes where the pilots would have plenty of time to troubleshoot .
As a result of this accident , US Airline Pilots Association made the recommendation that all procedures be re-written with logical “ opt - out ” points for example to get right to the point if time is of the essence .
8 ) Many people scoff at Harten , the ATC voice who suggested Newark was at 2 O’Clock and 7 miles , while the aircraft was at a few hundred feet and obviously not going to make Newark .
Mr. Harten , however , noticed the aircraft gaining altitude on radar and thought they may have regained power and was offering up options .
The aircraft gained 150 feet of altitude just prior to landing as they deployed flaps and slowed down , trading airspeed for energy .
Please review all facets of a complex event before forming opinions .
9 ) Skiles actually read and acknowledged a checklist item “ ATC notify , squawk 7700 ” – pilot speak for setting the plane to issue an emergency signal .
However , neither Skiles nor Sullenberger actually set the transponder to 7700 .
As a result , the NTSB made an important recommendation to ATC , that they could * assign * a 7700 code to an aircraft .
This is an obvious functionality that unfortunately was n’t possible 2009 .
The emergency code makes it easier for all involved to see the aircraft on traffic control displays .
10 ) Sully declared a “ Mayday ” which is an official way to let ATC know this is a real emergency , but the transmission was blocked for a few seconds and ATC never heard the mayday .
Air Traffic Control never heard him say “ Mayday ” which might have been helpful .
11 ) ATC called the aircraft “ Cactus ” , which goes back to the roots of US Airways in Airzona ( America West ) .
Unfortunately , this confused the port authority .
Precious time was lost .
12 ) Every airline passenger probably remembers hearing at least one safety briefing and that you should “ turn around , your closest exit may be behind you ” .
In this accident , many people egressed the aircraft from an exit door that was NOT their closest .
Additional rafts at the rear of the aircraft were unusable .
13 ) One passenger responded to a survey question “ Did the pre-flight safety presentation help during the evacuation ? ” as follows : “ I was asleep . ”
Please pay attention and be prepared .
14 ) Many passengers did n’t bother , or could not successfully , retrieve a life vest prior to evacuation .
One of the most hotly debated issues I ’ve seen is whether or not 1549 could have returned to LaGuardia or diverted successfully to Teterboro .
Airbus and the NTSB collaborated on an effort to have pilots attempt this in the engineering simulator at Airbus facilities in France .
Of all 15 trials , six pilots attempted returned to LGA runway 22 and two of those made it .
Seven attempted return to LGA runway 13 and five made it .
Two attempted diversion to TEB and one made it .
All in all , about half of the pilots made it to a runway but the other half did n’t do so well .
NO PILOTS made a successful runway landing with ANY delay in turning directly to the intended runway ( i.e .
If they took ANY time to make a decision where to go , they wasted valuable energy to reach the intended destination and landed short ) .
Capt .
Sullenberger gave consideration to turning to Teterboro .
This is observed in the reconstruction around 2029Z , you can see him dip the right wing to have a better look at TEB .
FO Skiles has remarked that he was concerned when the Captain took a look , but of course we all know they did n’t proceed to TEB and instead chose to ditch the aircraft in the Hudson River .
It was immediately after Sully and Skiles assessed , and declined , the option of a TEB landing that the passengers heard “ This is the Captain , brace for impact ” and Sully subsequently told ATC “ We ’re gonna be in the Hudson ” .
For further FACTUAL discussion on this topic , the reader should follow - up on a FOIA which I issued to NTSB requesting the detailed data from the engineering simulations .
The idea was to explore the importance of decision timelines and optionality in emergency situations as well as the fundamental airspeed / altitude / energy questions that are so challenging to convey in flight instruction .
Unfortunately , I had to abandon this FOIA and never was able to study my hypotheses .
My belief and understanding , based on reviewing the available NTSB / Airbus report , is that the 20 to 30 second delay in assessing the situation was an important deciding factor and that Sully and Skiles probably made a good piloting decision to sink a $ 40 M aircraft in the Hudson …. not an easy choice .
I have presented this accident along with hour - long open discussion forums to a number of groups .
In doing so , several Boeing pilots have suggested that the engines could have made some power even though the fans were severely damaged , and that perhaps the computers prematurely shut them down .
I ’m doubtful of this , but it ’s one of hundreds of talking points that make an event like this such a wonderful learning opportunity for all of us .

For two weeks we ’ve been listening to the story of the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia — a media tempest in an English teapot .
And all the time the biggest scandal has been directly under our noses .
This afternoon at Copenhagen a document mysteriously leaked from the UN Secretariat .
It was first reported from the Guardian , and by the time it was posted online it oddly had my name scrawled all across the top — I do n’t know why , because I did n’t leak it .
My suspicion , though , is because it confirms something I ’ve been writing for weeks .
The cuts in emissions that countries are proposing here are nowhere near good enough to meet even their remarkably weak target of limiting temperature rise to two degrees Celsius .
In fact , says the UN in this leaked report , the cuts on offer now produce a rise of at least three degrees , and a CO2 concentration of at least 550 ppm , not the 350 scientists say we need , or even the weak 450 that the US supposedly supports .
In other words , this entire conference is an elaborate sham , where the organizers have known all along that they ’re heading for a very different world than the one they ’re supposedly creating .
It ’s intellectual dishonesty of a very high order , and with very high consequences .
And it ’s probably come too late to derail the stage management — tomorrow Barack Obama will piously intone that he ’s committed to a two degree temperature target .
But he is n’t — and now he ca n’t even say it with a straight face .

A prominent Columbia architecture professor punched a female university employee in the face at a Harlem bar during a heated argument about race relations , cops said yesterday .
Police busted Lionel McIntyre , 59 , for assault yesterday after his bruised victim , Camille Davis , filed charges .
McIntyre and Davis , who works as a production manager in the school ’s theater department , are both regulars at Toast , a popular university bar on Broadway and 125th Street , sources said .
The professor , who is black , had been engaged in a fiery discussion about “ white privilege ” with Davis , who is white , and another male regular , who is also white , Friday night at 10:30 when fists started flying , patrons said .
McIntyre , who is known as “ Mac ” at the bar , shoved Davis , and when the other patron and a bar employee tried to break it up , the prof slugged Davis in the face , witnesses said .
“ The punch was so loud , the kitchen workers in the back heard it over all the noise , ” bar back Richie Velez , 28 , told The Post .
“ I was on my way over when he punched Camille and she fell on top of me . ”
The other patron involved in the dispute said McIntyre then took a swing at him after he yelled , “ You do n’t hit a woman ! ”
“ He knocked the glasses right off my face , ” said the man , who would only give his first name as “ Shannon . ”
“ The punch came out of nowhere .
Mac was talking to us about white privilege and what I was doing about it — apparently I was n’t doing enough . ”
McIntyre had squabbled with Davis several weeks earlier over issues involving race , witnesses said .
As soon as the professor threw the punch Friday , server Rob Dalton and another employee tossed him out .
“ It was a real sucker punch , ” Dalton said .
“ Camille ’s a great lady , always nice to everybody , and does n’t deserve anything like this . ”
Davis was spotted wearing sunglasses yesterday to conceal the black eye .
Reached at her Columbia office , she declined to comment on the alleged attack .
McIntyre was released without bail at his arraignment last night .
“ It was a very unfortunate event , ” he said afterwards .
“ I did n’t mean for it to explode the way it did . ”

One thing I ’ve noticed in hunting for a job recently is the number of companies that insist that you write them a code sample to spec .
Not just any code sample , but a fully functional , complete application .
This is absurd , for several reasons .
Eli
White spends a good deal of time arguing why coding tests are bad .
I wo n’t rehash that here .
My biggest pet peeve with these types of tests is this : there are a lot of companies out there , and I ’m sending out resumes to each one that I can find .
I simply do not have the time to write fifteen code samples a day , just because you want to evaluate me against your coding test .
Period .
Joel Spolsky talks about how it ’s important to ask developers to write code during their interview .
But he also goes into detail about how he interprets this in his own company : namely , he asks people to write functions during the interview .
He does n’t administer a coding test .
He wants to see how people think , how they respond to critique , and how they come up with solutions .
He likens the coding test to asking a plumber or an electrician to provide some sort of proof that they ’re capable .
But asking a programmer to write a complete application for you is like asking an electrician to build a small electrical grid for you before they work on your house .
Can you imagine if every plumber had to prove that they could snake pipes before they could work on someone ’s plumbing ?
Plumbers would be even harder to get to your house than they are today .
Asking a developer to write an application for you before you ’ve made a formal offer of employment is also disingenuous , and disrespectful .
It ’s disingenuous to the value of their time , and disrespectful , especially to mid- and senior - level candidates , because it assumes that they do n’t have an understanding of the language and they must prove to you otherwise .
A coding sample , in the case of a mid-level developer , or a quick few phone calls , in the case of a senior developer , should establish pretty quickly as to whether or not they ’re qualified .
A coding test also does n’t identify the most important aspect of a programmer : whether or not they ’re capable of learning .
A fantastic test might represent their place now , but it does n’t represent their ability to adapt to changing environments .
The number of frameworks and projects in PHP should be evidence enough that the language is constantly evolving , and that we ’re going to need people who can learn and adapt .
For those who administer coding tests , please reconsider what you ’re doing .
For junior developers , they ’re fabulous tools .
But for anyone who has a body of code samples all ready to go , ask for one .
Ask a few technical questions that require code in an interview .
And make your decision based on how they think , how they learn , and how competent they are .
Frustrated with your company ’s development practices ?
You do n't have to be !
No matter what the issues are , they can be fixed .
You can begin to shed light on these issues with my handy checklist .
Plus , I 'll help you with strategies to approach the issues at the organization level and " punch above your weight . "

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) has decried government " handouts " as socialism , but an Environmental Working Group analysis of farm subsidies shows that the Bachmann family farm , managed by her father - in - law until his recent death , received $ 251,000 in farm payments between 1995 and 2006 .
Bachmann 's stake in the Wisconsin farm is worth as much as $ 250,000 .
Is Bachmann being hypocritical , or is she a principled conservative working in a broken system ?
Bachmann is a " welfare queen " : Michele Bachmann is a an anti-subsidy " tea bagger " by day , says Yasha Levine in Truthdig , and a hypocritical " welfare queen " by night .
" If American farms such as hers were forced to compete in the global free market , they would collapse . "
Bachmann says President Obama 's health - care reform and other initiatives are part of a socialist takeover , but she 's the one " padding her bank account with taxpayer money . "
" Michele Bachmann : Welfare queen "
Obama 's the hypocrite , not Bachmann :
It 's stupid to call Michele Bachmann a welfare queen , says Stephen Spruiell in National Review .
" Bachmann voted against reauthorizing the farm bill in 2008 .
Barack Obama is the one who has flip - flopped -- after originally calling subsidies a " mutlimillion - dollar giveaway " for " big agribusiness , " he " supported the awful 2008 farm bill anyway for crass political reasons . "
" Gotcha stupidity "
Anti-competitive farm subsidies are the real problem : Michele Bachmann is n't the only hypocrite , says Alex Knapp in Outside the Beltway .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) has also warned about Obama 's " trend toward socialism , " yet his family has received $ 1 million in federal handouts over 11 years .
And there are plenty of Democrats who 've collected , too .
It 's wrong for politicians of any stripe to cash in on subsidies , especially when they discourage competition and benefit wealthy , big farmers at the expense of smaller competitors .
" Members of Congress receive useless subsidies ( apart from their salaries ) "

* UPDATE :
Now with actual ( incredible ) crash footage !
( and no , we do n't see any pelicans , either )
WARNING :
This is one of the saddest , yet most amusing sights we 've ever seen .
A $ 1.6 million Bugatti Veyron sitting in a salt water lagoon , door open , in two feet of nasty , corrosion - inducing muddy water .
While the sight is sad , how the event allegedly transpired is downright hilarious .
The unnamed owner of the vehicle , traveling through Galveston , Texas to look at some high - end property , was reportedly talking on his cell phone when a low - flying pelican distracted him .
The driver swerved to avoid the big bird , dropped his cell phone , and in the process the front passenger tire hit a mud patch .
A quad - turbo , 16 - cylinder engine may be able to get you to 60 mph in under three seconds , but it does n't work well with mud , so the supercar made a b - line for an adjacent lagoon .
The ultra rare Veyron ( reportedly one of 15 copies here in the States ) was still running after it rested nearly belt - line high in the salt water , as local news affiliate KHOU reported the 1,000 + hp engine " gurgled like an outboard motor for about 15 minutes before it died . "
It probably would have been a great idea to kill power to the engine ( and even shut the door ) once the Veyron hit the muck , but hey , what do we know ?
Hit the jump to watch video of the Veyron as it is extracted from its salty abyss .
And if you own a Veyron , let this be a lesson to you that having money does n't necessarily mean you have the skill to drive a supercar , especially when you 're on the phone .
Thanks to everyone for the tips !
Secondvideo contains explicit not - safe - for - work language .
The European Commission analysis of ACTA 's Internet chapter has leaked , indicating that the U.S. is seeking to push laws that extend beyond the WIPO Internet treaties and beyond current European Union law ( the EC posted the existence of the document last week but refused to make it publicly available ) .
The document contains detailed comments on the U.S. proposal , confirming the U.S. desire to promote a three - strikes and you 're out policy , a Global DMCA , harmonized contributory copyright infringement rules , and the establishment of an international notice - and - takedown policy .
The document confirms that the U.S. proposal contains seven sections :
Paragraph 1 – General obligations .
These focus on " effective enforcement procedures " with expeditious remedies that deter further infringement .
The wording is similar to TRIPs Article 41 , however , the EU notes that unlike the international treaty provisions , there is no statement that procedures shall be fair , equitable , and / or proportionate .
In other words , it seeks to remove some of the balance in the earlier treaties .
Paragraph 2 – Third party liability .
The third party liability provisions focus on copyright , though the EU notes that it could ( should ) be extended to trademark and perhaps other IP infringement .
The goal of this section is to create an international minimum harmonization regarding the issue of what is called in some Member States " contributory copyright infringement " .
The U.S. proposal would include " inducement " into the standard , something established in the U.S. Grokster case , but not found in many other countries .
This would result in a huge change in domestic law in many countries ( including Canada ) as the EU notes it goes beyond current eu law .
Paragraph 3 – Limitations on 3rd Party Liability .
This section spells out how an ISP may qualify for a safe harbour from the liability established in the earlier section .
These include an exemption for technical processes such as caching .
As reported earlier , ACTA would establish a required notice - and - takedown system , which goes beyond Canadian law ( and beyond current EU law ) .
Moreover , ACTA clearly envisions opening the door to a three - strikes and you 're out model , as the EU document states :
EU understands that footnote 6 provides for an example of a reasonable policy to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of protected materials .
However , the issue of termination of subscriptions and accounts has been subject to much debate in several Member States .
Furthermore , the issue of whether a subscription or an account may be terminated without prior court decision is still subject to negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Telecoms Ministers regarding the Telecoms Package .
Paragraph 4 – Anti-circumvention Provisions .
ACTA would require civil and criminal penalties associated with anti-circumvention provisions ( legal protection for digital locks ) .
The EU notes that this goes beyond the requirements of the WIPO Internet treaties and beyond current EU law which " leaves a reasonable margin of discretion to Member States . "
The EU also notes that there is no link between the anti-circumvention provisions and copyright exceptions .
The U.S. proposal also requires the anti-circumvention provisions to apply to TPMs that merely protect access to a work ( rather than reproduction or making available ) .
This would again go beyond current EU law to include protection against circumventing technologies like region coding on DVDs .
From a Canadian perspective , none of this is currently domestic law .
As previously speculated , the clear intent is to establish a Global DMCA .
Paragraph 5 – Civil and Criminal Enforcement of Anti-Circumvention .
This section requires both civil and criminal provisions for the anti-circumvention rules , something not found in the WIPO Internet treaties .
The anti-circumvention provisions are also designed to stop countries from establishing interoperability requirements ( ie. the ability for consumers to play purchased music on different devices ) .
The EU notes that this not consistent with its law , which states " Compatibility and interoperability of the different systems should be encouraged . "
Of course , might reasonable ask why such a provision is even in ACTA .
Paragraph 6 – Rights Management Information protection .
This section includes similar criminal and civil requirements for rights management information .
Paragraph 7 – Limitations to Rights Management Information protection .
In summary , the EU analysis confirms the earlier leak ( though the Internet chapter has seven sections , rather than five ) .
The fears about the U.S. intent with respect to ACTA are confirmed – extending the WIPO Internet treaties , creating a Global DMCA , promoting a three - strikes and you 're out model , even stopping efforts to create interoperability mandates .
ACTA would render current Canadian copyright law virtually unrecognizable as the required changes go far beyond our current rules ( and even those contemplated in prior reform bills ) .
This begs the question of whether the Department of Foreign Affairs negotiation mandate letter really goes this far given the domestic changes that would be required .
This latest leak also reinforces the need for all governments to come clean – releasing both the ACTA text and government analysis of the treaty should be a condition of any further participation in the talks .
The Department of Defense has identified 927 American service members who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans on Tuesday :
KROPOV , Serge , 21 , Pfc. , Marines ; Hawley , Pa. ; First Marine Expeditionary Force .
WARE , Albert D. , 27 , Sgt. , Army ; Chicago ; 82nd Airborne Divi-

This is a case of “ photographer photographs photographer . ”
The following photographs were taken by photographer Hans van de Vorst at the Grand Canyon , Arizona .
The descriptions are his own .
The identity of the photographer IN the photos is unknown .
“ I was simply stunned seeing this guy standing on this solitary rock IN the Grand Canyon .
The canyon ’s depth is 900 meters here .
The rock on the right is next to the canyon and safe .
Watching this guy on his thong sandals , with a camera and a tripod I asked myself 3 questions :
How did he climb that rock ?
Why not taking that sunset picture on that rock to the right , which is perfectly safe ?
How will he get back ? ”

WASHINGTON -- Punditry in the nation 's capital has its own rhythms , and one common practice involves almost everyone beating up on the same politician at the same time .
Such assaults are rarely about ideology , though I have found that liberals or Democrats are often the object of these sustained attacks , perhaps because journalists are overly sensitive to charges of liberal bias .
There 's nothing like hitting a Democrat hard to " prove " impartiality .
For quite a while , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was the target of choice .
She was cast as a " San Francisco liberal " out of touch with the " real America . "
Everything about her , from her speaking style ( fluid in small groups , stilted with larger crowds ) to her taste in clothes ( female politicians always face this ) , became the object of analysis and disparagement .
But the beauty of journalism is that reality eventually has to intrude on analysis .
It has become quite clear that Pelosi is far less a " San Francisco liberal " than a " Tommy D'Alesandro Democrat . "
That would be a reference to her dad , the former mayor of Baltimore , a highly practical local politician more concerned with delivering the goods than with passing ideological litmus tests .
Pelosi turns out to be adept doing whatever needs to be done to produce House majorities for Democratic goals .
She is a liberal , of course , but she is the House speaker first .
Her standing has now risen to the point that Time magazine had her listed as a runner - up for Person of the Year .
With Pelosi off the hook , the Washington press corps needed a new goat , and along came Harry Reid .
The Senate majority leader , it should be said , sometimes makes it easy for his critics .
He can be irascible , and has no qualms about yelling at journalists .
( It 's happened to me . )
He is not always careful with words .
Earlier this month , he at least implied that Republicans were slow on the slavery issue , an odd charge since opposition to slavery was the passion that animated the founding of the GOP .
( In those days , most Democrats were , as we might put it now , bad on the slavery issue . )
And , yes , Reid criticized my friend David Broder .
It 's true that Reid was hitting back , since David is not wild about Harry .
Nonetheless , I dearly love Broder , as does everyone who has ever worked with him .
Still , there is a rote quality to the attacks on Reid that flies in the face of what he 's actually accomplished .
The simple truth is that Reid did what much of wise Washington thought was impossible :
He united the entire Democratic caucus , from Joe Lieberman to Bernie Sanders , to support a health care bill that is the most far - reaching piece of social legislation since the 1960s .
He confronts an unprecedented form of Republican obstruction -- yes , it 's really unprecedented , you can look it up .
Even Olympia Snowe , that most moderate of Republicans , refused to negotiate unless Reid postponed action on the bill , a delay that would very likely have led to its death .
You bet he made deals , including the now highly controversial buy - out of Nebraska 's extra Medicaid costs to win the 60th vote for the bill from Sen. Ben Nelson .
You should notice this about political analysis :
When a writer admires a wheeler - dealer , he or she inevitably compares that politician to Lyndon B. Johnson and typically asks :
Why can't others be more like LBJ ?
When a writer wants to condemn exactly the same sort of horse - trading , LBJ recedes and some other metaphor -- the popular one now is " Chicago - style politics " -- is wielded to imply highly unprincipled behavior .
With just a few keystrokes , shrewd pragmatism is transformed into terribly sinful activity .
Lord knows , I do n't blame Republicans in the least for being mad at Harry Reid .
He beat them at their own game .
In our great republic , Republicans are free to call him any name they wish between now and the next election -- and they will .
Those who aspire to be nonpartisan , however , need to pause in their excoriations of Reid long enough to note that he pulled off something very big .
Sen .
Tom Harkin may have been a little over the top when he praised Reid last week for " the patience of Job , the wisdom of Solomon and the endurance of Samson . "
But for now , at least , credit him with the toughness of LBJ , the listening skills of Tip O'Neill , and the canniness of Sam Rayburn .
He deserves that much .

USA TODAY 's Supreme Court correspondent Joan Biskupic says the court today has agreed to decide whether a state law school can refuse to recognize a Christian student group because the group excludes gay students and non-believers .
Here is her file :
The justices accepted an appeal from a Christian Legal Society chapter at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco , which said the society 's limited membership breaches the school 's anti-discrimination policy .
The society claims Hastings ' refusal to recognize it violates the society 's First Amendment right of expressive association .
By accepting the case to be heard next spring , the justices have agreed to navigate complicated terrain on how neutral rules may affect religious groups .
In urging the justices to take up the CLS appeal , the National Association of Evangelicals deemed the dispute " an important case about religious liberty affecting the ... rights of thousands of religious student groups at university campuses throughout the nation . "
Hastings , which had urged the justices to let stand a lower court decision favoring the school , says all campus organizations , religious or otherwise , have a simple choice :
If they want to be formally recognized , which gives them access to some school resources and travel funds , they must comply with the school 's non-discrimination policy ; if they do not , groups may exclude whomever they choose .
Both sides in the Hastings dispute say the Christian society is the only group on that campus that ever refused to abide by the non-discrimination policy .
The Christian Legal Society , founded in 1961 , is a nationwide association of law students and lawyers .
According to its appeal , " Its purposes include providing a means of society , fellowship , and nurture among Christian lawyers ; encouraging , disciplining , and aiding Christian law students ; promoting justice , religious liberty and biblical conflict resolution ; and encouraging lawyers to furnish legal services to the poor . "
The group opposes homosexuality and " unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle . "
After the chapter applied for travel funds , Hastings officials determined that the group 's mission violated the school 's non-discrimination policy , particularly religion and sexual orientation provisions .
Americans United for Separation of Church and State urged the high court to use the case to make it clear that groups seeking public funding and official recognition on public college campuses must be open to all .

" At some point I think players have to understand that there are certain risks that are involved , and if you decide that you want to go out and play football , then you 've got to understand that part of that means you 're going to break some bones and you may have some head injuries .
But if you try to eliminate all of those things , then we 're no longer playing football . "
as saying , I do n't disagree that players should be prepared for injuries and they have to accept that potential injuries are a part of the game .
Nor do I disagree that you can't completely eliminate hard hits and the associated injuries from football without watering the game down and removing the elements that have made it so popular with fans .
Rather , the disagreement lies with the ( unintentional * ) implication this statement creates that head injuries are an unavoidable part of the game that players just have to accept in order to play .
Fact is that there are several steps that could easily be taken to lessen the danger of sustaining a head injury without affecting the on - field play .
Dr. Gerald Maher , the team dentist for the New England Patriots , has designed a mouthpiece that dramatically reduces concussions caused by hits to the jaw .
In fact , according to Mayer , this simple device has virtually eliminated concussions of that type for players who have worn them .
The NFL itself has stated that approximately 70 % of concussions are caused by blows to the chin .
Which is why it is especially puzzling that the NFL has continually rebuffed Dr. Maher 's efforts to initiate a relationship with them .
Additionally , in spite of all the rules the NFL has concerning things as mundane as the type of socks a player can wear , they have steadfastly refused to mandate the use of concussion reducing helmets , despite their availability .
There are currently several helmets on the market that incorporate alternative designs in order to reduce factors which contribute to brain injuries .
One such helmet , the Riddell Revolution has been proven in independent studies to lesson the risk of concussions by as much as 31 % .
Both of these technical advances could potentially eliminate many of the concussions players suffer without eliminating any of the spectacular hits that fans pay to see each week , simply by reducing the amount of force that is transferred to players brains by those impacts .
More importantly in relation to Aikman 's comment , are the non equipment - related issues surrounding concussion risk .
Just the act of allowing a concussion to heal properly is a major key to avoiding further complications from head trauma .
Additionally , it has been shown that returning too soon leaves players even more susceptible to another concussion .
However , the tape it up and get back in there mentality is common among football players .
As a result , many players feel pressured to return before they are fully healed or even to not report concussions at all .
Just one example of this was when Brian Westbrook , of the Philadelphia Eagles , attempted to play less than two weeks after sustaining a major concussion against the Redskins .
Westbrook subsequently suffered another concussion and has since said that he contemplated retirement , as a result .
As was evident from the negative reactions of their teammates when Ben Roethlisberger and Kurt Warner skipped games after a concussion , that pressure to play at any cost is hardly an isolated situation within the NFL .
One of the biggest stumbling blocks to addressing concussion - related issues is the prevalence of those attitudes among the league 's players .
Such a mentality is n't so bad when you have a sprained ankle or a broken finger , but it 's a lot different when you are talking about brain injuries .
Limping in your old age does n't even begin to compare to not being able to function because your brain is scrambled .
The onus is of course on the National Football League to ensure proper equipment is available and to compel players to use that equipment .
A business that generates eight billion dollars a year marketing its players should have the foresight to ensure those players are n't taken out of the game prematurely by injuries that are preventable .
Obviously , the players also have a huge personal stake in preventing unnecessary injuries .
Which is all the more reason Troy Aikman , who himself had to retire early because of repeated concussions , should know better than to perpetuate those attitudes which have prevented players from properly dealing with concussion symptoms .* Aikman was discussing the over - regulation of hits on QB's , rather than concussions , specifically .
As stated , this article relates to the implications of his statement , not the actual intent .
As a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom , and a veteran of sorts of the antiwar movement , I feel that the left as a whole has done a poor job of speaking to veterans .
This is unfortunate considering they are an extremely important resource and could be great allies in our fight for democracy and freedom for the people of America and the world .
We must find a way to communicate with them without parroting rhetoric that is frankly inapplicable to today ’s military and today ’s war .
When we protest war , do we protest the war itself , the warrior , or the people who truly started the war in the first place ?
Vets feel they are being protested as well as the war .
How can we separate the war from the warrior ?
It ’s like trying to dissociate a shoe from a shoemaker or an exterminator from their poison .
Soldiering requires a high level of training and skill .
It also requires a sense of honor , self - sacrifice , courage , duty and loyalty – noble values that we on the left hold in high esteem as we work for peace and justice .
However , in our zeal for opposing war , we often have failed to recognize these positive traits in U.S. soldiers .
We often generalize and dehumanize them .
However , we can all agree that most soldiers are certainly not psychotic killers who enjoy death and suffering .
If this were the case , then why are the VA hospitals filling up with people horribly traumatized with PTSD , their humanity and consciousness scarred ?
For the rest of their lives , veterans will experience guilt , horror , terror , confusion and anger .
And yet , these scars validate their humanity .
Soldiers are good people who have gone through hell .
By all accounts they should be considered victims , although their pride would never let them accept our pity .
So why do they fight unpopular wars ?
The reason is simple .
Soldiers themselves correctly point out that they did not choose the war , therefore we cannot hold them responsible for the facts of the war .
They have no control over where they go , who they fight , and when they return .
They can literally do nothing about their lot , and , despite the screeching on the far left , it is delusional for us to believe that soldiers will commit mass disobedience against this or any war .
In any case , such disobedience would lead to the military clamping down on civil rights and possibly cutting us off from the soldiers completely .
We must face the fact that massive disobedience is simply not practical or possible in an all - volunteer military .
Soldiers operate under too many rules and they have been trained too well for this to ever occur .
In our rhetoric , we must therefore be sure to separate soldiers from the war .
But what do we tell a soldier who has just come back from Iraq – who has seen combat for three years , has had many friends killed for what feels like no reason , and comes home to a lukewarm welcome and a broken - down VA system that leaves them out in the cold ?
How do we reach them ?
How can we gain the trust of those who believe that we hate them because we dislike the war they fight ?
Who believe that we “ hate America ” because we dislike some of its leaders and major aspects of its economic structure ?
How do we address soldiers experiencing alienation from the society they once belonged to ?
Their dissatisfaction can be fodder for right - wing extremist groups .
Such groups are working to recruit these alienated and troubled soldiers and Marines and twist them into foot - soldiers of hate and death .
Or they are tricking them into Quixotic crusades for unrealistic candidates like Ron Paul and his “ libertarian ” circus .
This trend may have terrible consequences for the future of this country .
We may be moving toward a similar situation as the one in post - World - War - I Germany when legions of disaffected German soldiers were recruited by fascist thugs to fight progressive reforms and help turn Germany into a fascist state .
Today , the myriad “ tea party ” groups , whose anger at any kind of progressive reform is to some degree fueled by closeted racism , are feeding the feelings of victimhood already present in many soldiers .
To reach veterans , disaffected and otherwise , we must clearly communicate the nature of war , the Iraq War in particular , and their role in it without attacking their honor or dignity , or else we lose their ear .
We must separate them from the war without lying to them or talking down to them .
We must explain the truth :
– Soldiers fight and die in wars to secure natural resources and captive markets for capitalists to exploit .
– Most wars fought over the last 200 years have had nothing to do with freedom or democracy .
– As working - class Americans they share a common brotherhood with 90 percent of the world .
They share a deeper brotherhood with the average Iraqi than almost nine - tenths of the U.S. Congress by this simple class measure – a Congress that sends young men and women to kill , fight and die so that they can secure profits for large multinational corporations and the “ defense ” industry .
We must do this without the conversation devolving into superficial liberalism or pacifism .
It is not enough for them to think “ killing is wrong ” and leave it at that .
This would be ignoring the bigger picture and doing them a great disservice .
They must be told about the nature and origin of war and imperialism truthfully and scientifically so they can decide for themselves about war and why they feel so much doubt and alienation .
We must communicate that we do not hate America when we disagree with policies of its leaders and their marriage to big business .
We must communicate the class roots of warfare and the veterans ’ role in it .
We must tell them that it is morally right to use their freedom of speech to talk about their experiences .
We must convince them that we are fighting FOR them if not WITH them .
Most of all , veterans need to hear that values of honor , self sacrifice , courage , duty , and loyalty – their values – are needed to fight for democracy and freedom here at home .
We need them to help us build a better future for America , and to bring peace at last for the rest of the world .
A shy tree - dwelling monkey with a black face and long brown fur , the kipunji ( key - POON - jee ) was unknown to science until 2003 , when it was discovered in a remote region of southern Tanzania .

The most extensive DNA study to - date of Africa 's rarest monkey reveals that the species had an intriguing sexual past .
Of the last two remaining populations of the recently discovered kipunji , one population shows evidence of past mating with baboons while the other does not , says a new study in Biology Letters .
The results may help to set conservation priorities for this critically endangered species , researchers say .
A shy tree - dwelling monkey with a black face and long brown fur , the kipunji ( key - POON - jee ) was unknown to science until 2003 , when it was discovered in a remote region of southern Tanzania .
Until recently , little was known about its biology except what scientists could glean from observations and a single specimen found in a farmer 's trap .
The first analyses revealed that kipunji represented an entirely new genus of primate , Rungwecebus .
Now , thanks to additional DNA samples collected from dung and tissue — the most extensive genetic data to date — scientists have a more complete picture of the genetic makeup of this monkey .
The kipunji is found in two tiny forest fragments totaling less than 7 square miles , researchers explained .
Of the last two remaining populations , one is in Tanzania 's Southern Highlands , and the other lies 250 miles away in a mountain range called the Udzungwas .
Armed with six dung samples from the Udzungwas - the first ever genetic material from this population - and two additional tissue samples from the Southern Highlands , the researchers were able to reconstruct the genetic relationships between these populations and kipunji's closest kin .
Confirming other reports , the Southern Highlands population contained bits of DNA that are similar to baboons .
This suggests that the two species interbred at some point after they diverged , researchers explained .
" Way back in time in the evolutionary history of this population there was at least one event where there was some cross-fertilization with a baboon , " said study author Tim Davenport of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
In contrast , the researchers discovered that the Udzungwa population showed no traces of baboon DNA .
" We thought the DNA from the second population would match the first one , but instead we got something quite different , " said first author Trina Roberts of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham , NC .
Mating across the species barrier is n't unheard of in the animal kingdom .
" We usually think of species ' genomes as being contained and not sharing with each other , but sometimes one species picks up genetic material from another through interbreeding , " said Roberts .
" It 's as if the genomes are a little leaky . "
The findings help to settle a debate over kipunji's status as a new genus of primate .
" They 're still separate taxa — they 're not baboons , they 're still kipunji , " said co-author Bill Stanley of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago .
" But there 's a little bit of baboon DNA that shows up when you analyze their DNA . "
Their results may also help to set conservation priorities for this critically endangered monkey .
Much of the kipunji's remaining habitat is threatened by deforestation for farming and other uses , the researchers explained .
" There 's a lot of pressure on the forest for natural resources - food , medicine , fuel , and building materials , " said Davenport .
" Part of the challenge we have is making sure the forest is n't degraded any further . "
Census data indicate there are just over 1,100 individuals left in the wild , said Davenport .
Of these , roughly 1,000 live in the Southern Highlands , and 100 remain in the Udzungwas .
Both populations may require habitat protection if we are to preserve the genetic diversity of the species , researchers said .
" Udzungwa is a tiny population , " said Roberts .
" What we 've shown is that it is substantially different from the first population .
We may not be able to resurrect it by simply transplanting kipunji from one population to the other , " Roberts said .
" If we were to lose it we might in fact lose the true kipunji genome forever , " she added .
" Does the baboon DNA help to explain why there are differences in number between the two populations , or is just a remnant of evolutionary history ? " asked Davenport .
" It 's too early to say , but it 's something we 're looking at . "
" We have two separate populations that are slightly genetically different , so until we learn more it is extremely important that we maintain both of them , " Davenport said .
" It might be that those genetic differences have an impact on their survival in the future . "

The Connecticut senator said that a government official in the Yemeni capital told him that " Iraq was yesterday 's war , Afghanistan is today 's war .
If we do n't act preemptively , Yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
ADVERTISEMENT
Lieberman , who is known to be hawkish on security issues , said that Yemen needs to be a focal point because two recent attacks were linked back to a growing al - Qaeda presence there .
Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan -- the Army officer who killed 13 people in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in November -- was linked to Anwar al - Awlaki , a radical Muslim cleric now based in Yemen .
The senator said that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the 23 - year - old Nigerian accused of attempting to set off a plastic - explosive device aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Friday , " reached out to Yemen " but was " not sure " if he contacted al - Awlaki .
Abdulmutallab reportedly told authorities he traveled to Yemen and met al - Qaida figures there .
The U.S. earlier this month launched cruise missiles at two al - Qaeda targets in Yemen .
The attacks represented a major escalation of U.S. efforts against al - Qaeda in Yemen .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) , also on Fox , agreed that preemptive strikes should be " one [ option ] we ought to be considering " but added that " it 's a big , complex subject . "
Concerns about Yemen as a breeding ground for extremists have quickly grown since Christmas Day , when Abdulmutallab attempted his attack but was foiled by passengers and crew .
Lieberman praised the Obama administration for reaching out to the government in Yemen about extremism there .
But he said that the administration should not release the 90 Yemenis now being held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The White House is attempting to close down the base by releasing some detainees and eventually transferring others to a facility in Illinois .
Lieberman also keyed in on internal improvements on security watch lists , saying the government should cast its net wider in order to stop potential terrorists from boarding planes .
" We have to be able to , in our age , put 500,000 names on a computer and have everyone that 's trying to come to the U.S. go through that list , " he said .
" That does n't mean they 're convicted of any wrongdoing , but it would be basis enough to take this guy out of the line in Amsterdam and do a full body check . "

Here in the Australian Capital Territory the Labor Party ( in minority Government ) supported a Greens ’
Bill giving legal recognition to same sex unions which passed just under 2 weeks ago .
Federally the homophobic and anti-equal rights Rudd Labor Government will suggest changes to the Act which effectively gut it .
The local Catholic archbishop weighed in a few days ago , claiming the Act undermines marriage and imposes the views of a minority on the rest of us .
Simon Corbell , the local Labor Attorney - General , rightly said the archbishop ’s views were intolerable in a democratic society and the Church was supporting discrimination against gays ( just as , I might add , are his Federal Labor counterparts . )
This got me thinking about the role of the Church in society and how it has changed over the millenia .
The rise of capitalism saw the bourgeoisie usurp the state power of the Christian ( often Catholic ) Church .
The response of the Church hierarchy as it was sidelined was , among other things , to attempt to retain vestiges of its power through an even greater emphasis on answers to the seemingly unknowable – love , birth and death .
That power springs in the main from attracting adherents to its particular belief system , a belief system which takes the yearnings of humanity and turns them into an object of , but separate from , humanity ( i.e. god ) .
As a generalisation the growth of capitalism has seen a larger and larger number of people reject religion for rationality .
This has seen the Church leadership respond with more ferocity in its areas of ‘ mystery ‘ and other so - called moral streams such as the family ( itself today a capitalist product for the cheap reproduction of the next generation of workers ) , marriage , sexuality , the subservient role of women , abortion and the like .
The homophobic opposition of the Church ’s rulers to gay unions is in the end a power struggle waged by an aging , and , viewed historically , declining philosophy of fear to retain and gain support in an increasingly secular society .
We should support equality for all and that includes the right of gays and lesbians to marry .
If that means as a by - product the further reduction of the power of the Church hierarchy then we as a society should welcome such an outcome .
The Fairfax media blog site , the National Times , has run an updated version of the article here , including a reference to the first legally binding union in Canberra and details of the same sex marriage demos this Saturday at www.equallove.org,au/info/nov28
Gang Rape Witnesses Kept Silent So They Would n't Be Called Snitches
Teen Boy Who Watched for 20 Minutes Feels No Guilt for Not Calling Cops
One of the witnesses of last month 's gang rape of a 15 - year - old girl at her homecoming dance said that while he could have stopped the attack that he watched for 20 minutes he did n't feel accountable for what happened .
" I feel like I could have done something , but I do n't feel like I have any responsibility for anything that happened , " the unidentified 16 - year - old witness told ABC's San Francisco affiliate KGO -TV .
Two witnesses told the television station they did n't call police during the more than two - hour - long assault on the girl because they did n't want to be called a snitches .
For the first time since the Oct. 24 gang rape , details are emerging about the vicious attack on the defenseless teen .
Witnesses have now said that the victim was repeatedly kicked in the head as a group of boys took turns raping her during the more than two - hour attack , even using a foreign object to penetrate her .
The witness said that he did n't have a cell phone to call for help and was scared to tell anyone what was happening .
Even his parents did n't know he saw the rape occur , he said .
" She was pretty quiet .
I thought she was like dead for a minute , but then I saw her moving around and I was like , ' Oh , ' " the witness told KGO .
" I really wanted to help her , but I do n't know , I just did n't . "
Police have arrested and charged six men , ranging in age from 15 to 21 , in the Oct. 24 gang rape during Richmond High School 's homecoming dance .
Police said that a total of 10 males were suspected of taking part in the gang rape .
Twenty others , according to authorities , stood by and watched , some even snapping photographs on their cell phones , while the teen girl was assaulted .
Salvador Rodriguez , who was initially arrested in connection to the crime but was later released after the district attorney said she did not have sufficient evidence to hold him , said he saw some " crazy things " the night of the attack .
Rape Witnesses Feared Being Called a Snitch
" They were kicking her in her head and they were beating her up , robbing her and ripping her clothes off .
It 's something you can't get out your mind , " Rodriguez told KGO .
Rodriguez said he was skateboarding near the high school when he saw a group form at a dimly lit section of campus , an area friends of the victim told ABCNews.com is known for its seclusion .
But when Rodriguez approached the group , what he found was gruesome .
" I saw people , like , dehumanizing her , " said Rodriguez .
" I just see like everybody going crazy and messing with her , and I was like , ' Hey man , calm down , leave her alone , that 's a little girl . '
You do n't do nothing like that , ' because I got two 15 - year - old sisters myself , " Rodriquez said .
He said he knew at least one of the attackers and tried to stop the group from taking pictures of the victim on their cell phones .
Rodriguez told KGO that he was the only person who tried to help the victim , who was lying naked alone by the time the attack ended .
" She was by herself , she was naked and I tried to help her and I reached for her and she started screaming and I said , ' Hey , I do n't want to hurt you , I just want to help , that 's all I want to do is just help you , ' " Rodriguez said .
" So she stopped screaming .
It 's as if she knew , you know , I was n't trying to do nothing and then I grabbed my T - shirt and covered her up with it . "
Fearful of being labeled a snitch -- a reputation that Rodriguez said could put his life in danger -- the teen said he was too scared to call for help .
" People say , ' Why did n't I call the cops , ' but at the same time , I live in Richmond .
A neighborhood like this , snitching is something you do n't do , you know .
I mean I have to walk down the streets now in fear of my life , " Rodriquez said .
Someone who heard people talking about the attack eventually called the cops .
" We did n't want to go back there because we were scared , " Margarita Vargas told the police dispatcher .
" Nobody wants to call the cops , so we decided to call the cops . "
Gang Rape Victim Is Recovering at Home
The victim , now recovering at home , is described by friends as a devout Christian who attended church three times a week ; her friends said she had been looking forward to the homecoming dance for weeks .
Because the suspects are being charged as adults , each could face life in prison if convicted .
The charges include rape in concert ( gang rape ) , sexual battery and penetration with a foreign object in concert .
Only one of the six in custody , 15 - year - old Cody Ray Smith , has entered a plea .
He pleaded not guilty .
When I was little ( 12 yo ) , I was in the ER after being sent from my pediatricians for an asthma attack that was n’t responding to medication .
As I ’m in the room with serious SOB , there ’s a woman with a ‘ headache on the left side ’ demanding treatment ahead of everyone else because she had a meeting to get to .
I am so dizzy from lack of oxygen that I run out of the room ( I noticed a restroom when we walked in ) and throw up .
I was immediately admitted and given oxygen after that .
From my room I could hear her screaming about “ That brat just pukes and she gets admitted when I ’ve been here for twenty minutes ? ” and then she storms out .
TARD .
Actual text from triage assessment : “ Pt states she accidentally poured Ajax dish detergent on her pancakes instead of syrup .
Pt states she rinsed her mouth out several times but still wants to be checked . ”
Male patient comes to the ER complaining that he has n’t been able to make much urine .
Patient also complains that he is having severe abdominal and pelvic pressure .
Upon assessing the patient he looks to be very distended .
The patient begins to tell a nurse and myself how it got so bad last night that he went to the garage and retrieved an extension cord .
Not elaborating we asked what he did with that extension cord to which he replied … ” I took the wire out of the middle and pushed the cord up my penis to get something to come out . ”
In disbelief I asked did it work ?
He said nothing and just stared at me .
Of course it did n’t work he would n’t be here if it did .
" We think it could have only been by penetration because we found needles in the lung , the left leg and in different parts of the thorax .
It could n't have been by ingestion , " Dr Soltoski said .
My SS sent me an awesome print of one of my favorite writers , Hunter S Thompson , and a vintage scarf .
Sorry the quality of the pictures is n't that great , I had to use my blackberry .
Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Case Against Gun Maker
NEWTOWN , Conn .
–-( AmmoLand.com ) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed Beretta U.S.A. and the firearms industry another victory by rejecting the Brady Center 's appeal of Adames v. Beretta U.S.A .
Corporation challenging the constitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act ( PLCAA ) .
The PLCAA is the 2005 federal law passed by Congress in response to the flood of reckless lawsuits brought by the Brady Center on behalf of anti-gun mayors seeking to hold members of the firearms industry liable for the criminal or unlawful misuse of their products .
This is now the third time this year the Supreme Court has denied a challenge to the PLCAA backed by the Brady Center .
In March 2009 , the Brady Center was also involved in the appeals of Lawson v. Beretta and City of New York v. Beretta , both of which the Supreme Court refused to hear .
Monday 's Supreme Court decision in the Adames case is another stinging setback to the Brady Center 's failed anti-gun political agenda to destroy the individual right of Americans to keep and bear arms — a right the Supreme Court declared last year in Heller was protected by the Second Amendment .
The Adames lawsuit was filed by the Brady Center on behalf of a family seeking to hold Beretta responsible for the tragic shooting death of their son , caused solely by the criminal acts of a teenage boy who gained unauthorized access to his father 's unsecured service pistol .
The case was originally dismissed by a Chicago trial court , subsequently reinstated in part by the Illinois Court of Appeals , and then ultimately found to be barred under the PLCAA by the Illinois Supreme Court .
By its decision yesterday , the Supreme Court found it unnecessary to consider the Illinois Supreme Court 's well - reasoned decision that held the PLCAA was both constitutional and clearly applicable to this lawsuit .
Representing Beretta in the case was Craig Livingston of the Livingston Law Firm , who after being notified of the Supreme Court 's rejection of the appeal remarked ,
“ And so ends a long legal battle — from the trial court in Chicago , through the Illinois appellate courts , and all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court — which served only to confirm what has been known since May 5 , 2001 , namely that this tragic shooting death was caused not by any defect in a Cook County Corrections Officer 's Beretta pistol , but rather by its reckless misuse on that fateful day by his teenage son . ”
Lawrence G. Keane , senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) , the trade association for the firearms industry , applauded yesterday 's Supreme Court rejection of the Brady Center 's appeal , stating ,
“ Frivolous and unsupported lawsuits such as Adames that attempt to force manufacturers of firearms to pay for the crimes of others over whom they have no control are precisely what the PLCAA is designed to stop . ”

Police quietly removed safeguards against Taser - related brutality
A Minneapolis man who was Tased by police after surrendering and putting both hands on the hood of a squad car says he wants restitution from the police .
On Monday , Rolando Ruiz ’s lawyer released dashcam video of an April 30 incident in which Ruiz can be seen with his hands on the hood of a car when a police officer approaches him and Tases him in the neck .
Ruiz then falls to the ground , and can be heard screaming in agony as the officer kneels over him .
ADVERTISEMENT
As WCCO - TV in Minneapolis notes , the video begins moments before the Tasing , so it ’s unclear whether there was a physical confrontation beforehand .
But it is clear that Ruiz was not being aggressive at the moment he was hit with a conducted energy weapon .
Ruiz ’ attorney , Albert Goins , says his client ’s civil rights were violated , and he wants the police department to settle out of court for $ 75,000 or he says he will bring a federal lawsuit against the officers and Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan .
This is at least the second high - profile incident of police brutality in Minneapolis to make the news this year .
As the Minneapolis Star - Tribune reports , Chief Dolan earlier this year forced his officers to watch dashcam footage of officers beating Minneapolis resident Darryl Jenkins in a snowbank to the point he needed seven stitches .
The FBI is now investigating that incident .
The fact the officer Tased Ruiz in the neck will likely cause concerns among police watchdogs .
Last month , Taser International issued a memo to police forces telling them not to Tase suspects in the head , neck and chest , because doing so poses a risk of injury .
Observers of Minneapolis police note that the force had accepted recommendations not to allow officers to use Tasers on suspects ’ necks — before quietly removing that guideline from its training manual .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They removed restrictions on more than one officer Tasering a person at a time , or intentionally using the Taser on the head , neck , face , or genitalia , ” wrote civil liberties advocate Dave Bicking .
“ They did this without consulting , or even notifying , the City Council or the [ civilian review authority ] .
They said that they had just moved the policy to their training manuals .
When we finally were able to look at a training manual , it was clear that almost all of the important provisions were gone , and officers were given much greater discretion . ”
The Star - Tribune reported that Ruiz was arrested “ after an incident involving damage to property at the Second Precinct headquarters . ”
Ruiz is charged with felony damage to property .
He also pleaded guilty earlier this year to second - degree assault and misdemeanor failure to stop at the scene of an accident , both evidently unrelated to the property damage charge .
“ For an individual facing a property crime case and in custody , that ’s an outrageous amount of force , ” the Star - Tribune quoted Goins .

Goins has not divulged how he obtained the police camera footage .
He says his client does n’t want more than the available 75 seconds of the video shown to the public .
This video is from WCCO - TV in Minneapolis , broadcast Nov. 2 , 2009 .

The recession has prompted some state and local governments to pare programs that benefit illegal immigrants .
And although illegal immigrants may account for about seven million of the country ’s 46 million uninsured , the health care bills being negotiated by Congress exclude them from expansions of subsidized public insurance .
( The House bill that passed on Nov. 7 would allow illegal immigrants to buy policies at full cost on government - run exchanges , while legislation being considered in the Senate would forbid it . )
Calling it “ a horrible situation , ” Mr. Correll said that governments at all levels had decided that immigrants were not their problem .
“ But somehow , ” he said , “ they ’ve become Grady ’s problem , which seems totally unfair . ”
Some of the Grady dialysis patients have chosen to return to their countries , encouraged by the hospital ’s offer of free airfare , cash payments , three months of paid dialysis and assistance in seeking insurance or other long - term remedies .
Others are trying their luck in states where Medicaid policies may be less restrictive .
But most remain in Atlanta , taking full advantage of a last - minute offer by the hospital , in response to a lawsuit , to pay for three months of dialysis at commercial clinics .
They are hopeful that the reprieve will buy time for the lawsuit to progress or for private dialysis providers to take them as charity cases .
What they fear , however , is that their already fragile lives will soon be reduced to a frenzied search for their next dialysis , most likely in an emergency room after a descent into crisis .
Looking for a Better Life
They need only look to Ms. Perez to see what the future may hold .
After hearing that the clinic would close , Ms. Perez , 32 , set out for Alabama on Sept. 6 because cousins told her they might be able to procure dialysis there .
Grady was not yet offering its deal for three months of treatment , and instead gave her $ 1,300 , enough to cover dialysis for a week or two .
Ms. Perez said the money was quickly spent on rent , food and transportation .
After going without dialysis for 16 days , she walked into an emergency room near Birmingham , which found that the potassium levels in her blood were high enough to require immediate filtration .
Eight days later , she did the same at another Birmingham hospital .
Moving to a new country brings in a lot of excitement , but at the same time the whole procedure is accompanied by a fair amount of stress too !
First of all , make your mind that you really want to move on to this new country .
A mind filled with speculations or doubts cannot succeed .
Ask yourself whether the new culture will really suit you and your family members !
Remove all the confusions and head on towards a better future .
Preparation is the key to excellence .
Search for your job and house well in advance to avoid any hassles in future .
Assure that you have enough financial assets to sustain in the first few struggling months of your move .
Good budgeting makes all the difference when it comes to moving to an altogether new world .
Think what you want to do with your current home ( Give it on rent , sell it , leave it ) .
What about the household items ?
Make a thorough check - list of what to the stuff that you need to pack and take with you and the items that need to be discarded .
Transportation aspect needs to be a reliable one .
If you have already got a job in the new country , know about the relocation benefits offered by your company .
Also understand all the benefits offered by your firm before making the final move as no one wants to end up in a messy situation after landing in a new country and know the hidden clauses later on !
If the prospective country has a new language , ensure that you learn its official language to ensure your comfort level and enhance your chances of a better future .
Ensure that the documentation is right in order !
There are so many things including birth certificate , experience certificate , financial proofs , to name a few .
This is one of the most critical aspects and requires an expert guidance from an experience Immigration veteran .
Good luck !
Well after viewing the thread up top , and a lot more in here , I 've decided to give this a go .
This thread will be a copy and paste from my other journal , but I would welcome comments here as well since I know there 's members on here who are n't on the other and vice versa
Wish me luck !
My parts list !
Scissors
Clear Plastic large bin
Shoebox size bins
Topsoil
Light Timer
Humidity Meter
Water
Lights
Some time
Well I needed some space , so I got rid of my moss growout which was n't doing anything but growing algae ... Then I got myself a plastic bin from walmart ( $ 16.77 ) And I def took the humidity guage idea to heart ( $ 5.97 @ Petco , I could have gotten cheaper on ebay , but I 'm impatient today .... ) Drilled many many holes , used a pair of nail clippers to take care of the ugly hole blocking plastic that happened with many of the holesCleaned out the bin in the bathtubI then took the lids that came with the shoe boxes and cut them to act as free dividers for multiple species ( plus they 're free since they came with the box ! )
Fill up the dirtGet your hands dirty and have funAdd water , I 've added about 4 gallons here , also added dividers ... I 've now reduced about a half gallon of water out of the setup since the soil seemed to be super - saturated this morning Added the lights --
These are the walmart plant lights that they have locally , they seem to be doing the trick so far ( I had these laying around , I 'm planning on adding a few more possibly , IDK yet ) Humidity showing about 95 % about 2 hours after letting the lights run and closing the top , checking everything tonight , plan on adding a few plants tomorrow !
UPDATES FROM TODAYSo everything seemed stable , I 've worked plants into 3 out of the 4 bins now .
Humidity was at about 92 % when the photo period started , I added a bit of dirt to the bins to take care of the settling / saturation and then reduced the water just a hair , I 'll be watching the dirt over the next few days to see if I should add a bit of water back or not , currently the water is approx .
1.5 - 2 " under the surface of the soil .
Found some decent looking HC at the LFS ( was very surprised to see that ) bought a planter worth and got it in there .
Here 's hoping it takes offAlso found some pigmy chain sword , I 've wanted to try these guys in the past but have had no room in any of my tanks , so I said why not and decided to go to town with the planter , here 's hoping I get some runnersAlso decided to try some rotala macrandra japan red in this bin as well .
Some Moneywort and some CW Green , they 're small but who knows , if these guys do n't work out I 'll transplant a bit from my bigger tank , or if they work out maybe I 'll transplant some red or bronze over from one of my submerged tanks into the empty binFull bin shot as of about 20 minutes ago .
I may open up to mist the plants down in a few days but that will be it , going to try to run this guy sealed for 72 hours and then open for gas exchange and mist and then close .

Sparr , Belville & Brown , LLC was such a great help with resolving my case .
I knew I was always in great hands with my attorney , Amanda Belville , as I could always count on her to answer my questions and relieve my worries .
My case took longer than anticipated , due to a personal situation ; however , Amanda was there throughout the whole process .
I would recommend Attorney Belville to you , as well as the rest of the lawyers in the firm , as I am very satisfied with my experience .
My husband and I worked with Kristina Sanders - Brown for a personal injury case , she was very helpful .
Our case was drug out for longer than it should have due to the other party but she kept us up to date and kept up informed with all the changed and things that were happening .
She was also always to the point telling us what she thought would be a good idea and what would have been a waste of time .
She is a great lawyer and if there was something that she was not sure of she would tell us that she would talk to her colleagues and then get back to us .
Both my husband and I would recommend Kristina and all the other lawyers in the firm .
Mrs. Bellville is a good lawyer .
She helped me out .
She 's practical .
Attorney Belville was a pleasure to work with .
I received a speeding citation and immediately consulted Attorney Belville after the incident .
While I was extremely flustered and emotional after receiving the violation , she was adept at reassuring me that she would further investigate the citation and attempt to reduce the penalties .
Attorney Belville was then able to negotiate a favorable outcome with the district attorney .
The 15 MPH speeding ticket was reduced to a " Defective Speedometer " citation .
I would highly recommend hiring Attorney Belville .
David was extremely helpful in providing me legal representation and accomplished everything I asked of him in an efficient , timely manner .

In was another incredible month as gold continued to outshine all other major investment themes by being the only investment that has broken out to new highs since the global meltdown of 2008 .
Not only is gold making new highs ( 1100 this week ) , it is doing so in a fashion that accelerated the price this week in terms of velocity , momentum , volume , and daily price range .
Even the pullbacks are chart bullish recently as the best the bears can do is get gold to consolidate and trade sideways for three or four days and then gold moves up again .
This latest pullback over the last two weeks of October is a case in point .
At a time when the seasonal aspect of gold points lower and at its weakest , gold 's price pulled back right on queue as a price drop from 1072 to 1026 occurred .
Because of gold 's bullish aspect , the corrective tone was shallow .
In seasonal fashion the price peak for the month occurred on October 13th , and the price retreat lasted until near the end of the month .
Even the circumstances surrounding the pullback entailed options expiration and the rollover of October futures to December .
From a time element , the October pullback for gold was for the most part behaving as what gold usually does in latter October .
The difference is this .
The rallies are longer , and the pullbacks smaller .
That statement , when broken down to its components , reflect the definition of a bull market .
That 's what a bull market is .
It 's a trend where rallies are longer and deeper on the upside , and the pullbacks are shorter and shallower in price and time .
The level of that interaction in term of magnitude and duration provides the setting for how strong and powerful a bull market run or leg is .
The magnitude of this event is one where gold spent 19 months hovering below the 1000 level and finally broke out to the upside .
What about the fundamental demand driving the market ?
Since the beginning of September the gold price is up from 940 to 1100 in less than seventy days .
What happened in late August ?
Technically speaking , it�s where the Bears lost control of the market .
Let 's look at that dynamic in action on the charts .
The red arrows at the bottom of the chart show the dynamics of a loss of control by the shorts .
It occurred in late August .
The fat aqua trend line at the bottom of the chart is the 2009 summer channel support line .
Look at how many times the bears tried to collapse this uptrend .
On nine separate occasions the bears shorted this market and every spike down was GREETED WITH FRESH BUYING .
It is a great display of a market turning point .
There was one final element necessary to complete the process and that was the point of recognition and that was where the shorts began to cover and NEW market participants entered at the same time .
The resultant explosion in price is sometimes called the " point of recognition " where the last three highs on the charts were taken out in FIVE HOURS .
That point was a MAJOR reversal of trend and therefore where the bulls retook took control of the gold market .
Was there a key fundamental change that was recognized in those few weeks by the markets ?
Yes .
The dynamic in the above chart is where the " underlying " demand for a commodity was absolutely and totally overwhelming the supply .
This is where the big market players , the commercials and the banking shorts could no longer stop the wall of buying that had materialized .
What was that wall of buying ?
It was the great " Wall of China . "
The announcements came to the forefront at the beginning of May 2009 .
The next phase of WW III - " The Financial war " is on .
Nations have now become buyers of gold .
But not just any nation is China .
For a shift to gold in there foreign reserves means no other than to take existing United States dollars and purchase gold with it .
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-gold-buy-raises-eyebrows-for-right-reasons
Then the news kicked into full gear in August and the reality of gold 's supply and demand equation as well as the physiological shift in investor perceptions reached a crescendo as the first trickles of investors realize that nations are buying gold and rejecting paper currency .
Royal
Mint sees surge in gold coin production Tuesday , 4th August 2009 , 16:53:06 Gold coin proves highlight of $ 1.4 m auction Tuesday , 4th August 2009 , 14:27:26 Gold coins " an attractive option " for investors Tuesday , 11th August 2009 , 08:08:47 Lottery offering gold coins proves a hit in India Thursday , 13th August 2009 , 14:38:39 Double Eagle gold coin sales break 80,000 barrier Wednesday , 19th August 2009 , 15:45:35 Middle Eastern investors look to physical gold Monday , 17th August 2009 , 15:19:20 Indian gold imports predicted to rise Friday , 21st August 2009 , 16:23:55 China becoming ' gold superpower '
Tuesday , 25th August 2009 , 17:04:41 Double Eagle sales remain strong Thursday , 27th August 2009 , 17:04:22
In bull markets , the news just keeps getting bigger and bigger .
Just as the seasonal trends were about to take hold in the metals , a monthly string of announcements rattled the gold market and the effects on price is hard to dispute as you will see .
First came the September bombshell by the " Wall of China . " � China urges citizens to buy gold Sep 3 , 2009
And then the October bombshell ...... " Oil to trade in non US currency . "
The demise of the dollar
In a graphic illustration of the new world order , Arab states have launched secret moves with China , Russia and France to stop using the US currency for oil trading And yet another bombshell delivered in November ........... " India buying gold . "
Here 's the result of these announcements Usually demand from jewelry and India tail off at this point of the year , and gold corrects much harder .
The reports coming from India and the jewelry market were way below average this year as well .
The bear 's saw their chance in September and attempted to take the market down in the latter half of the month .
But this year it�s different .
The investment community has stepped in and " demanded " gold in the physical markets and the paper tigers .
( futures , etf's )
Then just last week India dropped a " bunker buster " on the community by issuing a contra seasonal news story .
It was BUYING GOLD !!
The seasonal players , the perma bears , and the banks ( who have shorted some 30 % of Planet production ) had to run for cover .
The buying on the ask was so strong that it took back all of the selling of the past two weeks on the bid .
The seasonal chart below indicates the last week of October is one of the strongest down weeks of the year .
And in fashion , gold did pullback in that time frame .
But the bullish aspect was how little gold pulled back in price , only 46 dollars , less than 5 % during the total price retreat .
This time frame usually ushers in a complete retracement of the September rally .
This year 's pullback in October , if we think about it , was just gold pulling back during options expiration and the rollover of the October contract .
So technically speaking , that was very normal and it satisfied the October pullback .
As soon as November was ushered in , gold , like it has done in September , and October , took off running in front of the investment pack and made a new 21st century bull market high at 1100 dollars an ounce during the first seven days of the month .
The seasonal chart in the past has provided a sufficient roadmap .
From the highs in February , to the lows in July and August , and the current September and October rally , the seasonal pattern has been a great guide and that is why it�s good to take look on a monthly basis .
I 've drawn a red oval on the chart above to point out where we are on the timeline .
This November rally we just had on the seasonal chart is usually just a fairly steady bounce on average , and a choppy motion at that .
Due to its strength and the India announcement , this week in gold provided one of the best weekly gains in a while .
If we look out over the next few months we can see that the seasonal aspect of gold is now entering a time period of choppiness ( Nov / Dec ) .
This average choppiness is due to the autumn correction sometime taking place during November .
The question this all brings to hand is will there be an autumn pullback in gold or is it going to keep screaming up ?
Let 's take a look at it from a longer term standpoint .
The Medium Term Timeframe www.stockcharts.com
The chart above is a very bullish chart and there is a major breakout underway in gold as the culmination of the 19 month consolidation ( dotted blue sideways trend lines ) has come to an end .
All of the technical indicators are in full gear and after a brief consolidation at the end of October gold is back on the move .
For those who have not read previous updates on the medium term trend , we 're monitoring the chart pattern of 2007 and the effects of that major bull market and comparing them with the patterns and indicators currently under way in the new bull market leg since gold moved above 1030 .
The chart above shows the 2007 rally as well as our current progress in the current rally .
Most important is the fact that we have broken into a new zone of price parameters .
The tiny purple uptrend lines on the chart above indicate where the next price resistance points should occur and where potential trend changes into corrective mode could take place .
From a price pattern standpoint , we could n't ask for a move bullish chart .
We are accelerating in price , range , and in volume .
We are near the proximity of total strength as the pattern is becoming every 4th week , a major up move takes place , and then price consolidates for the next three weeks .
That has been the modus operandi since the autumn rally began pretty much .
The next area of resistance should be the 1150 - 1175 zone and then the 1350 level .
The current three areas of support are : 1 ) The 1000 area where the dotted blue line and the fast blue moving average reside .
2 ) The 950 area where the initial autumn rally began and where medium term ( red ) moving average has moved up to .
3 ) Finally the 880-900 area where the bottom purple channel line and the long term green moving average is on the chart .
AS LONG AS WE REMAIN ABOVE THOSE PRICE ZONES , the medium term trend is up .
Let �s review the coincidental technical indicators included with the chart 1 ) Volume - Volume is expanding just like it did in the 2007 bull market run .
( Using GLD as a proxy ) 2 ) MACD Histogram - MACD keeps rising just like as 2007 compare the circled areas .
3 ) Williams %R - %R continues to be pegged in overbought area just like in 2007 and remains bullish .
4 ) RSI - RSI has entered overbought area just like 2007 .
Conclusion : Bullish Medium
Term with very strong chart characteristics .
Price is accelerating .
Odds favor a correction at some point but the main trend at this point is up and building strength .
Action :
When RSI diverges , and %R comes out of overbought area in conjunction with price bouncing off one of these channel lines , the medium term most likely will go into corrective fashion and a pullback / correction will take place .
November is the optimal time a seasonal US Dollar rally takes place , and up until last week , the rallying dollar would have brought the price of gold down .
But last week , GOLD DETACHED ..... and rallied while the US DOLLAR was rallying .
This makes things even more bullish as now gold is rallying against the currencies .
Was it just an abnormality ?
We can say yes once .
But should it happen again in the coming weeks , we expect gold to rise against the other world currencies dismantling another bearish argument against gold .
Bearish considerations ..........
Markets are one big paradox .
In a runaway market , demand or psychology outstrips all bearish considerations .
When it overcomes , parabolic moves up occur .
Should that happen in gold , it will be the mother of all rallies as the mainstream enters .
The potential to drastically move up here keeps growing by the day / week / and month .
The downside considerations are huge , especially the large short positions of the banks who are being subsidized by the feds in order to avoid an outright panic .
They 've sold close to 30 % of this years planetary output .
Yet , every pullback for a few weeks provides sideways action and then another move up , putting shorts further in trouble develops .
To me , the faster this move accelerates , the more apt we are for the US Government to take more drastic measures .
Cycles From a " CYCLES " standpoint by the folks who make a living doing it , times now could n't be more short term bearish .
There is a confluence of cycles that are due here both in the short , intermediate , and even on a medium time frame that is suggestive that gold is about to experience a pullback .
The bullish fever is growing heavy as well .
How heavy ?
Perma Bear Bob Prechter from ELLIOT WAVE INTERNATIONAL actually mentioned that gold could move higher in his latest televised interview .
Granted they are still trying to pick a top at his newsletters , and one of these months they are going to be correct .
Not to bash them , I like to read the Theorist every month .
But the fact that Prechter is acknowledging the potential is a change .
What is it that the cycle people see right now ?
The chart above with the red arrows is a cycle that gold has been following that frequently occurs near or at the highs and once in a while at lows .
We have arrived at one of these cycle turns where a high is due to occur .
If we combine this with the choppy action that the seasonal charts suggest , the potential for gold to pull back is certainly a consideration .
There is no doubt that all of the cyclical and technical factors are at their maximum .
The demand swell so far is out powering it .
Countries and reportedly some central banks are now in accumulation of gold , and when the public arrives , it 'll be a sight to see .
But what about the autumn correction ?
Was the 4 week consolidation in silver and the 2 week in gold the correction ?
Here 's the 4 potential scenario's as I see them .
1 ) The time frame now strongly suggests November is the prime candidate for a 4 - 6 week pullback before the winter rally .
At its earliest , gold should peak here in the 1100 - 1160 area this coming week and a final move to the 980 - 1000 area would occur into the end of November / December time frame .
We think from there gold ( barring a global meltdown ) could move to the 1300's by Mid February .
2 ) The potential for gold to continue higher here and not peak until Thanksgiving is also a potential .
In that scenario , gold moves to 1175 - 1200 and pulls back into Xmas and New Years , and then rallies to mid February , early March .
3 ) An " event " sets gold off in a parabolic move and gold does n't correct , instead , just keeps on running up from here .
The chart action supports this potential and if we do n't pullback in November things could get interesting very quickly .
4 ) Gold is peaking now and a deflationary bomb is about to hit the market as gold ( and everything except the dollar ) swoons lower .
Three of the four scenario's above calls for a much higher gold price .
Even the 4th one calls for it .
It 's just that it calls for a big move down first .
I have difficulty thinking gold goes to $ 700 , but there are too many brilliant minds still entertaining a deflationary outcome .
If we begin to follow their bearish script we will address the potentials .
There is no need to consider it until gold breaks below the 950 - 975 area .
Can you imagine the United States getting in the ring with China for a fictional showdown ?
Satirically speaking , the American enters the ring with paper stocks , bonds , currency , toxic debt which they cannot collect , and out of control borrowing for which they can never repay , an economy whose industrial production has been gutted and shipped to Asia and who depends totally on its major competitor for its credit and purchase of most goods !!!
On the other side of the ring , the Chinese challenger enters the ring armed with gold , silver , 98 % of all rare earths , energy deals with Russia and Venezuela , Iran , acquired natural resources and precious metals from Africa to Canada , all the industrial industry that USA handed to them so they could produce it for us , all of the American money , an economy that is growing at 8 % GDP .
Does anyone care to take a guess who is going to be calling the shorts at the G20 meeting this weekend ?
On a more serious note�� .
In this age , the information age , I believe World War III is already underway and is not fought with guns and butter .
It �s fought with gold and hard assets and not paper .
It is a financial war and the goal of the enemy is to acquire the wealth of and usurp the power of the USA without firing one single shot .
While USA has been at the Party the real competition for power and control have been gathering together , forming alliances , and have implemented a plan to systematically dismantle the United States and remove it from the world throne .
In this War , the " no - bullet " war , the removal from the throne cannot be stopped because of the method of extraction .
Just like in the movie " 2001 - a Space Odyssey " an Astronaut dismantles a super computer that has taken over the spaceship .
He simply removes the computers huge memory banks ..... one bank at a time until the computer at the end is basically rendered to the capability of a person who has undergone a lobotomy .
Once the astronaut gained access to the memory bank , the computer could only stand by and watch the dismantling .
By removing the dollar as the method of payment in the world Oil supply , China and a host of other nations have rendered a blow to this country akin to the memory banks being removed from HAL , the supercomputer we stated about in the last paragraph .
The USA can just stand there and watch as the dollars removal of the world currency has begun , and like HAL , it is powerless to stop it .
The end of the dynasty of the 20th century known as the United States is officially over .
It is bankrupt .
Caput as they say .
It is akin to a home owner who has defaulted on his mortgage payment and at this point , has stopped paying but is still living there , pawning off the remainder of his " stuff " before the creditors arrive and take over all the assets and remove him from the premises .
At that point , no one gets paid .
Not the oil man , not the phone , not the credit card , not the TV , not the car .
Nothing .
He / she can put it out of their minds for the time being , but the day of reckoning does arrive at some point .
The removal of the US dollar as world reserve currency is underway .
China is not as far off as many think to be able to issue bonds that will be backed by the Yuan .
When that happens , it 'll be like that home run A - Rod hit the other night in the ninth inning ( I think it was ) against the Phillies in the World Series .
Game over .
The real parabolic moves in gold are said to be due to inflation .
Did anyone really see prices go down from 1980 to 2000 ?
Yet gold went in a 20 year bear market .
Gold goes parabolic when the faith of the government and confidence is lost by the populous which shows up through fiscal irresponsibility .
The inflation is the result of that government�s inability to maintain control of all of its paper machinations and the debt machines inherently borrows to the hilt like a college student with 5 or 6 credit cards near an ATM at a package store .
My point is that while inflation will come , the current threat of deflation still looms large .
Once the college student is denied further credit , the party comes to an end .
Is there any event a demand for US Dollars could occur ?
Yes .
The US DOLLAR has replaced the Yen as the " carry " trade dollar .
Should the value of the US Dollar rise against foreign currencies an unwinding of the trade could develop .
All of these things have consequences that will affect gold and silver and while we do not know the future , it is difficult to see a world where gold demand will be decreasing .
The exception is a complete contraction where liquidation of all assets takes place .
We 've looked at the medium term picture of gold .
Now let�s take a final look at a shorter term chart .
Earlier , we looked at a 3 year weekly chart of gold and we saw that gold was technically sound as a button .
In the chart below , the shorter time frame points to three key price areas for the upcoming week .
The is 60 minute December gold chart .
There 's a lot there but the basics are :
The red arrows are the short term price RESISTANCE AREAS .
Take a look at the gold price right now on the chart .
LOOK HOW IT IS JAMMED into the TOP OF THE FAT UPPER AQUA TREND LINE .
That pattern looks very bullish and any break above that aqua area should set off a run to the other red arrows in the 1120 - 1140 area .
Should we move and close above those lines , it will indicate that the MOMENTUM of gold is increasing .
Gold is in an uptrend channel since July ( Fat aqua trend lines ) .
Those channel trend lines define key support and resistance areas for gold 's current price range and fluctuations .
As long as gold is above the bottom aqua channel line , the trend is up .
Within the chart there are 3 gold arrows pointing to key price support areas .
Two gold arrows are pointing to the SLOW ( RED ) moving average .
The other gold arrow is pointing to a dotted blue line .
That line is short term support for the gold rally .
Anytime we are above that line , the short term trend is up and climbing at about a 40 dollar per month clip .
The bottom support areas for gold is the red moving slow average and the lower aqua channel line which crosses the 1020 area .
Key turning point
The potential for gold to actually fail here and not get above the aqua line would indeed usher a correction down towards the support areas I 've listed .
We think this is the most important area for the week and will either provide support or resistance .
Bottom line :
We think that if there is to be a correction in gold that the most likely time for it to begin would be in November .
We think it would be a pullback in a still up moving bull market , and that once completed , new highs will be upon us during the winter months .
Only moves below the 980 - 1000 area would warn that the medium term timeframe has issues and that a consideration of a deeper correction would be in order .
THIS WEEK -- WATCH THE 1100 - 1105 area ......... the aqua trend line where price is at right now .
A move above that area should give us a quick run towards 1150 - 1175 .
Should that area provide resistance , the potential for a pullback towards the 1060 area over the next few weeks or even a 4 - 6 week correction might be the modus operandi for gold .
The medium term trend of gold is up .
There are usually a few times per year that gold pulls back .
Autumn is one of those times .
Should a correction develop , it would provide a buying opportunity in the on going bull market .
At www.Goldtrends.net , we follow all the timeframes of the gold market right down to the hourly trend .
We are currently monitoring and watching the weekly medium term breakout in gold .

Obama holds stage - managed meeting with Wall Street bankers
By Tom Eley
15 December 2009
The stated aim of the gathering of Wall Street bankers at a private White House meeting with President Barack Obama on Monday was to cajole the nation 's largest financial institutions into offering loans to cash - starved businesses and consumers .
In reality , the event was a media exercise designed to placate growing popular anger toward the Obama administration .
The true nature of the event was not lost on its attendees .
“ It 's a PR [ public relations ] stunt , ” an unnamed CEO flatly told Time magazine prior to the meeting .
Attending were Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase , Ken Lewis of Bank of America , Richard Fairbank of Capital One , Bob Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon , Ken Chenault of American Express , and Ron Logue of State Street Bank .
Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , John Mack of Morgan Stanley , and Dick Parsons of Citigroup joined the meeting via video conference .
The nation 's biggest banks will soon hand out year - end executive bonuses totalling in the tens of billions .
This conspicuous display of bank prosperity comes just over one year after the US Treasury and Federal Reserve began to funnel trillions of dollars to the finance industry .
This ensured that the banks would profit from the economic crisis that they precipitated through rampant financial speculation .
The vast majority of the population continues to suffer through the nation 's worst social crisis since the Great Depression .
One in six workers is without a job or underemployed .
For those who have work , speed - up and pay and benefit cuts are the rule .
The foreclosure crisis continues .
Hunger is at a record high .
The destruction of the social safety system by cash - strapped states is accelerating , and the Obama administration is readying years of budget austerity to right the US fiscal crisis at the expense of the working class .
Appearing on the CBS news program “ 60 Minutes ” on Sunday evening , Obama acknowledged the anger .
Referring to the Wall Street financiers as “ fat cat bankers , ” Obama noted , “ They 're still puzzled why is it that people are mad at the banks . ”
“ Well , let 's see , ” Obama continued , “ you guys are drawing down 10 , 20 million dollar bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it 's gone through in decades , and you guys caused the problem .
And we 've got 10 percent unemployment . ”
Obama did not mention that this is an outcome of the policies of his own administration , which has overseen the Wall Street baillout and has explicitly campaigned to oppose any measure that would curb executive pay .
Meanwhile , it has spearheaded the attack on workers ' pay , including through the forced bankrupcy of General Motors and Chrysler .
Monday 's meeting comes nine months after a similar meeting at the White House in March .
Then , Obama pledged not to take any measures that would impinge on the interests of the financial oligarchy .
Bank of America 's Lewis said at the time that he was confident that no “ punitive ” actions would be taken after the “ pleasant ” meeting .
( See “ Obama holds ‘ very pleasant ’ meeting with top US bankers ” )
While the media had predicted that Obama 's criticisms on “ 60 Minutes ” meant he would shame the executives or give them a “ dressing down ” on Monday , by all accounts the meeting was likewise as pleasant as it was unsubstantial .
No transcripts of the discussion have been released .
Richard Davis , CEO of US Bancorp , told the media “ there was n't a lot of disagreement . ”
“ He did n't call us any names , ” Davis said , referring to Obama 's “ fat cat ” reference on “ 60 Minutes . ”
Obama pleaded with the bank executives to “ explore every responsible way ” to increase lending “ to help creditworthy small and medium - sized businesses . ”
Over the past year , a general lack of cash liquidity has forced many businesses to fold , scale back operations , and lay off workers .
Last fall , Obama , President George W. Bush , and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , among others , justified the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) as critically necessary in order to “ jump start ” or “ open the spigot ” of lending .
Since then every facet of the Wall Street bailout , including the unaccounted trillions extended to the banks from the Federal Reserve , has relied on the same rationale .
But all evidence shows that the banks have hoarded the cash or used it to engage in new forms of speculation .
Overall loan volume continued to fall from the second to third quarters this year , according to recent data .
What the banks have made liquid has not been invested in production .
Instead much of it has been been shifted into new asset bubbles , primarily in Asia .
From this and other speculative practices the banks have made windfall profits only one year after they teetered on the brink of collapse .
The banks have used some of these profits to pay back TARP funds in order to escape modest limitations on executive pay .
Citigroup and Wells Fargo became the latest Wall Street firms to do so , announcing Monday they would pay back $ 20 billion and $ 25 billion , respectively .
They join Bank of America , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , and Morgan Stanley .
Obama also implored the bankers to “ close the gap ” between their declared support for finance reform and their vocal opposition to the regulatory bill passed by the US House of Representatives last week , even though the proposed law would , if anything , expand possibilities for financial speculation .
Such hypocritical entreaties from the president characterized the meeting .
There was no mention of any penalties or consequences to banks that fail to increase their lending .
Unsurprisingly , results were slim , with only Bank of America announcing it intends to make $ 5 billion more available to small and medium - sized businesses , a drop in the bucket compared to the enormous need for capital and liquidity .
Wall Street executives ' determination to not lend to the productive sectors of the economy ―while rewarding themselves billions in compensation ―is not a question of morality , nor is it an aberration .
It arises from the historical decay of capitalism and its turn to evermore parasitic forms of financial speculation .
While media accounts attempted to present the gathering as an example of Obama “ taking on ” the bankers , they could not conceal the real relationship of forces .
The Obama administration 's efforts to put on the show of getting tough produced the opposite image , that of the president as willing supplicant before the masters of Wall Street .
It is significant that Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , Mack of Morgan Stanley , and Parsons of Citigroup did not attend in person .
While their last - minute cancellations were chalked up to weather ―fog in the Washington DC area delayed some flights on Monday morning ―they more likely aimed a rebuke at Obama over his “ fat cats ” comments .
Parsons was already a substitute for Citi CEO Vikram Pandit , whose decision to skip the event was attributed to his bank 's negotiations with the Treasury to pay back TARP .
“ The President has real problems only the banks can help him solve , ” according to Time magazine .
“ On jobs , housing and the strength of the economy , he needs bankers to change their behavior , and there 's only so much he can do to force them .
So when he sits down with the financial industry elite on Monday , he may talk tough , but he 'll also be asking for their help . ”
The admission that a democratically elected president has no power over a handful of financiers is an acknowledgement of the oligarchic character of US society .
The financial aristocracy in fact controls every lever of state power and dictates economic and social policy .
Obama is their representative .

The health department approved the first producer earlier this year , which began dispensing cannabis in July , and recently approved four new applicants .
Twenty - one additional producer applications are pending .
" We are the first state to develop this kind of distribution system for medical cannabis , and we will continue to proceed carefully with the development of the program so we can meet the needs of our patients while not creating an excess supply , " Dr. Alfredo Vigil , the state 's health secretary , said in Santa Fe .
" The medical cannabis program is for people who cannot get relief from their suffering from any other means .
We are very proud of the program 's success so far . "
Efforts to get similar state legislation passed in Texas have been unsuccessful so far .
During the Texas 81st Legislature , state Rep. Elliot Naishtat , D - Austin , introduced House Bill 164 , which would permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes in Texas .
The legislation was referred to the Public Health Committee in February , but did not advance beyond the committee before the session adjourned in June , according to the state 's bill tracking service .
Retired DEA official Phil Jordan , a former director of the El Paso Intelligence Center , said authorizing the use of medical marijuana is bad public policy .
" The marijuana available today is much more potent than it was in the past , " Jordan said .
" It is a known gateway drug to harder drugs .
It seems like we 're throwing in the towel instead of trying to protect the younger generation from the ill effects of marijuana .
" More to the point , I would not want to have surgery in New Mexico , where a doctor or a medical assistant under the influence of pot might operate on me . "
Chris Minnick , spokesman for the department , said New Mexico 's health department is not getting involved in determining the quality of the marijuana its licensed producers offer , or how producers obtain their supplies , such as seeds and plants .
Patients who receive permission to obtain medical marijuana also can apply for a license to produce their own cannabis , Minnick said .
The department has approved 809 patients since the program began in 2007 ; eight of them have since died .
Under the current rules , a nonprofit producer in New Mexico could supply medical cannabis to as many as 100 patients .
Producers are allowed to have 95 mature plants and seedlings , and maintain an inventory of usable medical cannabis for patients .
Patients are allowed to possess six ounces of medical cannabis .
For patients to qualify , a doctor must certify that they have one of the 15 conditions or ailments that are debilitating and cannot be helped by standard treatments .
The qualifying conditions include : severe chronic pain , painful peripheral neuropathy , intractable nausea / vomiting , severe anorexia / cachexia , hepatitis C infection currently receiving antiviral treatment , Crohn 's disease , post - traumatic stress disorder , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig 's disease ) , cancer , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis , damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord with intractable spasticity , epilepsy , HIV / AIDS , and hospice patients .

I was looking through the groups I belong to and realized it has been way too long since anyone shared any Lovecraft art or crafts here !
So here 's a woodcut print I made last year :
This is my second Necronomicon page print , I have a third in the works though I have several larger ( non-Lovecraft ) pieces to finish first .
The Latin text translates as " Dagon who brings abundance from the sea . "
No deities , forbidden tomes , or dreamers were harmed in the making of this art .
" Dagon " and my first Necronomicon print , " Shub - Niggurath " are both available for purchase in my Lovecraftian Etsy Shop Anyone else have any goodies they have n't shared ?
Would be nice to see some action here again !
The court said the use of the death penalty was now impossible Russia 's ban on the death penalty will remain when a current legal suspension expires on 1 January , the country 's Constitutional Court has ruled .
It said the use of the death penalty was now impossible because Russia had signed international deals banning it .
Russian announced the moratorium in 1996 when it joined the Council of Europe , although it retains capital punishment in its criminal code .
Opinion polls suggest that a majority of Russians back the death penalty .
One recent survey showed that two - thirds of Russians backed the measure .
It said that one in four was against it , mainly because of the possibility that judges would make mistakes .
Chechnya jury trials
The court 's head Valery Zorkin said that the end of the moratorium " does not make it possible to apply the death penalty on Russian territory " .
He cited a number of international accords signed by Moscow , which banned the use of the capital punishment .
Mr Zorkin also said Russia must extend the moratorium on executions until it ratified Protocol Six of the European Convention on Human Rights , which prohibits the use of the death penalty in peaceful times .
Russia 's pledge to sign the protocol was a key condition of its membership in the Council of Europe in 1996 .
However , the country 's parliament is yet to officially outlaw executions .
In 1999 the Constitutional Court ruled that the death penalty could not be used until jury trials had been introduced in all of Russia 's 89 regions .
Thursday 's ruling was its response to the country 's Supreme Court request , which had sought to clarify the future of the moratorium because the first jury trials would take place in Chechnya on 1 January .
Chechnya is the only remaining part of the Russian Federation where trials by jury have never been held .
Last week , President Dmitry Medvedev 's representative at the Constitutional Court , Mikhail Krotov , said that the Kremlin was in favour of the gradual abolition of the death penalty .

Emma Watson posed for these pictures in the Russian version of Elle Magazine .
It is bad enough that Emma mocks the greatness of Allah by promoting witchcraft in her Harry Potter movies , but then she goes and poses for Russian Elle instead of Saudi Arabian Elle .
Frankly , I ’m not surprised .
Of course a Satanist like Emma would enjoy flaunting her wares to the godless commies .
Russia is a country full of heathens and whores , so it is no wonder they do n’t have the moral fortitude to stone Emma Watson to death for posing provocatively in this white dress .

Top Gear producer Andy Wilman has admitted the popular BBC2 show is in danger of running out of road .
Wilman , who is credited with turning the show into a global powerhouse since relaunching it with presenter Jeremy Clarkson seven years ago , warned " this incarnation of Top Gear is nearer the end than the beginning " .
In a blog addressing criticism about the latest series , shown at 9 pm on Sundays on BBC2 , Wilman said he was looking forward to the end of the current run .
" Personally I 'll be glad to see the back of it , " he wrote .
" We 've done some good stuff this series , but we were too rushed and too knackered to get everything right . "
Top Gear 's ratings have been down this series – although at more than 5 million they are very high for BBC2 – partly because the show was moved to the highly competitive 9 pm slot to avoid clashing with ITV1's The X Factor .
However , viewers have complained about the editorial direction it has taken – in Wilman 's words , that " we 've lost the plot , we 've disappeared up our arses , we 're scripting everything , we 're predictable etc etc " .
Wilman said the presenters – Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May – were starting to become caricatures of themselves .
" I do believe we 've now got the presenters playing to their TV cartoon characters a bit too much – Jezza the walking nuclear bomb , Richard the daft Norman Wisdom , and James the bumbling professor , " he wrote .
He missed " the three mates who mooch along " , pointing to a recent film about Lancias as an example where they recaptured some of the old spirit .
" I know James definitely feels that way , and Jeremy and I were saying the other morning how the Lancia film was a bit of a wake - up reminder that we can actually make good films just enthusing about cars . "
He defended the show against complaints that it was becoming too scripted , instead arguing that " you 're watching a show that 's lost its innocence " .
He said the show 's success after relaunching in 2002 had not been expected , resulting in " surprise and delight on the presenters ' faces " .
" That innocence has gone now , as always happens , because that 's the nature of TV , " he said .
" You all know the main pillars of our editorial , and we do our best to entertain , but none of us are going back to that first flush of discovery .
But although that 's sad , this is not time for glumness because there 's still so much to do . "
He admitted that the show could not go on indefinitely .
" It 's fair to say this incarnation of Top Gear is nearer the end than the beginning , and our job is to land this plane with its dignity still intact , " he said .
" But ironically , that does mean trying new things to the last , even if they screw up , because , well , it means you never stopped trying . "
London
AS we become increasingly dependent on the Internet , we need to be increasingly concerned about how it is regulated .
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed “ network neutrality ” rules , which would prohibit Internet service providers from discriminating against or charging premiums for certain services or applications on the Web .
The commission is correct that ensuring equal access to the infrastructure of the Internet is vital , but it errs in directing its regulations only at service providers like AT&T and Comcast .
Today , search engines like Google , Yahoo and Microsoft ’s new Bing have become the Internet ’s gatekeepers , and the crucial role they play in directing users to Web sites means they are now as essential a component of its infrastructure as the physical network itself .
The F.C.C. needs to look beyond network neutrality and include “ search neutrality ” : the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive , impartial and based solely on relevance .
The need for search neutrality is particularly pressing because so much market power lies in the hands of one company : Google .
With 71 percent of the United States search market ( and 90 percent in Britain ) , Google ’s dominance of both search and search advertising gives it overwhelming control .
Google ’s revenues exceeded $ 21 billion last year , but this pales next to the hundreds of billions of dollars of other companies ’ revenues that Google controls indirectly through its search results and sponsored links .
One way that Google exploits this control is by imposing covert “ penalties ” that can strike legitimate and useful Web sites , removing them entirely from its search results or placing them so far down the rankings that they will in all likelihood never be found .
For three years , my company ’s vertical search and price - comparison site , Foundem , was effectively “ disappeared ” from the Internet in this way .

BEIJING , Nov. 18 / Christian Newswire / — At 10:13 AM ( Beijing time ) , nearly 200 nervous - looking Public Security officials seized two Chinese human rights lawyers outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing , who were trying to establish a meeting with President Obama before the end of his visit to China .
Five human rights lawyers in total contacted the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday morning , but were unable to set up a meeting , due to the President ’s busy , preset schedule .
The lawyers were determined to answer the general invitation reported by U.S. media , indicating President Obama would be interested and willing to meet with fellow human rights lawyers while in Beijing .
Shortly after receiving a call from the U.S. Embassy announcing they would not be able to meet , the 200 - strong state police guard seized the two lawyers and interrogated them in the neighboring hotel for over an hour .
The lawyers were strictly warned , “ You are not allowed to meet with President Obama .
We will hold you until he leaves Beijing . ”
The police then escorted the two lawyers to their homes , where they were to be held under constant surveillance by police guards until Obama left this afternoon .
Two of the five lawyers outside the embassy were among six Chinese legal defenders who recently returned to China after visiting the United States to raise awareness of the unjust treatment of human rights lawyers .
During their visit , they spoke with members of Congress and the Department of State , testified in a hearing before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission ( 10/29 ) , and presented a panel discussion with law students at Pepperdine University in Malibu , CA .
One week later , thirty U.S. Representatives signed a bipartisan letter to President Obama on November 10th , calling for him to speak out on human rights and religious freedom while in China .
The first issue addressed in the list of recommended items was the treatment of human rights lawyers .
Click here to view the Congressional Letter to President Obama , issued November 10 , 2009 .
The six Chinese legal defenders returned home this week and last to find their families had been placed under close surveillance by local PSB ; many chose not to return home for the duration of President Obama ’s visit for the safety of their families .
This harassment follows a warning issued by Congressman Frank Wolf at the hearing , his , personal expression of concern for their safety upon their return to China .
During their visit , Chinese legal defenders repeatedly recommended that American leaders encourage President Obama to meet with his fellow lawyers in China , and for U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing to meet with human rights lawyers more frequently .
After today ’s events , a US Embassy officer informed ChinaAid President Bob Fu that he regretted the President ’s inability to meet earlier this morning , and expressed the Embassy ’s desire to invite the lawyers to a meeting in the near future .
Despite the negative implications of Chinese state police and media stifling the voice of human rights defenders , ChinaAid President Bob Fu is hopeful .
“ By bluntly declining to meet with these attorneys who are willing to take this risk and waiting for the whole night for this meeting to happen , it sends a regrettably chilling signal …
But we look forward to the U.S. Embassy keeping their word with future meetings . ”

As pressure to address climate change increases , long - simmering debates on the connections between population and environment have been renewed .
Because population policies historically often have undermined women ’s rights , these issues remain both sensitive and contentious .
Rewire welcomes open debate on these issues and encourages both comments on this and other articles as well as submissions from other authors .
As the world ’s nations meet in Copenhagen , global pressure is mounting
for leaders to come to agreement on how to address climate change .
This is an
opportunity for the United States and the other 170 nations attending the
climate forum to secure an agreement to set targets for reducing carbon dioxide
( CO2 ) emissions and provide the financing and technology needed by the developing
nations to carry it out .
There ’s additional
pressure in Copenhagen on the US as the world ’s biggest energy consumer to take
a corresponding lead role in curbing the CO2 “ greenhouse gas ” emissions that
cause climate change .
This is important because with just 5 percent of the global
population , Americans consume 25 percent of the world ’s energy , and generate 5 times
the world ’s average per-capita of CO2 emissions .
Americans are high - energy and
resource consumers in a country with a large , rapidly growing population base .
As a result , the US has a much bigger “ per-person ” link to global climate
change than any other nation .
And looking forward , with 8,000 people added
daily and 3 million people added each year in the US , there ’s real potential to
reach 1 billion high - energy - consuming Americans by 2100 .
The US population ’s
disproportionate role in causing climate change has not gone unnoticed by
nations now meeting in Copenhagen .
Many leaders have said the US must do more
to curb its emissions if it expects other countries to do likewise .

Copenhagen : Population ’s Role
In light of this ,
Copenhagen not only provides an opportunity for the US to step up to the plate
and lead by example , significantly reducing its energy use and CO2 emissions –
but also to take critical steps relating to population in the context of the climate talks because it is
associated with both the " causes " and " effects " of climate
change .
The world ’s population
is on track to reach 7 billion people in two years , just twelve years after
reaching 6 billion .
In the meantime , global climate change , as a result of
human activities , is having unprecedented effects on the planet ’s sea level
rise , weather patterns , species habitat and freshwater resources .
The US uniquely
demonstrates how these two issues – population and climate change – are
inextricably linked .
America ’s role within the global context is especially
significant : it is the third largest country in the world in terms of
population , and contributes disproportionately to the planet ’s climate change because
it is responsible for a quarter of the world ’s energy use .
The US uses more
energy than any other country , is the biggest CO2 emitter of all the
industrialized nations , and second only to China in overall global emissions .
It is also the largest and fastest growing developed nation worldwide .
This unique
combination – of America ’s high population numbers and rapid growth and high per-capita energy consumption
and CO2 emissions – makes the US pivotal in the global climate change debate .
Meeting the energy
demands of this large and rapidly growing population that consumes elevated
levels of energy and resources – while at the same time reducing the greenhouse
gas emissions contributing to climate change – is part of the challenge before
us now .
But how do US
" population " factors ( such as growth , density , movement , age / income ,
or per-capita resource use ) relate to climate change ?
There are several key
linkages , relating both to the " causes " and " effects " of
climate change :
· Population is associated with the causes of climate change mainly through
high per-capita energy use and the associated greenhouse gas emissions .
This is
from large numbers of people burning fossil fuels for vehicle use , high energy
consuming households and appliances , and widespread " sprawl " land
development to accommodate the growth ( resulting in increased vehicle use and
fossil fuel burning , and deforestation which decreases the amount of trees used
as carbon " sinks " ) .
· Population is linked to climate change ’s effects when there is high population
density and rapid population growth in the areas most vulnerable to climate
change - related sea level rise , severe weather patterns , drought conditions
including reduced snow - pack , seasonal changes , and habitat alteration that
increases people ’s exposure to vector - borne diseases .
Also , US demographic
trends such as the high and fast increasing numbers of people living along the
US coasts or in the arid West all exacerbate climate change ’s effects .
When you look at these
issues from a developing country ’s perspective , it is most often in terms of
" effects " rather than " causes " .
Large aggregates of people
there ( many of them poor , with little means to alter their situation and
respond to climate change ’s impacts ) live in the coastal or arid areas most
susceptible to climate change - induced sea level rise , increased incidence of
severe weather , and droughts .
In addition , especially vulnerable populations
living in small island states , and those who depend most heavily on the natural
climate to survive ( such as Native populations in Alaska and the Arctic ) will
disproportionately feel climate change ’s impacts .
Addressing Population and Climate Change in Copenhagen
At the climate talks
population will most likely surface in the nations ’ efforts to " mitigate
and adapt " to climate change , especially where large numbers of people
live in coastal and arid sites most prone to climate change impacts .
In the context of the
Copenhagen climate negotiations , the US can take several steps associated with
population :
– First , US leaders
should include population / demographic specialists among the experts at the
climate change table , to inform the US stance and overall negotiations with the
best , balanced scientific data on how population factors are linked to climate
changes ’ causes and effects , and how they can be part of addressing the
challenge ;
– Second , the US should take a
leadership role and show their support for voluntary universal access to good
quality reproductive healthcare that , when combined with reducing high
per-capita energy and resource use , are viable means to balance pressure on the
earth ’s natural systems .
In this case , however , it is extremely important to recognize
that we are not speaking of " blaming " high population numbers for
climate change – the science demonstrates that it is a combination of very high unsustainable per-capita energy use and rapid population growth as a
multiplier of the high energy use , that is the issue here ;
– Third , for the world ’s
nations at Copenhagen to acknowledge the links between population factors and
climate change , and the central role population plays in various ways relating
to its " causes " and " effects " worldwide , and as part of
effectively addressing the climate change .

Man On The Moon–A Colossal Hoax that Cost Billions of Dollars
Although many believe man first reached the moon in July , 1969 , we have information from a very reliable source , the Sanskrit Vedic scriptures , that the astronauts never actually went to the moon .
The manned moon landing was a colossal hoax .
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura , the spiritual master of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , once described materialistic civilization as “ a society of the - cheaters and the cheated . ”
Looking at our modern world , we can easily see why : massive advertising campaigns for cigarettes and liquor that promise pleasure but deliver disease ; widespread gambling rackets of all kinds , some government - sponsored , that bilk the public of billions each year ; high level corruption of many leaders in industry and government that reveals a nearly total disregard for the public ’s welfare .
From all this , and , much more , the only conclusion to draw is that the vast majority of people , out of ignorance of a meaningful goal of life , actually desire to be cheated - actually feel the need for the false promises and outright lies of the hucksters to provide some hope of happiness from day to day .
Thus a few clever , aggressive professionals take advantage of the ignorant masses and engage in large - scale cheating for their own selfish interests .
While cheating goes on in all fields of endeavor , one of the most outstanding is modern science .
Scientists can make useful contributions to material life , but they become cheaters when they claim that science is ( or someday will be ) independent of the laws of nature .
Theories such as “ Life originates from matter and can be created in the laboratory , ” or “ Since there is no supreme intelligence directing the universe , we [ the scientists ] are the only ones who can explain existence , ” are all bluffs perpetrated without a shred of scientific proof .
Their only purpose is to advance the prestige of the scientists and net them billion - dollar government grants for endless research .
Recent efforts to travel to the moon provide a prime example of this kind of lucrative mass “ brainwashing , ” which is still succeeding with a large portion of the gullible public .
( * Twenty - eight percent of all Americans , according to a Gallup poll cited in the Los Angeles Times on October 13 , 1976 , have seen through the sham and now believe the moon landing to be a fake ) .
Despite the tremendous volume of propaganda proclaiming the “ conquest of outer space , ” we have information from a very reliable source , the Sanskrit Vedic scriptures , that the so - called “ astronauts ” never actually went to the moon .
Although most people hold it as an article of absolute faith that man first reached the moon in July , 1969 , the manned moon landing is actually a colossal hoax .
We realize that this is very difficult for you to accept , since it directly contradicts your established beliefs .
But since you yourself have not actually gone to the moon , you owe it to yourself to consider why you are so confident that the astronauts actually have gone there .
Why do you accept the popular version of the manned moon landing ?
Because you believe the authority of the scientists , the journalists , and the politicians who propagate that version .
When we cite the Vedic scriptures , which state that the “ astronauts ” could not have gone to the moon , we are simply favoring another authority .
In both cases , it is a matter of accepting an authority and believing what it says .
Now , why do we believe the Vedic scriptures rather than the material scientists ?
Because the Vedic scriptures differ from the conclusions of material science in that they are not based on imperfect sensory investigation , but are apaurusa i.e. , they emanate from God , who is beyond the material world .
In other words , Vedic evidence stands above the defects of conditioned souls within the material world .
Thus , when it comes to real scientific knowledge , the standard of Vedic authority is perfect because it originates directly from the all - perfect , omniscient Personality of Godhead .
The Vedic account of our planetary system is already researched , concluded , and perfect .
The Vedas state that the moon is 800,000 miles farther from the earth than the sun .
Therefore , even if we accept the modern calculation of 93 million miles as the distance from the earth to the sun , how could the “ astronauts ” have traveled to the moon–a distance of almost 94 million miles–in only 91 hours ( the alleged elapsed time of the Apollo 11 moon trip ) ?
This would require an average speed of more than one million miles per hour for the spacecraft , a patently impossible feat by even the space scientists ’ calculations .
Another important reason why the manned moon landing must be a hoax is that , according to the Vedas , each planet has its particular standard of living and atmosphere , and no one can transfer from one planet to another without becoming properly qualified .
This means that if someone wants to go to Mars , for instance , he has to give up his present gross material body and acquire another one suitable for life on that particular planet .
Vedic knowledge teaches that the living being does n’t die with the death of the body , but that he is an eternal spirit soul .
As Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad - gita , “ As the embodied soul continually passes , in this body , from boyhood to youth to old age , the soul similarly passes into another body at death ” ( Bhagavad - gita , 2.13 ) .
At the time of death the human being transfers to another material body according to the desires he cultivated and the work he performed during his lifetime .
Therefore , since the moon has a particular standard of life and atmosphere , if one wants to travel there he has to adapt his material body to the conditions of that planet .
Even on the earth planet these restrictions hold true .
For example , a human being cannot possibly live in the water nor can a fish live on land .
These are the rigid conditions of life , and any attempt to defy them is artificial and will fail .
Similarly , just as you have to change your dress if you want to go from India to Europe , where the climatic conditions are different , so you also have to change your physical “ dress ” if you want to go to the specialized atmosphere of the moon .
In other words , if you want to go to the moon or the sun or any other higher planet , you can keep your finer dress of mind , intelligence , and ego , but you have to leave behind your gross dress ( your physical body ) made of earth , water , fire , and other material elements , and acquire a body suitable for your destination .
Of course , none of this will help you solve the real problem of life –entrapment in the vicious cycle of birth and death .
As Krsna states in the Bhagavad - gita , even if one transfers in his next life to a very elevated position in the highest planet in the universe , Brahmaloka , he will still have to experience birth and death .
The goal of human life is to free the soul from its continuous transmigration among different species of life on various planets , and to transfer to the spiritual planets , where life is eternal .
To reach these planets , a complete change of both gross and subtle bodies is necessary , for one can reach the spiritual sky only in a spiritual form .
We will elaborate on this a little later , but our point here is that you cannot simply force yourself onto another planet without the proper qualification .
Just as in the United States there are laws controlling the entry of foreigners through the issuance of visas , so in the universe there are also laws controlling the movement of all living beings–even astronauts and scientists–and unless one ’s karma is such that he deserves to take birth on the moon or the sun or the earth or wherever , he cannot defy the laws of nature and go there by force .
The scientists are always claiming they are independent of nature ’s law , but even they have to submit to death and rebirth ; they can not check them .
Similarly , they cannot go to the moon planet , which the Vedas describe not as a lifeless desert but as a heavenly planet of extraordinary material pleasures .
Where the astronauts actually went , or how this fabrication of lunar visitation will one day be exposed to people in general , are not part of our present discussion .
But the Vedic teachings warn us that the manned moon landing is certainly an empty bluff .
When we contradict the revered scientists like this and warn people that , through the use of brainwashing propaganda , they are being cheated out of billions of hard - earned tax dollars–we ourselves are accused of brainwashing .
But which is better : a sober warning or a colossal multi-billion - dollar hoax ?
Furthermore , even if , for argument ’s sake , we accept , that the “ astronauts ” did go to the moon , our main contention still holds : the moon excursion is a hoax , a mass brainwashing job .
Why ?
Because it has no value .
Even the scientists now admit its uselessness , and their interest in going to the moon has subsided .
After many years of concentrated effort and billions of dollars of public money spent , the scientists have concluded that the moon is uninhabitable and have stopped trying to go there .
But the public is encouraged to regard this failure as a wonderful achievement !
“ Just see !
They have come back with some moon dust ! ”
Long ago the Vedic literatures said the moon was uninhabitable by man , before going there the scientists themselves predicted they could not live in that atmosphere , and upon reaching the moon they discovered the same thing –that they could not live there .
So what is the value of this kind of billion - dollar excursion , which has produced only a few rocks ?
The scientists ’ stubbornness is like that of a boy who is repeatedly warned by his father not to stick his finger in the revolving blades of a fan , but who goes ahead and does it anyway , and is hurt .
The scientists insisted that a lunar landing would prove the United States to be the most advanced nation .
Never mind that it cost billions , which could have been spent on worthwhile projects , such as feeding the starving .
The brainwashing was so extreme that at one point Pan American Airlines was even selling tickets to the moon , and there was talk of colonizing it , although everyone acknowledged that it is impossible to live there .
And yet if we speak out strongly against this nonsense , people say we are brainwashed –for not believing in the bluff of the moon excursion .
Now , having squeezed as much prestige as possible out of their great “ success ” in reaching the moon , the scientists have become disappointed and set their sights on Mars and the huge expenditure of public funds goes on .
Again , we do not say that man should neglect science , but rather that he should practice science according to the authorized knowledge of the laws of nature .
The scientists should not attempt to defy the laws of nature , or those of God , but should work humbly in harmony with the real purpose of human life–liberation from the cycle of birth and death .
Despite all scientific theorizing , research , and technology , the scientists do not even know the nature of the life within the body , how life enters the body , and where life goes after death .
Not being able to produce even the smallest living creature , and being unable to stop death , the modern scientists should not consider themselves the all - in - all .
If we desire to praise someone for scientific achievements , let us praise the Great Brain who is actually controlling all living beings by directing
His material energy , and who regulates the immense machinery of the universe .
Let us follow Lord Brahma , who sings in the Vedic scripture Brahma - samhita ( 5.52 ) : “ I worship Govinda [ Krishna ] , the primeval Lord , by whose order the sun assumes immense power and heat and traverses its orbit . ”
The sun is a creation of God ; it is not a creation of the scientists .
So also are the oceans and the great mountains , the resources of nature , and outer space–all are works of the Supreme Personality of Godhead .
As for machine - making , the material energy of Krishna , the Supreme Energetic , has expertly fashioned male and female forms that go on reproducing themselves without further assistance from Him .
And this happens over and over in millions of species .
Can the scientists create such replicating machines ?
Can they create a sun and keep it floating perpetually in space ?
Can they create the oceans , the brain of a great scientist like Einstein , or even an ant or an amoeba ?
No .
All these scientific achievements are the works of God .
And when God Himself speaks throughauthorized scriptures like the Bhagavad - gita , He explicitly says , “ Do not waste your time trying to go to the Moon ; that is not your place . ”
If the godless human scientists defy this Supreme Scientist and Supreme Controller , then disaster will befall them and whoever follows them .
Therefore we are protesting a godless science that defies God ’s laws .
In Easy Journey to Other Planets ,
written back in 1959 , His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada warned us that attempting to reach the moon by materialistic methods is a waste of time .
In a speech ten years later he further explained :
If we go to live on the moon–assuming that it is possible even with an oxygen mask , how long could we stay ?
Furthermore , even if we had the opportunity to stay there , what would we gain ?
We might gain a little longer life perhaps , but we could not live there forever .
That is impossible .
And what would we gain by a longer life ?
… Near San Francisco
I have seen a forest where there is a tree 7,000 years old .
But what is the benefit ?
If one is proud of standing in one place for 7,000 years , that is not a very great credit .
Of course , scientists , journalists , and politicians are not known for considering things in the philosophical light of transcendental knowledge , but a sober fact to consider is this : if , even after all the scientists ’ achievements , we must still die and suffer the miseries of repeated birth and death , then what is the benefit of that science ?
Krsna tells us not to waste our valuable time with things that are only temporary and do not lead to liberation from birth and death .
“ Do n’t waste your time going from this planet to that planet , ” He says in the Bhagavad - gita .
“ Your material miseries will only follow you . ”
So the moon excursion is a hoax in yet another , all - important sense : the scientists are leading people to believe they will be happy if they go to the moon , but when considered in the context of the eternal soul ’s welfare , going to the moon and living there for many , many years still wo n’t solve the problems of life .
It is a hoax to claim that the endeavor to travel to other planets will bring happiness .
A person can be happy only if he receives information from authorized scriptures about the nature of the soul and the method of liberating the soul from his suffering condition .
This liberation is the goal of Krishna consciousness .
And yet , when we warn people not to waste their lives in temporary achievements , when we warn them not to engage in sinful activities that will force them to transmigrate to lower planets and lower forms of life–they accuse us of being duped and spreading false propaganda .
But we will not be quieted by their accusations .
As devotees of Krishna , we must go on repeating His instructions for everyone ’s benefit .
As Krishna tells us in His incarnation as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu , “ Instruct everyone to follow the teachings of Lord Sri Krsna as they are given in the Bhagavad - gita and the Srimad - Bhagavatam .
In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in the world
So you have to decide who is actually cheating : the materialist , who promises happiness in the context of temporary advancement and enjoyment , and who thereby ignores the eternal soul , or the spiritualist , the Krishna conscious person , who says , “ Always think of Krishna and become His devotee .
Worship Him and bow down before Him .
If you practice in this way , at the end of life you will certainly return to the supreme spiritual planet , which is eternal and free from all miseries , because of your full absorption in and devotion to the Lord . ”
KABUL ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber killed eight American civilians in an attack at a military base in southeastern Afghanistan on Wednesday , one of the highest foreign civilian death tolls in an insurgent strike in the eight - year war .
The explosion was at a military base in Khost province , near the border with Pakistan , U.S. officials said .
The base is a center for civilians working on reconstruction projects , a key part of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s strategy to stabilize the country .
“ We can confirm that there was an explosion in Khost province and eight Americans have been killed , ” said one U.S. official in Kabul .
Some people , none of them U.S. or NATO troops , were wounded in the explosion at Forward Operating Base Chapman , defense officials said , without providing any further details .
Asked whether the suicide blast occurred inside the base , one official said : “ That ’s my understanding . ”
Another senior official confirmed the attack involved an explosive vest .
Attacks in Afghanistan this year have spiraled to their highest levels since the Taliban were overthrown by U.S. - backed Afghan forces in late 2001 .
Civilian and military casualty tolls have reached record levels this year , with suicide attackers even targeting United Nations employees at a guesthouse in Kabul , killing five and wounding several others .
After that incident , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan were the most dangerous places for United Nations civilian staff .
Many civilians working outside Kabul have retreated into army bases as the security situation has deteriorated .
Bases are heavily fortified and require extensive security checks to enter .
Foreign aid agencies warned earlier this year that the shift into the military bases , and the use of military personnel to carry out development projects , risked a dangerous blurring of the boundaries between troops and civilians .
Washington is sending 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in an attempt to stem the violence , with NATO allies also contributing thousands more .
The Obama administration has pledged a “ civilian surge ” in Afghanistan , adding hundreds of U.S. experts to support work on development projects that aim to undermine support for the Taliban and other insurgents .
Khost is one of the areas of Afghanistan where the Taliban insurgency is strongest , and most foreigners there are troops or working under military protection .
In September a suicide bomber rammed a car into a military convoy of foreign forces there , killing one American .
Afghan civilian casualties have also been increasing , raising tensions between the Afghan government and Western forces .
Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets on Wednesday to protest a raid by foreign troops which Afghan officials say killed 10 civilians .
NATO forces say the deaths occurred in a battle in which nine insurgents were killed .

Bin Laden is believed to be somewhere along the Pakistan - Afghan border A Taliban detainee in Pakistan claims to have information about Osama Bin Laden 's whereabouts in January or February of this year .
His claims cannot be verified , but a leading American expert says his account should be investigated .
The detainee claims to have met Osama Bin Laden numerous times before 9/11 .
He claims that in January or February he met a trusted contact who had seen Bin Laden about 15 to 20 days earlier in Afghanistan .
" In 2009 , in January or February I met this friend of mine .
He said he had come from meeting Sheikh Osama , and he could arrange for me to meet him , " he said .
" He helps al - Qaeda people coming from other countries to get to the sheikh , so he can advise them on whatever they are planning for Europe or other places .
" The sheikh does n't stay in any one place .
That guy came from Ghazni , so I think that 's where the sheikh was . "
The province of Ghazni in eastern Afghanistan has an increasingly strong Taliban presence .
Large parts of the province are no - go areas for coalition and Afghan forces .
He says he declined the invitation to travel to meet Bin Laden because he was afraid of compromising his security , if he was captured by the police or the army .
" If I had met him , the first question they would have asked would be where have you met him , and I would have had more problems and it would have created problems for them [ al - Qaeda ] . "
According to a Pakistani security official the detainee has close ties with leaders of the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and was involved in kidnapping and fund - raising operations in the north - western city of Peshawar .
The entire Western intelligence community , CIA and MI6 , have been looking for [ Osama Bin Laden ] for the last seven years , and have n't come upon a source of information like this
Bruce Riedel
Former CIA analyst
The detainee , who cannot be named for legal reasons , said that militants were avoiding Pakistani territory because of the risk of US drone attacks .
" Pakistan at this time is not convenient for us to stay in because a lot of our senior people are being martyred in drone attacks , " he said .
We were given access to him twice in the past month .
He spoke at length and in detail , painting a picture of close co-operation between the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
A Pakistani interrogator was listening as he spoke .
His account suits Pakistan , which maintains that Bin Laden is not on its soil , though Britain and the US think otherwise .
But US counter - terrorism expert Bruce Riedel , a former CIA analyst , says his story is " a very important lead , that ought to be tracked down . "
" The entire Western intelligence community , CIA and MI6 , have been looking for OBL [ Osama Bin Laden ] for the last seven years , and have n't come upon a source of information like this .
" So , if it 's true - a big ' if ' - this is an extraordinary and important story , " he said .
" We know Osama Bin Laden is alive .
We know that he is living somewhere in the badlands along the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" What 's extraordinary about this story is we have someone who has come forward and said , really for the first time , ' I met with Osama Bin Laden and I had the opportunity to met him again in the recent past ' . "
Active and healthy
The detainee claims that Bin Laden is well , though there has been speculation for years that he was in poor health .
" What my associate told me was that he is fresh , and doing well , " he said .
He also claims the al - Qaeda leader is still active , training instructors who in turn train others .
" The information I have is that he provides training to special people .
There are training centres in homes , and all the teachers are first trained by the Sheikh .
Then they go and teach the classes . "
The detainee 's account raises a lot of questions - among them , what were his motives for talking .
Western interrogators may have lots of questions they would like to ask , but so far the detainee has been out of their reach .

3D images on PCs , TVs , and elsewhere used to be a dorky , headache - inducing business .
The movie industry retuned to it every 10 years or so with cringe - worthy results , such as Jaws 3 - D. Computers and , especially , CGI have changed all that .
I recently saw Robert Zemekis ' A Christmas Carol in 3D on an iMax screen and I was absolutely blown away .
Yes , I had to wear special , polarized glasses , but the movie and effects were good enough that I was utterly transported ( and I did n't mind looking like a dork ) .
The consumer electronics industry has taken notice and will roll out a bunch of 3D - ready TVs , 3D Blu-ray discs , 3D gaming laptops , and more in 2010 .
Virtually all of them require special glasses , but they 're all pretty lightweight and not the least bit ridiculous .
2010 is 3D 's year .
Microsoft Launches Office 2010 , Few Notice
Businesses and consumers took their sweet time adopting Microsoft Office 2007 , despite the fact that it's a great productivity suite .
You know how people often react to change , and Office 's ribbon menu metaphor changed a lot .
Office 2010 changes a lot less than 2007 did , but everyone got comfortable with Office 2007 .
This means that it will be an incredibly slow ride for 2010 plus , Microsoft is releasing Web productivity apps that might be an even easier path for many consumers .
So when that big 2010 release drops , PCMag and other tech outlets will write about it , but do n't expect the same fanfare that greeted .
Home Robots Rise from the Never Actually Living
2009 was one dull year for robots .
I expect ( okay , more like I 'm wishing for ) some big surprises in2010 .
I 'm sure we 'll see some odd robots at CES 2010 , and I recently got an early look at a .
Even so , I have to believe that someone is going to roll out a game - changing home robot that does some of the things we dream about , such as cleaning the windows , bringing you a cup of coffee , and maybe even performing a gentle back rub .
The technology is in place , and I have seen this robot ideal in bits and pieces .
An improving economy in 2010 may help propel some of this innovation , or maybe my words will .
I can dream , ca n't I ?
YouTube Makes Radical Changes to its Community Services , Pisses Off Everyone
I do n't get the sense that YouTube 's AdSense integration has been a booming success for Google or with consumers .
I signed up with the program but at the way YouTube uses the program to catch copyright infringers .
My guess is that 's probably kept a lot of people away from the program since so many repurpose some music , text , images , etc. from other sources when making their YouTube videos .
In 2010 , YouTube will get even cozier with major media companies and their content , using the YouTube platform to promote more HD - quality clips , trailers , and lots more full - length content .
As YouTube transforms into a traditional " network " it'll apply more and more restrictive terms on the great unwashed community .
You know who I mean ; the dolts who post obscenities and nonsense in comments fields for virtually very clip on the service .
This will transform YouTube into something its early fans barely recognize .
In other news , Facebook redoes its privacy policy for the 8th time in 2010  no one is satisfied .
Google Does Hardware
Google releases a Google Phone to consumers in early 2010 and the public goes wild .
Then it follows up with a lovely , branded netbook that runs the brand - spanking - new Chrome operating system .
Consumers are confused about why Google would start manufacturing hardware and are especially confounded by the phone , since they get their phones from their favorite or contractually obligated carrier .
Only a handful of technophiles buy the phone .
Consumers stay away because they do n't like choosing a carrier after the fact .
Google 's netbook fairs no better because consumers and businesses are n't ready to make the super - thin client leap .
This may simply be a case of Google being too far ahead of the curve .
Google Does n't Do Hardware
Google never delivers a Google - branded phone directly to consumers ( through retailers ) because that 's not its core business and it does n't like the terrible margins on hardware -- even if it can afford to give away a phone and a netbook for free .
Apple Adds More Apps , So Does Android , So Does Microsoft
The app ware continues , but as Apple reaches 300,000 apps in its AppStore , company executives realize that the signal - to - noise ratio is out of whack .
The company will start culling dead , bad , and useless apps and turn the AppStore into an AppMall where they report numbers for categories only and leave totals to the tech press and bloggers .
Palm Realizes Apps Are Important
Palm may or may not release some new hardware in 2010 , but the tech press will not get fleeced again .
Yes , we all loved the , but where are the apps ?
In 2010 , Palm will make a huge push to get its app pump going .
To do so , it 'll take its 1,000 most popular apps from the original Palm OS platform and rewrite them for the Web OS .
It 'll also hold cash - prize contests to encourage developers to create award - winning Web OS apps .
It 'll do all this or the Palm Pre becomes an intriguing footnote in 2010 .
As I wrote this , Palm recommitted itself to getting more apps on its platform .
Damn I 'm good . 
e-Book Readers Explode , but People Still Buy Kindles
The Amazon Kindle may or may not be the best e-Book reader in 2010 .
There will be so many new models with similar features that consumers may no longer be able to tell the difference .
This leaves aside the two leading competitors , Nook from Barnes & Noble , which will officially reach consumers in 2010 , and the Sony Reader , which has been around longer than the Kindle but has failed to spark the same level of interest .
In 2010 , Amazon will lead because consumers 1 ) like it and 2 ) they 'll call all readers , regardless of their real names , Kindles .
In essence , the Kindle becomes the " Kleenex " of e-Book readers .
This will prompt
Sony to come up with a more imaginative name than Reader .
I 'd suggest SpeedReader or Braniac .
Apple Launches a Tablet , Everyone Forgets About JooJoo
Apple finally releases the Apple Tablet , or the iTablet , and everyone forgets about the former CrunchPad , now JooJoo , which should be stuck in a legal wormhole for much of 2010 .
The Apple Tablet will be exciting , gorgeous , and expensive .
Early sales will be amazing , but by the end of 2010 , it will not be as popular as the iPhone , iPod touch , iMac or MacBook .
It may not even sell as well as the Amazon Kindle .
[ Insert Bizarre MalWare Name Here ] Threatens Millions of Windows PCs
There will be another malware scare .
They always happen in the late winter or early spring .
It 's guaranteed not to be nearly as bad as everyone will predict .
Do yourself a favor right now : Update your security software and then ignore the whole fiasco .
Carol Bartz Exits Yahoo and No One Notices
Is Yahoo really all about me ?
I do n't feel like it is .
I use Yahoo for mail , photo management ( Flickr ) , and Web hosting ( I have a few domains with them ) , but I really feel like Yahoo is all about survival .
Yahoo as a search entity will become irrelevant in 2010 .
Its latest ad campaign which no one cares about will disappear and Bartz will shed one final part of the Yahoo business herself .
I 'd be surprised if she lasts through half of 2010 .
In the meantime , the Microsoft / Yahoo ad partnership will expand and by late 2010 , we 'll be talking , again , about a merger .
However , this time , Microsoft will succeed , with a deal to acquire Yahoo completed by early 2011 .
Color eBooks Threaten Kindle Dominance
I know that color e-ink technology is coming at least I think it is .
And the emergence of a few working prototypes next year will cause a slowdown in black and white e-reader sales as consumers wonder if they should wait for the next big thing .
My guess , however , is , even if there are prototypes , functioning and affordable units are two or three years away .
So keep buying those Kindles and Nooks ( Nook !
Remember , the one from Barnes & Noble ?
Okay , the Kindles Barnes & Noble sells . )
Sony Unveils 45 - Inch , $ 15,000 OLED Display
Every year at CES , Sony shows off a bigger OLED display than the year before .
Yet , these super - thin HD displays never make it to market .
They wo n't in 2010 either , but Sony will show off its biggest OLED yet , at a price point that no average consumer can afford .
FTC's Intel Antitrust Hearing Pushes to 2011 , NVidia and AMD Seethe
The stuff that the Federal Trade Commission wants Intel to do is for any competitive firm .
I expect Intel to fight throughout 2010 and win a delay of at least 4 months .
The remedies will be negotiated down to something Intel finds reasonable ( though they 'll call them painful and unfair ) and that competitors NVidia and AMD will grudgingly ( but with barely hidden glee ) accept in 2011 .

? What is Twitter and why is it important for us ?
Of course to traffic flow to our articles , links and blogs as well without spamming others .
Twitter is a popular social networking site which people share their opinions , links and interesting things .
It is like Facebook and Myspace .
Well , why do people need to share and what happens when I publish mine in Twitter ?
Everything you publish is directed to your followers instantly .
They see what you publish and share it with their followers if they think that it is good enough to share .
In this way , something in your mind travels all over the world .
Twitter is a way of fast communication because everything published echoes somewhere in other side in an instant of time .
Speed is the most determining factor in popularity .
Joining Twitter is as easy as breathing .
The only thing you need to do is to fill a sign - up form and activate your Twitter account .
After that , you are on another side of the road .
If you have no follower or search determiner before your tweets , nobody will be aware of your tweets .
The fist stage is to make followers by using # character followed by keywords because people in this way will be aware of you .
Most of the people use searching part of Twitter with alternative keywords .
Start your journey by making tweets related to quotes , travel , making money , life , writing , science , health , medicine , cancer and so on so forth .
Sure that , someone will see your tweets and start following you .
As the number of your tweets and followers increases , much more people realize your existence in Twitter 's miraculous world .
Do n't be so fast man because over speeding brings about death .
If you follow others fast , you may be bound to break the Twitter rules .
Before starting your journey , you had better to read the rules of Twitter to protect you against bans and punishments .
If you follow the rules and obey them , you are always in safe .
How about the basic rules ?
They are as below .
1 . Make much more tweets and retweets and share your opinion and as well as the others ' .
2 . Use search criteria by using proper and popular keywords and tags to be realized by others .
3 . Do not use follow button too much .
This is a specific sign of a spammer and you 'll be treated as those .
4 . Do not spam others and violate the rules .
Do not publish the same thing again and again .
Do n't think that people do not care about it .
Twitters and Twitter admins are more careful than you think .
5 . Do not dream of making millions of Twitters in a short time if you are not a celebrity .
As an ordinary person , move slow but safe .
6 . Twitters use other assisting programs which are completely legal .
Do not use third party programs to make much more followers instantly .
Strictly speaking , you are caught and suspended .
It is not easy to convince Twitter to remove your suspension .
7 . Do not use add followers programs .
They are also illegal .
8. Do not publish the links from the same original source .
You 'll be dubious and treated as spammer .
9 . Publish limited number of tweets daily .
10 - 20 tweet is enough .
10 . Use Twitter lists to group your Twitters .
Making lists are a good way of communicating with others .
Follow - back , travel , sport , health , music and art based groups are commonly preferred .
Majority of Twitters enjoy being involved in lists .
Briefly , Twitter is one of the main traffic producers for webmasters if it is used properly and correctly and of course as long as the rules are not broken .
You can trust Twitter but do not forget that they also wait the same respect .
Be as patient as possible while walking on the dusty roads of Twitter .

It was the simple clacking of two wooden sticks on a street corner that signaled to children the start of kamishibai , a popular pastime during Depression - era Japan .
Kamishibai means “ street theater using painted illustrations . ”
Author Eric P
Nash examines the little - known art form and predecessor to modern - day anime and manga in his recent book “ Manga Kamishibai : The Art of Japanese Paper Theater , ” published by Abrams ComicArts .
Storytellers would travel from town to town with their butai ( miniature stage ) on the back of a bike .
The setup was reminiscent of a Punch and Judy show , but instead of puppets the narrator would slide a series of poster boards with watercolor illustrations in and out of the box .
He would act out the script , which was written on cards placed on the back of a board .
Each show consisted of three stories of about 10 minutes each : an adventure for boys , a domestic drama for girls and then a simple comic story .
The majority of performances ended in a cliffhanger , forcing eager audiences to return the next day .
Nash , a New York Times writer and research editor and author of several books on architecture , has always been a fan of comics .
It was while reading the book “ Getting it Wrong in Japan ” that he came across kamishibai , a word he had never seen before , and decided to dig further .
Unable to find any book on the topic in English , he traveled to Japan two years ago to investigate and found more than 300 images in two children ’s libraries in Osaka and Tokyo and discovered countless contributions that kamishibai had made to the comics genre .
American Airlines Fires Designer Who Reached Out To Disgruntled Customer
from the not - quite - connecting - with - fans dept
When I first learned about this , I was horrified .
Mr. X is actually a good UX designer , and his email had me thinking there was hope for American Airlines .
The guy clearly cared about his work and about the user experience at the company as a whole .
But AA fired Mr. X because he cared .
They fired him because he cared enough to reach out to a dissatisfied customer and help clear the company ’s name in the best way he could .

A few years back , I remember seeing a fascinating study that showed that how a company responds to a problem or a mistake is more important to customer loyalty than not making any mistakes at all .
That is , customers feltto companies that screwed up , but handled it well , than companies that never screw up at all .
If you think about this , it makes a fair amount of sense .
At some point or anotherscrews up .
Everyone makes a mistake .
Customers recognize this .
But if a company never makes a mistake , then customers mayhow they 'll be treated when that future mistake comes .
However , if the mistake has been made , and the response was good , the customer is confident that future mistakes will be handled well also .
Of course , the converse situation is true as well .
If a company screws up and thenas well , it causes tremendous harm to a brand -- often in ways that cannot easily be redeemed ( if at all ) .
Brendan writes points us to a story of American Airlines seeming to go out of its way to respond poorly to a situation -- someone from the company had first responded well .
It started with a blog post written by Dustin Curtis , complaining about the poor user interface design of American Airlines website ( including a suggested redesign ) .
He did n't expect much of a response , but actually received a nice and detailed email from a user design person at American Airlines explaining why it was often tricky to good design at large companies , due to all of the different interests , but says that some good stuff is coming , even if it may take some time .
Now , that 's a good response .
It 's human .
It explains the situation without PR / marketing speak that a recipient would know was bogus .
It is the type of response that makes someone feel good about American Airlines ( mostly ) .
So , how did AA respond ?
Apparently , higher level folks at American Airlines did n't like the fact that an employee was actually being open and honest with a customer , took the text from Dustin 's post ( he had n't named the designer ) , searched through the email system , identified the guy ... and fired him ... and threatened to sue the guy if he spoke to Dustin again .
As Dustin notes : The guy 's original response was an example of an excellent interaction with a disgruntled customer .
It was honest .
It responded to his concerns .
It was real .
It was human .
It made Dustin actually reconsider his view of the company .
Then , in firing the guy , American Airlines did n't just wipe out that goodwill , it pushed negative feelings well beyond where things had been before .
It made it clear that American Airlines does not value honesty .
It showed that American Airlines did not value actually engaging with disgruntled customers .
It showed that American Airlines did not value trying to make disgruntled customers happy .
And , as such , it 's also probably giving a lot of people very good reasons not to be customers of American Airlines at all .

The Conservatives ' lead over Labour has been reduced to single figures , according to a Guardian / ICM poll which increases the pressure on Gordon Brown to call an early general election .
While the nine - point lead would probably still give David Cameron a narrow Commons majority , it will reinforce the view in the camps of both party leaders that the Tories can still be deprived of victory .
This is the first Guardian / ICM poll – and the first by ICM for any newspaper – since December 2008 to give the Tories less than a double - digit lead .
After 12 months of unbroken Conservative dominance in the polls , the figures – showing the Tories on 40 % , down two , Labour on 31 % , up two , and the Liberal Democrats on 18 % – are likely to intensify calls for Brown to go to the country on 25 March next year , rather than the 6 May polling day that most at Westminster have been expecting .
Labour 's vote share has risen for the fourth consecutive month , improving significantly on the 25 % share it had in August .
The gap between the parties is a sharp reduction from the 17 points recorded two months ago .
The results suggest increasing doubts about the economic competence of Cameron and his shadow chancellor , George Osborne .
But there will be some relief at Tory HQ that the party has not fallen below the crucial 40 % threshold that gives it a strong chance of winning a majority .
If replicated at a general election , the figures would probably result in an outright Tory win – but by the narrowest of margins .
One projection suggests a Cameron government would be returned with an overall majority of four .
The great hope within Labour circles is that the tightening of the race is a trend that may continue to the point where Cameron is denied any kind of victory .
The government 's progress in the poll comes at the end of a fortnight in which many MPs believe that , after months of political drift , the prime minister has finally got himself back on the front foot despite a mixed reception for last week 's pre-budget report .
His suggestion 13 days ago that Conservative tax policy had been dreamed up " on the playing fields of Eton " brought accusations of class war , but went down well with Labour backbenchers .
The Copenhagen conference on climate change has provided Brown with the chance to present himself as an international statesman , while the new tax on bankers ' bonuses – an overwhelmingly popular move backed by 71 % of voters , according to today 's poll – has also won plaudits from leaders overseas .
The prime minister , however , remains deeply unpopular , and may find it difficult to maintain momentum with no spare public money to play with .
The poll was carried out at the weekend , after news of Alistair Darling 's pre-budget report had sunk in .
The chancellor 's statement confirmed a record - breaking £ 178bn deficit for this year , and pencilled in spending cuts that will hit the pay of public - sector workers as well as national insurance increases that will hit everyone earning more than £ 20,000 .
The poll shows that 19 % of voters believe the package will make the economy worse overall , against 12 % who think it will make things better .
A mere 31 % believe Brown and Darling are better placed to manage the economy than Cameron and Osborne .
While Labour 's stewardship of the economy remains unpopular , the narrowing of the political gap appears to be underpinned by growing unease about the prospect of Conservative financial management .
Just two months ago , 49 % of voters said they thought Cameron and Osborne would do better than Darling and Brown , but that figure is 38 % today .
With the small print of the poll suggesting continuing public reluctance to accept the tough choices that balancing the government 's books will require , it could be that the Tory tactic of demanding deeper , faster cuts than Labour is willing to make is starting to make the public nervous .
There was speculation about an early election in the weekend press , with Labour chiefs ordering staff to be ready to fight an election any time next year .
Brown does not have to go to the country until June .
Ed Balls , the schools secretary , said he had " heard nobody talking about going for early or snap elections " .
But some Labour MPs believe Brown should move sooner rather than later .
Cameron himself sought to encourage the talk – stating in public that he believed that 25 March was a " likely " election date .
Although most recent opinion polls have suggested some tightening in the political race , not all of them have done so .
A ComRes survey for the Independent on Sunday suggested that the Conservative lead had actually widened to 17 points .
• ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,009 adults aged 18 + by telephone on 11 - 13 December 2009 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .
When the BBC's David Willis recently found himself caught up in the American healthcare system in Los Angeles , he says he only just lived to tell the tale .
The healthcare system is a huge topic all over the US
It is amazing how , within a matter of minutes , fate can build you up almost beyond recognition , only to deliver a well - aimed slap across the backside .
Going through the mail last week , I found the first envelope was marked US Immigration and Naturalisation Service and contained a laminated piece of plastic , confirming that my application for permanent residency had finally been approved .
Holding my green card up to the light , I was just about to break into an interpretative dance of celebration .
Then I spotted the second envelope in the pile and the exhilaration evaporated instantaneously .
The letter was from a company which oversees the BBC 's health insurance plan .
Tearing open that envelope , I was confronted with news that my coverage - extended after I left the BBC to go freelance - had come to an end .
The news itself was hardly unexpected but seeing it in black and white filled me with horror .
Even if you are a picture of good health , all it takes is a freak accident and you are toast
Now I was on my own , it was me against the system .
I had the feeling things were about to get ugly because , when it comes to health insurance , the Americans could teach the British a thing or two about bureaucracy .
Big hypochondriac
It is difficult to overstate how vital health insurance is in America .
Find yourself in the emergency ward , strapped to machines which go " bip " and surrounded by sullen doctors who have been called in from the golf course just to deal with you , and if you do not have health insurance , the chances are you will be paying for your visit until the end of time .
About 47 million Americans currently have no health insurance Even if you are a picture of good health , all it takes is a freak accident and you are toast .
An expatriate friend of mine spent a week in " outpatients " after having the misfortune of flying a small aeroplane into the sea .
His bill was around $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) .
He told the cashier he had come in for treatment - not to buy the hospital .
Being uninsured was especially worrying for me because I am , well , the world 's biggest hypochondriac .
If I get a headache , I instantly assume I am haemorrhaging .
The longer it continues , the wilder my doom - laden diagnosis becomes .
What , for example , if it is tapeworm larvae burrowing a hole in my brain ?
Such fears have led me to have virtually every test under the sun .
I have donated blood by the bucketful and enough urine to float a battleship , because I know my body is trying to fool me .
Yes , I feel as fit as a fiddle , but it is a facade .
My body is lulling me into a false sense of security while some deadly virus , some terminal disease - holed up in some dark corner of my insides - marshals its forces and starts plotting my untimely demise .
By the time he had finished , I felt like a winner on ' The Price Is Right ' .
The cost - £ 5,500 a year !
Given the fact that visits to the doctor are therefore a weekly occurrence for me ( I prefer to think of it more as a pastime than an addiction ) you can see how distressing the prospect of being without insurance could be .
And so , with heavy heart , I set about taking on the many - headed hydra that is the American healthcare system .
For some reason , there was no way of simply continuing the policy the BBC had in place and paying the premiums myself .
So I had to apply as if I had never had coverage before .
I found myself talking to Steve , a chirpy salesman at one of the larger insurance companies , who ran me through the details of one of their more popular policies .
Yes , I would still have to pay to see either a doctor or a specialist but he would throw in a prostate exam - and a colonoscopy every 10 years .
By the time he had finished , I felt like a winner on " The Price Is Right " .
The cost - $ 9,100 ( £ 5,500 ) a year !
Tenterhooks President Obama has made healthcare reform a big priority Steve sent me a form which delved into my every malady since emerging from the womb .
I was reminded that there is one thing that health insurance companies absolutely hate - sick people .
Sick people have the audacity to require treatment , which not only eats into profits , but upsets the accountants ' balance sheets .
Too much of that and you could completely spoil their day .
Having explained away virtually every cough and sneeze over the course of the last 49 years , I got to question 41 :
Has the person applying for coverage consumed any alcoholic beverage in the last six months ?
I read that several times , even at one point substituting a different pair of glasses , and no , I was not mistaken - it really did say six months .
Not six days , or six minutes , but six months .
By the time I had finished the form I had a headache and eye strain , and so I went back and added those to my pre-existing conditions and then sent the form off to Steve .
He told me my application would be assessed by an underwriter , which conjured up images of Lloyds of London weighing the fate of the QE2 or , in my case , the Titanic .
And so I wait on tenterhooks to learn whether my application has been approved .
The tension is killing me .
And at my age that is not good for the blood pressure .

Earthquakes Actually 19th Century Aftershocks |
Listen to Prof. Seth Stein discuss his latest research on earthquakes
EVANSTON , Ill . ---
When small earthquakes shake the central U.S. , citizens often fear the rumbles are signs a big earthquake is coming .
Fortunately , new research instead shows that most of these earthquakes are aftershocks of big earthquakes ( magnitude 7 ) in the New Madrid seismic zone that struck the Midwest almost 200 years ago .
The study , conducted by researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Missouri - Columbia , will be published in the Nov. 5 issue of the journal Nature .
" This sounds strange at first , " said the study 's lead author , Seth Stein , the William Deering Professor of Geological Sciences in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern .
" On the San Andreas fault in California , aftershocks only continue for about 10 years .
But in the middle of a continent , they go on much longer . "
There is a good reason , explains co-investigator Mian Liu , professor of geological sciences at Missouri .
" Aftershocks happen after a big earthquake because the movement on the fault changed the forces in the earth that act on the fault itself and nearby .
Aftershocks go on until the fault recovers , which takes much longer in the middle of a continent . "
The difference , Stein explains , is that the two sides of the San Andreas fault move past each other at a speed of about one and a half inches in a year -- which is fast on a geologic time scale .
This motion " reloads " the fault by swamping the small changes caused by the last big earthquake , so aftershocks are suppressed after about 10 years .
The New Madrid faults , however , move more than 100 times more slowly , so it takes hundreds of years to swamp the effects of a big earthquake .
" A number of us had suspected this , " Liu said , " because many of the earthquakes we see today in the Midwest have patterns that look like aftershocks .
They happen on the faults we think caused the big earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 , and they 've been getting smaller with time . "
To test this idea , Stein and Liu used results from lab experiments on how faults in rocks work to predict that aftershocks would extend much longer on slower moving faults .
They then looked at data from faults around the world and found the expected pattern .
For example , aftershocks continue today from the magnitude 7.2 Hebgen Lake earthquake that shook Montana , Idaho and Wyoming 50 years ago .
" This makes sense because the Hebgen Lake fault moves faster than the New Madrid faults but slower than the San Andreas , " Stein noted .
" The observations and theory came together the way we like but do n't always get . "
Aftershocks go on for long times in other places inside continents , Stein said .
It even looks like we see small earthquakes today in the area along Canada 's Saint Lawrence valley where a large earthquake occurred in 1663 .
The new results will help investigators in both understanding earthquakes in continents and trying to assess earthquake hazards there .
" Until now , " Liu observed , " we 've mostly tried to tell where large earthquakes will happen by looking at where small ones do . "
That 's why many scientists were surprised by the disastrous May 2008 magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Sichuan , China -- a place where there had n't been many earthquakes in the past few hundred years .
" Predicting big quakes based on small quakes is like the ‘ Whack - a - mole ' game -- you wait for the mole to come up where it went down , " Stein said .
" But we now know the big earthquakes can pop up somewhere else .
Instead of just focusing on where small earthquakes happen , we need to use methods like GPS satellites and computer modeling to look for places where the earth is storing up energy for a large future earthquake .
We do n't see that in the Midwest today , but we want to keep looking . "

How would you describe your project to someone who had never heard of it before ?
How would you describe your project to someone who had never heard of it before ?
The objective of my project was to develop a toolset for the Unity Editor which would streamline and improve the workflow involved in creating realistic terrains for games .
It contains a range of ' filter ' style tools which allow a Unity artist to easily generate , erode and texture terrain objects .
How many people were involved in creating your project ?
How many people were involved in creating your project ?
I worked on the project alone , but had help along the way - both from developers who were willing to share bits of code and of course support from the Unity team .
What is your previous experience with Unity or coding in general ?
What is your previous experience with Unity or coding in general ?
I actually do n't have a background in game development as such .
I started out my career as a designer , mostly focusing on editing , motion graphics and visual effects .
I later switched into working in digital and I currently work in the role of Art Director at Amnesia Razorfish in Sydney where I 've been involved in the creation of quite a few Flash games for a number of high - profile clients including Microsoft , Pepsico and Smirnoff .
I 've had an interesting in creating games for a long time .
I grew up with a Commodore 64 and I remember reading books about coding in BASIC , but none of it really made much sense to me at the time .
I wrote my first actual working game in Director about ten years ago while was at university and started to get more seriously into game development about 3 years ago .
I 've been using Unity for the last 2 years .
What inspired the idea behind your project ?
What inspired the idea behind your project ?
The idea behind the project was to enable indie developers to create large scale , realistic and playable game worlds within a short time span .
I think procedurally generated content is a great solution , particularly for indie game development projects with limited time , budgets and human resources .
What does your project bring to the table that is n't available already ?

Unity already has a great terrain engine as one of its core features - I believe my project expands on this by providing the user with the ability to rapidly create a variety of different landscapes directly within Unity without needing to use third party software .
An additional advantage is that landscapes can now be generated dynamically at runtime .
This means a Unity game can have a potentially infinite number of levels with a negligible impact on the file size .
Unity - Summer of Code
How would you describe Unity to someone who has never used it before ?
How would you describe Unity to someone who has never used it before ?
Unity is a game engine with a clean and very user - friendly integrated development environment .
I think its strongest feature is in its flexibility .
On one hand it allows indie game artists and developers to jump in and start actually creating a game without a long and time consuming learning process - instead it encourages you learn as you create .
On the other hand , it does this without becoming oversimplified or by losing any of the more complex features that one expects from a game engine and therefore is a viable solution for small and middle sized teams to develop commercial games .
What originally attracted you to use Unity ?
What originally attracted you to use Unity ?
When I started looking for game engines , everything seemed to be very much focused on the PC platform only .
I did try Torque , but found the learning curve too steep and did n't make much headway , especially due to the need to learn C++ which I had never used before .
Unity on the the other hand was available for the Mac platform and was quite easy to get into and start using , especially as I had prior experience in Flash development - Unity JavaScript being structurally quite similar to ActionScript .
I also like the fact that it was originally developed for the Mac platform , rather than ported from a PC product .
Previous to the release of Unity 2.5 it got a bit of criticism for being limited to Macs only , but when you look at the software now and see the attention that has been given to the interface , the workflow and the user experience , I think you can really see the great benefit that a Mac- centric design influence has brought to it .
Which platforms do you target with Unity when making games ?
Which platforms do you target with Unity when making games ?
I develop for Mac and PC .
I have n't really delved into the iPhone side of things quite yet , but I definitely intend to .
I 'd also really like to have the opportunity to develop for the Nintendo Wii in the future .
What inspired you to enter Unity 's Summer of Code competition this year ?
What inspired you to enter Unity 's Summer of Code competition this year ?
I 've had an interest in game development for quite a while and I thought the Unity Summer of Code was a great opportunity to get more involved in the game development community as well being as a chance to get my name out there .
Would you have created your project without the competition ?
Would you have created your project without the competition ?
Yes , for sure .
Though , it probably would have taken a lot longer to complete .
What does being selected as a final project in the Summer of Code competition mean to you ?
What does being selected as a final project in the Summer of Code competition mean to you ?
I was a bit surprised .
I do n't think I really expected to be one of the successful applicants .
I think it was a great opportunity and I 'm really keen to see the response of the Unity community to my project as well as the projects developed by the other participants .
I 'll definitely be looking into how I can benefit from using their Summer of Code projects in my own games .
Development - Post Mortem

After you had the original idea , describe the process you took in prototyping the idea and finally bringing it to completion ...
I began the project by prototyping some of the more basic erosion scripts .
These scripts were originally implemented as ' wizards ' , but once I had a system in place for applying various kinds of filters to terrain objects , I later turned them into filters which could be run directly from the component inspector .
I then focused on creating a usable interface for the toolkit and began working on and adding the various planned features .
As early on as possible I integrated features that were fundamental to the usability of the tools such as quality settings , a progress bar to give the user feedback on the application of filters , as well as features such as the brushes .
Throughout this time I continued to work on , test and optimise the existing erosion scripts as well as constantly testing new ideas and methods for erosion using more advanced techniques such as velocity fields .
I also added the generator tools , which allow for the creation of base terrain using Voronoi , fractal and Perlin noise algorithms .
It was quite late in the timeline to add completely new features , but I think the value they added to the project far outweighed the investment in time .
Towards the end of the project timeline my main focus was refinement of the existing features and writing documentation for the tools , including a scripting reference for the runtime API .
Did you plan the project in detail , or did you let it evolve along the way ?
Did you plan the project in detail , or did you let it evolve along the way ?
A bit of both really .
I scoped out most of the features before I started and for the most part I stuck to that plan .
However , there were definitely a few completely new ideas that found their way in to the final version .
How did you go about testing the project ?
How did you go about testing the project ?
For this project the testing process was continuous .
All of the erosion and terrain generation filters were tested extensively as I refined them .
I also wrote some additional code to visualise erosion data such as terrain height , water flow and velocity fields , which were exported as image sequences so I could really see what the filters were doing to the terrain heightmap at each iteration .
Did you get any external opinions or help on the development of the project ?
Did you get any external opinions or help on the development of the project ?
Not really , and looking back I think I really should have done so more .
Aside from another Unity developer I work with and the guys at Unity , no - one else really got to see it .
I did get some assistance indirectly from a couple of other developers who shared some of their code .
This meant that I did n't have to write fractal and Perlin noise algorithms from scratch , which was a big help .
What do you feel went well in the project ?
What do you feel went well in the project ?
I think pretty much everything in the early stages of the project went quite well .
All of the basic features like getting the simpler erosion filters working and creating a user interface for the toolset got completed in less time than I had originally expected .
After that everything started to get a bit complicated !
What did n't go so well ?
What did n't go so well ?
Unsurprisingly , I struggled in trying to understand computational fluid dynamics - shallow water models , Navier - Stokes equations and so on .
Without a degree in physics , I did n't get very far .
It was too ambitious for such a short time frame .
I hope to revisit this in the future to come up with a better solution for hydraulic and glacial erosion .
I also ran into problems in capturing mouse events .
I was pretty unhappy with the solution that I had to use for applying erosion brushes .
I hope this will be one of the first things to get fixed in the first update .
If you were to go back and do your project again , what would you do differently ?
If you were to go back and do your project again , what would you do differently ?
I would do more research in the early stages of the project .
As it was , I did some research to start off with , then jumped into writing code and only got back to looking at the research side of things again quite late in the project .
However , by this time there was n't really enough time to implement anything new that I was able to learn .
What would you do the same ?
What would you do the same ?
The tools for generating base terrain were n't part of the original scope of the project , but I think they really added a lot of value to the end product and really helped to create an integrated solution for creating terrain .
If I were to do the project over , these features would definitely stay in .
Which part of the project did you find the most interesting or fun ?
Which part of the project did you find the most interesting or fun ?
Learning how to create custom component inspectors for the Unity editor was quite cool .
My job ( during daylight hours ) involves a lot of interface and user experience design , so it was satisfying to be able to utilise the full extent of Unity 's Editor GUI to put this knowledge into practice .
Writing the documentation was probably the least fun part - tedious , but necessary .
Did you have enough time to complete your project ?
Did you have enough time to complete your project ?
I have enough commercial experience ( including some bad experiences ! ) to know that I needed to start out by setting realistic deliverables for the project .
I divided my feature set into ' must have ' , ' should have ' and ' nice to have ' features and agreed on a minimum number of deliverable features with the guys at Unity .
While I ended up both exceeding the minimum amount and delivering a couple of originally unscoped features , there were still some features that never made it in , mostly due to their high level of complexity .
I will definitely continue to support the project with improvements to existing features as well as the addition of new features .
Destructible terrain is something I 'd really like to see in a future version .
Is there anything else you 'd like to have added or spent more time on if you had the time ?
Is there anything else you 'd like to have added or spent more time on if you had the time ?
I really wanted to find a better solution for hydraulic erosion that was based on real fluid dynamics but as I discussed before , these simulations were far too complex to include within the time span , they would be a whole other project unto themselves .
Is there any advice you 'd like to offer any developers based on your experience in this project ?
Is there any advice you 'd like to offer any developers based on your experience in this project ?
I can't stress enough how important it is to scope the project properly .
Set yourself or your team realistic and achievable goals , particularly when there 's a client involved .
It 's far better to under - promise and over - deliver than to over - promise and under - deliver .
Unity Development
How did you find the process of creating an addon of Unity ?
How did you find the process of creating an addon of Unity ?
Unity is a great environment to work in and though it has a reasonably smooth learning curve - like all software it takes time to really get proficient at it , so this was definitely a learning process for me .
I think the main challenge in creating tools for other people to use is getting the interface design right .
The things that are second nature to you as the developer will probably not be so obvious to other users .
For this reason I probably spent only half the time working on the erosion , generator and texturing code and the other half was all about the interface elements .
Would you create another addon for Unity ?
Would you create another addon for Unity ?
Yes , definitely .
If I create something that is useful within my own projects , then I 'm sure that it may be helpful to other Unity users as well .
Also , I think there is a real advantage in creating tools and features for games in an ' add - on ' format .
This means that the features will be easily portable and the features they provide will be more high - level rather than being too specific to single game .
What support did you get along the way ?
What support did you get along the way ?
Our main line of support for the Unity Summer of Code was an email mailing list .
The benefit of this was that everyone was able to see the challenges that were being faced by other participants and be able learn from them .
It also meant that most of the issues we ran into were resolved pretty quickly .
Looking forward ...
What do you plan to do next ?
What do you plan to do next ?
I will continue to work on and improve the Terrain Toolkit , but first I 'm keen to hear the response of the Unity community to the tools I have developed , as their feedback will definitely affect which features that I add or improve .
Other than that , my main focus will be on other projects including getting back to work on a game I have had in production for a while .
I also have plans to release one of the planned features of this game as an add - on for Unity .
It 's a procedural combat animation system , which should be quite cool - if it works .
Would you enter another Unity Summer of Code competition ?
Would you enter another Unity Summer of Code competition ?
Possibly , but I 'd also be very keen to see what great ideas other Unity developers can bring to the community .
Finally , do you have any other comments you 'd like to make about Unity , Unity Summer of code , your project or development in general ?

Mick Jagger stills gets some job satisfaction at 66 People approaching retirement age find their work becomes more enjoyable , research has suggested , but the effect is greater amongst men than women .
Psychologists at Qowl , a private firm linked to the University of Portsmouth analysed the quality of working life of more than 5000 college employees .
Previous studies had found that women workers were happier than men .
However , the study shows that this difference narrows with age , and the trend reverses around the age of 60 .
At this age men seem to experience a notable increase in the quality of working life , the researchers said .
However , the report said that women at or about the age of 60 report less of an increase in their quality of working life , even though they would normally be nearer retirement .
The result is that men for the first time have become happier at work than women .
Better prospects ?
The researchers say the reason for the pre-retirement bounce amongst men is not clear , but suggest a range of different explanations .
As men often have jobs which allow greater flexibility , this enables them to wind down and reduce their stress as they head for retirement .
Or it could be that men can typically look forward to the prospect of higher pensions than women .
A third possible explanation is that whilst men look forward to retirement , and see it as an opportunity to spend time doing things they like ; women may not relish the prospect of being at home with their husbands .
" While we are only now beginning to identify the factors that contribute to the quality of working life , this research underlines the potential benefits that might be reaped from taking action to enhance the work environment and experience for all age groups , " said Dr Darren Van Laar , lead researcher at Qowl .
His team now plan to research the reasons why men find contentment at work after the age of 60 , to see if the benefits can be transferred to women as well .
They also propose to explore whether levels of work satisfaction change as people adjust to working longer and retiring later .

A realtime Mandelbrot zoomer in SSE assembly and CUDA
Yep , looks boring when it does n't move ...
Yep , looks boring when it does n't move ...
( Written around 2002 , enhanced with OpenMP and CUDA in 2009 ) Back in 2002 , I wanted to try out SSE programming .
I bought and installed an Athlon - XP based motherboard , and over the better part of a weekend , I created a simple implementation of a Mandelbrot zoomer in native SSE assembly .
I was happy to see that it was almost 3 times faster than pure C - even when compared to pipelined floating point calculations .
Many years later , I revisited the code and enhanced it to use the GNU autotools ; it therefore became portable to all Intel platforms under the sun ( Linux / x86 , Mac OS/X , Windows ( via MinGW gcc ) , OpenBSD / amd64 and FreeBSD / amd64 ) .
Benchmarks showed - as expected - that OSes had very little to do with such " pure " calculations as this ; speed was pretty much the same under all of them ( I used libSDL for portable HW - assisted " blitting " of the pixel data ) .
Recently ( 2009 ) , I learned how to use OpenMP and Intel TBB to make use of additional CPUs / cores - so I added OpenMP #pragmas to both the pure - C and SSE modes ... and smiled as I saw my little Atom330 get a boost from 58 to around 150 frames per second .
The manually written SSE code was also using GCC 's AT / T syntax , so it could be automatically inlined by GCC even at - O3 optimizations .
I thought that this was the limit - what else could I do now but to sit back and wait for CPU cores to multiply ?...
Perhaps buy an i7 ?
Nope .
Wrong .
Last weekend , I got to play with an NVIDIA GT240 ( around 100 $ ) .
Having read a lot of blogs about GPU programming , I downloaded the CUDA SDK and started reading some samples .
In less than one hour , I went from my rather complex SSE inline assembly , to a simple , clear Mandelbrot implementation ... that run ... 15 times faster !
Let me say this again : 1500 % faster .
Jaw dropping .
Or put a different way : I went from 147 fps at 320x240 ... to 210 f ps ... at 1024x768 !
I only have one comment for my fellow developers :
The algorithm in question was perfect for a CUDA implementation .
You wo n't always get this kind of speedups ( while at the same time doing it with clearer and significantly less code ) .
But regardless of that , you must start looking into GPGPU coding : CUDA ( and soon , OpenCL ) can become huge game changers .
If you do n't , you are in danger of missing ... significant opportunities ...
Update , one week later :
It turned out that my GT240 is so ... fresh , that the Linux drivers are n't yet up to speed - they are driving my card at Performance Level 1 instead of 2 ( i.e. at 324M Hz memory clock instead of 1700MHz ! ) .
Under Windows , the code runs at an astonishing 420 frames per second , so the speedup is not 15x , it is in fact more like 30 x ...
Update , March 2010 : The newest NVIDIA drivers ( 195.36.15 ) have corrected the bug - the Linux and Windows versions now run at identical speeds : Blazing ones :‑)

SSE version
The portable GPL source code for the SSE version is here
Compile and run with ...
./ configure && make && ./src/mandelSSE
You can zoom - in / zoom - out with the left and right mouse buttons .
Hit ESC and it will report the frames per second achieved .
If you are a Windows user , here is a Win32 binary ( compiled via TDM / MinGW , and compressed with 7 - zip ) .
To use it , simply unzip the package and run mandelSSE.exe .
CUDA version
The CUDA package ( portable GPL source code ) , is also available .
The program also uses OpenGL to blit the CUDA - generated data on the screen - this way there 's no moving of pixel data back - and - forth between the CPU and the GPU : they are calculated on the GPU global memory , and they are drawn from that ( via a texture ) .
If you are working under Windows , a precompiled Windows binary is here ( compressed with 7 - zip ) .
Make sure you disable Vertical Sync in order to get the maximum frame rate .

Just so you understand what I meant by " getting a speedup with clearer and simpler code " , this is the CUDA , from inside src/mandel.cu : if you have ever coded a Mandelbrot zoomer , you 'll probably agree that this is one of the simplest ways to implement it :
Now compare that to the SSE main loop ( brace yourselves ) : Convinced ? :‑)
Not only was this SSE code a pain to write , and impossible to maintain ...
It is now an order of magnitude slower than what you can get with cheap GPUs !
Times have changed ( yet again ) ...

A German software engineer and encryption expert named Karsten Nohl told a group of hackers at the Chaos Communication Congress that he and a group of enlisted contributors had broken the primary encryption code protecting GSM phone calls .
According to The New York Times , spokespeople from the GSM Association shrugged off the news , saying that actually listening in on a call is still practically complex , even with the code book now available online .
However , other security experts disagree , saying the crack now puts mobile interception of the majority of non -3G cellphone calls within reach of " any reasonable well - funded criminal organization . "
Simon Bransfield - Garth , CEO of London - based Cellcrypt , said the net effect of Nohl and the company 's work would likely " reduce the time to break a GSM call from weeks to hours . "
The current GSM encryption scheme is known as the A5/1 standard , based on a 64 - bit encryption scheme .
A newer specification based on more modern and tougher to crack 128 - bit encryption called A5/3 has been available since 2007 , but few network operators have undertaken the expense to upgrade their networks .
Nohl says the project was meant to point out the vulnerability of the current 64 - bit system and " push operators to adopt better security measures for mobile phone calls . "
He says his team took precautions to keep the effort within legal boundaries , and " are not recommending people use this information to break the law .
What we are doing is trying to goad the world ’s wireless operators to use better security . "
You probably do n't have to worry about sniffers on the other end of your next wireless call just yet , but it seems like 64 - bit GSM encryption might not be long for this world .
Do you think Nohl 's " white hat " efforts will have the desired effect ?
How do you think carriers should respond to the crack ?

Department store operator Sogo & Seibu has announced plans to sell two humanoid robots custom - built to look like the people who purchase them .
Roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro already got his
The mechanical doppelgangers are available for a limited time as part of a special New Year 's promotional sale at Sogo , Seibu , and Robinson ’s department stores .
They will be built by Japanese robotics firm Kokoro , which is perhaps best known for its line of Actroid receptionist humanoids .
In addition to providing the robot with the owner 's face , body , hair , eyes and eyelashes , Kokoro will model the robot 's facial expressions and upper body movements after the buyer .
The robot 's speech will be based on recordings of the owner 's voice .
Orders will be accepted from January 1 to 3 at any of Japan 's 28 Sogo , Seibu , or Robinson 's department stores .
Only two robot twins are available , but given the hefty price tag of 20.1 million yen ( $ 223,000 ) each , the stores will likely be hard - pressed to find any takers .
If more than two orders are received , the purchasers will be selected in a random drawing .

Using a unique Aramid fibre technology for disc pad manufacture employing high tech man made products such as aramid fibres and Twaron the EBC brake product is years ahead of its competitors , most of whom manufacture using cheap steel fibre bases .
The use of Aramid fibres allows a higher degree of flexibility in compound design enabling EBC Brakes to produce a quiet and long lasting range of compounds that can improve brakes , reduce rotor wear and thereby greatly reduce brake dust found on alloy wheels .
With Aramid fibre technology only 4 % of the pad is the fibre used for binding and production , in steel fibre technology up to 50 % is cheap binding fibre .
All EBC
Brake pads for highway use are tested to ECE R90 brake safety regulations and are therefore considered a legal equivalent to and replacement for any Original Parts .
The exhaustive R 90 procedures guarantee not only pad quality and performance on a model - by - model vehicle basis but also oversee conformity of production at our plant .
This means EBC parts are as good as , or in most cases BETTER than original parts .
On brake rotors the EBC product excels once again with its UK manufacture for a high percentage of its brake disc sales .
Made in modern series production facilities in the UK the EBC Brake rotor is cast using “ Moulded out ” tool patterns to produce a balanced design rotor core that prevents brake distortion and brake vibration .
Precision machined and inspected the EBC Brake rotors are tested rigorously before leaving our factory .
Many EBC sport rotors have recently been tested and awarded the much accredited TUV testing approval and the resulting German ABE number signifying the highest in quality for parts sold into Europe .
If this product works at the Autobahn Speeds ( which are unlimited ) you can be confident that EBC Brake rotors will deliver on your car , truck or SUV in any country .
Through its team of R and D ( Research and Development ) Engineers EBC Brakes in its Bristol UK manufacturing facility continues to improve its product annually with the arrival of new raw materials and by rigorous testing on one of its five dynamometers bring you the best in modern and classic vehicle brakes .
When replacing brakes of any kind please remember how important brake safety is to your own well being and either have a professional mechanic install your new brakes or if you are a qualified mechanic use the EBC installation DVD as a guide in support of your vehicle owner ’s manual .
These installation guide DVD tasters can be viewed here and the full DVD purchased from online vendors .

Always replace brake pads when replacing rotors , it is false economy to use worn or old pads on new rotors as these can cause hot spots and promote brake fade and more than double bed in time .
This is both dangerous and bad economics .
Always turn or replace rotors when changing pads .
If your vehicle was suffering from brake vibration , just changing the pad wo n’t necessarily cure the problem , the brake rotor will also need changing or turning .

Open MPI v1.4 release : explanation
From : Jeff Squyres ( jsquyres_at_[ hidden ] )
Date : 2009-12-08 17:29:07
The Open MPI Team , representing a consortium of research , academic , and industry partners is just about to release Open MPI version 1.4 in reaction to the GNU Libtool 2.2.6 b security update release ( see http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3736 for more details ) .
This mail contains a few more details than the upcoming v1.4 announcement mail .
The Open MPI v1.4 release closes a potential security vulnerability associated with the embedded version of GNU Libtool used in the Open MPI v1.3.x series .
The * only * change between Open MPI v1.3.4 and Open MPI v1.4 is that we used GNU Libtool 2.2.6 b to build Open MPI v1.4 , thereby updating Open MPI 's embedded copy of the " libltdl " library .
*** NOTE : We feel that this GNU Libtool libltdl vulnerability has
minimal / trivial impact on Open MPI , but are releasing v1.4 with
the update for the following reasons :
- It is a convenient excuse to transition the v1.3 " feature
release " series in to the v1.4 " stable / bug fix " series .
- It serves to encourage all v1.2 [.x ] users to upgrade to the v1.4
series .
Note that the GNU Libtool libltdl problem extends back quite a few versions , and affects multiple Open MPI versions :
- v1.0 series :
This series is ancient and no longer maintained .
- v1.1 series :
This series is ancient and no longer maintained .
- v1.2 series : Until today , the v1.2 series was technically the
stable release .
However , the majority of Open MPI users are
already using the v1.3 series .
As such , there are currently no
plans to patch the v1.2 series .
- v1.3 series :
As of today , this series has formally transitioned to
the v1.4 series ; no more releases will be made .
- v1.4 series : First release today .
As mentioned above , v1.2 [.x ] users are encouraged to upgrade to the v1.4 release .
If you cannot upgrade to v1.4 but need the security fix , please send a note to the Open MPI user 's list to help us gauge the demand for a v1.2.10 release .

From The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley in Copenhagen
In the Grand Ceremonial Hall of the University of Copenhagen , a splendid Nordic classical space overlooking the Church of our Lady in the heart of the old city , rows of repellent , blue plastic chairs surrounded the podium from which no less a personage than Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the IPCC , was to speak .
I had arrived in good time to take my seat among the dignitaries in the front row .
Rapidly , the room filled with enthusiastic Greenies and enviro - zombs waiting to hear the latest from ye Holy Bookes of Ipecac , yea verily .
The official party shambled in and perched on the blue plastic chairs next to me .
Pachauri was just a couple of seats away , so I gave him a letter from me and Senator Fielding of Australia , pointing out that the headline graph in the IPCC ’s 2007 report , purporting to show that the rate of warming over the past 150 years had itself accelerated , was fraudulent .
Would he use the bogus graph in his lecture ?
I had seen him do so when he received an honorary doctorate from the University of New South Wales .
I watched and waited .
Sure enough , he used the bogus graph .
I decided to wait until he had finished , and ask a question then .
Pachauri then produced the now wearisome list of lies , fibs , fabrications and exaggerations that comprise the entire case for alarm about “ global warming ” .
He delivered it in a tired , unenthusiastic voice , knowing that a growing majority of the world ’s peoples – particularly in those countries where comment is free – no longer believe a word the IPCC says .
They are right not to believe .
Science is not a belief system .
But here is what Pachauri invited the audience in Copenhagen to believe .
1. Pachauri asked us to believe that the IPCC ’s documents were “ peer - reviewed ” .
Then he revealed the truth by saying that it was the authors of the IPCC ’s climate assessments who decided whether the reviewers ’ comments were acceptable .
That – whatever else it is – is not peer review .
2. Pachauri said that greenhouse gases had increased by 70 % between 1970 and 2004 .
This figure was simply nonsense .
I have seen this technique used time and again by climate liars .
They insert an outrageous statement early in their presentations , see whether anyone reacts and , if no one reacts , they know they will get away with the rest of the lies .
I did my best not to react .
I wanted to hear , and write down , the rest of the lies .
3 . Next came the bogus graph , which is featured three times , large and in full color , in the IPCC ’s 2007 climate assessment report .
The graph is bogus not only because it relies on the made - up data from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia but also because it is overlain by four separate trend - lines , each with a start - date carefully selected to give the entirely false impression that the rate of warming over the past 150 years has itself been accelerating , especially between 1975 and 1998 .
The truth , however – neatly obscured by an ingenious rescaling of the graph and the superimposition of the four bogus trend lines on it – is that from 1860 - 1880 and again from 1910 - 1940 the warming rate was exactly the same as the warming rate from 1975 - 1998 .
4. Pachauri said that there had been an “ acceleration ” in sea - level rise from 1993 .
He did not say , however , that in 1993 the method of measuring sea - level rise had switched from tide - gages to satellite altimetry against a reference geoid .
The apparent increase in the rate of sea - level rise is purely an artefact of this change in the method of measurement .
5. Pachauri said that Arctic temperatures would rise twice as fast as global temperatures over the next 100 years .
However , he failed to point out that the Arctic was actually 1 - 2 Celsius degrees warmer than the present in the 1930s and early 1940s .
It has become substantially cooler than it was then .
6. Pachauri said the frequency of heavy rainfall had increased .
The evidence for this proposition is largely anecdotal .
Since there has been no statistically - significant “ global warming ” for 15 years , there is no reason to suppose that any increased rainfall in recent years is attributable to “ global warming ” .
7. Pachauri said that the proportion of tropical cyclones that are high - intensity storms has increased in the past three decades .
However , he was very careful not to point out that the total number of intense tropical cyclones has actually fallen sharply throughout the period .
8. Pachauri said that the activity of intense Atlantic hurricanes had increased since 1970 .
This is simply not true , but it appears to be true if – as one very bad scientific paper in 2006 did – one takes the data back only as far as that year .
Take the data over the whole century , as one should , and no trend whatsoever is evident .
Here , Pachauri is again using the same statistical dodge he used with the UN ’s bogus “ warming - is - getting - worse ” graph : he is choosing a short run of data and picking his start - date with care so as falsely to show a trend that , over a longer period , is not significant .
9. Pachauri said small islands like the Maldives were vulnerable to sea - level rise .
Not if they ’re made of coral , which is more than capable of outgrowing any sea - level rise .
Besides , as Professor Morner has established , sea level in the Maldives is no higher now than it was 1250 years ago , and has not risen for half a century .
10 . Pachauri said that if the ice - sheets of Greenland or West Antarctica were to melt there would be “ meters of sea - level rise ” .
Yes , but his own climate panel has said that that could not happen for thousands of years , and only then if global mean surface temperatures stayed at least 2 C ( 3.5 F ) warmer than today’s .
11 . Pachauri said that if temperatures rose 2 C ( 3.5 F ) 20 - 30 % of all species would become extinct .
This , too , is simply nonsense .
For most of the past 600 million years , global temperatures have been 7 C ( 13.5 F ) warmer than today , and yet here we all are .
One has only to look at the number of species living in the tropics and the number living at the Poles to work out that warmer weather will if anything increase the number and diversity of species on the planet .
There is no scientific basis whatsoever for Pachauri ’s assertion about mass extinctions .
It is simply made up .
12 . Pachauri said that “ global warming ” would mean “ lower quantities of water ” .
Not so .
It would mean larger quantities of water vapor in the atmosphere , hence more rain .
This is long - settled science – but , then , Pachauri is a railroad engineer .
13 . Pachauri said that by 2100 100 million people would be displaced by rising sea levels .
Now , where did we hear that figure before ?
Ah , yes , from the ludicrous Al Gore and his sidekick Bob Corell .
There is no truth in it at all .
Pachauri said he was presenting the results of the IPCC ’s fourth assessment report .
It is quite plain : the maximum possible rate of sea - level rise is put at just 2 ft , with a best estimate of 1 ft 5 in .
Sea level is actually rising at around 1 ft / century .
That is all .
14 . Pachauri said that he had seen for himself the damage done in Bangladesh by sea - level rise .
Just one problem with that .
There has been no sea - level rise in Bangladesh .
At all .
In fact , according to Professor Moerner , who visited it recently and was the only scientist on the trip to calibrate his GPS altimeter properly by taking readings at two elevations at least 10 meters apart , sea level in Bangladesh has actually fallen a little , which is why satellite images show 70,000 sq. km more land area there than 30 years ago .
Pachauri may well have seen some coastal erosion : but that was caused by the imprudent removal of nine - tenths of the mangroves in the Sunderban archipelago to make way for shrimp - farms .
15 . Pachauri said we could not afford to delay reducing carbon emissions even by a year , or disaster would result .
So here ’s the math .
There are 388 ppmv of CO2 in the air today , rising at 2 ppmv / year over the past decade .
So an extra year with no action at all would warm the world by just 4.7 ln( 390/388 ) = 0.024 C , or less than a twentieth of a Fahrenheit degree .
And only that much on the assumption that the UN ’s sixfold exaggeration of CO2 ’s true warming potential is accurate , which it is not .
Either way , we can afford to wait a couple of decades to see whether anything like the rate of warming predicted by the UN ’s climate panel actually occurs .
16 . Pachauri said that the cost of mitigating carbon emissions would be less than 3 % of gross domestic product by 2030 .
The only economist who thinks that is Lord Stern , whose laughable report on the economics of climate change , produced for the British Government , used a near - zero discount rate so as artificially to depress the true cost of trying to mitigate “ global warming ” .
To reduce “ global warming ” to nothing , one must close down the entire global economy .
Any lesser reduction is a simple fraction of the entire economy .
So cutting back , say , 50 % of carbon emissions by 2030 , which is what various extremist groups here are advocating , would cost around 50 % of GDP , not 3 % .
17 . Pachauri said that solar and wind power provided more jobs per $ 1 million invested than coal .
Maybe they do , but that is a measure of their relative inefficiency .
The correct policy would be to raise the standard of living of the poorest by letting them burn as much fossil fuels as they need to lift them from poverty .
Anything else is organized cruelty .
18 . Pachauri said we could all demonstrate our commitment to Saving The Planet by eating less meat .
The Catholic Church has long extolled the virtues of mortification of the flesh : we generally ate fish on Fridays in the UK , until the European Common Fisheries Policy meant there were no more fish .
But the notion that going vegan will make any measurable impact on global temperatures is simply fatuous .
It is time for Railroad Engineer Pachauri to get back to his signal - box .
About the climate , as they say in New York ’s Jewish quarter , he knows from nothing .

At the World Rowing Championships , Poznan , Poland
If you 're watching the TV coverage on Sunday and someone nearby asks what those little people at the back of the boat do , it 's fine to kick off by saying there are eight big men with small cox but there 's a lot more to tell .
Phelan Hill , a 28 - year - old from Bedford , says his role in the Great Britain men's eight is like combining those of jockey , football manager and occasionally mother .
When he needs it , he also has experience of dealing with crisis situations thanks to his afternoon job , working as a banking and financial advisor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer .
" You go out there with a plan but races sometimes do n't go to plan so you have to make a value judgement , like a football manager would , " he told me .
" I like the jockey analogy more , though , because that makes the rowers the horses .
If you whip them too hard they get tired before the finish but if you do n't do it enough they wo n't work hard enough .
" And , like horses , you have to show them who 's boss .
" But you sometimes have to be a mum , aware of how people are feeling .
You have to be critical and know when they 're being lazy but you can't hit someone all the time . "

“ Pleasure is the object , duty and the goal of all rational creatures . ”
– Voltaire
Pleasure .
Regardless of the goals we set , what motivates us or how disciplined we are , we are still biological creatures that respond to and crave stimuli that give us pleasure .
If you had a magic button that let you experience intense pleasure and euphoria whenever pressed , you might push that button thousands of times a day , and beg me not to take it away when I tried to stop you .
Why is this ?
It has to do with the way our brain ’s “ pleasure centers ” are wired * , and it just might hold the key to why we procrastinate and take part in activities that we later regret wasting time on , and that get in the way of achieving our dreams .
In the rest of this article , I will discuss :
What the research shows us about our pleasure centers
What naturally stimulates our pleasure centers , and theorize why it evolved to respond to such stimuli
New man -made stimuli that are stimulating our pleasure centers – and perhaps gaming our brain ’s reward system
The Pleasure Center – Experiments & Research
There is some fascinating research on the subject of pleasure .
The experiment which sparked interest and led to further research in the brain ’s pleasure centers was conducted by James Olds and Peter Milner :
“ In 1954 , James Olds and Peter Milner accidentally implanted an electrode into the [ pleasure centers ] of a rat and discovered that it became very energized , so they purposely set up an apparatus such that whenever a rat pressed a bar it generated a small electrical stimulation to the area .
The rats pressed the bar until they collapsed , even to the point of forgoing food and water . [… ]
The effect has since been found in all mammals tested , including humans . ”
– Page 113 The Mind of the Market by Michael Shermer
Other accounts of the research state that the rats would press the bar 6000 times an hour .
Well sure , you might say , but there are two issues with that experiment .
One , those are rats , not humans , and two , how do we know what they felt when that area of the brain was stimulated ?
We have the answer to both those questions , because Dr. Robert Heath repeated these experiments – with human subjects :
“ [ A ] n electrode was implanted into [ the patients ’ pleasure centers ] and turned on — these patients experienced a euphoria so powerful that when the researchers tried to end the experiment , one patient pleaded with them not to . ”
– Page 113 The Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doidge
So we know that stimulating the pleasure center ( electrodes implanted in subjects ’ brains ) provides intense feelings of pleasure ( euphoria ) – the next questions to me are :
What is the evolutionary purpose of this pleasure center ?
What naturally stimulates ( and is supposed to stimulate ) the pleasure center ?
What is stimulating our pleasure center that perhaps should n’t be , and ( like rats pressing a bar ) is artificially giving us pleasure ?
The Purpose Of Our “ Pleasure Center ”
There does not appear to be any definitive answer on why we evolved to experience pleasure , but the theories and discussions I have read appear to all suggest the same thing : if we acquired the ability to reward ourselves with a feeling of pleasure when presented with certain stimuli , then it was most to reinforce behaviors that increased the likelihood of survival and reproduction .
This is supported by some laboratory studies :
“ Dopamine is released naturally from [ …] the [ pleasure center ] when hungry rats eat or when sexually motivated rats copulate [… ] .
Moreover , blockage of dopamine receptors may block the rewarding effect of food or sexual contact [ … ] . ”
– Page 207 , Psychology by Peter O. Gray
I found this fascinating .
So not only do we experience the “ normal ” benefits associated with food or sex but in addition to that our brain rewards us with a feeling of pleasure .
These are not the only things that stimulate our pleasure center however .
New stimuli ( items we ingest as well as activities ) have been shown to stimulate the pleasure center as well :
“ Novel events are known to produce arousal and increased attention [ … ]
This motivational aspect of novelty may be considered adaptive in nature , since approach to novelty may promote survival as it encourages the location of new food sources , mates , and identification of potential sources of danger [ … ] .
[ L]esions [ … ] in the [ pleasure center ] have also been demonstrated to produce a transient disruption of novelty - seeking behavior . ”
– Page 112 in Dopamine Receptors And Transporters by Anita Sidhu
Items That Stimulate And Hijack Your Brain
“ Direct access from the outside to the brain ’s dispenser of pleasure , its reward system , was never intended by nature .
It is too dangerous , a circumvention of the evolutionary forged link between work and reward , a key to adaptation . ”
– Page 108 Inside The Brain , by Ronald Kotulak
We ’ve already established that food , sex and novel stimuli activate the pleasure center .
Let ’s look at some other stimuli that have been shown to activate and perhaps even hyperstimulate this part of our brains – in particular items which were likely not readily available while our brains were evolving .
Drugs ( cocaine , amphetamines ) , Tobacco , Alcohol .
Alcohol zips directly to the brains pleasure center to make us feel pleasure , almost as soon as we start drinking .
Drugs and tobacco act in similar fashion .

Video Games .

Television .
“ Television [ provides ] unnatural levels of sensory stimulation .
Little in real life is comparable to this .
Television may overpay the child for paying attention to it , and in so doing it may physically corrupt the reward system [ … ] . ”

Music .
Research has shown increased levels of dopamine , as well as increased activity in the pleasure centers when listening to music .
Research has shown increased levels of dopamine , as well as increased activity in the pleasure centers when listening to music .
Fast Food ( High Fat , High Sugar Foods ) .
High fat , high sugar foods were not a part of our natural environment – fast food is a man-made creation , and since we have not had time to evolve and adjust to this stimuli , they hyperstimulate the pleasure centers .
The levels of fat and sugar are so high in these foods that our body does not know how to respond , and so responds with extremely large reward
Look familiar ?
Television and video games are two of my procrastination thumbscrews .
I bet some of you notice other items on this list as well as perhaps particular weaknesses .
Note :
For the sake of keeping this article readable , I ’ve broken out my research for this list of items into a separate sidebar : Television , Video Games and Other Stimuli That Hijack Your Brain ’s Dopamine Reward System .
Feel free to give it a read now or later =)
Should We Give Up Pleasure ?
I am not suggesting that anyone should give up everything that gives them pleasure ; rather , I like to be aware of why and how I make choices .
This research has led me to realize that perhaps sometimes we are being held hostage to brain chemicals – and can fight back .
Stimulating the pleasure center for a dopamine rush is a short term “ fix ” – the feeling does n’t last , and so I think it is worth considering whether that short term buzz is worth sacrificing progress towards long term goals .
I had a great discussion with a friend recently about life and who we are .
One issue we talked about was how we looked back at some of the stupid things we did in the past , and days we just unproductively wasted away – days we wish we could have back .
I mentioned to him how when hooked directly into their pleasure center , rats spent all their time pressing the lever – in ways that suggest they were almost incapable of pulling themselves away from it .
We talked about how now , if I feel like spending a whole day playing video games I ask myself :
Do I really want to play video games ?
Or am I just like those rats ?
Am I just pushing my own , artificial pleasure buttons ?

It 's a Bizarro - World indeed when Microsoft is held up by a judge in Europe as a paragon of openness , but that 's apparently what happened in a law suit brought by Nintendo .
The games console and software maker has lost its case against Divineo Group in a Paris suit to block the sale of Nintendo DS Flash cartridges in France .
The judge dismissing Nintendo's case is reported to have said that by blocking non-Nintendo carts , the company is purposely locking out developers from their consoles .
Maxconsole , a site run by Max Louran of Divineo , wrote the judge said Nintendo : " Should be more like Windows where ANYONE can develop any application if they wish to . "
The ruling has been seized upon as a victory for those building homebrew games or who install non-Nintendo games on systems via the Flash carts , and were worried that Nintendo 's lawyers would come after them .
The carts allow non-Nintendo games to be run on systems like the popular DS .
The carts do this because they bypass Nintendo's DRM .
Maxconsole wrote : " Nintendo is deemed to be ' illegally ' protecting their system by locking users out .
Therefore , developers should not actually require separate development kits and should just be able to develop applications as they wish on retail versions of Nintendo's consoles . "
A Nintendo spokesperson told The Reg : " We are reviewing the judgment and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage . ”
It would seem Europe is shaping up to be hostile territory for Nintendo on this topic .
A court in Spain last month dismissed the company 's case against Grupo Movilquick over alternative cartridges for Nintendo DS devices .
Techdirt and Publico.es reported that although the judge found the cartridges circumvented Nintendo's DRM and could be used for pirating games and playing games downloaded from the internet , they also extended the devices by adding functionality not offered by Nintendo . ®

In a provocative new study , a University of Utah scientist argues that rising carbon dioxide emissions - the major cause of global warming - cannot be stabilized unless the world 's economy collapses or society builds the equivalent of one new nuclear power plant each day .
" It looks unlikely that there will be any substantial near - term departure from recently observed acceleration in carbon dioxide emission rates , " says the new paper by Tim Garrett , an associate professor of atmospheric sciences .
Garrett 's study was panned by some economists and rejected by several journals before acceptance by Climatic Change , a journal edited by renowned Stanford University climate scientist Stephen Schneider .
The study will be published online this week .
The study - which is based on the concept that physics can be used to characterize the evolution of civilization - indicates :
Energy conservation or efficiency does n't really save energy , but instead spurs economic growth and accelerated energy consumption .
Throughout history , a simple physical " constant " - an unchanging mathematical value - links global energy use to the world 's accumulated economic productivity , adjusted for inflation .
So it is n't necessary to consider population growth and standard of living in predicting society 's future energy consumption and resulting carbon dioxide emissions .
" Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at current rates will require approximately 300 gigawatts of new non-carbon - dioxide - emitting power production capacity annually - approximately one new nuclear power plant ( or equivalent ) per day , " Garrett says .
" Physically , there are no other options without killing the economy . "
Garrett says colleagues generally support his theory , while some economists are critical .
One economist , who reviewed the study , wrote : " I am afraid the author will need to study harder before he can contribute . "
" I 'm not an economist , and I am approaching the economy as a physics problem , " Garrett says .
" I end up with a global economic growth model different than they have . "
Garrett treats civilization like a " heat engine " that " consumes energy and does ' work ' in the form of economic production , which then spurs it to consume more energy , " he says .
" If society consumed no energy , civilization would be worthless , " he adds .
" It is only by consuming energy that civilization is able to maintain the activities that give it economic value .
This means that if we ever start to run out of energy , then the value of civilization is going to fall and even collapse absent discovery of new energy sources . "
Garrett says his study 's key finding " is that accumulated economic production over the course of history has been tied to the rate of energy consumption at a global level through a constant factor . "
That " constant " is 9.7 ( plus or minus 0.3 ) milliwatts per inflation - adjusted 1990 dollar .
So if you look at economic and energy production at any specific time in history , " each inflation - adjusted 1990 dollar would be supported by 9.7 milliwatts of primary energy consumption , " Garrett says .
Garrett tested his theory and found this constant relationship between energy use and economic production at any given time by using United Nations statistics for global GDP ( gross domestic product ) , U.S. Department of Energy data on global energy consumption during1970 - 2005 , and previous studies that estimated global economic production as long as 2,000 years ago .
Then he investigated the implications for carbon dioxide emissions .
" Economists think you need population and standard of living to estimate productivity , " he says .
" In my model , all you need to know is how fast energy consumption is rising .
The reason why is because there is this link between the economy and rates of energy consumption , and it 's just a constant factor . "
Garrett adds : " By finding this constant factor , the problem of [ forecasting ] global economic growth is dramatically simpler .
There is no need to consider population growth and changes in standard of living because they are marching to the tune of the availability of energy supplies . "
To Garrett , that means the acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions is unlikely to change soon because our energy use today is tied to society 's past economic productivity .
" Viewed from this perspective , civilization evolves in a spontaneous feedback loop maintained only by energy consumption and incorporation of environmental matter , " Garrett says .
It is like a child that " grows by consuming food , and when the child grows , it is able to consume more food , which enables it to grow more . "
Is Meaningful Energy Conservation Impossible ?
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Garrett 's theory is that conserving energy does n't reduce energy use , but spurs economic growth and more energy use .
" Making civilization more energy efficient simply allows it to grow faster and consume more energy , " says Garrett .
He says the idea that resource conservation accelerates resource consumption - known as Jevons paradox - was proposed in the 1865 book " The Coal Question " by William Stanley Jevons , who noted that coal prices fell and coal consumption soared after improvements in steam engine efficiency .
So is Garrett arguing that conserving energy does n't matter ?
" I 'm just saying it 's not really possible to conserve energy in a meaningful way because the current rate of energy consumption is determined by the unchangeable past of economic production . …
If it feels good to conserve energy , that is fine , but there should n't be any pretense that it will make a difference . "
Yet , Garrett says his findings contradict his own previously held beliefs about conservation , and he continues to ride a bike or bus to work , line dry family clothing and use a push lawnmower .
An Inevitable Future for Carbon Dioxide Emissions ?
Garrett says often - discussed strategies for slowing carbon dioxide emissions and global warming include mention increased energy efficiency , reduced population growth and a switch to power sources that do n't emit carbon dioxide , including nuclear , wind and solar energy and underground storage of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning .
Another strategy is rarely mentioned : a decreased standard of living , which would occur if energy supplies ran short and the economy collapsed , he adds .
" Fundamentally , I believe the system is deterministic , " says Garrett .
" Changes in population and standard of living are only a function of the current energy efficiency .
That leaves only switching to a non-carbon - dioxide - emitting power source as an available option . "
" The problem is that , in order to stabilize emissions , not even reduce them , we have to switch to non-carbonized energy sources at a rate about 2.1 percent per year .
That comes out to almost one new nuclear power plant per day . "
" If society invests sufficient resources into alternative and new , non-carbon energy supplies , then perhaps it can continue growing without increasing global warming , " Garrett says .
Does Garrett fear global warming deniers will use his work to justify inaction ?
" No , " he says .
" Ultimately , it 's not clear that policy decisions have the capacity to change the future course of civilization . "

Thank you so much for all of your hard work .
I think you did a great job !
I will definitely pass your name along to anyone I know who ’s hurt for the free consultation .
Roy Miller
I do n’t know where I would be without the Law Offices of Robert Paysinger .
It was a very emotional experience , and I feel as if I owe Mr. Paysinger my life !
The other lawyers would promise everything , but it was only here that I felt his integrity and willingness to live up to his word .
He and the paralegals were so incredibly helpful throughout the strenuous process of my case .
Going through a lawsuit is an emotional roller coaster , but whenever I was confused they would sit and explain everything in terms that I could understand .
They provided an emotional support and treated me like family .
It ’s never about the money there , but about you , if you are upset they will do everything to help you , and work extremely hard for you .
They are extremely honest and straight forward .
I would recommend Mr. Paysinger to everyone , because they truly and genuinely care about you .
Tammy Wonder
At the Law Offices of Robert Paysinger , I was very pleased with the professionalism and courteousness of everyone who worked on my case .
I had a horrible experience with my boss and dealing with my company regarding my workman ’s comp .
I came to the Paysinger Law Offices and received a settlement for what was needed to further my medical care so that I can heal and get back to work .
He defended my rights when they were violated and I am very happy with the results !
Thank you !

TALLAHASSEE -- Legendary Florida State coach Bobby Bowden , who built one of college football 's greatest dynasties in 34 seasons with the Seminoles , plans to announce his retirement Tuesday morning , sources close to the situation told ESPN.com .
Bowden told The Associated Press Tuesday morning he wanted to speak to his players before announcing later in the day whether he will return to coach Florida State next season .
A team meeting has been scheduled for 2:15 p.m. ET .
" I want to meet with my team first , " Bowden said on his way into the office .
MBABANE
Population growth , adherence to land distribution customs , and a small country are combining to make Swaziland a crowded place , rapidly running out of room to achieve food security .
The population has doubled to more than one million since independence from Britain in 1968 , but according to custom each Swazi son is given a portion of land on the family farm , located on communal Swazi Nation Land administered by traditional chiefs , to build a home , cultivate maize and graze cattle .
The effects of relentless subdivision are beginning to be felt in a country where about 80 percent of the population reside in rural areas , under the rule of sub -Saharan Africa 's last absolute monarch , King Mswati III , a staunch traditionalist .
" If you divide a meal into smaller and smaller pieces to feed more people there comes a time when everyone goes hungry , " Samuel Dlamini , 25 , a farmer in the central Manzini region , 70 km east of the capital Mbabane , told IRIN .
" When we were children there were eight of us living off this small farm , " he said .
Dlamini is married with two children , but his three older brothers , their wives and children , and one of his two sisters all still live on the family homestead .
" Now there are 19 people .
When we took our wives our father gave each son part of the farm .
We must support our families on the parcel , but it 's not possible , " he said .
Sedentary living is a relatively new concept ; in earlier times a pastoralist lifestyle saw Swazis migrating to various seasonal grazing pastures , and it was not until the 1800s that maize , now the staple food , began to be cultivated .
The number of people has finally caught up with the land area available .
" There are no new places now for young people to go , " Dlamini said .
The growing scarcity of land is moving the goal of achieving food security further out of reach , and a drought in 2007 made nearly half the population dependent on donor feeding schemes .
We see that the farms are shrinking all the time ; we are seeing more and more land going over to housing .
We are seeing less cattle production , with less rangeland due to deterioration caused by overgrazing
" It 's true ; we 've noticed what Mr Dlamini is saying .
Even the people we give seeds to , they tell us their farms are one hectare or 1.5 hectares , and we ask , ' Is it worth it ? '
They can't feed themselves , " Olga Tsabedze , of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation 's Swaziland office , told IRIN .
The land under cultivation is also diminishing .
During the 2001/02 season , 71,000 hectares were cultivated with maize , in 2004/05 this dropped to 56,000 hectares , and in 2006 / 07 - the last year statistics for which were available - the amount of land under maize cultivation fell to 51,000 hectares .
"
We see that the farms are shrinking all the time ; we are seeing more and more land going over to housing .
We are seeing less cattle production , with less rangeland due to deterioration caused by overgrazing , " Bheki Bhembi , head of the research department at the Central Bank of Swaziland , told IRIN .
" People feed themselves more by growing maize than raising cattle .
With cattle it is more of stock - wealth issue [ wealth and status are measured by the number of cattle owned ] instead of food production , " Bhembi said .
A Swaziland Central Bank report noted that " Prospects for maize production , like all other dry - land agricultural produce , are not encouraging .
This bleak outlook is due to unpredictable and unreliable weather conditions .
Output will also be negatively affected by rising input costs , coupled with the inherent risks of dry - land production .
" Even with good rains , the shrinking size of farms as each new generation carves up the land into smaller slices heightens the threat to food sufficiency .
" Some of the agriculture ministry extension officers are encouraging small landholder farmers to pool their land and resources , " Tsabedze said .
Eric Simelane , a government agricultural extension officer , told IRIN : " It 's economy of scale - if the farmers can patch their fields together to the size they once were , then farming would be more efficient and yields would increase .

The supply crunch has helped push gold to an all - time high , reaching $ 1,118 an ounce at one stage yesterday .
The key driver over recent days has been the move by India 's central bank to soak up half of the gold being sold by the International Monetary Fund .
It is the latest sign that the rising powers of Asia and the commodity bloc are growing wary of Western paper money and debt .

If not for the two southern states , California students would be at the bottom of the national heap in mathematics , according to the 2009 Nation 's Report Card released Wednesday .
The abysmal standing , which reflects in part the state 's diverse population , has n't changed much over the years .
California consistently has ranked among the lowest - scoring states in the biennial National Assessment of Educational Progress , a federally mandated assessment of a sampling of fourth - and eighth - graders across the country .
On the plus side , state students have made steady progress over the years , generally keeping pace with their national counterparts - albeit from the back of the pack .
California 's fourth - graders outscored their peers in only the two southern states and the District of Columbia , and tied five states .
Eighth - graders outscored only Mississippi and the District of Columbia , and tied four states .
Overall , California students performed at or below the national average regardless of income or ethnicity .
" We have nothing to celebrate .
It is not a high ranking we are holding on to , " said Linda Murray , acting executive director for The Education Trust - West , an Oakland nonprofit focused on closing the achievement gap , in a statement .
" The 2009 NAEP results in math are more boulders thrown on top of a mountain of data that scream at us to pay attention . "
Achievement gauge
While math instruction varies state to state , the national test is a challenging , comprehensive and a consistent indicator of student achievement , said Stuart Kerachsky , acting commissioner for the National Center for Education Statistics , which released the results .
" You can't really escape the conclusion that low performance on NAEP means there is a problem in a state that should be addressed , " he said in a Wednesday teleconference .
The national standing poses a conundrum for California education officials , who noted that students ' scores improved in math on state tests over the last few years .
In addition , on California 's standardized tests , more than half the students test at grade level or above in math , while on the national assessment , less than one - third reach that goal .
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell supports a national effort to create common standards at each grade level so that all states teach the same thing at the same time and then test on that level .
Federal officials said California 's low standing can be explained in part by a disproportionate representation of students who historically post the lowest scores on the test - English learners , low - income students and Hispanic students .
That means on the national test more of those students are tested in California than elsewhere in the country .
For example , 30 percent of the state 's fourth - grade students tested were English learners compared with 10 percent nationwide .
4th - graders level off
Federal and state education officials said they are concerned that fourth - grade math scores in California and nationwideleveled off this year after nearly two decades of consistent improvement .
Nationally , eighth - grade scores increased to the highest levels since 1990 .
And both here and across the country , closing the achievement gap between white and Asian students and their black and Hispanic peers has been an uphill and sometimes losing battle .
" With a lack of progress at fourth grade and large achievement gaps that are relatively unchanged , we need to re-examine our efforts to improve student achievement in math , " said David P. Driscoll , chair of the National Assessment Governing Board , which sets policy for NAEP , in a statement .
The Nation 's Report Card , congressionally mandated since 1969 , evaluated 168,800 fourth - graders and 161,700 eighth - grade students in public and private schools across the country over six weeks from the end of January to the beginning of March .

Still , Octavio Paz , in his classic look at his country ’s psyche , “ The Labyrinth of Solitude , ” spent some time assessing Mexican curses .
“ The forbidden words boil up in us , just as our emotions boil up , ” he wrote .
“ When they finally burst out , they do so harshly , brutally , in the form of a shout , a challenge , an offense .
They are projectiles or knives .
They cause wounds . ”
Exactly what is considered a bad word in Mexico can require some interpretation .
There are various types of insults , some comparing people to animals , others referring to the diminished mental capacity of the recipient .
Others refer to sex , naturally , using that most Mexican of words , “ chingar , ” which the Royal Spanish Academy of Language says is a derivative of the word “ to fight ” but that in Mexico can be very offensive or very innocuous or virtually anything in between .
“ It is definitely personal , ” the survey said of Mexicans ’ propensity for cursing .
“ The same word applied in different contexts and in two different moments is seen in very different manners . ”
It is almost always obvious , of course , when a curse is meant as a curse .
A woman walking by a group of construction workers the other day left no doubt as to her message when the men whistled at her and she shouted out a response .
The electrical workers who were recently fired by President Felipe Calderón also clearly wanted the worst impression possible to be read into the protest signs they lofted .
One banner , a tame one , referred to Mr. Calderón as a “ pinche ladrón , ” which can be translated as a “ damn crook . ”
Pinche , though , can also be a word with no negative connotation at all , meaning a cook ’s assistant .
A taxi driver who was trying to navigate through the electrical workers ’ demonstration also used a string of sexually charged expletives when it became clear that his Volkswagen Beetle was going nowhere anytime soon .
It turns out , there is plenty to curse about in Mexico these days .
The economy is in the doldrums , with a decline of 8 percent , one of the worst contractions in the world , expected this year .
The politicians are up to their usual antics , and drug traffickers continue to rampage , competing with one another to see who can kill their opponents in the most gruesome fashion .
In 1948 , the Tucker sedan introduced a host of technical innovations to the automobile world , including disc brakes , seat belts , fuel injection , and a padded dashboard .
But it was n't enough to make Tucker into the next General Motors ; a host of technical and legal problems ensured that only a handful of cars would be built before the company collapsed .
In more recent decades , the tech industry has seen the rise of products and services that are similarly ahead of their time .
Some of them represent great ideas that could n't really be implemented well with contemporary technology ; others are brilliant plans that were n't turned into viable businesses by the first person or group to come up with them .
All of them flopped , but all of them also influenced the industry .
This list should serve as a warning to those who think that being the first to think of something will lead to any easy road to success .

I was talking to some detectives in the park near my home today and they pointed out that if the police catch you with a pile of poo that you have n’t cleaned up , it ’s actually cheaper to say that it ’s your shit , rather than your dog’s .
Turns out , the fine for unpicked up dog poo is $ 319 and the police can add on another $ 319 fine if you are caught without a proper poo picking up tool .
But if you , a human , shit on the ground the fine is only $ 79 .
You could risk an indecent exposure fine but I think they would have had to witness your “ exposure . ”
So next time you ’re caught with poo , tell them it ’s yours .
RAF fighter pilot Andy Green intends to get behind the wheel of a car that is capable of reaching 1,000 mph ( 1,610 km / h ) .
Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter - Typhoon jet engine , the Bloodhound car will mount an assault on the land speed record .
Wing Cmdr Green is writing a diary for the BBC News Website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team 's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering .
BLOODHOUND SCENTS SUCCESS
After months of waiting , lots of great things have come together all at once .
The final design of the car , the move into our new HQ , the confirmation of our run location and the new animation video - which is fantastic !
Rear view : Jet engine now sits on top of the rocket Last October , we had a concept that demonstrated that we could do 1,000 mph .
Thirteen months later , we 've now got the design that will do 1,000 mph - and we 're about to start building it .
The obvious change is that the EJ200 jet is now on top of the car and the rocket is underneath - which is a better mechanical solution for the jet intake , the rocket load cells and the fin ( now mounted directly on to the car 's chassis , rather than the rocket which needs changing between runs ) .
Better still , the previous violent pitch down from a high - mounted rocket has been replaced by a gentle increase in pressure on the rear wheels as the rocket fires - which makes the car more stable and easier to driver .
Gets my vote !
The new shape is now being " optimised " through something called a " parametric study " - basically , a whole series of part - models of the back end , to give us the very best aerodynamic shape for the rear of the car .
The Northern Cape Premier flew in to announce the backing With access to Intel 's super - computers ( they 've just signed as our IT partner ) , we 've now running some of the biggest computers in the UK and getting aero results in hours , rather than days .
I 'm typing this sitting the in old Maritime Heritage Centre , now known as the Bloodhound Technology Centre ( and unofficially as the " Dog House " ) on the Bristol waterfront .
It 's a very smart two - storey building , design office upstairs and a huge open space below .
Looking down at this empty workshop floor , I can already start to picture the world 's fastest car being assembled here over the next year - and - a - half .
I can't wait .
And when we 've finished building the car , where are we going to run it ?
The surprise answer is Hakskeen Pan , in the Northern Cape of South Africa - a desert that we have n't mentioned before .
The new technical centre , or " Dog House " Originally discounted because of a road running across it , we recently found out that the road has been closed and can be graded out - which will leave a flat , hard surface over 20 km ( 12 miles ) long and 5 km ( 3 miles ) wide - the perfect site for the world 's fastest race track .
Better still , the Northern Cape Government has agreed to prepare the track for us - and the Northern Cape Premier and her team flew over to the UK to make a joint announcement with us on this week - fantastic !
We 've found the perfect location in Hakskeen and the perfect partner in the Northern Cape Government .
We 've now got a home to build the car , a design that we can start building and a 1,000 mph track to run Bloodhound on .
I 'm still slightly in awe of the fact that this car is going to do 1,000 mph - really .
That 's faster than a jet fighter aircraft has ever been at ground level - as our new animation below shows .

" The question Artsutanov asked himself had the childlike brilliance of true genius .
A merely clever man could never have thought of it -- or would have dismissed it instantly as absurd .
If the laws of celestial mechanics make it possible for an object to stay fixed in the sky , might it not be possible to lower a cable down to the surface , and so to establish an elevator system linking earth to space ? " -- Arthur C. Clarke , 1979 , " The Fountains of Paradise "
( CNN ) --
It sounds like science fiction .
And it was .
Now , 30 years after " 2001 " author Arthur C. Clarke wrote about an elevator that rises into outer space , serious research is happening all over the world in an effort to make the far - fetched - sounding idea a reality .
The benefits of a fully realized elevator would make carrying people and goods into space cheaper , easier and safer than with rocket launches , proponents say , opening up a host of possibilities .
Restaurants and hotels for space tourists .
Wind turbines that provide energy by spinning 24 hours a day .
A cheaper , easier and more environmentally friendly way to launch rockets .
Scientists envision all of the above -- possibly within our lifetimes .
" Space elevator - related research is valid , but there are hurdles to overcome , " said David Smitherman , a space architect at NASA 's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center .
This week in the Mojave Desert , three teams of engineers are competing for $ 2 million offered up by NASA for anyone who can build a prototype of an elevator able to crawl up a kilometer - high tether while hauling a heavy payload .
" We have n't had any winners yet , but we truly do expect to have at least one winner , probably more [ this year ] , " said Ted Semon , spokesman for The Spaceward Foundation , which has run the competition for the past several years .
Most models for an elevator into space involve attaching a cable from a satellite , space station or other counterweight to a base on Earth 's surface .
Scientists say inertia would keep the cable tight enough to allow an elevator to climb it .
The inspiration for researchers to pursue a space elevator started , as many scientific advances have , in the fantastical world of science fiction .
In Clarke 's 1979 novel " The Fountains of Paradise , " he writes about a scientist battling technological , political and ethical difficulties involved in creating a space elevator .
In the years that followed , Clarke , who died last year , remained an outspoken advocate for researching and funding the elevator .
Others are now carrying the torch .
" Space elevator research is important because it is a way to build a bridge to space instead of ferrying everything by rocket , " said Smitherman , who has conducted research and published findings on the effort .
" Look at the cost and efficiency of a bridge versus a ferry on Earth and then look at the cost and inefficiency of the rocket ferries we use today and you will see why so many people are looking for a ' bridge ' solution like the space elevator . "
Microsoft is among the sponsors an annual space elevator conference , and teams in Japan and Russia are among those working to turn the theory into reality -- even if they all admit they have a long way to go .
Even the most avid proponents of the research admit there are big hurdles that need to be overcome .
The first , scientists say , is that there 's currently not a viable material strong enough to make the cables that will support heavy loads of passengers or cargo into orbit .
According to NASA research , the space elevator cable would need to be about 22,000 miles long .
That 's how far away a satellite must be to maintain orbit above a fixed spot on the Earth 's equator .
" Right now , if you use the strongest material in the world , the weight of the tether would be so much that it would actually snap , " said Semon , a retired software engineer .
He said the super - light material would probably need to be about 25 times stronger than what 's now commercially available .
In a separate competition , his group offers a prize to any team that can build a tether that 's at least twice as strong as what 's currently on the market .
Another issue , scientists say , is how to keep the cable , or the elevator itself , from getting clobbered by meteorites or space junk floating around in space .
Some suggest a massive cleanup of Earth 's near orbit would be required .
And then there 's the cost .
Estimates are as high as $ 20 billion for a working system that would stretch into orbit .
Many think it would be private enterprise , not a government , that would spring for the earliest versions of the elevator .
Professor Brendan Quine and his team at York University in Toronto , Canada , think they have the answers to at least some of those problems .
They 've built a three - story high prototype of an elevator tower that would rise roughly 13 miles ( 20 kilometers ) -- high enough to escape most of the earth 's atmosphere .
" At 20 kilometers , you still have gravity ; you 're not in orbit , " Quine said .
" But for a tourist , you can see basically the same things an astronaut sees -- the blackness of space , the horizon of the Earth . "
In the stratosphere , the tower also could potentially be used to launch rockets , he said .
The most expensive and energy - sucking part of any space launch now is blasting from the ground out of the atmosphere .
Constructed from Kevlar , the free - standing structure would use pneumatically inflated sections pressurized with a lightweight gas , such as hydrogen or helium , to actively stabilize itself and allow for flexibility .
A series of platforms or pods , supported by the elevator , would be used to launch payloads into Earth 's orbit .
Quine acknowledged that the prototype is just a first step toward realizing the elevator and that several more prototypes are needed to fine - tune details .
He estimated that the cost of the basic tower would be about $ 2 billion -- the equivalent of a massive skyscraper in places like New York -- and that the technology to build it could be ready in less than 10 years .
He said a more advanced -- and expensive -- elevator tower could be built to go higher into the stratosphere .
But for the purposes of actually ferrying everyday people into space , 20 kilometers makes the most sense , Quine said .
" The tower might be economically viable if you 're able to transport 1,000 people a day to the to of it for about $ 1,000 a ticket , " he said .
" At the top , you 'd probably want amenities -- hotels , restaurants .
It could be a very pleasant experience , in contrast to zero gravity , which makes many people sick . "
For now , advocates of making the elevator a reality say they 'll keep at it .
They 'll continue reminding themselves that they would n't be the first to turn what started as an outlandish idea into good science .
" Every revolutionary idea seems to evoke three stages of reaction , " Clarke once said .
" They may be summed up by the phrases : One , it 's completely impossible .
Two , it 's possible , but it 's not worth doing .
Three , I said it was a good idea all along . "

I ’m not Foundation management , just an editor and volunteer who answers customer
e-mail , but my understanding is that while Foundation staff are probably aware of
this and other controversies , they leave their resolution to the community of
editors and its procedures .

What you refer to as a “ hijacking of process ” is , as far as I can tell , an
entirely normal ( for me ) series of disagreements about article content .
Thousands
of such disagreements occur every day on Wikipedia , and they are normally resolved
through our discussion - based dispute resolution process , as explained at
.
This process may ultimately lead to
an Arbitration Committee investigation .

Wikipedia ’s content is not centrally edited .
Anybody may make any change to
Wikipedia , including undoing an edit by Mr. Connolley .
But that change may be
undone in turn if others disagree , and any dispute has to be resolved through
discussion until a consensus is found .

Administrators are elected by the Wikipedia community , and require a supermajority
of about 70 % for election .
The community prefers to elect administrators who
display no bias in any respect , but are committed to upholding Wikipedia ’s
principle of “ neutral point of view ” ( ) .

Should the community conclude that its processes were indeed subverted by anybody
( and I am not aware of any such consensus emerging currently ) , it may decide to
change its policies , as explained at

SINGAPORE  President Obama and other world leaders have decided to put off the difficult task of reaching a climate change agreement at a global climate conference scheduled for next month , agreeing instead to make it the mission of the Copenhagen conference to reach a less specific “ politically binding ” agreement that would punt the most difficult issues into the future .
At a hastily arranged breakfast on the sidelines of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting on Sunday morning , the leaders , including Lars Lokke Rasmussen , the prime minister of Denmark and the chairman of the climate conference , agreed that in order to salvage Copenhagen they would have to push a fully binding legal agreement down the road , possibly to a second summit meeting in Mexico City later on .
“ There was an assessment by the leaders that it is unrealistic to expect a full internationally , legally binding agreement could be negotiated between now and Copenhagen , which starts in 22 days , ” said Michael Froman , the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs .
“ I do n’t think the negotiations have proceeded in such a way that any of the leaders thought it was likely that we were going to achieve a final agreement in Copenhagen , and yet thought that it was important that Copenhagen be an important step forward , including with operational impact . ”
With the clock running out and deep differences unresolved , it has , for several months , appeared increasingly unlikely that the climate change negotiations in Denmark would produce a comprehensive and binding new treaty on global warming , as its organizers had intended .

Good , because Mr. Greek35T over at AllDroid has a stable version of the ( previously rough - around - the - edges ) Android 2.1 ROM ready for all you Droid users to play around with .
It 's officially " super fast , " and probably the best thing to happen this weekend outside of that wicked jump you built on the neighborhood sledding hill before you went and watched Avatar with all your old high school friends .
Hit up the source link for the full install instructions , and there 's a video of 2.1 in action after the break .

This one came down as a bomb to many game lovers out there , Gameloft , the French mobile phone games company , is cutting their investment in Android platform .
According to Gameloft , not just them , but other software developers are cutting back because of the weakness of the Android Market .
All of us know that compared to the Apple App Store , not just the Android Market , but any other app store from any other platform is smaller .
But according to Alexandre de Rochefort , Gameloft ’s finance director ;
We have significantly cut our investment in Android platform , just like … many others .
It ( Android Market ) is not as neatly done as on the iPhone .
Google has not been very good to entice customers to actually buy products .
On Android nobody is making significant revenue .
We are selling 400 times more games on iPhone than on Android .
With all the attention in the mobile industry that Android has got lately , specially with the release of the Motorola DROID by Verizon , and Sony Ericsson bringing an Android based phone of their own .
This , you would think , should not be happening .
Anyway , comparing games on iPhone to Android as a base line does n’t look right ( or fair ) .
Android is growing , and will get to the point where those who are living will reconsider and come back , at least , that is my personal opinion .
And I ’m not an Android owner !
So , what do you think ?
Let us know in the comments .

Hector is a Literate Haskell implementation of Weizenbaum 's ELIZA program .
ELIZA is more or less the original “ chatterbot ” .
Implemented by Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s to demonstrate how seemingly “ intelligent ” behaviour could be mimicked by very simple pattern - matching , it shocked even him with how much ordinary people were taken in by the illusion .
It is probably best known in conjunction with its DOCTOR script , which allows it to act like a Rogerian psychotherapist ( a version of this can be invoked in the Emacs text editor with “ M-x doctor ” ) .
One user was reportedly so affected by the program that he requested that Weizenbaum give him some privacy to discuss his issues with the doctor !
The program works by simple pattern matching .
The user 's input is checked against a list of pre-defined patterns , and if there 's a match , a corresponding output is returned .
Eliza also has some facilities for extracting content from the input and using it in the reply ( e.g. “ I need a vacation ” might result in “ How would you feel if you got a vacation ? ” ) .
The final bit of finesse is a rudimentary memory , so that it can bring up past topics again if it does n't know what to say ( Hector does not do this ) .
Hector is a Haskell reimplementation of a very similar system .
It is written in a “ literate ” style , and should be simple to follow along with .
Hector is not a doctor like Eliza — instead , he 's more of a grizzled old programming veteran , having got his start feeding punchcards into a mainframe in his undergraduate years .
He can't help you with relationships or inferiority complexes , but he 'll be happy to discuss your programming problems with you .

Well , I do n't know what to say , then .
I am by no means knowledgeable about Haskell : this program is just the best efforts of a beginner , and I 'd be very happy to hear feedback on how to make it more idiomatic or expressive .
In particular , the PRNG seed passing strikes me as a kludge , and I suspect there 's a nicer way to handle the IO aspects , for example with interact and lines .
The code below covers the interesting parts of the program , but the actual input / response pairs have been left out for conciseness ( and because they 're largely boring ) .
You can also view the full source .
A short list of references about Haskell and AI history / programming can be found at the end of the post .
More can be found by looking at the “ related items ” on the linked - to pages .
The Code
We 're going to use regular expressions for our pattern matching , and select responses randomly from the set of available responses to that input , so we 'll need some imports .
import Data .
List import System .
Random import Text .
Regex
The main loop of the program is quite simple : we just keep prompting the user for input and outputting a response until we get an EOF .
Before we enter this loop , we 'll just print a short greeting .
Each iteration of the loop we 'll take advantage of the system random number generator to create a new generator for use in picking our output .
main :: IO ( ) main = do putStrLn " Hello there .
What 's the matter ? " mainloop mainloop :: IO ( ) mainloop = do input <- getLine seed <- randomIO putStrLn $ respond input ( mkStdGen seed ) mainloop
The format we 'll use for our canned input / response pairs is simple .
Each possible input is a regular expression , originally entered as a string .
Before use , we 'll do some gentle massaging to get it into the Regex type our libraries want .
Every input / response pair actually consists of many different inputs and responses : any input in the pair can cause any of the responses to be output .
In other words , if any of the inputs in a pair match , one of the outputs in the pair will be returned .
type RawIRPair = ( [ String ] , [ String ] ) type IRPair = ( [ Regex ] , [ String ] )
Our actual input / response pairs are defined at the end of the program , since they 're very bulky and largely uninteresting .
They 're grouped into categories , so we 'll need to put all of them together into one big list .
combinedResponses :: [ RawIRPair ] combinedResponses = foldl ' ( ++ ) [ ] [ general , tech , nonSequitur ]
While we 're at it , let 's convert our input strings into Regexes — this is the final form that we 'll actually use .
Note that we 're making the regular expressions case - insensitive .
responses :: [ IRPair ] responses = regexify combinedResponses where regexify :: [ RawIRPair ] -> [ IRPair ] regexify [ ] = [ ] regexify ( x:xs ) = [ ( map ( \i -> mkRegexWithOpts i True False ) ( fst x ) , snd x ) ] ++ regexify xs
Here 's where the meat of the program happens : the process of selecting a response .
Essentially , we just find the list of responses that match our input , and pick one at random .
respond :: RandomGen g => String -> g ->
String respond input randGen = pickResponse ( findMatchingResponses input ) randGen
The process of picking the response at random is also straightforward .
Once it 's chosen at random , we run it through a function that substitutes any captured subgroups in place of patterns of the form !0 , !1 , etc .
pickResponse :: RandomGen g => ( [ String ] , [ String ] ) -> g ->
String pickResponse ( responses , substrings ) randGen = fill
In ( responses !! chosen ) substrings where chosen = ( fst $ randomR ( 0 , length responses - 1 ) randGen :: Int ) fillIn :: String -> [ String ] ->
String fill
In response substrings = fillInCount response substrings 0 fillInCount :: String -> [ String ] -> Int ->
String fillInCount response ( x:xs ) n = fillInCount ( subRegex ( mkRegex ( " ! " ++ show n ) ) response x ) xs ( n+1 ) fillInCount response [ ] _ = response
Finding the list of matching responses , however , is a little trickier , largely due to the deep nesting that we need to flatten out before we get a chance to actually try to match our regular expressions .
Along with the list of matching potential responses , we return the list of matching substrings ( if any ) .
findMatchingResponses :: String -> ( [ String ] , [ String ] ) findMatchingResponses input = checkListOfTuples input responses where checkListOfTuples input ( x:xs ) = case ( checkTuple input x ) of ( [ ] , [ ] ) -> checkListOfTuples input xs ( responses , substrings ) -> ( responses , substrings ) checkTuple :: String -> IRPair -> ( [ String ] , [ String ] ) checkTuple input ( i:is , r ) = case ( matchRegex i input ) of Just a -> ( r , a ) Nothing -> checkTuple input ( is , r ) checkTuple _ _ = ( [ ] , [ ] )
Finally , we need to give Hector something to say .
We do this by creating the list of input / response pairs references in our list - flattening function above .
I 've left this out of the post because it 's largely uninteresting , but it looks something like this :
general :: [ RawIRPair ] general = [ ( [ " hello " ] , [ " Hi . What 's going on ? " , " Yes , hi .
Tell me your problem . " ] ) , ( [ " I need ( [ a - zA - Z ] * ) " , " I want ( [ a - zA - Z ] * ) " ] , [ " Well , do you think it 's at all possible to get !0 ? " , " What would change if you got !0 ? " ] ) ]

There are a few niceties that Hector does n't implement , that can be considered the infamous “ exercises left to the reader ” .
These include : memory of already - used phrases , memory of previous topics , a much more extensive and useful set of input / response pairs , and actual sentience and intelligence .
ELIZA implements the first three .
THE war of words between atheists and religious believers has entered a new chapter with the launch of Northern Ireland ’s first ever humanist advertising campaign .
The British Humanist Association ( BHA ) yesterday unveiled a billboard with the slogan :
Please Do n’t Label Me. Let Me Grow Up And Choose For Myself .
Located on one Belfast ’s busiest routes , the poster is a follow - up to its atheist buses campaign that ran earlier this year in parts of the UK .
The giant poster , at the junction of Great Victoria Street and Bruce Street , shows a photograph of a young girl against the backdrop of “ shadowy ” descriptions such as Catholic , Protestant , Muslim , Hindu or Sikh .
Organisers said the descriptions were mixed in with other labels that people would “ never apply ” to young children like Marxist , anarchist , socialist , libertarian or humanist .
They argue that children should be given the freedom to decide for themselves which , if any , ideology they follow .
According to this report , religious leaders across Northern Ireland are furious , and have hit out at the BHA , accusing it of arrogance and hypocrisy .
Reverend David McIlveen from the Free Presbyterian Church ranted :
It is none of their business how people bring up their children .
It is the height of arrogance that the BHA would even assume to tell people not to instruct their children in their religion .
I would totally reject the advertisement .
It is reprehensible and so typical of the hypocrisy of the British Humanist Association today .
They have a defeatist attitude and are just trying to draw attention to themselves .
I think it is totally arrogant , presumptuous and sparks of total hypocrisy .
I believe this does n’t deserve a counter campaign .
I will be expressing my public position on it in my own church on Sunday .
I will be saying that this advert is another attack on the Biblical position of the family and will be totally rejecting it .
Phew !
And he grumpily added for good measure :
It is a wasted campaign that will have no impact on family life in Northern Ireland .
Father - of - four Sheikh Anwar Mady from the Belfast Islamic Centre added this depressing tosh to the pot :
We believe that every child is born as a Muslim .
Religion is not given by the family , but it is a natural religion given by our God at birth .
The role of the family is to teach the traditions of the faith .
But that faith is implanted at birth .
The BHA said the billboards were being unveiled to coincide with Universal Children ’s Day on Friday .
Atheist campaigner Richard Dawkins , BHA vice president , added :
Nobody would seriously describe a tiny child as a â€ ˜Marxist child ’ , an â€˜anarchist child ’ or a â€˜post - modernist child ’ .
Yet children are routinely labelled with the religion of their parents .
We need to encourage people to think carefully before labelling any child too young to know their own opinions and our adverts will help to do that .
Dean of Belfast Dr Houston McElvey said the humanist poster would have little impact on Christian believers .
I am glad to live in a society where people have the right to express their point of view on a God in which I believe does n’t need defending .
But Fr Gary Donegan , from Holy Cross in north Belfast , said he hoped the campaign would open up debate on religious issues .
Cute game

However , the system could soon be expanded if the US and others follow Europe with a cap - and - trade scheme , turning the current $ 90bn ( £ 54 bn ) market into a $ 3.1 trillion one over the next decade .
The idea has met with the support of a large number of major energy companies , such as BP and Shell .
But Friends of the Earth wants carbon trading to be replaced by direct taxation and regulation of emissions production , arguing that the current system only enriches traders and does not drive carbon reductions .
If love is said to come from the heart , what about hate ?
Along with music , religion , irony and a host of other complex concepts , researchers are on the hunt for the neurological underpinnings of hatred .
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has begun to reveal how the strong emotion starts to emerge in the brain .
Neurobiologist Semir Zeki , of University College London 's Laboratory of Neurobiology , led a study last year that scanned the brains of 17 adults as they gazed at images of a person they professed to hate .
Across the board , areas in the medial frontal gyrus , right putamen , premotor cortex and medial insula activated .
Parts of this so - called " hate circuit , " the researchers noted , are also involved in initiating aggressive behavior , but feelings of aggression itself — as well as anger , danger and fear — show different patterns in the brain than hatred does .
Certainly loathing can spring from positive feelings , such as romantic love ( in the guise of a former partner or perceived rival ) .
But love seems to deactivate areas traditionally associated with judgment , whereas hatred activates areas in the frontal cortex that may be involved in evaluating another person and predicting their behavior .
Some commonalities with love , however , are striking , the study authors note .
The areas of the putamen and insula that are activated by individual hate are the same as those for romantic love .
" This linkage may account for why love and hate are so closely linked to each other in life , " they wrote in the October 2008 PLoS ONE .
This initial study , however , does not have everyone convinced that researchers have uncovered the neurological root of hatred .
" This is really early in the game , " says Scott Huettel , an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who was not involved in the study .
Other emotions , such as happiness and sadness , are much better understood , he says : " Even things like regret have some pretty clear neural coordinates . "
The next step , Huettel points out , will be to conduct more research on clearly defined aspects and types of hatred — including group hate rather than that aimed at individuals — then test them across several different situations .
It will also be important , he notes , to look for cases in which parts of the brain have been impaired and emotional tendencies have changed .
" Once you show the positive activation and impairment when the brain region is damaged you have good evidence that you have at least part of the circuit , " he says .
What purpose the emotion of hate serves is also still up for conjecture .
Although some argue that the feeling has an evolutionary advantage — it might help an individual decide whom to confront or scorn —
Huettel notes that , like pinpointing a dedicated neural circuit , it is all just " educated guesses at this point . "
Do n't you just hate that ?
Dr Donal Murray has resigned as Bishop of Limerick An Irish bishop has resigned , weeks after his handling of child sex abuse allegations was severely criticised .
A report on abuse by priests in the Dublin Archdiocese found Donal Murray 's handling of one case while an auxiliary bishop in the 1980s was " inexcusable " .
The Vatican said the Pope had accepted his resignation as bishop of Limerick .
Dr Murray said : " I know full well my resignation cannot undo the pain that survivors of abuse have suffered in the past and continue to suffer each day . "
The Murphy report into abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese from 1975 to 2004 was highly critical of the Catholic church hierarchy 's handling of priests suspected of being child abusers .
To all survivors of abuse , I repeat that my primary concern is to assist in every way that I can on their journey towards finding closure and serenity
Dr Donal Murray
Q&A : Bishop 's resignation
The report said many bishops were more concerned with preserving the reputation of the church rather than protecting children .
It found that during Dr Murray 's time as an auxiliary bishop in Dublin from 1982 to 1996 , he was dismissive of complaints about a priest who went on to abuse again .
Dr Murray said on Thursday he had taken time to study the report in full before deciding to resign .
" I humbly apologise once again to all who were abused as little children , " he said .
" To all survivors of abuse , I repeat that my primary concern is to assist in every way that I can on their journey towards finding closure and serenity .
" I asked the Holy Father to allow me to resign and to appoint a new bishop to the diocese because I believe that my presence will create difficulties for some of the survivors who must have first place in our thoughts and prayers . "
Dr Murray held talks about his future with the Pope in the Vatican last week .
He said Pope Benedict had accepted his resignation on Monday but agreed that Dr Murray should return to Limerick to allow him to be in his diocese when the announcement was made .
' Inexcusable '
The Murphy report said Bishop Murray did not deal properly with the suspicions and concerns that were expressed to him in relation to one priest , Fr Tom Naughton in 1983 .
A short time later , factual evidence of Naughton 's abusing emerged in another parish .
The Murphy report found Bishop Murray 's failure to reinvestigate the earlier suspicions was " inexcusable " .
In May 1998 , Naughton pleaded guilty to six counts of indecently assaulting three boys in 1985 and 1986 .
He was jailed for three years , reduced on appeal to two - and - a - half years .
On Wednesday , Naughton was jailed again - this time for three years for sexually abusing an altar boy between 1982 and 1984 .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) -
The payout offer of the Roman Catholic group at the center of an inquiry into child abuse in Ireland drew harsh criticism on Wednesday from a survivors group .
The Roman Catholic order of Christian Brothers , once the largest provider of residential care for boys in Ireland , said it offered a package of 161 million euros ( $ 240 million ) in compensation .
But the Irish Survivors of Child Abuse group ( SOCA ) said only 34 million euros of the offer was “ new money . ”
Disclosures in May of floggings , slave labor and gang rape in much of Ireland ’s now defunct system of industrial and reform schools have shamed Irish people and put pressure on religious orders who ran the institutions to pay more for past abuses .
A string of scandals involving priests molesting young boys have eroded the Catholic Church ’s moral authority in Ireland , once one of the most devout countries in the world .
The Christian Brothers said it would pay 30 million euros into a government trust , 4 million for counseling and transfer school playing fields worth 127 million to a government trust .
“ The range of incremental measures outlined above follow the Christian Brothers ’ acceptance , shame and sorrow at the findings of the Ryan Report , ” the order said in a statement , referring to the inquiry covering the period between the 1930s and 1970s chaired by High Court Justice Sean Ryan .
The order said the offer would bring its total contributions since 1996 to 191 million euros .
But SOCA said : “ This morning ’s statement from the Christian Brothers is an exercise in the art of sophistry by its supreme practitioners in Ireland . ”
It added : “ The references to playing fields to be held in joint trust with the State has nothing whatever to do with redressing the victims of Christian Brother abuse in Irish institutions . ”
Two other groups -- the Sisters of Charity and Daughters of Charity -- later said they had pledged to contribute 5 million euros and 10 million euros respectively for the benefit of former residents of religious - run institutions .
The moves came as Ireland awaits the publication of a separate report on the handling of allegations of child sex abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin from 1975 to 2004 , which Prime Minister Brian Cowen said would be published on Thursday .
“ In these days we will be reading of sordid events that took place within the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of Dublin , ” Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said at a ceremony last week .
10 Usability Crimes You Really Should n’t Commit
Over time certain conventions and best practices have been developed to help improve the general usability of websites during their design and build .
This roundup of ten usability crimes highlights some of the most common mistakes or overlooked areas in web design and provides an alternative solution to help enhance the usability of your website .
Crime 1 : Form labels that are n’t associated to form input fields
Using the ‘ for ’ attribute allows the user to click the label to select the appropriate input fields within a form .
This is especially important for checkboxes and radio fields to give a larger clickable area , but it ’s good practice all round .
Crime 2 : A logo that does n’t link to the homepage
Linking the logo of a website to the homepage has become common practice and is now second nature for ( most ) web surfers to expect the logo to head back home .
It ’s also worth mentioning the logo should appear in the top left .
Crime 3 : Not specifying a visited link state
Visited link states do exactly as they say on the tin .
It ’s not the most advanced CSS selector , but it ’s one that is often overlooked .
Give users a visual clue as to which link has already been clicked .
Crime 4 : Not indicating an active form field
You can use the ‘: focus ’ selector on lots of elements , but it ’s super handy when used on inputs and textareas to indicate that the field is active .
Add CSS styling such as a highlighted border , or a subtle change to the background color .
Crime 5 : An image without an alt description
This is straying a little into the realm of accessibility , but it ’s still an important consideration !
Remember to always add a descriptive alt attribute to your images , unless of course they are used for decorative purposes , then the ALT attribute can be left empty ( but should still exist ! ) .
When using an image as a link , enter a description of where the link goes .
Crime 6 : A background image without a background color
It ’s common to use background images behind passages of text , but it ’s worth remembering that if background images are disabled by the user , there needs to be a similar tone in the form of a background colour to avoid the text becoming unreadable .
Crime 7 : Using long boring passages of content
There ’s nothing more off - putting than landing on a webpage that ’s laid out as a continuous passage of text .
Break up your content with images , headings and clear sections to make it easier to scan , read and digest .
Crime 8 : Underlining stuff that is n’t a link
Everyone knows that text that ’s underlined , or is a different colour is likely to be a link .
Do n’t go confusing people by throwing in underlined text elsewhere !
To draw attention to a certain word , try using the strong or emphasize tags instead .
Crime 9 : Telling people to click here
The words click here have been around since the dawn of the Internet , but have been shunned aside in favour of more usable options .
Using the words click here requires the user to read the whole sentence to find out what ’s going to happen .
Instead , describe what ’s going to happen in the actual anchor link text .
Crime 10 : Using justified text
This is another tip that ’s heading a little deeper into accessibility but is also an important point to consider .
Justified text might look at neat and square to the eye , but it can generate some real readability problems , particularly for Dyslexic users who can find it troublesome to identify words due to the uneven spacing of justified paragraphs .
It 's not certain , but I 'll be damned if it is n't the best idea I 've heard in a while : Barnes & Noble 's rapidly - approaching eReader will be an Android piece , according to our source .
And it really should be , according to me .

The leak came from someone who ( quite convincingly ! ) claims to work for B &N developing mobile apps — his background knowledge of their app projects was startlingly deep , at any rate — and makes quite a bit of sense as an alternative to the brutally dumb software of current ebook readers .

Think about it .
At six inches , it 's a smallish device , and we 've seen Android on similarly - sized screens already .
Wireless connectivity is built into the OS .
Extraneous , inappropriate software and settings could be easily stripped out and replaced with relevant ones .
A custom - designed interface could be easily dropped in .
Apps — oh , sweet apps — could be a huge boon .
And hey , E - Ink Android drivers have already been demonstrated on video .
Not to mention the fact that B&N has conveniently skirted releasing an Android app , despite putting quite a bit of effort into iPhone and BlackBerry versions of the mobile ebook sofrware .

Simply put , this would be pretty fantastic , and it 's eminently plausible .
And from the looks of it , we wo n't have to wait long to find out .
How do you pronounce the name of Mexico
How do you pronounce the name of Mexico
When the Spaniards came to Mexico they encountered sounds that could not represented in Castillian language or what we call the Spanish language .
However , there existed in Spain languages other than Castillian such as Basque , Catalan , Aranese , and finally Galician .
It is the Galician language which has the ' X ' sound needed to pronounce Mexico correctly in the native language .
In Galician and as in Portuguese the X letter has the sound of sh as in shoe .
Mexico pronounced correctly in the native language of Mexico the Nahuatl language would sound just like it is pronounced by Portuguese or Galician .
In English is would be Meshico .
Unfortunately for most of the Mexicans that speak only Spanish they cannot prounouce the name of their own country correctly .
Instead , they substitute as in English a H sound which is pronounced Mehico or in Spanish Mejico since in Spanish the j sounds like the english h .
The above is a contribution by Mario .
Now then , native Spanish speakers have a difficult time pronouncing " sh " ( and are often derided for this in the US ) , whether in an English or a Mexica word .
The consequence of this is that in most cases where convention dictated that " X " meant " sh " this pronunciation has been replaced by the easier " ch " or even simply an " s " ( owing to the fact that some friars chose to represent " sh " with a " c circumscript " or the z of their time ( the Spaniards of that time were still working out how to distinguish the similar S and Z sounds in script ) , so that one often sees the Mexica " flower " spelled variously as " xo'chitl " and " zu'chil " ) .
In practice , native Spanish speakers pronounce Xochimilco as so - chee - meel - koh .
Another example of a case where " sh " has been replaced by " s " is Tlaxcala ( originally Tlaxcallan , pronounced : Tlash - Kall - ahn , meaning " residence ( or , place ) of bread ) , which all Spanish speaking Mexicans now pronounce as Tlass - kall - ah .
But , this has not occurred universally .
For instance , Chignahuapan is a case where " sh " was replaced by " ch , " and in a few instances the " sh " has been preserved .
My favorite example of this is the small community of Xonaca , nearby Puebla ( actually , swallowed up by Puebla now ) , where the name is still pronounced as " shoh - nah - kah " ( from the original Xonácatl = onion , which means literally : " meaty leg " ; ) .
By the way , this town 's name is a good shibboleth for people of the area ; natives will say " shonakah , " whereas if you call it " chonaka " or " sonaka " or " ksonaka " you 've given yourself away as not being from the vicinity of the city of Puebla .
An example where " x " became " j " ( aside from two to be discussed below ) is the city of Jalapa in Veracruz .
Natives of the region write it as Xalapa , and as you can guess , the original was Shah - llah - pahn ( sand upon the waters ) .
By the way , this is where the jalapeño chilli ( another Mexica word ) pepper gets its name .
Por otro lado , un caso muy típico de que la " x " no se pronuncia como 'j ' en España es el de la palabra Mexico ; en la mayoría de los libros y periódicos Españoles que he visto , Mexico se sigue escribiendo como " Mejico " , y en los casos en que los españoles lo ven escrito como " Mexico " entonces lo pronuncian " Mecsico " .
1. Pronounce " toy " several times slowly and notice how you pronounce the " t " sound .
You 'll find that you place your tongue on your upper palate , right behind your teeth , force air from behind your tongue creating tension , then release the tension by letting your tongue down from your palate .
" T " is pronounced in this way in all Indo - European languages , it is a minor explosion .
2 . You might have to practice the following a bit , but now place your tongue on your upper palate , behind your teeth , as you would normally when about to pronounce a " t " .
Now , expel the air from behind your tongue WITHOUT releasing your tongue .
You 'll note that the air must escape somehow , and that it will do so out the sides into your cheeks .
You 've just pronounced a Mexica " t " .
The closest the friars could come to writing this sound was to use a " t " followed by an " l " , and as you can see this sound is composed of two separate sounds , and is quite different from the single sound you 've now learned to pronounce .
So , we have the simplified " Mexico " evolving from the fact that the original Meshtleeko was truly difficult for native Spanish speakers to render .
In a very few generations from the conquest , the original " sh " sound that the " x " symbolized was replaced by the more common interpretation of " x " , the " j " .
This occurred because native Mexica speakers nearly disappeared from the central valley of Mexico in the first few decades post - conquest and those few remaining were not influential in any possible sense , and those Spaniards across the oceans who administered their new possessions on the basis of written reports issuing from these did not have the guidance of native speakers of Mesoamerican languages to properly interpret the " latinized " versions of native words .
Because of this , Spaniards soon began writing the name of the country as it was pronounced : " Méjico . "
Mexicans themselves ( by and large ) have continued to employ the " Mexico " version .
Even though both pronunciations are as far from the original Mexica word , the usual reason advanced for this is that this word and its present spelling connect Mexico with its historical past , the word is , if you will , a verbal artifact that is living proof of our tortuous past in the same sense that a fossil bone tells its own story .
You might be interested in how the Spaniards today view this whole issue ( from a document of the Royal Spanish Academy ) :
Mexico .
En esta palabra la x se pronuncia como la j : Méjico .
Mexico es la deletreación que los Mexicanos han querido darle al nombre de su país , y el que a su pedido se ha esparcido en el uso de todo el resto de los países Hispano - Americanos .
Es un arcaicismo ortográfico que no tiene justificación , ya que hoy en nuestra lengua todos los sonidos de j se significan con una sola letra , la j ( también con la g , si ésta sigue a la e , o e i ) .
Tiene además la desventaja de que la gente que no conoce el secreto de la x pronuncia mal a la palabra como méksico .
Unamuno define esta singularidad ortográfica como " una ansia por distinción e independencia , " " un afán envidioso por la diferenciación . "
Sin duda alguna , la mejor recomendación es la de escribir Méjico y la de extender la j a todas las de mas derivaciones de esta palabra ...
" Mexico is a land of controversy , and a land of extremes .
Everything is under contention there .
Any claim to knowledge about the place is subject to dispute .
Even the spelling of the country 's name is a matter of controversy .
Indeed , the conflict over Mexico 's name presents a crude model of what Mexico is , and how it works . "

How do you view yourself ?
( Image : Blizzard Entertainment )
As players who stay up all night fighting imaginary warriors demonstrate , slipping into the skin of an avatar , and inhabiting a virtual world can be riveting stuff .
But to what extent does your brain regard your virtual self as you ?
Brain scans of avid players of the hugely popular online fantasy world World of Warcraft reveal that areas of the brain involved in self - reflection and judgement seem to behave similarly when someone is thinking about their virtual self as when they think about their real one .
Disentangling how the brain regards avatars versus real individuals may help explain why some people spend large chunks of their life playing immersive online games , says Kristina Caudle , a social neuroscientist at Dartmouth University in Hanover , New Hampshire , who led the study along with her adviser William Kelley .
Advertisement
“ It ’s hard to imagine from an outsider ’s perspective what might drive someone to spend 30 hours a week immersed in a completely imaginary world , ” she says .
More than 11 million people play World of Warcraft each month .
Innocent or intelligent
Previously , researchers have observed that people easily adopt the persona of their virtual selves , for instance , by acting more aggressively when their avatars are tall than when they are short , irrespective of an individual ’s height in the real world .
To probe what brain activity might underlie people ’s virtual behaviour , Caudle ’s team convinced 15 World of Warcraft players in their twenties – 14 men and 1 woman – who play the game an average of 23 hours a week , to drag themselves away from their computers and spend some time having their brains scanned using functional MRI .
While in the scanner , Caudle asked them to rate how well various adjectives such as innocent , competent , jealous and intelligent described themselves , their avatars , their best friend in the real world and their World of Warcraft guild leader .
Self - reflection
When Caudle ’s looked for brain areas that were more active when volunteers thought about themselves and their avatars compared with real and virtual others , two regions stood out : the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex .
That makes sense as prior research has linked the medial prefrontal cortex to self - reflection and judgement .
Interestingly , however , there was “ next to no difference ” in the activity in these regions when people thought of themselves and of their avatar , says Caudle , who presented the results at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience .
Caudle ’s team also noticed key differences between how people thought about the virtual and real worlds , which must be a necessity for preserving your sense of reality .
“ Clearly you do n’t think of your virtual self as your real self , ” she says .
They found activity differed in a region called the precuneus , implicated in imagination .
“ It makes good sense to me if you ’re thinking about things in a virtual world you might get [ activation in ] these areas , ” says Caudle .
Better selves
In the future , Caudle hopes to study volunteers who spend less time playing World of Warcraft to see if there are differences in how their brains discriminate between real and virtual worlds .
It could be that people whose brain activity is more similar when thinking of themselves and their avatars are likelier to end up hooked , she says .
Liane Young , a social neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge is interested in what brain activity can tell us about our relationships to our virtual characters .
“ You have this control over your avatar such that you ’ve created this better version of yourself .
I wonder whether these neural processes support reasoning about our better selves in some kind of wishful thinking sense . ”
A . Ten years ago , we approached patient safety as a series of system flaws ; we believed that most errors were committed by good competent people doing something no more complicated than forgetting a cellphone .
But in the last few years some of us in the patient safety field have begun to feel uneasy about that approach .
When there are reasonably safe standards available , what do you do when people simply do n’t adhere to them ?
At some point , it ’s no longer a “ systems problem . ”
Q . In one of your articles , you use the example of hand hygiene to illustrate your point .
A . Hand hygiene seemed like a good place to start studying how we might find a new balance between “ no blame ” and accountability .
We know that this particular problem can be morbid , sometimes fatal , and that the systems issues , such as the availability of sanitizing gel dispensers in hospitals , have by and large been fixed .
But even with those changes in place , few health care systems have had sustainable rates of hand hygiene over 80 percent .
We have not achieved the rate we would expect of ourselves , and that our patients would expect .
Most hospitals and health care organizations are starting to step up to the idea of individual accountability , but in very haphazard ways .
For instance , I can lose my hospital privileges if I fail to sign a dictated discharge summary or operative note .
But if I do n’t clean my hands for the next 10 years , nothing will happen to me .
One of the fundamental problems of safety is embedded in this example .
We operate in an environment where there are regulatory sticks and payment incentives ; and in this particular example , it ’s difficult to submit to an insurer if the doctor has n’t signed off .
When there ’s money at stake , organizations get motivated enough to stop being too fuzzy .
Promoting safety  really doing it right  takes time and money .
Ethics and professionalism are important but not enough .
Q . Do you think the safety movement has eroded trust between patients and doctors ?
A . It has eroded trust in safety , but I think that was absolutely necessary .
The idea from the I.O.M. report that launched this field was that there was a jumbo jet ’s worth of people dying every day .
The only way we are going to fix this problem is to become much more open and transparent .
That transparency will drive us to improve and allows us to educate each other .
A Chinese villager has been jailed for 12 years for shooting and eating the country 's last known wild Indochinese tiger , China Daily reports .
Kang Wannian and Gao Zuqiao , from Mengla , Yunnan Province , encountered the animal in February while gathering freshwater mussels in a nature reserve near China 's border with Laos .
Kang claimed he shot the cat in self - defence , but the local court ruled he " did not need a gun " to gather mussels , and slapped him with ten years for the killing and two years for " illegal possession of firearms " .
He was also fined 100,000 yuan ( £ 9,100 ) and " ordered to compensate the state for an economic loss of 480,000 yuan " ( £ 43,800 ) .
Gao , who helped Kang cut up the carcass , and four villagers who shared the feline meal were sentenced to between three and four years for " covering up and concealing criminal gains " .
The endangered Indochinese tiger ( Panthera tigris corbetti ) is now represented by an estimated 1,000 individuals in Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Thailand , and Vietnam .
The slaughtered Chinese specimen was photographed back in 2007 in the same reserve where it met its fate .

Slouching Toward Sanity :
In America today – and in the rest of the world – economic - policy centrists are being squeezed .
The Economic Policy Institute reports a poll showing that Americans overwhelmingly believe that the economic policies of the past year have greatly enriched the bankers of Midtown Manhattan and London ’s Canary Wharf ( they really are n’t concentrated on Wall Street or in the City of London anymore ) .
In America , the Republican congressional caucus is just saying no :
no to short - term deficit spending to put people to work ,
no to supporting the banking system ,
and no to increased government oversight or ownership of financial entities .
And the banks themselves are back to business - as - usual : anxious to block any financial - sector reform and trusting congressmen eager for campaign contributions to delay and disrupt the legislative process .
I do not claim that policy in recent years has been anything close to ideal .
If I had been running things 13 months ago , the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve would have let Lehman and AIG fail – but would have taken the obligations of those entities for cash at face value provided that the obligations also came with sufficient equity warrants to give the government a proper share of the upside .
That would have preserved the functioning of the system .
That would have punished -- severely -- the banking and shadow - banking systems ’ equity holders who had not performed sufficent due diligence .
That would have kept any bankers today from claiming that their risk management practices were adequate and did not need reform .
If I had been running things 19 months ago , I would have nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
For the duration of the crisis shifted monetary and financial policy from targeting the Federal Funds rate to targeting the price of mortgages .
Ever since 1825 , the purpose of monetary policy in a crisis has been to support asset prices to prevent the financial markets from sending to the real economy the price signal that it is time for mass unemployment .
Nationalizing Fannie and Freddie , and using them to peg the price of mortgages , would have been the cleanest and easiest way to accomplish that .
Nevertheless , policy over the past two and a half years has been good .
A fundamental shock bigger than the one in 1929 - 1930 hit a financial system that was much more vulnerable to shocks than was the case back then .
Despite this , unemployment will peak at around 10 % , rather than at 24 % , as it did in the US during the Great Depression .
Nonfarm unemployment will peak at 10.5 % , rather than at 30 % .
Nor will we in the end have a lost decade of economic stagnation , as Japan did in the 1990’s .
Admittedly , this comparison bar is low .
But our policymakers have cleared it .
They might have well not have .
Thus it is worth stepping back and asking :
What would the economy look like today if policymakers had acceded to the populist demand of no support to the bankers ?
What would the economy look like today if Congressional Republican opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) program had won the day ?
What would the economy have looked like today had Senators Nelson , Snowe , and company done to Obama 's discretionary deficit - spending plan what their predecessors did to Clinton 's in 1993 and blocked it ?
The only point of reference is the Great Depression itself .
That is the only time in more than a century when ( a ) a financial crisis caused a widespread , lengthy , and prolonged reinforcing chain of bank failures , and ( b ) the government by and large washed its hands -- neither intervened on a large scale itself nor passed the baton to a consortium of private banks ( usually , in the U.S. , headed by Morgan ) to support the system as a whole .
It is now 19 months after Bear Stearns failed and was taken over by JP MorganChase , with the assistance of up to $ 30 billion of Federal Reserve money on March 16 , 2008 .
Industrial production now stands 14 % below its peak in 2007 .
By contrast , 19 months after the Bank of United States , with 450,000 depositors , failed on December 11 , 1930 – the first major bank collapse in New York since the Knickerbocker Trust failure during the panic and depression of 1907 – industrial production , according to the Federal Reserve index , was 54 % below its 1929 peak .
Opponents of recent economic policy rebel against the hypothesis that an absence of government intervention and support could produce an economic decline of that magnitude today .
After all , modern economies are stable and stubborn things .
Market systems are resilient webs that offer the best possible incentives to people to make deals and use resources productively .
A 54 % fall in industrial production between its 2007 peak and today is inconceivable – is n’t it ?
If so , then the unavoidable conclusion must be that things would not have been so bad if the government had refused to implement an expansionary fiscal policy , recapitalize banks , nationalize troubled institutions , and buy financial assets in non-standard ways .
The problem , though , is that all the theoretical arguments that depressions as deep as the Great Depression simply do not happen to modern market economies – well they applied just as well to the 1930s as they do to today .
But the Great Depression did happen .
And it could have happened again .
All that had to happen then was for the logic of the financial crisis to roll through to its conclusion , in the absence of extraordinary government intervention to stem it .

Israeli munitions , white flames , and smoke that human rights group say indicate the use of white phosphorus .
The Israeli military announced in a report on Thursday that it has used at least 20 white phosphorus bombs inside civilian areas during the IDF 's offensive in the Gaza Strip to try and stop rockets being fired by Hamas , from going into southern Israel .
The report comes as Israeli naval gunships went silent for the first time since Israel announced their ceasefire on January 18 , with Hamas following a few days later .
The report states that the military used white phosphorous bombs in civilian areas , with at least twenty phosphorous shells fired by a reserve paratroops brigade into a densely packed area of Beit Lahiya .
The United Nations head quarters and a hospital in Gaza City were also bombed with white phosphorus .
" We saw streets and alleyways littered with evidence of the use of white phosphorus , including still burning wedges and the remnants of the shells and canisters fired by the Israeli army , " said Christopher Cobb - Smith , with Amnesty International who is also an expert in the field of weapons .
An official for the IDF said that two types of phosphorus weapons were used in the offensive .
One contained little phosphorous and was primarily used as a smoke bomb and is fired from 155 mm shells .
The other type of bomb , made in 81 mm and 120 mm shells , are fired from mortar guns .
These shells used a computer guidance system and Israel says that the system failed when the UN and hospital were hit .
Phosphorus burns when it comes in contact with oxygen , and can cause serious injuries to humans if they are hit with it .
Doctors in Gaza say that dozens of civilians have been treated for burns related to the use of the weapons .
The Israeli military had claimed that they had never used the bomb during the offensive , despite the existence of photographic and video evidence .
The use of the white phosphorous bombs against civilian buildings is illegal under Protocol 3 of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons , agreed in 1980 .
However , Israel , which signed the treaty in 1995 , is not party to Protocol 3 .
Israel claims they were following international law when using the weapons .
200 of the bombs were used , 180 of which were used on farmland and orchards , where militants were launching rockets into southern Israel .
The other 20 were used in residential areas , but the IDF says they were fired in areas that rockets were being fired from .
Nearly 1,300 Palestinians , the majority being civilians , died and nearly 5,450 were injured during the three - week offensive .
Thirteen Israeli soldiers were also killed .

Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday that some top al - Qaeda 9/11 conspirators will be tried by jury in New York not far from the scenes of devastation that they had wrought .
This decision by the Obama administration demonstrates faith in the American way of life , and a conviction that even the worst mass murderers can be dealt justice by democratic institutions .
Predictably , Republican critics vowed to fight the decision , since they much prefer to hold people forever without trial while torturing them , sort of the way some English kings did in North America before there was that pesky American constitution .
In fact , on a whole range of issues , the contemporary Republican Party is a party of medieval romanticism .
Its disquisitions on when the human person begins are theological in character and rooted in assumptions even a lot of medievals would have questioned .
Its faith that bankers would never steal from us and so do not need to be regulated is a form of mysticism that medievals would have applied to saints .
And its fascination with arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and with torture more recalls the star chambers of yore than the deliberations at Philadelphia over 200 years ago .
Let us listen not to John Boehner of Ohio but to a Founding Father , Thomas Jefferson :
‘ “ I consider [ trial by jury ] as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man , by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Paine , 1789 .
ME 7:408 , Papers 15:269 ‘
Or here is John Adams :
“ Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty . ” – John Adams ( 1774 )
Many Republicans oppose not only jury trials but even habeas corpus for the prisoners at Guantanamo ( the right to apply to a court judge to be produced in court so that the authorities are forced to justify the prisoner ’s imprisonment ) .
They do so on supposed national security grounds , just as the British kings used to .
In fact , of course , these prisoners have no fresh information on plots and cannot possibly know anything of value to any contemporary terrorists at large , since they have been sequestered for so many years .
Here is what Thomas Jefferson had to say about the suspension of rights such as habeas corpus on national security grounds :
‘ “ Why suspend the habeas corpus in insurrections and rebellions ?
The parties who may be arrested may be charged instantly with a well defined crime ; of course , the judge will remand them .
If the public safety requires that the government should have a man imprisoned on less probable testimony in those than in other emergencies , let him be taken and tried , retaken and retried , while the necessity continues , only giving him redress against the government for damages .
Examine the history of England .
See how few of the cases of the suspension of the habeas corpus law have been worthy of that suspension .
They have been either real treasons , wherein the parties might as well have been charged at once , or sham plots , where it was shameful they should ever have been suspected .
Yet for the few cases wherein the suspension of the habeas corpus has done real good , that operation is now become habitual and the minds of the nation almost prepared to live under its constant suspension . ”

WASHINGTON --
More than $ 2 billion allegedly held on behalf of Iran in Citigroup Inc. accounts were secretly ordered frozen last year by a federal court in Manhattan , in what appears to be the biggest seizure of Iranian assets abroad since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The legal order , executed 18 months ago by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , is under seal and has n't been made public .
The court acted in part because of information provided by the U.S. Treasury Department .

Copenhagen was a disaster .
That much is agreed .
But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations .
The truth is this : China wrecked the talks , intentionally humiliated Barack Obama , and insisted on an awful " deal " so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame .
How do I know this ?
Because I was in the room and saw it happen .
China 's strategy was simple : block the open negotiations for two weeks , and then ensure that the closed - door deal made it look as if the west had failed the world 's poor once again .
And sure enough , the aid agencies , civil society movements and environmental groups all took the bait .
The failure was " the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility " , said Christian Aid .
" Rich countries have bullied developing nations , " fumed Friends of the Earth International .
All very predictable , but the complete opposite of the truth .
Even George Monbiot , writing in yesterday 's Guardian , made the mistake of singly blaming Obama .
But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal , and the Chinese delegate saying " no " , over and over again .
Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping , who denounced the Copenhagen accord as " a suicide pact , an incineration pact , in order to maintain the economic dominance of a few countries " .
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China ; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of having to fight its battles in open sessions .
It was a perfect stitch - up .
China gutted the deal behind the scenes , and then left its proxies to savage it in public .
Here 's what actually went on late last Friday night , as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors .
Obama was at the table for several hours , sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister , Meles Zenawi .
The Danish prime minister chaired , and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon , secretary - general of the UN .
Probably only about 50 or 60 people , including the heads of state , were in the room .
I was attached to one of the delegations , whose head of state was also present for most of the time .
What I saw was profoundly shocking .
The Chinese premier , Wen Jinbao , did not deign to attend the meetings personally , instead sending a second - tier official in the country 's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself .
The diplomatic snub was obvious and brutal , as was the practical implication : several times during the session , the world 's most powerful heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his " superiors " .
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general , know this : it was China 's representative who insisted that industrialised country targets , previously agreed as an 80 % cut by 2050 , be taken out of the deal .
" Why ca n't we even mention our own targets ? " demanded a furious Angela Merkel .
Australia 's prime minister , Kevin Rudd , was annoyed enough to bang his microphone .
Brazil 's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China 's position .
Why should rich countries not announce even this unilateral cut ?
The Chinese delegate said no , and I watched , aghast , as Merkel threw up her hands in despair and conceded the point .
Now we know why – because China bet , correctly , that Obama would get the blame for the Copenhagen accord 's lack of ambition .
China , backed at times by India , then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered .
A 2020 peaking year in global emissions , essential to restrain temperatures to 2C , was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that emissions should peak " as soon as possible " .
The long - term target , of global 50 % cuts by 2050 , was also excised .
No one else , perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia , wanted this to happen .
I am certain that had the Chinese not been in the room , we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks popping in every corner of the world .
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup ?
First , it was in an extremely strong negotiating position .
China did n't need a deal .
As one developing country foreign minister said to me : " The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans . "
On the other hand , western leaders in particular – but also presidents Lula of Brazil , Zuma of South Africa , Calderón of Mexico and many others – were desperate for a positive outcome .
Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than anyone .
The US had confirmed the offer of $ 100bn to developing countries for adaptation , put serious cuts on the table for the first time ( 17 % below 2005 levels by 2020 ) , and was obviously prepared to up its offer .
Above all , Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate regulation framework , so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese industry .
With midterm elections looming , Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only opportunity to go to climate change talks with a strong mandate .
This further strengthened China 's negotiating hand , as did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India .
Campaign groups never blame developing countries for failure ; this is an iron rule that is never broken .
The Indians , in particular , have become past masters at co-opting the language of equity ( " equal rights to the atmosphere " ) in the service of planetary suicide – and leftish campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard .
With the deal gutted , the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low - lying nations who have most to lose from rising seas .
President Nasheed of the Maldives , supported by Brown , fought valiantly to save this crucial number .
" How can you ask my country to go extinct ? " demanded Nasheed .
The Chinese delegate feigned great offence – and the number stayed , but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless .
The deed was done .
China 's game
All this raises the question : what is China 's game ?
Why did China , in the words of a UK - based analyst who also spent hours in heads of state meetings , " not only reject targets for itself , but also refuse to allow any other country to take on binding targets ? "
The analyst , who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years , concludes that China wants to weaken the climate regulation regime now " in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a few years ' time " .
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming .
It is strong in both the wind and solar industries .
But China 's growth , and growing global political and economic dominance , is based largely on cheap coal .
China knows it is becoming an uncontested superpower ; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen .
Its coal - based economy doubles every decade , and its power increases commensurately .
Its leadership will not alter this magic formula unless they absolutely have to .
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal , because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics .
This is fast becoming China 's century , yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only not a priority , but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower 's freedom of action .
I left Copenhagen more despondent than I have felt in a long time .
After all the hope and all the hype , the mobilisation of thousands , a wave of optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics , fell back , and drained away .
If you do n’t quite have the right stuff , but always thought being an astronaut would be cool , here ’s a way for you to contribute to the US space program .
Go to bed .
With NASA .
“ I would absolutely recommend it .
It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life , ” said Heather Archuletta , who has participated in three different studies for the Human Test Subject Facility ( HTSF ) at the Johnson Space Center .
These ongoing studies use long - term bed rest to simulate the effects of micro-gravity an astronaut would experience during extended space flight .
“ This is a great opportunity for the general public to help NASA with their scientific research , ” said John Foster , who works for Solitaire Creative Services , a company that promotes the studies .
“ This is one of NASA ’s biggest barriers for sending humans to Mars , ” Archuletta told Universe Today .
“ If they can find a way around bone demineralization , wow , that would really boost the possibilities for human spaceflight . ”
NASA is planning a series of studies that support the scientific needs of the space program .
The studies will be conducted over the next ten years , and currently , NASA is looking to fill spots in 87 - day bed rest studies and a lunar analog feasibility study .
For the bed rest study , participants are placed in bed with the head of the bed tilted down at a minus - six - degree incline .
The Lunar Analog Feasibility Study is a 21 - day study to demonstrate if it is possible to simulate 1/6 G lunar gravity using bed rest .
“ Participants are compensated for their time and expenses , ” said Foster .
“ For example , a participant who completed a 60 - day study was paid approximately $ 13,800 . ”
“ I know they desperately need more healthy females , ” Archuletta said .
“ It seems people think only guys can do these studies , so it seems harder to get women . ”
Archuletta , who is also known as the “ Pillow - naut ” from her blog about her experiences , Pillow Astronaut , said amazingly , the studies simulate very well what astronauts experience in space .
“ You would n’t think that something as simple as tilting the body would mimic what astronauts experience , but it affects your vestibular system the same way and you get the same exact fluid shift where all the blood pools in your head .
You get a little bit of muscle atrophy and some bone mineral loss , and they see the same exact lowering in plasma volume and lower heart rate .
Almost everything that happens in space they can do with tilting the bed .
That was major news for me . ”
She said the first week of being in bed is the hardest part of the study .
“ When they put you in the head - down position , it kind of messes with the inner ear and your equilibrium , ” Archuletta said .
“ They warned me about it , but I did n’t give it much credence , because I thought , ‘ you ’re lying down , how hard can it be ? ’
But you get a blood rush to the head , so my teeth were throbbing and I had a headache . ”
She also would get dizzy when she turned her head quickly , which again , mimics what many astronauts experience in space .
“ I have been able to talk with two different astronauts and they both said , yes , the first few days you are on orbit , the veteran astronauts tell them not to turn their head quickly because when you are weightless it messes with the vestibular system . ”
Those symptoms passed in about a week , Archuletta said .
“ It is amazing what the body can adapt to .
All of a sudden my body just said , ‘ OK , this is our new reality and we ’ll deal with it . ’
Within a couple of weeks I felt normal and actually getting up was the hard part .
You get used to lying down and it actually starts to feel normal . ”
But the benefits of participating outweighed any discomforts she went through .
“ You have tons and tons of free time .

You have your own room but there is a common room where we can play games and talk , but I worked a little while I was there , ” said Archuletta , who works as a consultant for an IT company and also is a freelance writer .
“ But mostly it was nice just to catch up on a lot of things I ’d wanted to do for a while . ”
But do n’t expect to be chosen to participate if you plan to just play video games for three months .
“ They are really looking for people who come in with goals , ” Archuletta said , “ such as one person there learned Spanish , I learned sign language , and another person brought their guitar and wrote songs .
They want people who have ideas about how to keep themselves busy because they will be less likely to get restless . ”
Archuletta said the question she gets asked most often is if she got bored .
“ Absolutely not , ” she said .
“ It is a very busy testing schedule when you first come , so you go through a lot of physical exertion before the bed rest phase ; they keep you very busy .
Once you are in bed you do get a lot of free time , but you are being monitored .
They take vitals a couple of times a day , and make sure you are doing OK .
You stretch a couple times a day so you do n’t get blood clots , but you ca n’t outright exercise .
But you get a massage every other day – that ’s definitely one of the good parts !
I do n’t think the astronauts get that in space ! ”
The studies are done at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston , Texas .
Participants will live in a special research unit for the entire study and be fed a carefully controlled diet .
The first 11 - 15 days of the 87 - day study , participants undergo tests , but are not on bed rest .
The next 60 days participants are constantly in bed , ( except for limited times for specific tests ) with their head tilted downward slightly .
Then there are 14 days to recover , to allow the body to get back to normal .
Participants must be nonsmokers who are in good health with no history of cardiovascular , neurological , gastrointestinal , or musculoskeletal problems .

In 1997 , three people were shot and killed in a South Side market known as “ El Grande . ”
My client was charged with murder , but I was able to get him acquitted by the jury in a total of 42 minutes .
Still , that is n’t even the full story .
The real issue was that the prosecutor committed misconduct .
After I filed a complaint with the bar association , the police investigated the matter , and he was later disbarred .
For further information , I encourage you to read the full New Yorker article written by Jeffrey Toobin .
Gov. David A. Paterson on Monday criticized the Obama administration ’s decision to try five men linked to the Sept. 11 attacks in a civilian court in Manhattan .
His comments made him one of a few Democrats to take that stand and underscored his schism with the White House .
“ This is not a decision that I would have made , ” the governor said .
“ New York was very much the epicenter of that attack ; over 2,700 lives were lost . ”
“ It ’s very painful , ” he added .
“ We ’re still having trouble getting over it .
We still have been unable to rebuild that site , and having those terrorists tried so close to the attack is going to be an encumbrance on all New Yorkers . ”
The degree of insider trading in this market is getting ridiculous .
And the strangest thing is those who are executing on blatantly obvious material , non-public insider information , are no longer concerned the least bit about getting caught as they realize that the " mighty " SEC will do nothing against them , courtesy of the example the SEC has set by finding absolutely nobody " responsible " ( except , of course , the regulator 's own future employers who thus get immunity from prosecution ) for the greatest market heist in history in which over $ 5 trillion has been transferred from the middle class to the Wall Street oligarchy ( future providers of paychecks for SEC staffers ) .
Today 's grotesque example of the SEC 's futility to act as even a modest deterrent to insider trading activity : New York Community Bancorp ( which , just so happens , is a $ 602 million recipient of TLGP debt ) , whose stock surged in the final minutes of trading for reasons ( then ) unknown .
As reader QevolveQ pointed out at 5:30 pm , the activity in both the stock and the calls of the company was many standard deviations away from average and raised major red flags .
Those questions were quickly put to rest when it became known at 6:33 pm that NYB would in fact receive FDIC subsidies to acquire newly failed AmTrust Bank in a transaction that would be " immediately accretive to earnings . "
And how would n't it be :
Under the terms of the agreement , the Community Bank did not acquire any of AmTrust Bank ’s non-performing loans serviced by AmTrust Bank or any other real estate owned ; construction , land , or development loans ; private - label securities , or mortgage servicing rights , nor did it acquire any of the assets or assume any of the obligations of the holding company .
No , those would conveniently be funded by Ms. Bair herself .
The cost to the FDIC , and US taxpayers , to make NYB a richer enterprise : $ 2 billion .
This is value that will go straight to the bank 's bottom line .
As a result of this middle - class subsidy it was a certainty that its shares would spike .
The smoking gun here comes straight from a quick observation of NYB 's intraday P/V chart : the jump at 3:24 pm on statistically significant volume is a clear signal that someone was fully aware of the soon to be announced transaction :
Furthermore , as QeQ highlights , " 8,933 of the Dec 12 calls traded vs. 2,244 OI , finishing +300 % on the day . "
A very solid return for a few hours of trading .
The block trades are visible below : one set of 2,500 Dec $ 12 calls bought at $ 0.20 , followed promptly by two more 2,500 blocks around $ 0.25 .
With the stock poised to open much higher than its closing price , someone is sure to make a killing .
It is practically certain that the NYB stock and option transactions came courtesy of a insider tip .
And as NYB is both a ward of the state , courtesy of its TLGP umbilical cord , and as the bank would soon become $ 2 billion richer as a result of some more middle class - to - Wall Street fund flows , it is very likely that the FDIC itself is the source of such leak .
We truly hope that one of D.C. 's most ineffective and useless females ( if grossly , grossly overpaid for her " work " in 2008 ) will analyze whether the agency headed by another such female has been responsible for yet more illegal insider trading activity .
That the government is only capable of promoting unpunished criminal activity would not surprise anyone at this point .
And as this will be one of those cases when everything is handed to the SEC on a silver platter , we do n't doubt that some minor scapegoat will be put away to make it seem like the most worthless organization in the world earns its $ 1 billion annual budget fair and square .
What is chilling is the complete disdain that insider traders now flaunt when it comes to fear of retribution by the " regulators . "
And when Ms. Mary " $ 3.3 Million " Schapiro is done catching any and all masterminds behind this dastardly deed , we would all be very grateful if she could leave her keys , her chauffeur , and her masseuse as she packs her banker box full of Wall Street indulgences on the way out of public office once and for all - Ms. Schapiro , the public does not want you betraying its trust any longer .
Now please go work for Goldman Sachs where your continued betrayal of U.S. interests will be welcome and compensated much better than the meager $ 3.3 million you made at Finra .
The sooner you get into a job that requires efforts more consummate with your diminished capacity , the sooner you can continue counting the $ 5 - $ 25 million in cash payouts you slurped up from FINRA 's defined benefit plans .
Dont know where this happened but that must have been one hell of a fight !!

An article in this week 's edition of Nature adds to the mysteries surrounding ' dark matter ' .
Should we abandon this enigmatic concept of invisible matter that exerts gravitational attraction but is otherwise undetectable ?
Could it be that we simply do not understand the long - range behavior of gravity ?
Galaxies rotate .
Each of them would fly apart and create a cosmic mess , were it not for the gravitational forces that bind together the many billions of stars and large quantities of dust and gas that constitute a typical galaxy like our Milky Way .
By applying Newton 's law of gravity to the observed mass distribution of the galaxies , we can predict the rotation curve for each galaxy .
If we do this , and compare the derived rotation curves to the observed rotational velocities , it becomes apparent that galaxies rotate much faster than predicted based on the gravitational attraction from the visible mass .
This means that the matter within a galaxy is bonded together much stronger than expected .
These deviations are very significant .
Detailed comparisons between observed and calculated rotation rates reveal that the bonding of matter in galaxies is about six times stronger than expected .
This means that either Newton 's law of gravity fails dramatically at galactic distances , or that large quantities of some invisible ( ' dark ' ) matter are present .
The physics community has predominantly opted for the latter conjecture .
An easy way out that leaves Newton 's venerable theories intact .
This , however , might start to change .
For a given galaxy , the mismatch between expected and observed rotational velocities is usually represented by plotting both velocities as function of the distance to the center of the galaxy .
This results in displays that typically look like : Galaxy rotation curve as measured from Doppler shifts ( solid curve ) and as inferred from the gravity effects associated with visible matter ( dashed curve ) Prominently apparent in these plots is that outside the core of the galaxy the rotational velocities typically flatten off , whilst theory based on the observed galaxy mass predicts the velocities to drop with distance .
The velocity flattening as function of radial distance is observed for virtually every galaxy investigated , yet the value of the constant velocity is different for different galaxies .
A European collaboration of astrophysicists now reports in the current edition of Nature the remarkable observation that hidden in the galaxy rotational velocity plots is a universal behavior .
To make this universality apparent , accelerations rather than velocities need to be plotted .
This can easily be accomplished by translating the observed rotational speeds into centrifugal accelerations using the fact that the centrifugal acceleration of a body circling around a central point equals the velocity squared divided by the distance to the center .
When plotting the observed centrifugal accelerations as function of distance to the centre of the galaxy together with the theoretically derived acceleration due to the gravitational attraction of the visible matter in the galaxy , a plot as shown below typically emerges :
Galaxy acceleration curve as measured ( solid curve ) , and as derived from the gravitational acceleration due to visible matter ( dashed curve ) .
The red arrow indicates the maximum value of the mismatch between both , and the green arrow indicates the corresponding acceleration that can be attributed to visible matter .
Both values are universal ( see text ) .
Quite remarkably , whilst the different galaxies have widely different sizes and different masses , each of them plot such that the maximum deviation between theory and observation corresponds to an acceleration of 3 10 cm / s , with the corresponding acceleration predicted based on visible matter being 0.6 10 cm / s .
Whilst the universality in the mismatch was known , the new publication in Nature adds universality in the theoretically derived acceleration to the picture .
This added aspect of universality between the effects of dark and visible matter could mean that facts start to close in on dark matter theories .
Whilst by no means impossible , it simply seems less plausible that for each and every galaxy dark matter always collects around visible matter in a fixed ( approximately 5:1 ) ratio .
On the other hand , modifications to Newton 's theory of gravity can very well be taylored so as to result in the observed universal gravity - scaling behavior .
Will dark matter soon be classified as a misconception ?
A gravitational aether that for decades has led scientists astray ?
It is all written in the stars .
The Column , No. 6 : Thoughts about Flinching By Chuck Hawks
Recoil ( or kick ) is the bane of all shooters .
Recoil and muzzle blast cause flinching , which leads directly to missed targets .
Anyone who shoots a lot and is honest will admit that he or she sometimes flinches .
Some shooters always flinch .
Flinching is the body 's natural reaction to the knowledge that it is about to absorb a blow .
Boxers duck when they sense a punch coming , and it is considered good defense .
Shooters are not so lucky .
We are expected to remain motionless and just absorb the full force of the blow delivered when our guns go off .
And we are belittled if our bodies inadvertently try to duck the blow by flinching .
Flinching is somehow seen by many as faintly cowardly , like whining or wife beating .
Certainly it is poisonous to accuracy with any firearm .
Flinching is mostly psychological , but also partly physical .
Heavy recoil bruises the shoulder and may cause permanent damage over time , particularly to the joints .
My right shoulder sometimes aches for several days after a long range session with hard kicking long guns , and my right wrist usually aches for at least a couple of days after a prolonged session with magnum handguns .
( I am not complaining , for shooting has been a lifelong recreational activity and has brought a great deal of pleasure into my life .
Baseball pitchers , after all , typically have far more severe shoulder trouble than do I . )
There is no question that muzzle blast can be literally deafening ; always wear ear protection when you shoot .
Not only will it help save your hearing , it also reduces flinching .
I can say from personal experience that loud , hard kicking guns are more likely to induce a flinch than milder weapons .
And the more such guns are fired , the worst the tendency to flinch becomes .
If you absolutely , positively , must shoot magnum loads , shoot them sparingly .
As a shooting session wears on and concentration begins to wane , flinching is liable to set in .
It takes serious concentration on sight alignment and trigger squeeze , at least with a rifle or pistol , to shoot consistently good groups .
Shotgun shooters must keep their heads down , focus on the target , swing smoothly without stopping , shoot the instant the correct lead has been established , and follow through .
Either way , if concentration fails , flyers appear on targets , game is missed , and trap targets are lost .
These are usually due to flinching .
Fatigue makes it harder to concentrate fully on the job at hand , and your subconscious is more likely to take over and command your body to flinch .
All shooters should " call " their shots .
That is , they should know where the sights ( on a rifle or pistol ) or the shotgun was in relation to the target at the instant the shot was fired .
Anytime you call a shot good , but the result is a miss , suspect that a flinch was the culprit .
Flinching can take many forms .
Perhaps the most common , and least damaging , is a slight twitch of the shoulder muscle as a gun is fired .
Some shooters always flinch in this manner , and they can still be very good shots if they do so consistently .
More serious is a generalized contraction of the muscles of the shoulder and / or arms and hands as the trigger is released .
This results in flyers or lost targets with long guns , or complete misses with a handgun .
Ditto a reflexive pull on the trigger , rather than a squeeze , when a rifle or handgun is fired .
Those embarrassing " grounders " that hit about halfway to the target occur when the shooter 's eyes snap closed and an inadvertent lurch forward with the upper body accompanies a yank on the trigger .
Any semblance of accuracy disappears with such a flinch .
Another type is flinching is a subconscious reluctance , or inability , to pull the trigger .
With a shotgun , the trigger pull may come very late , when the target is about out of range .
With a rifle or pistol , you think you are squeezing the trigger , but nothing happens .
This has happened to me .
If the gun does n't fire along about when I think it should , I raise my head , lower the gun a little , take a breath , consciously try to relax , and start over .
( I also check the safety ! )
In fact , all of the forms of flinching described above have happened to me at one time or another .
I 've been there and done that .
I have written more than once about recoil and flinching .
A stock that fits properly helps to minimize the effect of recoil , and one that does not fit promotes flinching because it hurts when the shot is let off .
Good recoil pads , like the Pachmayr Decelerator , help to soften the blow .
The mercury or spring type recoil reducers that are fitted into the stock may reduce recoil -- certainly they add weight to the gun , and that definitely does .
Muzzle brakes can do a lot to tame recoil , but they intensify muzzle blast , which to many is worse .
Sometimes , especially in the field , muzzle brakes are analogous to curing the disease by killing the patient .
Switching to a gas - operated gun reduces the effect of recoil by spreading it out over a longer time period .
The total recoil remains the same , but the peak amplitude is lowered .
Many trap shooters , who may shoot hundreds of 12 gauge shotgun shells a day during a tournament , have switched to gas - operated autoloaders for this reason .
I have also recommended relatively light kicking guns and loads in many of my articles , particularly those articles primarily intended for beginning shooters .
In most cases the milder calibers and loads remain fully effective for their intended purpose .
An obvious way to deal with the natural tendency to flinch is to shoot guns that kick less .
This applies equally to rifles , shotguns , and handguns .
That seems clear to me , but apparently it is not always obvious to others .
I have been accused of being afraid of powerful guns , and being overly sensitive to recoil .
I suspect that both are at least partially true , but when I observe the horrendous flinches delivered by some of the " bigger is better " school of shooters when their firing pin falls on an accidentally empty chamber , I have to wonder just how insensitive to recoil they really are .
( Normally , of course , the recoil of the gun covers the flinch . )
Apparently they are not immune from the flinches !
I think that most shooters , even the best shooters , flinch .
Certainly many top scoring trap and skeet shooters do , which is why release triggers , anti-recoil devices , light loads , and heavy guns are so popular on the firing line .
Yet these shooters control their flinching and win competitively .
They are not ashamed to take whatever measures are necessary to control recoil and thus minimize their flinching .
There is serious money at stake at major shoots , and money won and lost tends to wonderfully clarify the thinking !
Certainly no one can solve a problem until they first admit that they have one .
So come on , guys , ' fess up .
Repeat after me :
My name is ______ ( Chuck Hawks ) and I am a flincher . . ..
Protect your web apps with Content Security Policy ( CSP )
As the number of security threats grows , it 's crucial for web applications to adopt the latest security standards and countermeasures .
CSP is a modern standard that allows applications to declare approved origins of content ( such as JavaScript , CSS , images , etc ... ) for the browser to load .
Constructing a safe and at the same time complete CSP can be challenging .
You either risk leaving holes in the defense of your application or you break certain functionality .
Protecting against unwanted inline scripts is the most important target to attain .
In CSP this is called ' unsafe - inline ' and it's the most common cause of cross - site scripting vulnerabilities .
Wicket 9 comes with full support for CSP and does not need any unsafe directives .
Wicket will automatically add a nonce to every header contribution and whitelist this nonce .
This allows for flexible loading of resources without the need for a complex CSP .
Of course it is possible to modify and customize the CSP , add additional directives or disable it entirely .
Lookup our documentation for more information .
So Django has an interesting feature called " generic views " , which essentially allow you to to render a template with generic code .
In Rails , the same feature would be called " generic actions " ( just a terminology difference ) .
This was possible , but somewhat difficult in Rails 2.x , but it 's a breeze in Rails 3 .
Let 's take a look at a simple generic view in Django , the " redirect_to " view :
urlpatterns = patterns ( 'django.views.generic.simple ' , ( ' ^foo / (? P< id>\d+ ) /$ ' , ' redirect_to ' , {'url ' : '/ bar / %( id ) s /'} ) , )
This essentially redirects " / foo/ " to " / bar / s / " .
In Rails 2.3 , a way to achieve equivalent behavior was to create a generic controller that handled this :
class GenericController < ApplicationController def redirect redirect_to( params [ :url ] % params , params [ : options ] ) end end
And then you could use this in your router :
map.connect " / foo/:id " , : controller => " generic " , :action => " redirect " , :url => " / bar / %{id}s "
This uses the new Ruby 1.9 interpolation syntax ( " %{first} % {last} " % {: foo => " hello " , : bar => " sir " } == " hello sir " ) that has been backported to Ruby 1.8 via ActiveSupport .
Better With Rails 3
However , this is a bit clumsy , and requires us to have a special controller to handle this ( relatively simple ) case .
It also saddles us with the conceptual overhead of a controller in the router itself .
Here 's how you do the same thing in Rails 3 :
match " / foo /:id " , : to => redirect ( " / bar/ %{id}s " )
This is built - into Rails 3's router , but the way it works is actually pretty cool .
The Rails 3 router is conceptually decoupled from Rails itself , and the : to key points at a Rack endpoint .
For instance , the following would be a valid route in Rails 3 :
match " / foo " , : to => proc { |env| [ 200 , {} , [ " Hello world " ] ] }
The redirect method simply returns a rack endpoint that knows how to handle the redirection :
def redirect ( *args , &block ) options = args.last.is_a ?( Hash ) ?
args.pop : {} path = args .
shift || block path_proc = path.is_a ?( Proc ) ?
path : proc { |params| path % params } status = options [ : status ] || 301 lambda do |env| req = Rack :: Request.new(env ) params = path_proc.call(env[" action_dispatch.request.path_parameters " ] ) url = req.scheme + '://' + req.host + params [ status , {' Location ' => url , ' Content - Type ' => ' text / html'} , [ ' Moved Permanently ' ] ] end end
There 's a few things going on here , but the important part is the last few lines , where the redirect method returns a valid Rack endpoint .
If you look closely at the code , you can see that the following would be valid as well :
match " / api/v1/:api " , : to => redirect { |params| " / api/v2/#{params[:api].pluralize} " } # and match " / api/v1 /:api " , : to => redirect ( : status => 302 ) { |params| " / api/v2/#{params[:api].pluralize} " }
Another Generic Action
Another nice generic action that Django provides is allowing you to render a template directly without needing an explicit action .
It looks like this :
urlpatterns = patterns ( 'django.views.generic.simple ' , ( r ' ^foo / $ ' , ' direct_to_template ' , {'template ' : ' foo_index.html'} ) , ( r' ^foo / ( ? P< id>\d+ ) /$ ' , ' direct_to_template ' , {'template ' : ' foo_detail.html'} ) , )
This provides a special mechanism for rendering a template directly from the Django router .
Again , this could be implemented by creating a special controller in Rails 2 and used as follows :
class GenericController < ApplicationController def direct_to_template render ( params [ : options ] ) end end # Router map.connect " / foo " , : controller => " generic " , :action => " direct_to_template " , :options => { :template => " foo_detail " }
A Prettier API
A nicer way to do this would be something like this :
match " / foo " , : to => render ( " foo " )
For the sake of clarity , let 's say that directly rendered templates will come out of app / views / direct unless otherwise specified .
Also , let 's say that the render method should work identically to the render method used in Rails controllers themselves , so that render : template => " foo " , : status => 201 , : content_type =>
Mime :: JSON et al will work as expected .
In order to make this work , we 'll use ActionController : : Metal , which exposes a Rack - compatible object with access to all of the powers of a full ActionController : : Base object .
class RenderDirectly < ActionController :: Metal include ActionController :: Rendering include ActionController :: Layouts append_view_path Rails.root.join ( " app " , " views " , " direct " ) append_view_path Rails.root.join ( " app " , " views " ) layout " application " def index render * env [ " generic_views.render_args " ] end end module GenericActions module Render def render ( * args ) app = RenderDirectly.action ( : index ) lambda do |env| env[ " generic_views.render_args " ] = args app.call( env ) end end end end
The trick here is that we 're subclassing ActionController : : Metal and pulling in just Rendering and Layouts , which gives you full access to the normal rendering API without any of the other overhead of normal controllers .
We add both the direct directory and the normal view directory to the view path , which means that any templates you place inside app / views / direct will take be used first , but it 'll fall back to the normal view directory for layouts or partials .
We also specify that the layout is application , which is not the default in Rails 3 in this case since our metal controller does not inherit from ApplicationController .
Note for the Curious
In all normal application cases , Rails will look up the inheritance chain for a named layout matching the controller name .
This means that the Rails 2 behavior , which allows you to provide a layout named after the controller , still works exactly the same as before , and that ApplicationController is just another controller name , and application .
html.erb is its default layout .
And then , the actual use in your application :
Rails.application.routes do extend GenericActions match " / foo " , : to => render ( " foo_index " ) # match " / foo " => render ( " foo_index " ) is a valid shortcut for the simple case match " / foo/:id " , : constraints => { :id => /\d+/} , : to => render ( " foo_detail " )
end
Of course , because we 're using a real controller shell , you 'll be able to use any other options available on the render ( like :status , : content_type , :location , :action , : layout , etc. ) .
WASHINGTON  A missile fired this week by a Central Intelligence Agency drone over Pakistan ’s tribal regions killed a top operations planner for Al Qaeda , American counterterrorism officials said Friday .
An American intelligence official said there were “ strong indications ” that a drone strike this week killed Saleh al - Somali , a member of Al Qaeda ’s inner circle who was taking refuge in the mountainous tribal belt in western Pakistan .
The report came amid a swirl of conflicting information about recent C.I.A. strikes in Pakistan , which have grown so frequent that several may occur in the same day .
Pakistani officials said a drone strike this week killed another top Qaeda operative , Abu Yahya al - Libi , but American officials disputed that claim .
Mr. Libi has emerged as one of the terror network ’s rising figures by posting dozens of radical videos on militants ’
Web sites , and the rumors of his death spread through jihadi Internet forums .
The Obama administration in recent weeks has approved a C.I.A. plan to expand clandestine operations inside Pakistan , including the number of drone aircraft in the country and flying them over a wider territory .
The plan is awaiting approval by Pakistan ’s government .
Some sharks have a nasty habit of taking bites out of each other , but in an aquarium in New Zealand one aggressive shark ended up doing its tank - mate a favor when it tore out a piece of the second shark 's belly .
Visitors at Kelly Tarlton 's Underwater World watched in shock as four baby sharks popped out of the gaping wound .
The visitors ran to notify the aquarium staff , who quickly removed the babies .
Via the New Zealand Herald :
[ Aquarium staff member Fiona ]
Davies said the unusual delivery had probably saved the baby sharks ' lives .
Staff did not know the mother was pregnant and , had she given birth naturally , most likely at night , the babies would have been eaten by adult sharks and stingrays before staff could rescue them .
When the mom was removed from the communal tank to get her wound stitched up , vets found four more babies inside her .
All are reportedly doing well , despite the spontaneous C-section .

In my talk on Python concurrency , I talked about the multiple different approaches to asynchronous network programming in the Python world .
I showed Twisted and Tornado Web , and then I compared them to stackless Python and gevent .
Toward the end of the talk , I covered how MySQL plays into all this .
In the Python world , we usually use a MySQL driver that is a Python binding to a low - level driver written in C .
The low - level driver written in C is n't written to use Python 's socket module in any way .
In fact , it has nothing to do with Python .
Hence , it 's impossible to take Twisted or Tornado Web and have them make the low - level driver behave asynchronously .
That 's a problem .
If you go to all the trouble of making your code asynchronous , it sucks to have one request that is held up on a long query blockthe requests in your process .
People handle this in different ways .
The Twisted guys can put the MySQL driver on its own thread .
You might have 100 requests being handled by Twisted , and 10 threads devoted to MySQL connections .
The Tornado Web guys ( from what I can tell ) handle it differently .
They allow MySQL queries to block the entire process .
However , they compensate in two ways .
They lean heavily on their asynchronous web client wherever possible .
They also make use of multiple Python processes .
Hence , if you 're handling 500 simultaneous request , you might use nginx to split them among 10 different Tornado Web processes .
Each process is handling 50 simultaneous requests .
If one of those requests needs to make a call to the database , only 50 ( instead of 500 ) requests are blocked .
At lolapps , they use Tornado Web too ( at least for certain things ) .
Their approach is to lean heavily on memcached and avoid talking to MySQL in real time whenever possible .
At IronPort , Sam Rushing ( who 's now working on a cool project called Irken ) wrote a custom MySQL driver in Python .
It was built with his proprietary version of stackless Python in mind , and hence it was asynchronous .
I think the same thing should be possible in the gevent world .
MySQL Connector / Python is a MySQL driver written in pure Python .
Since gevent permits you to use asynchronous networking APIs without forcing you to use continuation - passing style , it 's possible that gevent could be used with MySQL Connector / Python to make your MySQL queries asynchronous too .
Thank goodness for greenlet
This is a topic I feel strongly about .
I remember in the early days of Java , the JVM supported kernel threads as well as green threads .
Some people would use green threads and then do multi- threaded programming with blocking socket APIs .
What a lot of them did n't realize is that with green threads , if you call a synchronous networking API , you 're blockingyour threads , not just one of them .
Similarly , I feel strongly that if you 're going to all the trouble of using an asynchronous web framework , your MySQL queries should be asynchronous too .
In light of Lincoln 's new healthcare amendment , which would cap the amount of money insurance company CEOs could claim as tax deductions in an attempt to rein in their profits , the National Republican Senatorial Committee said Lincoln ought to " apply that same standard to herself . "
“ If Blanche Lincoln truly believes that health care insurance industry profits are too high and that they should be punished with higher taxes , why should n’t she reject using those same profits to prop - up her embattled re-election campaign ? " said NRSC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson Marchand .
" Is she telling her constituents in Arkansas that health care profits should not line executives ’ pocketbooks , but it ’s ok if they line her campaign war chest ? ” Wilkerson Marchand added .
Down With Tyranny is probably the last place online one would come to look for a defense of Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln .
There are 41 posts since January 2 of this year with her name tagged .
Each and every one is extremely negative .
We persuaded Hebiclens -- who had previously only specialized in photographing Republicans -- to photograph her .
We started the first ActBlue page dedicated to doing something about removing her from office .
And , since summer we 've worked on creating and running 4 TV ads all over Arkansas , especially in the very cost - effective 7 key , heavily Democratic counties fronting the Mississippi River where Democrats need to amass huge turnouts to have even a chance of winning statewide .
And we 've talked with every conceivable politician in the state -- from Lt. Governor Bill Halter to independent candidate Trevor Drown .
Yes , we have n't been big Blanche Lincoln boosters .
Nor will we be going down that road today .
The Republican Party has been attacking her from every perspective under the sun .
And now , oddly , they 're attacking her for taking money from lobbyists and Insurance Industry CEOs .
Which is exactly whatbeen doing :
The Republican Party Establishment is demanding that she donate the more than half a million dollars she 's taken in from the Insurance Industry to Arkansas charities .
So let 's look at who has been carrying water for the Insurance Industry CEOs and lobbyists .
Among sitting senators , the Insurance Industry 's top career - long investment has been John McCain ( R - AZ ) , who has gotten $ 2,919,753 and certainly has been spouting the Insurance Industry 's line entirely .
Other Republican senators who are taking big money from the Insurance Industry and spouting their talking points in return are Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) - $ 983,674 Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) - $ 953,557Jim Bunning ( R- KY ) - $ 789,199 Dick Shelby ( R - AL ) - $ 693,348 Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) - $ 684,057 Saxby Chambliss ( R- GA ) - $ 647,066 Kit Bond ( R - MO ) - $ 644,571John Ensign ( R-NV ) - $ 629,466 Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) - $ 618,200John Cornyn ( R - TX ) - $ 576,678 Each of these senators has been serving the special interests as assiduously as Blanche Lincoln -- and each one of them has taken evenin corporate largesse than the $ 552,583 she 's managed to scoop up .
To be fair , I want to mention that Ben Nelson ( D - NE - $ 1,258,299 ) , Max Baucus ( D - MT - $ 1,191,163 ) , Joe Lieberman ( I - CT - $ 1,037,652 ) and Kent Conrad ( D - ND - $ 844,837 ) are all also notorious K Street whores taking the same kind of money the Republicans do -- and also trying to help their corporate paymasters to the detriment of their own constituents .
But the point I 'd like to drive home today is that the system in severely broken when senators -- from both parties -- are willing to make policy based on corporate payoffs .
It 's why Blue America has drawn a line in the sand on campaign finance reform and why we have decided to endorse no one running for Congress who is n't already sponsoring -- or , in the case of non-incumbents , does n't vow to co-sponsor -- S. 752 or H.R. 1826 , the Fair Election Now Act proposed by Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) in the Senate and John Larson ( D - CT ) in the House .

It 's time to change the English name of the planet in between Saturn and Neptune back to Ouranos .
Here are the reasons .
1 ) All the planets in the Solar System are named after Roman gods , except one .
In spite of that , for some reason we have gone with the Latinized spelling ( Uranus ) of the original name of the god , Ouranos ( Οὐραν ό ς ) .
There is no more reason to go with a Latinized spelling of the name than there is to go with an Arabized spelling of the word Persian ( which would make it Fersian or Farsian ) .
We also do not call Poseidon Posidon .
Yes , English does use Apollo instead of Apollon , but this does not resemble any other English word .
2 ) Due to the Latinized spelling the planet has long been the brunt of a stale joke , and any news about the planet is quickly swamped with irrelevant puns .
3 ) There is already some precedent for preferring terms in astronomy - technically the adjective for Venus is Venerean ( Latin Venus ( - eris , f. ) ) , but Venusian has become the norm due to the word venerean having largely the same meaning as venereal .
4 ) English has no governing authority and we can begin to call the planet Ouranos right now .
It would also take little effort to do so - simply begin using the name Ouranos ( with Uranus in parenthesis the first time to explain which planet you 're talking about ) and bring up the subject every now and then .
So here 's step one : join the group Ouranos , not Uranus on Facebook .
Ouranos is far too large and interesting a destination to be the target of such a stale joke all the time .
Also , how would it be pronounced in English ?
It would sound like - in - os ( final os rhymes with most ) , and the stress would be on the first syllable .
Not oh -- os .
The adjective would be ouranian , or oh - - ee - in .
The alternate spellingwould also be acceptable .

Roy Edward Disney , the nephew of Walt Disney whose commitment to his uncle ’s creative spirit prompted him to mount revolts that led to the unseating of two of the company ’s chief executives and a revival of the studio ’s legendary animation unit , died Wednesday .
He was 79 .
Disney , who had been battling stomach cancer , died at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach , according to Clifford A. Miller , a spokesman for Disney ’s company Shamrock Holdings .
Disney toiled for years in the shadow of his famous uncle and his father , Disney Studios co-founder Roy O. Disney , who ran the business side of the company for his brother .
But the quiet scion would emerge as a forceful protector of Disney traditions when he believed that the company that bore the family name was headed in the wrong direction .
“ People always underestimated Roy , ” Peter Schneider , the former president of Walt Disney Feature Animation , said recently .
“ You underestimate Roy at your peril , as many people have learned . ”
As chairman of Disney animation , Disney helped guide the studio to a new golden age of animation with an unprecedented string of artistic and box - office successes that included “ The Little Mermaid , ” “ Beauty and the Beast , ” “ Aladdin ” and “ The Lion King . ”
He was executive producer of “ Fantasia / 2000 , ” the sequel to the 1940 Disney classic , and the 2004 Oscar - nominated “ Destino , ” based on a 1945 collaboration between Walt Disney and Spanish painter Salvador Dali .
“ I really credit Roy Disney completely with the renaissance of Disney animation , beginning with ‘ Little Mermaid ’ and all the way through that great amazing series of classic Disney films , ” said John Lasseter , chief creative officer for Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios .
Nature filmmaker
Disney devoted the first 20 years of his career to working on nature films , including the Academy Award - winning True - Life Adventure features “ The Living Desert ” and “ The Vanishing Prairie . ”
His 1959 short subject “ Mysteries of the Deep ” received an Oscar nomination .
After the death of Walt in 1966 and Roy ’s father in 1971 , the younger Disney was spurned in his efforts to take a larger role with the company .
He finally quit in 1977 , but remained on its board as a director , where he was largely a figurehead .
Adrift , Disney hooked up with lawyer Stanley Gold and became a successful financier , investing in a variety of businesses that included broadcasting , soybeans and Israeli industrial concerns through Shamrock Holdings , a company named for one of Disney ’s racing sloops .
He served as chairman of the company , which has approximately $ 2 billion under management .
During the 1980s , Gold , Disney and Shamrock became one of the better - known corporate raiders , making unsuccessful hostile takeover bids for companies such as Polaroid Corp. and the Wherehouse Entertainment chain of music stores .
Its takeover of Central Soya , a soybean processor in Fort Wayne , Ind. , would yield a sizable $ 170 - million profit for Shamrock and its partners with its subsequent sale to an Italian agricultural concern .
Through investments ,
Gold sought to free Disney of his financial dependence on the Disney company stock he inherited .
Most were successful , although Shamrock stumbled on some , particularly a money - losing investment in sneaker maker L.A. Gear .
By 1984 , Disney had grown increasingly frustrated with the Walt Disney Co. , which he likened to a real estate company that happened to be in the movie business .
The company had let its feature animation film business , once the cornerstone of the company , deteriorate .
The company , Disney would later say , had lost its creative drive .
“ I said to him , ‘ Roy , I think you ’ve reached a point where you need to get all the way in or all the way out , ’ ” Gold said .
“ He said , ‘ What does that mean ? ’
I said , ‘ You either need to sell your shares in Disney and go independent , or you need to put up a fight and get rid of the managers and find real managers for this business . ’ ”
With his financial independence established from his investments , Disney pondered with Gold and a handful of other advisors what , if anything , they could do .
Finally , a decision was made to try to unseat the company ’s management , made awkward by the fact that Walt ’s son - in - law , Ron Miller , was chief executive .
Disney abruptly quit the company board in 1984 , sending a signal to investors and Wall Street that something was amiss .
The turmoil Disney ignited eventually swept the old management group from the corporate suites .
In the end , Disney , with an alliance formed with the billionaire Bass family of Texas , returned to the board and forced out the studio management , paving the way for the hiring of a new team led by Michael Eisner , Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg .
Upon taking over as chief executive , Eisner asked Disney what he wanted to do .
Disney responded that he wanted to revive the company ’s sagging animation division , where morale was rock - bottom as the company was releasing one of its worst - reviewed films , “ The Black Cauldron . ” Eisner granted Disney his wish .
Disney persuaded the new regime to invest about $ 10 million in a digital ink and paint system developed by Pixar , a seemingly minor decision that proved to be a turning point in the company ’s fortunes .
It would lay the foundation of Disney ’s relationship with the firm that pioneered computer - generated animation .
Within a few years , Disney turned out a remarkable string of animated hits .
The films won critical acclaim and proved wildly lucrative as well , with money pouring into the company not only from the box office , but from the sales of T - shirts , toys and home videos .
“ He was happy to sit in a room with a beer and a hot dog and talk about story ideas with us .
He was that kind of guy , ” said longtime Disney animation producer Don Hahn , who directed the new documentary “ Waking Sleeping Beauty . ”
“ He would walk through the halls , unannounced , and drop by and say hello .
That kind of involvement was not only empowering but encouraging to us .
. . .
That gave us tremendous confidence , when we were making movies like ‘ The Black Cauldron , ’ that we could reinvent ourselves . ”
Disney ’s pet project , a new version of “ Fantasia , ” was released in 2000 , initially in big - screen IMAX form .
Like the original , “ Fantasia / 2000 " blended animation inspired largely by classical music .
Included were segments set to Gershwin ’s “ Rhapsody in Blue ” and Ottorino Respighi ’s “ Pines of Rome . ”
Disney also included “ The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice , ” the cornerstone of Walt Disney ’s original , in the new version .
At the same time , relations between Disney and Eisner had grown increasingly strained , with the two men communicating mostly by phone and through e-mail .
Tensions had been building since the 1994 death of the company ’s president and chief operating officer , Frank Wells , which left Eisner solely in control of the company .
Disney complained to confidants that he was being marginalized by the man he had helped install as chief executive .
By November 2003 , Disney learned that the board ’s four - member nominating committee was planning to leave his name off the slate of directors scheduled to be elected at the company ’s next annual meeting .
The longtime animation chief discovered he had been shut out of a Thanksgiving week screening of ideas for new animated films .
The company had been in a prolonged financial slump , with its earnings flat and its stock performance anemic , but the snub was the last straw .
Disney and Gold , his business partner , abruptly quit the board of directors in December 2003 and called for Eisner ’s resignation .
In a stinging rebuke , Disney said that Eisner ’s leadership had led to the perception of the company as “ rapacious , soul - less and always looking for the ‘ quick buck ’ rather than long - term value . ”
Although the company ’s problems were well - known , Disney ’s public statement exposed the severity of his personal and professional rift with Eisner .
A month later , Disney called on shareholders to cast a vote of no confidence in the top executive .
Their efforts rallied a stunning 45 % no -confidence vote for Eisner at the company ’s 2004 annual meeting in Philadelphia , prompting Disney directors to remove Eisner as board chairman .
Five months later , Eisner said he would retire when his contract expired in September 2006 .
Disney did not relish the fight .
In an interview with Fortune magazine , he described how he had summoned his four children to a family meeting where they sat together , holding hands , and agreed he should challenge Eisner .
“ His identity is more wrapped up in this company than you can imagine , ” daughter Abigail E. Disney told the magazine in 2004 .
Disney and Gold continued their fight with the Disney board with a May 2005 lawsuit that challenged as “ a sham ” the search process that resulted in the appointment of Eisner ’s hand - picked successor as the company ’s new chief executive , Robert A. Iger .
The new chief executive quickly made peace with Disney , offered him an office at the company ’s Burbank studios , a consultancy and the title “ director emeritus . ”
Disney and Gold withdrew their lawsuit challenging Iger ’s selection .
Born Jan. 10 , 1930 , in Los Angeles , Disney was the only child of Roy O. and Edna Disney .
Growing up around the studio , Disney was exposed to both the joys of the Walt Disney aura as well as its darker side .
In a 1999 Times interview , Disney recalled how his uncle came to see him when he had the chicken pox as a boy , enthralling him with a story he wanted to make into a film about a wooden puppet named “ Pinocchio . ”
“ He scared me to death with the stuff about the whale and everything else , ” Disney recalled .
“ I remember it very , very sharply and very clearly .
But when the movie came out , it was a big letdown for me .
It was nowhere near as good as Walt ’s version . ”
Yet his uncle and father fought bitterly at times , and for a while were n’t on speaking terms , communicating only through memos .
In the 1999 interview , Disney recalled listening to the sounds of his father pulling into the driveway at night , trying to pick up on the subtle signs of whether it had been a good or a bad day with Walt .
When the car door slammed , “ you knew it was time to go do your homework , ” he recalled .
Eventually ,
Walt wrote his brother a touching letter to make up .
He also gave him a peace pipe , which Roy E. displayed in his office after his father died .
After graduating from Pomona College , Disney initially spurned working for the studio , taking a job as a film editor on the television police series “ Dragnet . ”
When he was laid off from that job , his father arranged a job at the company .
In 1955 , he married Patty Dailey , sister of boyhood friend Peter Dailey .
The couple had two sons and two daughters .
They divorced in 2007 , after 52 years of marriage .
He married the former Leslie DeMeuse in 2008 .
Despite wealth estimated at $ 600 million , Disney remained shy and outwardly unpretentious , according to people who knew him .
His main indulgences were a castle in Ireland , a jet , sports cars and financing a passion for sailboat racing .
In 1999 , Disney fulfilled a lifelong dream when he and the 12 - member crew of his 74 - foot sloop Pyewacket -- named for the witch ’s cat in the 1958 film “ Bell , Book & Candle ” -- won the 2,225 - mile Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu , setting a course record .
A heavy smoker of unfiltered Lucky Strikes for much of his life , Disney quit the habit in his mid-60s after his first wife , Patty , was ordered by doctors to quit .
Over the years he gave relatively few interviews , and only later in life began to feel comfortable making the kind of public appearances required of him for the company .
As a vice chairman of the studio ’s board of directors , Disney would frequently appear at theme parks or help promote the company ’s animated films .
With his oval face , sloping nose , protruding ears and mustache , Disney resembled his uncle to the point where people in public would frequently approach him to ask if he was Walt ’s brother .
Disney ’s shyness belied a toughness that could surface when needed .
He frequently wrote pointed memos about such things as animation projects , never hesitating to spell out what parts of a film he did n’t like .
And he butted heads with former Disney Studios Chief Jeffrey Katzenberg , who Disney felt took too much credit for the studio ’s animated hits .
Philanthropist
Among his philanthropic activities , Disney served on the board of trustees of California Institute of the Arts in Valencia , where he helped carry out the dream of Walt and his father to build and sustain a top arts college in Southern California .
He was a major donor for the construction of REDCAT , the college ’s experimental theater named for his parents that adjoins Disney Concert Hall .
He also was chairman emeritus of the board of directors of the Peregrine Fund , which reflected his efforts to save the bird of prey that was the subject of his 1968 documentary , “ Varda , the Peregrine Falcon . ”
In addition to his wife , Leslie , and daughter Abigail , Disney is survived by another daughter , Susan M. Disney Lord ; his sons , Roy P. Disney and Timothy J. Disney ; and 16 grandchildren .
Funeral services will be private , followed by cremation .
His ashes will be scattered at sea .
Instead of flowers , donations can be made in his name to the California International Sailing Assn. to benefit youth sailing .

In the basement of my mansion , along with the garbage room , the bicycle sheds and the car parks , there are also 2 floors of trunk rooms .
The storage space here is for residents who ca n’t fit everything inside their rooms upstairs .
The floor space inside the trunk rooms is quite limited , but its great to have somewhere to throw the empty suitcases , seasonal clothing etc .
The whole place is air conditioned and each room has its own individual light .
It ’s actually very well organised for a basement facility in a mansion .
Do you have trunk rooms in your part of the world ?
Are they bigger than this ?

( CNN ) --
The death of Tom Sparks , a 33 - year - old former TV host from California who was participating as a third - season contestant on ABC 's reality show " Wipeout , " likely was caused by a pre-existing condition , but the Los Angeles County coroner 's office is still examining all possibilities .
Sparks died on November 5 of an apparent stroke that his doctors believe was triggered by a pre-existing disease that causes unnatural blood clotting , according to a statement his father released to the Idaho Mountain Express .
Sparks previously had worked in radio in Idaho , according to his résumé .
An autopsy was conducted on November 8 , but test results are still pending .
" There 's nothing we can confirm until we look at everything , " the coroner 's office told CNN .
" We do n't want to jump to any conclusions yet . "
A source close to the production company that produces " Wipeout " for ABC said that Sparks began to complain of knee pain while running through the first part of an obstacle course challenge during taping on October 19 .
Although Sparks was in good spirits , the spokesperson said , producers pulled him from the course .
Medics realized he was also experiencing shortness of breath and sent Sparks to a hospital close to " Wipeout 's " set .
Between the day of taping and November 5 , Sparks was transferred to Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles , California .
The Endemol spokesperson said the company requires all participants to undergo a full physical screening , but it 's highly unlikely that Sparks ' disease -- antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , or APS -- could have been detected , and Sparks did not list it as a pre-existing condition .
" We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family , " ABC and Endemol said in a joint statement .
" This is a tragic loss and our thoughts are with them at this time . "
Sparks was survived by his wife , Kate , according to the Idaho Mountain Express .
The couple would have celebrated their two - month wedding anniversary on November 6 .
I am well aware of the tendency for police officers to stop and question photographers under Section 44 legislation – it happened to me .
It was about three days before Barack Obama 's first visit to Britain and I was on a journalistic assignment in Regent 's Park , taking pictures of where he would be staying .
I had quite a lot of professional photography equipment with me yet I was stopped and questioned by police officers who wanted to know what I was doing and why I was there .
When they had finished speaking with me they gave me a form with my details .
I understand they were simply doing their job , but they were very much targeting me as a likely and potential criminal .
There was a lot of resentment towards the police in the 1980s , around the time of the Brixton riots , when the police were deemed to be targeting black people .
They seemed to think that all black people were criminals .
Nowadays it seems to be the same kind of label they apply to photographers and people with cameras .

The police are using a piece of specific acts or pieces of legislation designed to deal with a specific threat and are generalising it to the extent that all photographers are feeling criminalised .
What we require is intelligent policing .
Clearly the police need powers to deal with the threat of terrorism and I would never dream of suggesting they get rid of legislation which is designed to protect the public and save lives .
But officers need to use their power sensibly .
They need to ask themselves what could someone taking a harmless picture of a Christmas tree or a tourist attraction possibly be doing that would endanger the state ?
I travel to America quite a lot and I have also been stopped there two or three times for taking pictures outside courtrooms and baseball stadiums .
The police in the US are quite aggressive towards photographers and hassle them .
In this country we have always had quite gentle policing , policing by consent .
It is a basic principle and it has brought the police respect .
Obviously we want to keep that , but policies like this endanger the mutual respect between police and the public .
People can say that if they are doing nothing wrong then photographers should not have a problem with being stopped and questioned , but it is an intrusion into civil liberties .
It is like the police suddenly deciding that , because they know some people are liable to drink and drive , they are going to stop every car in London .
It would n't work and neither does stopping every photographer .
We need to strike a balance which reduces the threat , but also ensures a continuing climate of respect between the law - abiding public and the police .

WASHINGTON -- Underdogs trying to ride a wave of anti-establishment fervor are mounting challenges to the Republican Party 's hand - picked Senate candidates in several states .
The trend suggests that conservative surges in a New York House race and a Senate primary in Florida were not isolated incidents and pose a dilemma for the GOP .
Party leaders have stopped endorsing candidates , and in some cases establishment candidates have shifted to the right .
Challengers are seizing on the fact that their rivals were recruited by the National Republican Senatorial Committee , the party organization that finds and vets candidates .
They are presenting such links as evidence of coziness with party leaders unpopular with conservatives for supporting Wall Street bailouts and other spending programs .
In Kentucky , Rand Paul , the son of 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul , is ahead in fund raising .
He is competing with a candidate backed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , also of Kentucky .
The candidate , Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson , has now taken to criticizing some of Mr. McConnell 's views .
Two other NRSC recruits , former Rep. Rob Simmons of Connecticut and Rep. Mark Kirk of Illinois , have recently renounced past support for cap - and - trade legislation aimed at addressing climate change , as they reintroduce themselves as fiscal conservatives .
100 + Beautiful Examples of Black and White Photography
All photography was originally monochrome , most of these photographs were black - and - white .
Most forms of visual technology start out in black and white , then slowly evolve into color as technology progresses .
Even after color film was readily available , black - and - white photography continued to dominate for decades , due to its lower cost and its “ classic ” photographic look .
There are many ways to attack photography and some are much more expensive than others .
Here in this showcase , we presenting a Stunning collection of Black and White Photography and Pictures taken by various artists in which all pictures are linked to the author ’s pages .
You may want to explore further works of the photographers we ’ve featured below .
For those who do n’t know what is “ Black and White ” in terms of Photography then , In early time photography was black - and - white or shades of sepia .
Color photography was originally rare and expensive , and again often less than true to life .
Color photography became more common in the middle of the 20th century , and has become even more common since .
Black - and - white remains a niche market for photographers who use the medium for artistic purposes .
This can take the form of black and white film or digital conversion to grayscale , with optional image manipulation to enhance the results .
For amateur use , certain companies such as Kodak manufacture black - and - white disposable cameras .
Also , certain films are produced today which give black and white images using the ubiquitous C41 color process .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. researchers have discovered antiviral proteins in cells that naturally fight off influenza infections , a finding that may lead to better ways to make vaccines and protect people against the flu .
A scientist works on developing the H1N1 ( Influenza A ) vaccine inside a Bio-safety Level 3 ( BSL - 3 ) lab at Sillapakorn University on the outskirts of Bangkok July 12 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chaiwat Subprasom
They said a family of genes act as cell sentries that guard cells from an invading influenza virus , the team reported on Thursday in the journal Cell .
“ This prevents the virus from even getting into the cell , ” said Stephen Elledge of Harvard Medical School and a Howard Hughes Investigator at Brigham & Women ’s Hospital .
“ It is out there fighting the flu all of the time , ” Elledge said in a telephone interview .
Elledge and colleagues used a new research technique called RNA interference in which they systematically turned off individual genes and then exposed cells to the flu virus .
Using this method , they discovered a small family of flu - fighting proteins called interferon - indicible transmembrane proteins that boost the body ’s natural resistance to viral infection .
“ If you get rid of it ( the protein ) , the virus can replicate 5 to 10 times faster .
What that means is your cells have a mechanism that can block 80 to 90 percent of the virus that gets in , ” Elledge said .
They also showed that if they make the cell overproduce the protein , they become more resistant to the flu .
“ If you crank it up , it really shuts down the flu , ” he said .
The team showed that a specific protein in the family -- IFITM3 -- protected against several viruses , including strains of influenza A now found in seasonal flu , the West Nile virus and dengue virus .
The proteins did not offer any protection against HIV or the hepatitis C virus , but lab tests suggested they may defend against other viruses , including yellow fever virus .
The team showed that if the virus evades this first - line protein defense and makes it inside the cell , this activates an alarm system called the interferon immune response that gets pumped out of cells and alerts the rest of the body to make more of the natural antiviral proteins .
The findings offer new insights into the body ’s natural defenses against influenza and other viruses , Elledge said .
“ We really did not know how our bodies were stopping the flu . ”
They also may lead to better ways to protect people from influenza and other viral infections .
“ By making this protein be expressed in poultry or pigs , we can make them resistant to the flu .
That can help protect people by protecting animals from the flu , ” he said .
It also may lead to more reliable vaccine production by creating a more friendly environment for the virus to grow in chicken eggs , he said .
“ If we take our gene away from the cells in which the virus is growing , it will grow much faster .
You can actually produce vaccines much faster , ” he said .

Practice makes perfect .
But imaginary practice ?
Elisa Tartaglia of the Laboratory of Psychophysics at Switzerland 's Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) and team show that perceptual learning -- learning by repeated exposure to a stimulus -- can occur by mental imagery as much as by the real thing .
The results , published in Current Biology , suggest that thinking about something over and over again could actually be as good as doing it .
" When trained , radiologists are able to detect anomalies on medical images which are extremely hard to detect for untrained people , " Tartaglia says .
" The results of our study would predict that mental imagery training , hence , repeatedly mentally visualizing the anomalies that one wants to detect , would be sufficient to become able to detect them . "
In a series of experiments , the scientists asked some participants to practice identifying which line , the right or the left in a series of parallel lines , a central line was closest to and to identify it by pushing the correct button .
In follow - up , " post - training " exercises , these participants improved their baseline performance significantly .
But so did another set of volunteers who , instead of practicing with all three lines in training , were instead asked to imagine the bisecting line 's proximity based on an audio tone .
This group also improved their performance significantly in further testing , meaning that " imagery training " was sufficient for perceptual learning .
Some experts question the relevance of mental imagery in this kind of learning , which is generally assumed to be driven by stimulus processing -- synapses firing in response to a physical cue .
Here , the researchers show that perceptual learning can also occur by mental imagery , i.e. , in the absence of physical stimulation .
The results help shine a light on what has been an ongoing puzzle in the field and suggest an overlap in how -- and possibly where -- mental imagery affects perceptual learning .

MUMBAI : Yadnyesh Narkar and his friends , who often dine at various restaurants in Matunga and Dadar , recently witnessed a new campaign ; there were notices pasted on restaurant walls explaining why the rates of delicacies had gone up .
Customers were warned against wastage of dal , vegetables , water and power as they were very “ expensive ’ ’ .
This campaign is not confined to Dadar and Matunga restaurants .
Lakhs of Mumbaikars will soon face such a campaign in around 7,000 restaurants across the city and other urban pockets in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region ( MMR ) .
Ahar , the biggest association of restaurant and hotel owners in MMR , has decided to hike the price of various dishes by 25 - 30 % due to the rise in prices of vegetables and food grains .
Narayana Alva , president of Ahar , said due to the steep hike in prices of cooking gas cylinders , vegetables , pulses , and water and power , the association has decided to make the masses aware by putting up posters inside dining rooms .
“ An Udipi restaurant in Matunga has warned customers that they would be fined Rs 5 if they wasted the dal as tur dal prices are soaring , ’’ said Narkar .
“ Over 40 % Mumbaikars eat in our 7,000 restaurants every day .
We are going to inform our customers as to why our dishes have become pricy and how they can help get the rates down by cooperating with the restaurant owners , ’’ said Ahar ’s former president Chandrahas Shetty .
Alva said the rates of vegetables and pulses had increased by almost 40 % over the past three months .
However , he said if the prices come down , Ahar will bring down the rates .
According to Shetty , soon a delegation of Ahar will call on CM Ashok Chavan to apprise him of the shortage of water and power and hike in prices of fuel and food items .

Back when we launched the Propaganda contest , we originally figured it'd be a cakewalk to judge .
You might not know this , as it's a well - kept industry secret , but normally with giveaway tie - in contests for video games , you get about 10 entries .
Seven of these are virulently racist .
The other two are pornography .
The last one , regardless of its quality , wins by default .
However , the recession must be a lot worse than we thought , because apparently all of you are unemployed and have nothing better to do than spend real hours drawing incredibly time - consuming art for virtual prizes .
No joke : as of contest 's end last night , we have in excess of 11,000 entries and almost every one of them deserves to be framed on the wall of one of Gabe Newell 's castles .
In fact , while we 've managed to wade through your mountain of entries carefully enough to select a first , second and third place winner below , we 're nowhere near through categorizing our many favorites , and we 've got plenty more prizes to give away .
So just because you do n't see your entry below , do n't assume you have n't won anything .
( Still , with 11,000 entries , do n't bet against it , either . )
FIRST PRIZE
Customized In - Game Item
50,000 War Points to Soldier
" GIVE 'EM THE BOOT " by J. Axer 's Dapper Topper
With some entries , we loved the art but did n't care for the slogan .
Others had an awesome look , but did n't capture the spirit of a propaganda poster .
Still others had a killer propaganda slogan , but not a heck of a lot else .
" Give ' Em the Boot Right in the Fruit , " on the other hand , is a triple threat :
It 's funny , it looks great , and it makes us want to kick a Demoman in an extremely precise area ( that the bean counters wo n't let us mention because they 're all such huge extremely precise areas ) .
SECOND PRIZE
Slightly Less Impressive Customized In - Game Item
25,000 War Points to Demoman
" THAT BLUE DEVIL " by Amber 's Rad As All Hell Item
We liked this one because it looked like art and made us feel smarter every time we saw it .
It says something profound about evil .
It exists , and it 's bad .
Hold on , we need some back - up here .
Let 's get Jeremy Bennett in here to explain why we like it : " I appreciate the strong composition , coupled with the limited Prussian blue palette , accented by the spot red .
It 's reserved , yet sophisticated a first - rate homage to period propaganda . "
We agree .
THIRD PRIZE
Less -Impressive - Than - the - First - Two Customized In - Game Item
10,000 War Points to Soldier
" DO THE RIGHT THING " by John Freeman
The majority of the entries we received were pretty lighthearted , and that 's what we liked about them .
This one we liked for the opposite reason : it is n't funny .
It 's just legitimately bad - ass .
We do n't need any artists to tell us what 's great about this one .
Look at that guyhe just killed twelve dudes .
With a shovel .
We did n't think there was any way to make that not funny , but John Freeman somehow did it , and for that he gets third prize .
The in - game prizes these lucky winners will receive are being custom - designed for them as we type .
We 'll be sure to release images of them soon .
And do n't forget there 'll be more winners ( and more prizes ) after the update .
Dear EarthTalk : I do n’t understand why many people oppose wind power just because they have to look at the turbines .
If you ask me , wind turbines are much nicer - looking than coal - fired , waste - to - energy or nuclear power plants .
— Michael Hart , via e-mail
Whether it ’s a wind farm , a coal - fired power plant , a nuclear reactor or even just a big box store , there are always going to be locals opposed to it , declaring “ not in my back yard ! ” ( NIMBY ) .
As to the attractiveness of wind farms , people do seem to come down on one side or the other rather vehemently .
Those in favor of wind development have been known to extol the visual virtues of a horizon full of windmills not only for the turbines ’ graceful sculptural lines but also for the fact that their very presence advertises the coming of a modern , almost futuristic age of clean , renewable energy .
Writing in the online magazine Contemporary Aesthetics , Yuriko Saito waxes eloquent about the visual appeal of wind farms when created thoughtfully .
“ [ I ]t is possible to create an aesthetically pleasing effect by choosing the color , shape and height of the turbines appropriate …to the particular landscape , making them uniform in their appearance and movement , and …arranging them in proportion to the landscape , ” he says .
“ One writer admires the windmills in Sweden as ‘ graceful objects ’ because ‘ the slender airfoils seem both delicate and powerful … while their gentle motion imparts a living kinetic nature ’ . ”
On the flip side , detractors begrudge wind turbines for destroying their views — a classic NIMBY stance .
According to Saito , opposition to wind farms stems from their being sited on previously “ open , unhindered lands ” and as such “ are viewed as machines intruding in a garden . ”
He adds : “ [ T ] hey are almost invariably decried as ‘ marring ’ , ‘ spoiling ’ , ‘ ruining ’ , and ‘ intruding on ’ the otherwise relatively natural landscape , such as desert , open field , mountainside , and …ocean , and for creating an ‘ eyesore ’ . ”
Respondents to a survey by the British magazine Country Life listed wind turbines as the most egregious type of architectural blemish across England .
They disliked wind farms even more than other “ eyesores ” — such as highway service areas , conventional power stations and ugly office buildings — because of the size of the turbines , some of which are 300 feet tall , and their intrusion on the landscape .
Opponents of a proposed wind farm in the waters of Massachusetts ’ Nantucket Sound cite similar gripes .
The builder , Cape Wind Associates , has campaigned for seven years for approval of the development , to be located 16 miles off the shore of Nantucket Island .
Homeowners , politicians and some evidently conflicted environmentalists have mounted stiff opposition to the facility , which would appear from shore as distant white smears on the horizon .
The decision rests with the U.S. Interior Department which , despite stated desires to expand offshore wind energy , is taking its time on the highly contentious matter .
But with wind now the hottest renewable energy source going , those opposed to seeing windmills better get used to it .
In 2008 wind power provided 1.5 percent of global electricity — having doubled its output every year now for five years in a row — and should account for as much as eight percent by 2018 .

In New York , Beck sold 17 tickets .
In Boston , another 17 .
And in Washington , D.C. , the hotbed of political activism , his tearful film drew only 30 , Raw Story has found .
Glenn Beck ’s new movie The Christmas Sweater – A Return To Redemption — released for a viewing Thursday night in hundreds of theaters across the country .
While it performed better in the south and in rural , more conservative areas , his ability to draw viewers in major US markets was a bust .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The theater ’s almost empty , ” a representative at Regal Cinemas in Manhattan told Raw Story moments before it began .
The flick features the firebrand Fox News host sharing with willing souls his most profound childhood memories , along with his philosophies on life , love and happiness .
“ It is the story of faith , tragedy , redemption and hope , ” Beck says in the trailer .
( Reporter ’s caution : he cries in it . )
By the time of its 8:00 pm EST airing Thursday , it hardly sold any tickets in the three aforementioned metropolitan cities , cinema staffers told Raw Story .
But Beck ’s home crowd was less apathetic .
ADVERTISEMENT
The viewing in Lynnwood , WA — the closest one to Beck ’s Mount Vernon hometown — sold out several hours before the show began .
Ten miles south , 70 out of 415 seats had been snagged in Seattle , a better turnout than other cities .
All attendees were charged $ 20 — a figure that Beck surely hoped was affordable for the “ little guy , ” who he often claims to stand up for .
Unsurprisingly , the movie appears to have performed better in rural , conservative areas .
Shortly before it began , the show in the small town of Rockwall , TX had 94 ticket - buyers out of a possible 193 .
One - hundred seventy seats were taken in the suburban West Jordan , UT .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The tale ’s message of redemption literally changed people ’s lives , bringing many back from the brink of collapse and restoring family relationships , ” read the description of Beck ’s similarly titled book , upon which the movie is based .
In the film , Beck talks about the inspiration for his 2008 memoir , explains the “ overwhelming response ” he received from fans , and introduces watchers to some formerly troubled souls who say it touched and changed their lives forever .
ADVERTISEMENT
To the pleasure of his most die - hard fans , he even reads from it .
The movie runs 2 hours and 15 minutes , and a full repeat of Thursday ’s agenda will be offered one week from the showing .
Every month the number on food stamps increases .
Food stamp usage is now up to a record 36 million .
Please consider Food Stamp Use Soars , and Stigma Fades
With food stamp use at record highs and climbing every month , a program once scorned as a failed welfare scheme now helps feed one in eight Americans and one in four children .
While the numbers have soared during the recession , the path was cleared in better times when the Bush administration led a campaign to erase the program ’s stigma , calling food stamps “ nutritional aid ” instead of welfare , and made it easier to apply .
There are 239 counties in the United States where at least a quarter of the population receives food stamps , according to an analysis of local data collected by The New York Times .
The counties are as big as the Bronx and Philadelphia and as small as Owsley County in Kentucky , a patch of Appalachian distress where half of the 4,600 residents receive food stamps .
In more than 750 counties , the program helps feed one in three blacks .
In more than 800 counties , it helps feed one in three children .
In the Mississippi River cities of St. Louis , Memphis and New Orleans , half of the children or more receive food stamps .
Even in Peoria , Ill . — Everytown , U.S.A. — nearly 40 percent of children receive aid .
Although the program is growing at a record rate , the federal official who oversees it would like it to grow even faster .
“ I think the response of the program has been tremendous , ” said Kevin Concannon , an under secretary of agriculture , “ but we ’re mindful that there are another 15 , 16 million who could benefit . ”
“ Some people like to camouflage this by calling it a nutrition program , but it ’s really not different from cash welfare , ” said Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation , whose views have a following among conservatives on Capitol Hill .
“ Food stamps is quasi money . ”
Arguing that aid discourages work and marriage , Mr. Rector said food stamps should contain work requirements as strict as those placed on cash assistance .
“ The food stamp program is a fossil that repeats all the errors of the war on poverty , ” he said .
Use among children is especially high .
A third of the children in Louisiana , Missouri and Tennessee receive food aid .
In the Bronx , the rate is 46 percent .
In East Carroll Parish , La. , three - quarters of the children receive food stamps .
A recent study by Mark R. Rank , a professor at Washington University in St. Louis , startled some policy makers in finding that half of Americans receive food stamps , at least briefly , by the time they turn 20 .
Among black children , the figure was 90 percent .
Food Stamp Usage
Unemployment Claims Tick Higher
In the week ending Dec. 5 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 474,000 , an increase of 17,000 from the previous week 's unrevised figure of 457,000 .
The 4 - week moving average was 473,750 , a decrease of 7,750 from the previous week 's revised average of 481,500 .
4 - Week Moving Average of Initial Claims
Dozens of American soldiers have died in Afghanistan this year
At least 14 Americans have been killed in a series of air crashes in Afghanistan , military officials say .
Four US soldiers died and two were hurt when two helicopters collided mid-air in the south , Nato - led forces said .
In a separate helicopter crash , in western Badghis province , seven US soldiers and three US civilians died .
The US said hostile fire was not believed to be to blame for either incident , but the Taliban said it was behind the Badghis crash .
Taliban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmedi told the AFP news agency that militants had shot down the US helicopter in the Darabam district of the province .
Drugs operation Another 12 Americans and 14 Afghans were also reported to have been injured in that crash .
Col Wayne Shanks , a spokesman for the Nato - led force in Afghanistan , said the authorities were still investigating the incident in Badghis , but " do not believe that enemy action was responsible " .
He said the crash happened as troops were leaving an area where they had carried out an anti-drugs trafficking operation and killed 14 " enemy fighters " .
" After they were flying away , that 's when the crash actually happened , " he said .
" We did go ... and remove an insurgent who was working with the drug trade in that particular area . "
The three dead civilians worked for the US Drug Enforcement Administration , news agencies reported .
The deaths were the first for the DEA in Afghanistan since it began operations there in 2005 , Associated Press reported .
Bad year for troops
The exact location of the crash in the south of the country has not been confirmed by the US military .
This year has seen the highest death toll of international troops in Afghanistan since the Taliban were overthrown in 2001 .
There have been dozens of American soldiers among those killed , making up more than half the total foreign troop deaths in the country .
The worst single loss of US life in Afghanistan occurred in June 2005 , when a Chinook helicopter was shot down in eastern Kunar province , killing 16 military personnel .

Science & Exploration Pioneering images of both martian moons
11/12/2009 3839 views 1 likes
For the very first time , the martian moons Phobos and Deimos have been caught on camera together .
ESA 's Mars Express orbiter took these pioneering images last month .
Apart from their ‘ wow ’ factor , these unique images will help the HRSC team validate and refine existing orbit models of the two moons .
Phobos up close
The images were acquired with the Super Resolution Channel ( SRC ) of the High Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) .
The camera took 130 images of the moons on 5 November at 9:14 CET over period of 1.5 minutes at intervals of 1s , speeding up to 0.5 -s intervals toward the end .
The image resolution is 110 m / pixel for Phobos and 240 m / pixel for Deimos — Deimos was more than twice as far from the camera .
The Super Resolution Channel of the HRSC uses an additional lens , which has a very narrow field of view of just 0.5° , providing four times the resolution of the HRSC colour stereo channel .
Raw and processed images Phobos , the larger of the two moons , orbits closer to the Red Planet , circling it every 7 hours and 39 minutes .
It travels faster relative to Mars than the Moon relative to Earth .
It was 11 800 km from Mars Express when the images were taken .
Deimos was 26 200 km away .
It is not often that both martian moons are located directly in front of the camera , lined up one behind the other .
The chance to image both moons together came on 5 November 2009 when the viewing geometry was especially favourable .
The plan to image both moons at once was years in the making and was made possible by the unique elliptical orbit of Mars Express , precise knowledge of the orbits of the planet , the moons and the spacecraft , as well as fortuitous viewing geometry , and perfect planning by the ESA and HRSC teams .
Exploration of Phobos : a scientific priority for Mars Express Exposure geometry
In addition to producing high - resolution maps of the surface of Mars in colour and in 3D , the exploration of Phobos is a scientific priority for the HRSC team .
The potato - shaped , 27 × 22 × 18 km moon has already been photographed 127 times by the HRSC , improving our knowledge of the topography of the moon , and providing insight into its origins and development .

Israel resembles a failed state Ali Abunimah Solidarity will tear down the walls imprisoning Palestinians .
( Oren Ziv/ Activestills )
December 27 , 2009
One year has passed since the savage Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip , but for the people there time might as well have stood still .
Since Palestinians in Gaza buried their loved ones -- more than 1,400 persons , almost 400 of them children -- there has been little healing and virtually no reconstruction .
According to international aid agencies , only 41 trucks of building supplies have been allowed into Gaza during the year .
Promises of billions made at a donors ' conference in Egypt last March attended by luminaries of the so - called " international community " and the Middle East peace process industry are unfulfilled , and the Israeli siege , supported by the US , the European Union , Arab states , and tacitly by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in Ramallah , continues .
Amid the endless , horrifying statistics a few stand out : of Gaza 's 640 schools , 18 were completely destroyed and 280 damaged in Israeli attacks .
Two - hundred - and - fifty students and 15 teachers were killed .
Of 122 health facilities assessed by the World Health Organization , 48 percent were damaged or destroyed .
Ninety percent of households in Gaza still experience power cuts for four to eight hours per day due to Israeli attacks on the power grid and degradation caused by the blockade .
Forty - six percent of Gaza 's once productive agricultural land is out of use due to Israeli damage to farms and Israeli - declared free fire zones .
Gaza 's exports of more than 130,000 tons per year of tomatoes , flowers , strawberries and other fruit have fallen to zero .
That " much of Gaza still lies in ruins , " a coalition of international aid agencies stated recently , " is not an accident ; it is a matter of policy . "
This policy has been clear all along and it has nothing to do with Israeli " security . "
From 19 June 2008 , to 4 November 2008 , calm prevailed between Israel and Gaza , as Hamas adhered strictly -- as even Israel has acknowledged -- to a negotiated ceasefire .
That ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched a surprise attack on Gaza killing six persons , after which Hamas and other resistance factions retaliated .
Even so , Palestinian factions were still willing to renew the ceasefire , but it was Israel that refused , choosing instead to launch a premeditated , systematic attack on the foundations of civilized life in the Gaza Strip .
Operation Cast Lead , as Israel dubbed it , was an attempt to destroy once and for all Palestinian resistance in general , and Hamas in particular , which had won the 2006 election and survived the blockade and numerous US - sponsored attempts to undermine and overthrow it in cooperation with US - backed Palestinian militias .
Like the murderous sanctions on Iraq throughout the 1990s , the blockade of Gaza was calculated to deprive civilians of basic necessities , rights and dignity in the hope that their suffering might force their leadership to surrender or collapse .
In many respects things may seem more dire than a year ago .
Barack Obama , the US president , whom many hoped would change the vicious anti-Palestinian policies of his predecessor , George W. Bush , has instead entrenched them as even the pretense of a serious peace effort has vanished .
According to media reports , the US Army Corps of Engineers is assisting Egypt in building an underground wall on its border with Gaza to block the tunnels which act as a lifeline for the besieged territory ( resources and efforts that ought to go into rebuilding still hurricane - devastated New Orleans ) , and American weapons continue to flow to West Bank militias engaged in a US - and Israeli - sponsored civil war against Hamas and anyone else who might resist Israeli occupation and colonization .
These facts are inescapable and bleak .
However , to focus on them alone would be to miss a much more dynamic situation that suggests Israel 's power and impunity are not as invulnerable as they appear from this snapshot .
A year after Israel 's attack and after more than two - and - a - half years of blockade , the Palestinian people in Gaza have not surrendered .
Instead they have offered the world lessons in steadfastness and dignity , even at an appalling , unimaginable cost .
It is true that the European Union leaders who came to occupied Jerusalem last January to publicly embrace Ehud Olmert , the then Israeli prime minister -- while white phosphorus seared the flesh of Gazan children and bodies lay under the rubble -- still cower before their respective Israel lobbies , as do American and Canadian politicians .
But the shift in public opinion is palpable as Israel 's own actions transform it into a pariah whose driving forces are not the liberal democratic values with which it claims to identify , but ultra-nationalism , racism , religious fanaticism , settler - colonialism and a Jewish supremacist order maintained by frequent massacres .
The universalist cause of justice and liberation for Palestinians is gaining adherents and momentum especially among the young .
I witnessed it , for example , among Malaysian students I met at a Palestine solidarity conference held by the Union of NGOs of The Islamic World in Istanbul last May , and again in November as hundreds of student organizers from across the US and Canada converged to plan their participation in the global Palestinian - led campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions modeled on the successful struggle against South African apartheid in the 1980s .
This week , thousands of people from dozens of countries are attempting to reach Gaza to break the siege and march alongside Palestinians who have been organizing inside the territory .
Each of the individuals traveling with the Gaza Freedom March , Viva Palestina , or other delegations represents perhaps hundreds of others who could not make the journey in person , and who are marking the event with demonstrations and commemorations , visits to their elected officials and media campaigns .
Against this flowering of activism , Zionism is struggling to rejuvenate its dwindling base of support .
Multi-million dollar programs aimed at recruiting and Zionizing young American Jews are struggling to compete against organizations like the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network , which run not on money but principled commitment to human equality .
Increasingly , we see that Israel 's hasbara ( propaganda ) efforts have no positive message , offer no plausible case for maintaining a status quo of unspeakable repression and violence , and rely instead on racist demonization and dehumanization of Arabs and Muslims to justify Israel 's actions and even its very existence .
Faced with growing global recognition and support for the courageous nonviolent struggle against continued land theft in the West Bank , Israel is escalating its violence and kidnapping of leaders of the movement in Bilin and other villages ( Mohammad Othman , Jamal Juma ' and Abdallah Abu Rahmeh are among the leaders of this movement recently arrested ) .
In acting this way , Israel increasingly resembles a bankrupt failed state , not a regime confident about its legitimacy and longevity .
And despite the failed peace process industry 's efforts to ridicule , suppress and marginalize it , there is a growing debate among Palestinians and even among Israelis about a shared future in Palestine / Israel based on equality and decolonization , rather than ethno-national segregation and forced repartition .
Last , but certainly not least , in the shadow of the Goldstone report , Israeli leaders travel around the world fearing arrest for their crimes .
For now , they can rely on the impunity that high - level international complicity and their inertial power and influence still afford them .
But the question for the real international community -- made up of people and movements -- is whether we want to continue to see the still very incomplete system of international law and justice painstakingly built since the horrors of the Second World War and the Nazi holocaust dismantled and corrupted all for the sake of one rogue state .
What we have done in solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza and the rest of Palestine is not yet enough .
But our movement is growing , it can not be stopped , and we will reach our destination .
Ali Abunimah is co-founder of The Electronic Intifada and author of One Country : A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli - Palestinian Impasse .
He will be among more than 1,300 persons from 42 countries traveling to Gaza with the Gaza Freedom March this week .

OK , maybe a more polite way to say it is this : bad ideas are acting as serious constraints on policy .
We ’re in a liquidity trap , with interest rates up against the zero bound .
This means that conventional monetary policy is n’t sufficient .
What should we do ?
The first - best answer — that is , the answer that economic models , like my old Japan ’s trap analysis , suggest would be optimal — would be to credibly commit to higher inflation , so as to reduce real interest rates .
But the key thing to recognize about this answer is that it ’s all about expectations — the central bank only has traction over expected inflation to the extent that it can convince people that it will deliver that inflation after the liquidity trap is over .
So to make this policy work you have to ( i ) convince current policymakers that it ’s the right answer ( ii ) Make that argument persuasive enough that it will guide the actions of future policymakers ( iii ) Convince investors , consumers , and firms that you have in fact achieved ( i ) and ( ii ) .
In reality , we have n’t even gotten anywhere near ( i ) : the conventional wisdom is still that any rise in expected inflation above 2 percent is a bad thing , when it ’s actually good .
So some readers have asked why I ’m not making the same arguments for America now that I was making for Japan a decade ago .
The answer is that I do n’t think I ’ll get anywhere , at least not until or unless the slump goes on for a long time .
OK , so what ’s next ?
The second - best answer would be a really big fiscal expansion , sufficient to mostly close the output gap .
The economic case for doing that is really clear .
But Washington is caught up in deficit phobia , and there does n’t seem to be any chance of getting a big enough push .
That ’s why , at this point , I ’m turning to what I understand perfectly well to be a third - best solution : subsidizing jobs and promoting work - sharing .
Call it constrained optimization , where the constraint comes from the power of bad ideas .
Do people care about the climate ?
It 's an open question these days , and opinion polls offer little help .
Some show that climate ranks fairly low among public concerns , while others indicate a high level of concern among the populace .
And in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit , now a mere six weeks away , those opinions count for something , particularly in the United States , where lawmakers are looking to be swayed one way or another .
Here 's a sampling of the hodgepodge of public opinion .
• The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press last week reported that " There has been a sharp decline over the past year in the percentage of Americans who say there is solid evidence that global temperatures are rising .
And fewer also see global warming as a very serious problem -- 35 percent say that today , down from 44 percent in April 2008 . "
• The World Wide Views on Global Warming , a global opinion poll released on the same day , reported that " 90 percent of U.S. participants say it is urgent to reach a tough , new agreement at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December and not punt to subsequent meetings , " and that " 69 percent believe the price of fossil fuels should be increased . "
It 's not just Americans who seem to be schizophrenic on this topic .
Polls from Canada , Australia , Japan , Egypt -- you name it -- all seem to have conflicting results .
Much of this , of course , depends on exactly what questions were asked , and by whom : the pollsters ' agendas , when they have them , can steer answers in a certain direction .
I 'm not suggesting that Pew and the World Wide Views folks have done this .
I 'm just saying .
It 's in this context that I recently spoke with my friend Cara Pike .
Pike heads the Social Capital Project , a project spun out of the nonprofit Earthjustice , aimed at " building the base of public support for environmental protection . "
Pike -- whose meaty and insightful " Ecological Roadmap " of Americans ' environmental attitudes is the appendix of my book , Strategies for the Green Economy -- has for years been combining research tools and storytelling techniques to build some of the most important national environmental campaigns of the past decade .
Pike 's latest effort is a new report , Climate Crossroads : A Research - Based Framing Guide for Global Warming Advocates to Global Warming Advocates .
The report ( available for download from GreenBiz.com ) , is described as :
a first step towards a unified conversation on global warming .
It is a summary of what is known to date about the most effective communications approaches , developed by drawing on more than 25 advocacy organizations ' experiences in the field , the body of research they built over the years , and new research conducted specifically for this project .
This document identifies the ideas and values that will lead to public support for global warming advocates ' shared objectives over the long term , and suggests ways to bridge from specific policy concerns to the broader , shared narrative .
The idea , says Pike , is to create a " Common Message Platform " that will provide organizations with " a shared set of key points and perspectives that will lead to both more effective communications on their own particular issues , and a more engaged and constructive national conversation on the topic with sympathetic groups . "
In other words , it aims to answer the question :
How do you talk about climate change ?
Actually , that was n't stated quite right , based on Pike 's work .
Her research led her to prefer the term is " global warming " over " climate change , " not to mention " climate crisis , " " global weirding , " and any of the several other monikers that have been inflicted on this global malady .
However , Pike acknowledge , global warming " is not a perfect term for a number of reasons .
Scientifically , it 's not as accurate , for example , but it is the term that 's most familiar with the public . "
Accurate or not , it 's what people seem to respond to .
( You can listen to a podcast of our recent conversation here . )
Pike pointed out just how far we have to go in educating the public .
" What we found even in talking to people who are members of environmental organizations or who identify themselves as environmentalists is they often thought global warming had to do with the problem with ozone holes . " {related_content}
It 's that bad , folks .
She continued .
" The other thing that you find is that most people do n't really have a sense of the connection between energy , the economy , and climate .
Most people would n't be able to tell you , for example , that their energy or great majority of their energy might come from coal , for example . "
Part of the problem , she said is that the media , both the mainstream media and the niche environmental media , " has leaped ahead into this somewhat elite conversation .
But even those who are trying to follow that conversation very actively are missing some fundamental information .
So what we found is that you have to go back and fill in some of those holes . "
Another problem has to do with identifying solutions that are meaningful to people , and that they 're actually willing to do .
" I think a growing number of Americans really do want to engage and do things that will make a difference , " says Pike .
But she adds , " I think that it 's very confusing what really will make that difference and in particular , given how busy people are , how pressed they feel financially , they really want to know ' If I only have time to do a handful of things , what are the things that are really going to have the biggest payback and biggest impact on solving the problem ? '
I think there 's been a bit of a scale issue around solutions where many of the things that the public are being asked to do do n't seem to match the scale of the challenge .
How can you really solve a global complex issue by changing light bulbs ? "
Short answer :
You can't .
It 's a good question , though , and one that seems to have flummoxed marketers , public agencies , activist groups , and pretty much everyone else aiming to educate , motivate , and activate the public on global warming / climate change .
Do you scare people , inspire them , threaten them , or bribe them ?
Are people more motivated by fear or greed ?
Do they care more about the future of their children or their day - to - day quality of life ?
Do they see this looming crisis as an inevitable calamity or an empty , sky - is - falling warning ?
Is it a crisis or an opportunity ?
These all remain open questions .
I 'll let you wade through Pike 's report to find the nuggets of her research that are of greatest value to you in your work .
And I 'd love to hear your thoughts about what works , what does n't , and how best to change the conversation , and the climate for action .

The one sad thing about being a PlayStation gamer is that a few legendary franchises have never made the jump over to Sony 's platforms .
Despite having some incredible exclusive titles , it 's always painful to watch Nintendo fans throw up their arms in happiness as plumbers and space pirates rain over the long line of Nintendo consoles .

This + game +is+very+pretty .
Fortunately , From Software -- the developer of the recently released Demon 's Souls -- has designed 3D Dot Game Heroes , a game that not only celebrates the 8 - bit games of old but also recreates one of the most memorable adventure games of all time .
Without giving too much away , let 's just say the franchise in question stars with " Z " and ends in " elda . "
You can figure out the rest .
In 3D Dot Game Heroes , legend tells of an evil known as the Dark King Onyx , who brought tragedy and darkness to Dotnia Kingdom .
Fortunately , a hero rose to face the Dark King and -- with his legendary sword -- sealed Onyx away in an orb .
But as is the case with the forces of evil , darkness rose again .
The Dark Bishop Fuelle has stolen the orb and has thrown Dotnia into chaos once more .
It 's up to a new hero to rid the kingdom of its dark plague and restore peace throughout the land .
This story is told through some excellent cutscenes that are driven by classic , 8 - bit visuals ,
It all looks great , but you 'll notice that there 's a " 3D " in the title , so how can the game be visualized entirely in sprite - form ?
Good question .
The King of the land , thinking that sprites are a bit outdated , decides that the kingdom should make the jump to 3D .
With this great decree , the entire world is made 3D , but still preserves its pixelated look .
The result is one of the most visually appealing games I 've seen in a long time .
Although 3D Dot Game Heroes references a number of old adventure games ( including previous From Software titles ) , the game is a startling adaptation of the classic I hinted at above .
Players move from screen to screen , battling monsters ( or bunnies ) , exploring dungeons , collecting items and solving puzzles .
An apple meter governs the player 's health , and at full health the hero 's sword grows to tremendous sizes when swung .
Each sword in the game can be leveled up to enhance its length , girth and magical power ( snicker , snicker ) and a number of useful items can be collected .
These items include boomerangs , lanterns , candles , a bow and more .
Sound familiar ?
Controlling 3D
Dot Game Heroes is as simple as pie .
One button is used to swing your sword and rotating the left analog stick while doing so will cause the hero to swing it in a circular motion .
Another face button is assigned to item use , and a trigger can be held to bring up the hero 's shield and execute basic strafing patterns .
During my demo of 3D Dot Game Heroes , I was able to wander a few sections of the world map and explore the game 's first dungeon .
The dungeons will clearly be home to the game 's best puzzles and most challenging fights , as is the case with the game 3D Dot Game Heroes is based on .
After wandering from room to room , fighting monsters , dodging harmful traps and pushing blocks in a certain order to clear a path , I had to collect keys to reach the dungeon 's end boss .
The first dungeon featured a giant snake boss that looked incredible and capitalized on 3D Dot Game Heroes ' unique visual style .
In order to defeat the boss , I had to attack each tail section in turn as it flashed , while avoiding the snake 's speedy movements .
There are a few other details that make 3D Dot Game Heroes feel special .
Firstly , players can create their own character model with a 3D sprite editor .
I was told that a member of the Atlus team actually created a small tank that looked quite believable , so I can only imagine the possibilities .
Players can also collect monsters to be featured in an encyclopedia , complete with a full 3D model of the creature .
While this bestiary might not seem too unusual , the fun comes from how you actually collect the monster 's profile : you need to beat them over the head with the book .
Hitting the monster enough with the encyclopedia will force their profile to show up in its pages .
Classic !
To provide icing for this delicious cake , all the loading screens in the game are recreations of classic videogame box art , which are a blast to see .
It 's very obvious that the folks at From Software have a serious affinity for old - school games .
Even though 3D Dot Game Heroes is only a six - to eight - hour game , just like some of its 8 - bit predecessors , the charm and raw nostalgia involved is more than enough reason to check it out .
And because 3D Dot Game Heroes is launching at a lower price point than most disc - based retail games , there 's even more reason to consider investing your time and money .
Let 's just hope that the entire experience , from start to finish , lives up to the amazing style and retro goodness .
Following Mr Justice Burton 's ruling that green beliefs should enjoy the same protection as religious ones , many committed recyclers will have been wondering how green you have to be to become unsackable .
Would buying Duchy Originals do the trick ?
Or would you need to be sustainably crucified or burned at the stake , prior to receiving compensation ?
In recitations of his own creed , Tim Nicholson , who won the ruling allowing him to claim discrimination , sets the bar rather lower .
" I no longer travel by aeroplane , " he told an employment tribunal , by way of piety credentials .
" I have eco-renovated my home , I try to buy local produce , I compost my food waste , I encourage others to reduce their carbon emissions and I fear very much for the future of the human race , given the failure to reduce carbon emissions on a global scale . "
Do n't we all ?
Or intend to , anyway ?
Give us an eco-renovation , but not yet .
That 's religion for you , is n't it ?
We stray , occasionally , particularly where the smellier food waste is concerned .
Even St Tim , one notices , does not disclose what part , if any , the car plays in his " low carbon lifestyle " .
Or specify how cold it has to be before he turns on the central heating .
Indeed , following his court victory , the great martyr admitted that , just five years ago , he walked in darkness .
" I flew abroad on holiday and for work , drove fast cars and had no knowledge of or concern about carbon emissions . "
Not unlike St Paul , Tim then went on a journey and had an epiphany .
After a 6,000 - mile jaunt to New Zealand in a 50 - year - old Morris Oxford , the young quantity surveyor asked himself : " How could I continue to live in a way that would increase the already dangerous high levels of CO ² ? "
Not going on any more 6,000 mile car journeys was just the first step on his road to an exemplary , low carbon lifestyle in which , he reveals , he does not eat much meat .
Following his conversion , St Tim went to work for Grainger plc , which describes itself as " the UK 's largest listed residential landlord " .
On the face of it , this seems about as sensible a scheme as a campaigning feminist taking a job in a lap - dancing club .
Was the epiphany of the gradual variety or was it more of a missionary thing ?
One recalls that St Paul was specifically instructed , during his conversion , to go and preach to the contemporary of Grainger plc : the Gentiles .
Writing about his court victory , St Tim said : " I hope that in practice it will encourage people who share my beliefs to speak up about climate change in their workplace and seek practical measures to cut emissions . "
In practice , it seems likely that his achievement in getting climate change classified with the supernatural will do more planetary damage even than a 6,000 - mile trip in a 50 - year - old Morris Oxford .
Some wonder if St Tim has not been possessed by the spirit of Christopher Monckton .
For short of the collective apostasy of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , it is hard to imagine a more rewarding episode for sceptics who have always said that environmentalism is a matter of faith , not facts .
For them , the most effective way of discrediting the movement is to depict it as an alliance of gullible consumers and doomy , secular preachers , who rant about sin , self - scourging and the apocalypse because they can't produce any evidence .
Disparaging analogies with religion , implying that it has no science worth challenging , have followed the movement almost since it began , finding their most elegant expression in a well - known speech made by the late Michael Crichton .
" Environmentalism is the religion of choice for urban atheists , " he said in 2003 .
" Increasingly it seems facts are n't necessary , because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief . "
Too many environmentalists have helped make his point .
Al Gore 's film , An Inconvenient Truth , was so liberal with panic that the same Michael Burton , in a court case funded by sceptics , found nine " inaccuracies " that , he said , made it unacceptably " partisan " .
For instance , in attributing the melting snow on Kilimanjaro to anthropogenic climate change , Gore went against the scientific consensus ( David Miliband has made the same mistake ) .
One wonders if this experience contributed to Justice Burton 's suggestion in the Nicholson case , that environmentalism is as much a viewpoint as a rational respƒonse to physical evidence .
As for Nicholson , he could have been designed to embody the common objection that the green movement is populated by affluent , I 'm Not a Plastic Bag - carrying caricatures , who think it meritorious to advertise their eco-friendly tat or Cameronesque affectations .
Does his " we do n't eat much meat " generally inspire admiration ?
Or unworthy thoughts along the lines of Orwell 's , when he raged against the middle - class cranks who , he argued , were putting working people off socialism ?
" If only the sandals and the pistachio - coloured shirts could be put in a pile and burnt , " he wrote in The Road to Wigan Pier , " and every vegetarian , teetotaller , and creeping Jesus sent home to Welwyn Garden City to do his yoga exercises quietly ! "
By chance , Orwell identifies at least three of the possible types who , following Burton 's ruling , may take the opportunity to make a nuisance of themselves under the pretext of the Employment Equality ( Religion and Belief ) 2003 Regulations .
Lawyers are already crowing over the procession of vegetarians , humanists , feminists and – why not ?
– climate change sceptics , who are expected to find that their deeply held beliefs have been callously disrespected .
But even without Nicholson , this dismal outcome was predictable once the Labour government had chosen to enhance the place of religious faith in public life , instead of making a stand for secularism .
Once it had encouraged religious people to believe that workplaces should take account of their myriad spiritualities , it had , in spirit of fairness , to extend a similar right to cause mischief to people who strongly believe in non-religious stuff .
The difficulty with a belief such as environmentalism , Burton said , is testing the " genuineness " with which it is held .
So , probably , the more extreme the protestations , the better the chance of a pay - out .
That 's something for future green martyrs to bear in mind .
Have n't we all heard voices telling us to buy local produce where possible ?
Are n't you hearing one , right now , saying that , for green believers , Earth Day is right up there with Christmas and Easter ?
In fact , one wonders if it would not have been more prescient of Professor David Nutt , after being sacked by Alan Johnson , to say that his beliefs on the decriminalisation of drugs were dictated by an undeviating adherence to the shamanistic practices of Carlos Castaneda and thus privileged , like all similar codswallop , by the 2003 act .
The counter - argument that he should , in that case , have found a job somewhere more congenial is , as we know , far too rational to be worth entertaining .
A few dozen residents of the western Negev together with some young visitors from abroad demonstrated Thursday afternoon at the Camel 's Hump observation post near the Gaza Strip , next to Kibbutz Nir Am , to mark one year since Operation Cast Lead .
Sharing the Burden Shas :
No aid to Sderot , Gaza vicinity at party 's expense Roni Sofer Party ministers not enthused by idea of government ministries transferring millions from their budgets to reinforce southern communities within range of Hamas rockets .
Prime Minister 's Office :
We do n't understand what Shas ministers are complaining about Shas :
No aid to Sderot , Gaza vicinity at party 's expense
Leading the marchers were Sderot Mayor David Buskila and Information Minister Yuli Edelstein ( Likud ) .
The demonstrators marched from the kibbutz towards the observation post , from which dozens of balloons were released .
Messages written by the children of Sderot to the children of the Gaza Strip were attached to the balloons .
The marchers sang peace songs , and said the main purpose of the march was to send a message of peace to the people of the Gaza Strip and to Hamas leaders .
" We stand here today on both sides of the border , with a message of peace between us , " Buskila said .
" We have released balloons with messages from the children of Sderot who experienced the Qassam rockets , and we want to say to Hamas leaders , who to our dismay continue to rearm , that we come in peace .
We are too strong to leave this land , and justice is with us . "

The mayor also noted the demonstration that took place at the Erez border crossing , particularly the behavior of MK Taleb el - Sana ( United Arab List ) , which drew criticism from politicians in Israel .
" It makes me sad that a member of Knesset in Israel offers himself as a spokesman for Hamas , and I believe that the Knesset must rid itself of such people , " he said .
" I want to remind people that Haniyeh is a member of a terror organization , " he continued , referring to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh .
" We come with a message of peace , one year after the war , " Edelstein said .
" Sadly , the shooting continues , but we seek peace . "
A Zambian member of parliament , who had come to show solidarity with the residents of Sderot , was also among the marchers .
The African guest said , " I believe that these people bring a message of peace .
The children of Sderot have sent messages to the children of Gaza .
Israel does n't want war ; it wants to live in peace with its neighbors – the launching of rockets into Israel must cease . "
WASHINGTON : The founder of Blackwater Worldwide has acknowledged in an interview with Vanity Fair that he had helped the CIA with secret programs targeting top al - Qaeda leaders , a role he says was intended to give the agency '' unattributable capability ' ' in sensitive missions .
Erik Prince , owner of the military contractor now known as Xe Services , told Vanity Fair magazine , published on Wednesday , that his company performed numerous '' very risky missions ' ' for the spy agency , some of which were improperly exposed in leaks to the news media .
Risky missions ...

The magazine , which was granted rare access to Mr Prince and his deputies at the company 's facilities in the United States and Afghanistan , said the former Navy SEAL had served a dual role for the CIA as a contractor and an ' ' asset ' ' , or spy , who carried out secret missions as recently as two months ago , when the Obama Administration terminated his contract .
Among other , previously undisclosed roles , Mr Prince ran intelligence - gathering operations to co-ordinate the movement of undercover spies in '' one of the so - called Axis of Evil countries ' ' , the magazine said , citing unidentified sources familiar with his activities .
Oh , this is going to have to be studiously ignored at the upcoming confab in Copenhagen .
Apparently those Himalayan glaciers that are supposedly being devastated by global warming , may actually be doing just fine , thank you very much .
From the story :
It has been reported worldwide that the Himalayan glaciers are retreating fast due to global warming .
But now a report released by India ’s Ministry of Environment last week claims that the picture of fast retreating glaciers is simply not accurate .
The report , by a senior glaciologist called Vijay Kumar Raina , says that earlier studies based on the measurements of a handful of glaciers did not present a true account , and that in fact , India ’s 10,000 plus Himalayan glaciers are not shrinking rapidly in response to climate change .
The report disputes the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ’s ) 2007 report , which stated clearly that Himalayan glaciers ‘ are receding faster than in any other part of the world and , if the present rate continues , the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 , and perhaps sooner , is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate . ’
Growing glaciers , however , are not exactly good news .
According to Hewitt , ‘ Surging glaciers are dangerous because they store water .
The Hunza River has declined by 20 per cent due to the advance of glaciers in the area .
These glaciers are storing ice
This is a different problem and needs to be investigated ’.
But the consensus tells us it ’s true !
Ignore everything else and stick to the consensus !
( Quick !
Get some smelling salts for Gore , he looks like he ’s going into shock . )
As for the IPCC , its minions are calling the Indians “ arrogant ” for daring to come to a different conclusion than it did .
Arrogant ?
Talk about speaking into a mirror !
But there apparently is no such thing as good news where climate change is concerned :
So , are the glaciers in danger or not ?
I do n’t know .
Climate and its impact are always in flux , so to say that there is “ climate change ” is really a meaningless term .
But I think it is high time that the IPCC and all climate scientists — from both sides — opened up their raw data for a good look - see by the rest of us .
Trust is over and it is time for verify to begin .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . -- Florida coach Urban Meyer , who was admitted to a hospital because of chest pains following the Southeastern Conference championship game , is stepping down because of health concerns .
" There was no heart damage , " Meyer told The New York Times , referring to the night he was admitted to the hospital .
" But I did n't want there to be a bad day where there were three kids sitting around wondering what to do next .
It was the pattern of what I was doing and how I was doing it .
It was self - destructive . "
Meyer resigned Saturday after five seasons in Gainesville and two national titles .
He goes into the Sugar Bowl with a 56 - 10 record at Florida that includes a 32 - 8 mark in league play and a school - record 22 - game winning streak ended early this month against Alabama .
Meyer , 45 , says he consulted with his family , his doctors , school president Bernie Machen and athletic director Jeremy Foley before deciding it is in his best interest to focus on his health and family .
Meyer told his wife and three children on Christmas he planned to quit as Florida coach , The Times reported .
He told The Times his daughter Nicki , 18 , hugged him and said , " I get my daddy back . "
" I saw it as a sign from God that this was the right thing to do , " Meyer told The Times of his daughter 's reaction .
" I was worried about letting people down .
I was feeling so awful and concerned about my health .
That was among several other signs that said it 's time to back away . "
Meyer 's health problems are not life threatening , a Florida source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN's Chris Mortensen .
The same source said Meyer will remain in Gainesville in a non-coaching role to be defined later .
A Florida spokesman said reports of Meyer being diagnosed with muscle - heart - valve defect and having a heart attack during the season are inaccurate .
The team does not have an official medical diagnosis for Meyer .
Meyer will hold a news conference in New Orleans on Sunday afternoon and will coach his final game in the Allstate Sugar Bowl against Cincinnati on New Year 's Day .
" I have given my heart and soul to coaching college football and mentoring young men for the last 24 - plus years and I have dedicated most of my waking moments the last five years to the Gator football program , " Meyer said in a statement .
" I have ignored my health for years , but recent developments have forced me to reevaluate my priorities of faith and family . "
" Coach Meyer and I have talked this through and I realize how hard this was for him to reach this decision , " Foley said in a statement .
" But , the bottom line is that Coach Meyer needed to make a choice that is in the best interest of his well being and his family .
I certainly appreciate what he has meant to the University of Florida , our football program and the Gator Nation .
I have never seen anyone more committed to his players , his family and his program .
Above all , I appreciate our friendship . "
We 're aware of concerns raised in this post and others like it .
At this point , our teams are looking into the details .
When we have more information to share , we 'll update customers via a post on Dell 's blog , Direct2Dell .
All is not well in the land of the E6400 - and E6500 - series lappytops .
What looks to be hundreds of owners of these machines have been complaining of massive performance issues , throttling themselves down by as much as 95 % under what would seem to be normal operating conditions .
Whenever the devices get slightly warm the BIOS automatically starts dialing down the performance until they basically crawl to a halt , some indicating that even when cool they wo n't go over 50 % of maximum clock .
Users have been reporting this issue since early in the year and Dell has apparently started censoring some posts on its forums , including a link to a PDF created by ( now - banned ) user Tinkerdude describing the problem in detail .
It 's entitled " Performance loss during normal operation in a Dell Latitude E6500 laptop due to processor and bus clock throttling " , and if you think that 's long wait until you see all 59 pages of analysis ( at the read link ) .
As of now there 's no official fix provided by Dell , leaving many to call this Throttlegate , and we do love a good Stargate reference . :
Ibrahim e-mailed to let us know that these two series are n't the only ones being gimped .
The Studio XPS 1645 is said to be having similar ( but somewhat less drastic ) issues according to this thread , seemingly thanks to an inadequate AC adapter .
In this case Dell seems to be shipping replacement adapters to those who call up and complain .
Dell 's Chief Blogger Lionel Menchaca dropped the following in comments , which is something of a positive step :
[ Nupedia - l ]
Let 's make a wiki
No , this is not an indecent proposal .
It 's an idea to add a little feature to Nupedia .
Jimmy
Wales thinks that many people might find the idea objectionable , but I think not .
" Wiki , " pronounced \ wee ' - kee\ , derives from a Polynesian word , " wikiwiki , " but what it means is a VERY open , VERY publicly - editable series of web pages .
For example , I can start a page called EpistemicCircularity and write anything I want in it .
Anyone else ( yes , absolutely anyone else ) can come along and make absolutely any changes to it that he wants to .
( The editing interface is very simple ; anyone intelligent enough to write or edit a Nupedia article will be able to figure it out without any trouble . )
On the page I create , I can link to any other pages , and of course anyone can link to mine .
The project is billed and pursued as a public resource .
There are a few announced suggestions or rules .
The concept actually seems to work well , as you can see here with the original wiki : http://c2.com/cgi/wiki
Links are indicated by using CapitalizedWordsBunchedTogetherLikeThis .
If a wiki page exists , the word is underlined ; if not , there is a question mark after the word , which is clickable , and which anyone can use to go and write something about the topic .
Setting up a wiki for Nupedia would be very easy ; it can be done in literally ten minutes .
( We 've already found this out . )
As to Nupedia 's use of a wiki , this is the ULTIMATE " open " and simple format for developing content .
We have occasionally bandied about ideas for simpler , more open projects to either replace or supplement Nupedia .
It seems to me wikis can be implemented practically instantly , need very little maintenance , and in general are very low - risk .
They 're also a potentially great source for content .
So there 's little downside , as far as I can see .
We can make wiki versions of all new Nupedia articles , too , and that can be a place where additional changes and commentary can be gleaned ( authors could ignore what goes on on the wiki , of course - - it 's up to them ) .
The content can be licensed under an open content license .
A Nupedia wiki would instruct users to try to make their entries resemble encyclopedia articles , but the usual wiki sort of banter would be permitted .
This would make things more interesting to many users , who could * instantly * create , edit , and comment on articles .
If a wiki article got to a high level it could be put into the regular Nupedia editorial process .
We would not integrate the Nupedia wiki into the rest of Nupedia ( though wiki pages could link to regular Nupedia pages , there would n't be links back ) .
It would be a completely separate part of the website .
The search engine would not return wiki pages , and wiki pages would n't be listed among other regular Nupedia pages .
We 'd just have a link on the left or right hand column of the website , " Nupedia Wiki " , and let people explore it if they 're curious what it is .
On the front page of the Nupedia wiki we'd make it ABSOLUTELY clear that this is experimental , that Nupedia editors do n't have control of what goes on here , and that the quality of articles , discussion , etc. , should not be taken as a reflection of the quality of articles , review , etc. on the main part of the Nupedia website .
Does anyone have an objection to our trying this out ?

British climate centre reeling over Internet posting of sensitive material .
The online publication of sensitive e-mails and documents from a British climate centre is brewing into one of the scientific controversies of the year , causing dismay among affected institutes and individuals .
The tone and content of some of the disclosed correspondence are raising concerns that the leak is damaging the credibility of climate science on the eve of the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December .
The Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) in Norwich confirmed on 20 November that it had had more than 1,000 e-mails and documents taken from its servers , but it has not yet confirmed how much of the published material is genuine .
" This information has been obtained and published without our permission , " says Simon Dunford , a spokesman for the UEA , adding that the university will undertake an investigation and has already involved the police .
“ There are apparently lots of people who really do think that global warming is an evil socialist plot . ”
Many scientists contacted by Nature doubt that the leak will have a lasting impact , but climate - sceptic bloggers and mainstream media have been poring over the posted material and discussing its contents .
Most consist of routine e-mail exchanges between researchers .
But one e-mail in particular , sent by CRU director Phil Jones , has received attention for its use of the word " trick " in a discussion about the presentation of climate data .
In a statement , Jones confirmed that the e-mail was genuine and said : " The word ' trick ' was used here colloquially as in a clever thing to do .
It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward . "
" If anyone thinks there 's a hint of tweaking the data for non-scientific purposes , they are free to produce an analysis showing that Earth is n't warming , " adds Michael Oppenheimer , a climate scientist and policy researcher at Princeton University in New Jersey .
" In fact , they have been free to do so for decades and have n't been able to . "
" There are apparently lots of people who really do think that global warming is an evil socialist plot , and that many scientists are part of the plot and deliberately faking their science , " adds Tom Wigley , a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , and former director of CRU .
Alleged e-mails containing critical remarks about other climate scientists are merely proof of lively debate in the community , adds Gavin Schmidt , a climate researcher with NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City .
The title of the uploaded file containing the leaked e-mails — ' FOIA.zip ' — has led to speculation that the affair may be linked to the deluge of requests for raw climate data that have recently been made under the UK Freedom of Information Act to Jones ( see Nature 460 , 787 ; 2009 ) .
The source of many of those requests is Steve McIntyre , the editor of Climate Audit , a blog that investigates the statistical methods used in climate science .
" I do n't have any information on who was responsible , " McIntyre told Nature .
Nevertheless , e-mails allegedly sent by Jones seem to illustrate his reluctance to comply with these requests .
" All scientists have the right to request your data and to try to falsify your results , " says Hans von Storch , director of the Institute for Coastal Research in Geesthacht , Germany .
" I very much respect Jones as a scientist , but he should be aware that his behaviour is beginning to damage our discipline . "
In a statement , the UEA said : " The raw climate data which has been requested belongs to meteorological services around the globe and restrictions are in place which means that we are not in a position to release them .
We are asking each service for their consent for their data to be published in future . "
However , von Storch believes that , at least until the affair is resolved , Jones should cease reviewing climate science for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The saying Moss used is featured on pro-anorexia websites Model Kate Moss has been criticised by campaigners after saying she lives by a slogan which encourages people with anorexia not to eat .
In an interview with fashion news website WWD , Moss said one of her mottoes was : " Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels . "
Eating disorder charity Beat described the comments as " dangerous " and " very unhelpful " for sufferers .
A spokeswoman for Moss said the comment had been " completely misrepresented " .
In the interview , Moss adds : " That 's one of them .
You try and remember , but it never works . "
The saying is widely used by anorexia and bulimia sufferers on websites .
' Irresponsible ' A spokeswoman for Beat said it was " a very unfortunate phrase " particularly as it was widely used on pro-anorexia websites .
" She probably does n't realise how dangerous such comments can be .
It 's difficult enough for young people who are struggling to beat eating disorders , without comments like this which are very unhelpful , " she said .
Katie Green , a former Ultimo underwear model who has launched a Say No To Size Zero campaign with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik , said the comments were " irresponsible " .
She said : " I think Kate Moss should really have thought before she spoke like most of us do before giving interviews .
Kate is a mother herself and how would parents with children suffering from eating disorders feel reading something like this ?
" We are trying to get the government to put something in place to stamp out size zero models and comments like this are n't doing anything to help that . "
A spokeswoman for Moss 's model agency Storm said : " This was part of a longer answer Kate gave during a wider ranging interview which has unfortunately been taken out of context and completely misrepresented .
" For the record , Kate does not support this as a lifestyle choice . "

Researchers have characterised a new multi drug resistant strain of Salmonella Typhimurium that is causing life - threatening disease in Africa .
This type of Salmonella bug normally causes diarrhoea and is rarely fatal .
The new strain infects vulnerable children and adults in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa leading to death in up to one in four cases .
The new genome work , a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , the Malawi - Liverpool - Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme and the Kemri-Wellcome Trust Programme , shows how genetic changes transformed this infection into a new antibiotic - resistant form of the disease .
The new strain , called ST313 , appears to be better adapted to affect humans , is resistant to several commonly used antibiotics and may spread from person to person .
The severe effects of ST313 - invasive disease and high mortality rates - are seen predominantly in individuals with the immune compromising conditions , HIV , malaria , malnutrition or anaemia .
Until today , it had been widely assumed that this was n't a new deadly form of the organism but , rather , that the existing diarrhoea - causing strain of the pathogen was taking advantage of the weakened immune system of patients with underlying health problems to cause a more severe disease .
Today 's results paint a truer picture
" Multi - drug resistant forms of this deadly type of S. Typhimurium emerged only in the last decade , " explains Dr Robert Kingsley from the Sanger Institute and lead author on the paper .
" It seems to have evolved to acquire a unique armoury that allows it to efficiently infect vulnerable children and adults in some African regions .
The results highlight the power of in - depth genome sequence analysis to challenge basic medical assumptions and distinguish closely related pathogens .
" This is a new form of pathogen . "
The team studied approximately 50 samples of the bacterial DNA , extracted from blood samples of African patients with severe symptoms of infection and also suffering HIV , malaria , malnutrition or anaemia .
They used these samples to produce a high - quality reference genome sequence .
Based on this sequence , the team were able to look in fine detail at the genetic differences between ST313 and strains associated with milder disease symptoms across the globe .
" This work was entirely dependent on close collaboration that brings important samples collected over years together with genomic technology that can pick apart the important changes , " says Professor Rob Heyderman , Director of the Malawi - Liverpool - Wellcome Trust , Clinical Research Programme .
" This work is a great example of such cooperation : now we must build the capacity to expand this kind of research in affected countries . "
" When we started looking in detail at our newly completed reference genome sequence , we saw the genetic signatures that suggested it may be adapting to humans , " explains Dr Robert Kingsley .
" For example , this deadly strain has lost around one in 50 of the genes found in the ' typical '
S. Typhimurium - a classic sign that it may be becoming more closely adapted to one host , in this case , humans .
" We also found similar patterns of genome degradation in ST313 compared S. Typhi - a bacterium which is known to be well adapted to its human host . "
Six out of ten of the regions that showed degradation in the invasive ST313 are also degraded in S. Typhi , suggesting that the genomes have converged in their ability to thrive in the human host .
This theory is bolstered by the finding that eroded areas of the genome tend to play important roles in the intimate interaction with cells of the human host .
The team 's findings suggest that ST313 may be spreading by a new method , not seen before in S. Typhimurium .
This pathogen normally circulates among animals and is introduced to humans through food poisoning .
It spends much of its time in the animal hosts .
However , ST313 may be passing predominantly from person to person and so can adapt more rapidly to its human hosts : it does n't spend time acquiring mutations to help it thrive in the animal host , but on the contrary may be losing them .
This is likely to have helped seal its success and helped it to become the dominant strain among humans .
Multi drug resistant ST313 has swept through humans in remarkable fashion : in an 18 - month period beginning in 2002 , it came to represent 95 per cent of S. Typhimurium isolates identified in Africa .
However , antibiotic - sensitive versions of the same strain may have been evolving in regions of Africa for many decades .
" This new strain of S. Typhimurium has rapidly gained resistance to many of the commonly used antibiotics in the field , " explains Dr Chisomo Msefula from the Malawi - Liverpool - Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme .
" Our findings show that ST313 has acquired a block of genes that make it resistant to the common antibiotics .
The genes jumped into ST313 on a mobile genetic element called a transposon , bringing with it additional genes that make the strain more deadly . "
" Even when treated using drugs against which the bacterium has not gained resistance , the mortality rate remains staggeringly high , at 25 per cent . "
The team hope that the new sequence will open the door for future studies of disease important to populations in Africa
" There are more than 2500 different strains of Salmonella , " explains Professor Gordon Dougan from the Sanger Institute and senior author on the paper .
" The emergence and rise to dominance of ST313 in Africa is associated with uniquely susceptible host populations : we must be on our guard against the emergence of new pathogens in a rapidly changing world .
This is n't simply a story about HIV infection :
There is little evidence that this type of disease is a problem in other areas of the world where HIV and malaria infection rates are high , such as southeast Asia .
" If we can understand what 's special about the types of Typhimurium that emerge and susceptible populations , we might be able to predict in future where new pathogens will emerge .
We may also be able to design vaccines against those pathogens . "
Two ST313 isolates in available databases come from outside Africa - one from India and one from the UK .
Strikingly , both were from severe invasive disease .
Invasive cases are very , very rare outside certain regions of Africa .
The researchers do n't know whether the additional cases were from travellers to Africa or know the immune status of the patients .
Tracking the transmission pathways and the emergence of new strains can most effectively be done using new sequencing technologies to spot the tiny differences - single letter changes - in the genetic code .
The completion of this new high - quality S. Typhimurium reference genome for the emergent ST313 strain opens the door for such investigations in the future .

' Naked ' domains on App Engine
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under naked - domains , app- engine , tech , dns
One topic that comes up frequently on the App Engine groups is that of ' naked ' domains in App Engine , and how to handle them .
A naked domain , for the uninitiated , is one without a service - specific subdomain .
For example , " google.com " is naked , while " www.google.com " is not .
This post provides an overview of why naked domains are a problem , and what you can do about them .
There are two separate factors that combine to make handling of naked domains a problem in App Engine .
The first is the design of DNS , the system for resolving domain names to IP addresses .
There are two different types of DNS record we 're concerned about here : A records , which specify the IP address for a name , and CNAME records , which acts a " see also " , specifying another name for a domain .
For example , an A record might say " google.com has the IP 216.239.59.104 " , while a CNAME record might say " google.com is also known as www.l.google.com " .
The problem arises with the way CNAME records work .
An A record specifies the IP address only for a single record - for example , an A record on google .com specifies the address for that domain , but not for subdomains such as " news.google.com " .
A CNAME record , however , actually serves as a " see also " for not just the name in question , but all its subdomains .
The upshot of this is that if I have a CNAME record on " foo.bar " , it 's not valid to have any other record , at all , on " baz.foo.bar " , or any other subdomain of foo. bar .
The second factor is that App Engine operates as a global , reliable service .
This means that it has to handle things such as routing traffic to the closest datacenter to the user , and failing over between data centers when necessary , and so forth .
As a result , an App Engine app does n't have a single IP address , or even a small set of them - the IP addresses that can serve an App Engine app will change over time , and even depending on where the user is .
Since it 's impractical to expect owners of domains that want to host on App Engine to somehow maintain these records , Google employs a common technique :
They provide a DNS name - ghs.google.com - and instruct people to CNAME their own domains to that address , allowing Google 's DNS servers to take care of returning the right IP address to the user .
I 'm sure you can see where this is going :
In order to support a global , fault - tolerant service like App Engine , we need to use CNAMEs , but CNAMEs can't be used on naked domains , because that would make it impossible to add any records for subdomains - including ' www ' , or mail server records .
As a result , naked domains are n't directly supported .
What you can do about it
The why is all very well , but what can you do about it ?
Fortunately , there 's a relatively easy solution :
Use a service to redirect users who visit the naked domain to the www - prefixed one .
Such a service is very simple :
It accepts all incoming HTTP requests , and tacks on " www . " to the beginning of the URL , sending the user an HTTP redirect ( known as a ' 301 redirect ' or ' 302 redirect ' ) to the new URL .
Even better , many registrars , such as godaddy provide such services for free .
If you are using such a service , make sure that when you enable it , you do n't select ' cloaking ' - instead of serving a redirect , this will serve up your site in an invisible frame , which messes up URLs .
If you do n't use a registrar that provides this , do n't despair .
You have two other options :
You can change your DNS hosting to a service that does support it , or you can do it yourself .
DNS services that support redirects for naked domains include zoneedit and dyndns .
Zoneedit will host your first 5 domains at no charge , and both services charge only nominal fees .
You can move your DNS hosting to one of these services while continuing to use your current registrar for the domain registration , too .
If you want to do it yourself , the exact method depends on the HTTP server you use .
Here 's an example configuration for Apache 2 :
< VirtualHost *:80 > Include /etc/ apache2/vhosts.d/default_vhost.include < IfModule mpm_peruser_module >
ServerEnvironment apache apache </ IfModule > RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ! ^www\ . [ NC ] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$ RewriteRule ^/(.*)
http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$ 1 [ L , R=permanent ] </ VirtualHost >
Other HTTP servers should be similarly easy to configure .

International trailer for Robin Hood is entirely different from the trailer , as it provides more story and dialogue from the film .
AROUND THE WEB
We ’ve been following the career of Joel Osteen — who ’s become quite wealthy via his Lakewood Church in Houston — for quite some time , from when he introduced Pastor Jay Bakker to his family to the time Joel ’s wife Victoria was sued by a flight attendant .
Osteen is part of that new brand of “ smiling bigots . ”
Like NOM ’s Brian Brown , he puts on a nice suit , acts all friendly to the queers , and looks to God for the answers .
But then he turns around and preaches that your “ lifestyle ” is one of sin .
For Osteen , here on The View this week , it ’s a question about “ God ’s best . ”
The Bible , he says , teaches that LGBTs are not God ’s best , and while he loves them , he sees their sexuality as a flaw .
Which is to say : God made a mistake .
But that ’s impossible !
Except :
It ’s a conclusion Osteen ca n’t explain away .
But this is a man who lives life like The Secret , telling people to believe in what they want , and they shall receive .
We ’re all for optimism , but Osteen is the guy who wrote in his 2004 book that “ God wants to give you your own house [ even if it feels out of reach ] , but says those hit by the housing crisis must “ keep believing . ”
Believing themselves into more debt ?
Osteen is irresponsible at best , a man preaching hatred at worst .

With a military health care system over - stretched by two ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , more soldiers are deciding to go absent without leave ( AWOL ) in order to find treatment for post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Eric Jasinski enlisted in the military in 2005 , and deployed to Iraq in October 2006 as an intelligence analyst with the U.S. Army .
He collected intelligence in order to put together strike packets — where air strikes would take place .
Upon his return to the United States after his tour , Jasinski was suffering from severe PTSD from what he did and saw in Iraq , remorse and guilt for the work he did that he knows contributed to the loss of life in Iraq .
“ What I saw and what I did in Iraq caused my PTSD , ” Jasinski , 23 - years - old , told IPS during a phone interview , “ Also , I went through a divorce — she left right before I deployed — and my grandmother passed away when I was over there , so it was all super rough on me .
” In addition , he lost a friend in Iraq , and another of his friends lost his leg due to a roadside bomb attack .
Upon returning home in December 2007 , Jasinski tried to get treatment via the military .
He was self - medicating by drinking heavily , and an over - burdened military mental health counselor sent him to see a civilian doctor , who diagnosed him with severe PTSD .
“ I went to get help , but I had an eight hour wait to see one of five doctors .
But after several attempts , finally I got a periodic check up and I told that counselor what was happening , and he said they ’d help me … but I ended up getting a letter that instructed me to go see a civilian doctor , and she diagnosed me with PTSD , ” Jasinski explained , “ Then , I was taking the medications and they were helping , because I thought I was to get out of the Army in February 2009 when my contract expired . ”
As the date approached , a problem arose .
“ In late 2008 they stop - lossed me , and that pushed me over the edge , ” Jasinski told IPS , “ They were going to send me back to Iraq the next month . ”
During his pre-deployment processessing “ they gave me a 90 - day supply of meds to get me over to Iraq , and I saw a counselor during that period , and I told him “ I do n’t know what I ’m going to do if I go back to Iraq . ”
“ He asked if I was suicidal , ” Jasinski explained , “ and I said not right now , I ’m not planning on going home and blowing my brains out .
He said , ‘ well , you ’re good to go then . ’
And he sent me on my way .
I knew at that moment , when they finalized my paperwork for Iraq , that there was no way I could go back with my untreated PTSD .
I needed more help . ”
When Jasinski went on his short pre-deployment leave break , he went AWOL , where he remained out of service until Dec. 11 , when he returned to turn himself in to authorities at Fort Hood , in Killeen , Texas .
“ He has heavy duty PTSD and never would have gone AWOL if he ’d gotten the help he needed from the military , ” James Branum , Jasinski ’s civilian lawyer who accompanied him to Fort Hood told IPS .
“ This case highlights the need of the military to provide better mental health care for its soldiers . ”
Branum , who is also co-chair of the Military Law Task Force , added , “ Our hope is that his unit wo n’t court - martial him , but puts him in a warrior transition unit where they will evaluate him to either treat him or give him a medical discharge .
He ’d be safe there , and eventually , they ’d give him a medical discharge because his PTSD symptoms are so severe . ”
He ’s turning himself in “ because he is not a flight risk and wants to take responsibility for what he ’s done , ” Branum stressed .
“ It ’s been a year , I want to get on with my life and go to college and become a social worker to help people , ” Jasinski said of why he is turning himself in to the military at this time .
“ I want to get on with life , and I do n’t want to hide . ”
Kernan Manion is a board - certified psychiatrist , who treated Marines returning from war who suffer from PTSD and other acute mental problems born from their deployments , at Camp Lejeune — the largest Marine base on the East Coast .
While he was engaged in this work , Manion warned his superiors of the extent and complexity of the systemic problems , and he was deeply worried about the possibility of these leading to violence on the base and within surrounding communities .
“ If not more Fort Hoods , Camp Liberties , soldier fratricide , spousal homicide , we ’ll see it individually in suicides , alcohol abuse , domestic violence , family dysfunction , in formerly fine young men coming back and saying , as I ’ve heard so many times , ‘ I ’m not cut out for society .
I ca n’t stand people .
I ca n’t tolerate commotion .
I need to live in the woods , ’” Manion explained to IPS .
“ That ’s what we ’re going to have .
Broken , not contributing , not functional members of society .
It infuriates me — what they are doing to these guys , because it ’s so ineptly run by a system that values rank and power more than anything else — so we ’re stuck throwing money into a fragmented system of inept clinics and the crisis goes on . ”
“ It ’s not just that we ’re going to have an immensity of people coming back , but the system itself is thwarting their effective treatment , ” Manion explained .
According to the Army , every year from 2006 onwards there has been a record number of reported and confirmed suicides , including in 2009 .
There has also been an escalation of soldier - on - soldier violence , as the Nov. 5 shooting spree at Fort Hood by Major Nidal Hassan indicates .
In 2008 there was also a record number of suicides for the Marine Corps .
Jasinski ’s case is representative of a growing number of soldiers returning from the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan who are going AWOL when they are unable to get proper mental health care treatment from the military for their PTSD .
A 2008 Rand Corporation report revealed that at least 300,000 veterans returning from both wars had been diagnosed with severe depression or PTSD .
Jaskinski’s experience with the military has inspired him to offer advice for other soldiers who need PTSD treatment but are not receiving it .
“ Do not , do not let a 5 - 10 minute review by a military doctor determine if you go to Iraq , ” he told IPS .
“ Even if you have to pay out of pocket , go civilian to a doctor … the military mental health sector is so overwhelmed , they wo n’t take care of you .
Go see a civilian , and hopefully that therapist will help you … even then I ’m not sure that will help … but you have to take that chance . ”
When asked what he feels the military needs to do in order to rectify this problem , he said : “ A total overhaul of the mental health sector in the military is needed … we had nine psychiatrists at our center , and that ’s simply not enough staff , they are going to get burned out , after seeing 50 soldiers each in one day .
We need an overhaul of the entire system , and more , good psychiatrists , not those just coming for a job , but good , experienced mental health professionals need to be involved . ”

More than 40 % of respondents said Russia needed " an iron fist " leader A growing number of Russians believe their country does not need democracy , a nationwide survey by one of Russia 's leading polling agencies suggests .
The poll by the Levada - Centre showed that 57 % of those questioned considered that Russia needed democracy - the lowest number since 2006 .
It said 26 % believed that democratic governing was not suitable for Russia .
Nearly 95 % of respondents said they had little or no influence on what was happening in the country .
' Rigged ' election Levada - Centre said 1,600 people across Russia had been questioned in the poll which was released on Friday .
Russian police dispersed a protest rally in Moscow , arresting some activists
Although the majority of them believe the country needs to be democratic , the results of the survey are an intriguing mix , the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says .
The majority ( 60 % ) also said it would be better for Russia if the president controlled both the courts and the parliament , which can hardly be described as a democratic aspiration , our correspondent says .
The poll also suggested that 43 % agreed with the question that the country sometimes needed an " iron fist " leader .
And nearly 25 % said the Soviet Union had a better political system that the current Russian model ( 36 % ) or that in Western countries ( 15 % ) .
The poll came as Russian police arrested 10 people in Moscow who were protesting against an alleged fraud in last weekend 's regional and local elections .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's United Russia party tightened its already overwhelming grip on power after the polls , our correspondent says .
But three parties walked out of parliament earlier this week , protesting against the outcome of the elections .
Two later returned , but the Communists are continuing their boycott .

Everyone who wants to make their own Stormtrooper costume without fear of reprisals from George Lucas , move to Britain .
That seems to be the message sent by the British courts , which have just declared that Star Wars ' Stormtroopers are n't copyrightable .
Advertisement
The British Court of Appeals upheld the original British verdict that the familiar white - and - black costume could n't be considered copyrighted because it was n't art .
Instead , the costume has been considered " industrial design , " and therefore only allowed to keep copyright for 15 years after creation .
British Lord Justices Rix , Jacob and Patten considered the look of the Empire 's cloned warriors to have a " utilitarian , " rather than artistic , purpose , and denied Lucasfilm the right to enforce their US copyright in the United Kingdom .
It 'll be interesting to see how this ruling could affect future British copyright cases .
Can British companies now produce merchandise based on any movie or television designs , as long as they 're older than 15 years , and use this as a defense ?
The Cybermen have been around for almost three times that long , let 's see if someone 's brave enough to test the BBC 's legal wrath .

George Lucas loses court appeal over Star Wars costume copyright [ Times Online ]
Cannon to the left of him , cannon to the right of him , cannon in front of him volley and thunder .
That 's our president 's position on the political battlefield now , taking it from all sides .
And the odd thing , the unique thing in terms of modern political history , is that no one really defends him , no one holds high his flag .
When was the last time you put on the radio or TV and heard someone say " Open line Friday — we 're talking about what it is we like best about Barack Obama ! "
When did you last see a cable talking head say , " The greatness of this man is as obvious as it is unnoticed " ?
Is the left out there on the Internet and the airwaves talking about him ?
Oh , yes .
They 're calling him a disappointment , a sellout , a DINO — Democratic in name only .
He sold out on single - payer health insurance , and then the public option .
He 'll sell you out on your issue too .
The pundits and columnists , dreadful people that they are , call him cold , weak , aloof , arrogant , entitled .
So let 's denounce him again .
Wait — it 's Christmas .
Let 's not .
There are people who deeply admire the president , who work with him and believe he 's doing right .
This week , this column is their forum .
They speak not for attribution to avoid the charge of suckupism .
A federal inquiry has heard families are abandoning their disabled children in order to fit into Australia 's immigration criteria .
A parliamentary committee is looking at relaxing the rules which block many immigrants from entering Australia if a family member has a disability or a health condition .
Under the rules , families are blocked from entering Australia if a member has a disability or health condition predicted to cost taxpayers at least $ 20,000 over a lifetime .
The incoming chairman of the United Nations committee on the rights of disabled people , Professor Ron McCallum , is blind himself .
" I would not be allowed to emmigrate to this country even if I could assert that I could make a reasonable contribution , " he said .
" I think that 's outrageous . "
He has told the inquiry the rules breach Australia 's international commitments to human rights .
Meanwhile immigration law specialist from the University of Sydney , Professor Mary Crock , has told the inquiry some desperate families are leaving children behind in order to meet the criteria .
" There are families who will literally cast off a family member and it has had a horrendous impact on the child , " she said .
Professor Crock says the system is inhumane and discriminatory , and people are being blocked even if they do not pose a cost to the economy .
Dr Dinesh Wadiwel from the National Ethnic Disability Alliance has told the inquiry some families assume they can bring their disabled children to Australia once they are settled there .
" Many families assume that once they get to Australia , it 's going to be an easier task to be reunited with that family member , " Dr Wadiwel said .
" Often they just assume because Australia 's a fair and decent country that they 'll be able to make that argument .
" Unfortunately , many families have to wait many years to be reunited and some never do . "
The Human Rights Commission has also told the inquiry migrants ' social contributions need to be assessed , not just their cost to the health system .
The water problem is solved !
The full announcement from NASA is here :
The argument that the moon is a dry , desolate place no longer holds water .
Secrets the moon has been holding , for perhaps billions of years , are now being revealed to the delight of scientists and space enthusiasts alike .
NASA today opened a new chapter in our understanding of the moon .
Preliminary data from the Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite , or LCROSS , indicates that the mission successfully uncovered water during the Oct. 9 , 2009 impacts into the permanently shadowed region of Cabeus cater near the moon ’s south pole .
The impact created by the LCROSS Centaur upper stage rocket created a two - part plume of material from the bottom of the crater .
The first part was a high angle plume of vapor and fine dust and the second a lower angle ejecta curtain of heavier material .
This material has not seen sunlight in billions of years .
One NASA official described the volume as " significant . "
The following chart , apparently , explains a lot :
Additional confirmation came from an emission in the ultraviolet spectrum that was attributed to hydroxyl , one product from the break - up of water by sunlight .
When atoms and molecules are excited , they release energy at specific wavelengths that are detected by the spectrometers .
A similar process is used in neon signs .
When electrified , a specific gas will produce a distinct color .
The ultraviolet visible spectrometer detected hydroxyl signatures just after impact that are consistent with a water vapor cloud in sunlight .
The first company to sell bottled moonwater is going to make a fortune .

* Bloomberg wins narrow re-election
* Margin far slimmer than anticipated ( Adds Bloomberg quotes , details )
NEW YORK , Nov 4 ( Reuters ) - New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who engineered a change in the city ’s term - limits law so he could run again and set a campaign financing record , narrowly won a third term on Tuesday , local media declared .
Bloomberg , who ran as an independent , defeated City Comptroller Bill Thompson , a Democrat , according to The New York Times , the Daily News and NY1 television .
With 99 percent of the votes counted , Bloomberg was ahead 51 to 46 percent .
His margin was far smaller than expected , given polls that showed him as recently as Monday with a double - digit lead and expectations of a large , lopsided victory .
Bloomberg spent more of his own money in pursuit of public office than any other individual in U.S. history , and he vastly outspent his challenger , laying out $ 13 for every $ 1 spent by Thompson .
Described by Forbes magazine as the richest man in New York , with a $ 16 billion fortune , he has spent almost $ 90 million on his re-election bid and is on track to spend as much as $ 140 million overall .
Thompson spent $ 7 million .
Bloomberg pledged in a speech to supporters to cut crime further , reduce the city ’s carbon emissions , expand mass transit , increase city parkland , improve schools , add affordable housing and jobs and diversify the local economy .
“ Conventional wisdom says that historically third terms have n’t been too successful , but we ’ve spent the past eight years defying conventional wisdom , ” he said , citing the city ’s economic resilience following the Sept. 11 attacks and its success at lowering crime rates .
“ We ’ve proven the experts wrong again and again and again , ” Bloomberg said .
“ We ’re going to make the next four years the best yet . ”
Official numbers were not yet calculated , but turnout appeared low .
Some 4.2 million New Yorkers are registered voters .
Noting Bloomberg ’s unexpectedly slim margin of victory , some political observers said New York voters may have been soured by the mayor ’s success in getting the city ’s term - limits law amended on his behalf .
Others said Bloomberg supporters may have been lulled by his strong polling numbers and did not turn out in large numbers at the polls .
In arguing that he should be allowed to run for a third term , which the city council allowed by amending the law , Bloomberg said his financial acumen was needed to guide New York through hard economic times .
A former partner at Salomon Brothers , he founded Bloomberg LP , a news and financial information company that competes with Thomson Reuters .

But here 's the critical sentence :
In that weird conspiracy - theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig is n’t my real son .
And a lot of people say , “ Well you need to produce his birth certificate !
You need to prove that he ’s your kid ! ”
Which we have done .
My italics .
Palin has never produced Trig 's birth certificate or a single piece of objective medical evidence that proves he is indeed her biological son .
A child with Down Syndrome must have a pile of such records , tests , assessments and ultrasounds that conclusively prove that he is Sarah 's biological son .
It seems bizarre to me that neither the public nor the campaign ( so far as I can glean ) has ever been given one of them .
Her doctor , Catherine Baldwin Johnson , offered a two - page summary of Palin 's health just hours before polls opened on November 3 , a bizarre approach to transparency .
The summary omits certain details from Palin 's medical history ( two miscarriages , one serious ) , and does not provide any actual documentary evidence of the pregnancy and birth .
It was authored by a doctor who has refused to return any phone calls , even from the New York Times , since the moment Palin 's candidacy was announced .
The hospital has three recorded births on the day Trig was born : the governor 's son , by wishes of the parents , was not included on the list .
There were only a handful of photographs over eight months that showed Palin pregnant , none showed her as visibly pregnant as with her previous children , and at seven months , her entire staff and all of Alaska 's political class disbelieved her :
People just could n't believe the news .
" Really ?
No ! " said Bethel state Rep. Mary Nelson , who is close to giving birth herself ...
" It 's wonderful .
She 's very well - disguised , " said Senate President Lyda Green , a mother of three who has sometimes sparred with Palin politically .
" When I was five months pregnant , there was absolutely no question that I was with child . "
On the return flight from Dallas to Alaska , which she says she boarded despite having contractions at eight months - a " strange sensation " she had never felt before , according to " Going Rogue , " - the flight attendants on the plane at the time , according to a contemporaneous account in the ADN , had no idea she was even pregnant , let alone in labor of some kind .
The questions about this astonishing story are not a function of conspiracy theories and never were .
They require no elaborate theory of whose child Trig may actually be .
They are simply basic questions anyone would ask of a person who had recounted such an amazing tale .
And yet not a single journalist has done so .
This blog has attempted to give Palin the benefit of the doubt on this from the get - go .
The Dish was one of the first blogs to post a photograph - of only four - showing Palin somewhat pregnant .
At the time , on August 31 , 2008 , I asked :
Please give us these answers - and provide medical records for Sarah Palin 's pregnancy - and put this to rest .
A short time later , I asked simply :
What harm would it do to release the medical records showing that Sarah Palin delivered Trig on April 18 in Wasilla ?
This is not hard : there must be an obstetrician , medical records , and data that can easily refute this rumor .
It is not out of the ordinary either : candidates routinely issue medical records .
So let 's have them .
And then we can move on .
On September 3 , Palin was cut off from the press for the following reasons :
In an extraordinary and emotional interview , Steve Schmidt said his campaign feels " under siege " by wave after wave of news inquiries that have questioned whether Palin is really the mother of a 4 - month - old baby , whether her amniotic fluid had been tested and whether she would submit to a DNA test to establish the child 's parentage .
On September 5 , Ben Smith reported that the medical records would be released " very soon " .
We kept being told that in the campaign and they never were - until the brief doctor 's note was issued a few hours before midnight before Election day .

Editor ’s note : Since I happen to be on vacation ( sort of –in reality I plan on spending most of next week holed up in my Sanctum Sanctorum at home writing a grant that ’s due in February ) and because readership tends to be down during the week between Christmas and New Years ’
Day , I thought I ’d resurrect something from well over three years ago and revise it to fit this particular blog .
In doing so , I hope to provide you with something amusing to read , as well as something to link to time and time again whenever you want to refer to a particular gambit beloved by promoters of quackery and pseudoscience .
I present here ….
The “ Pharma Shill ” Gambit !
Enjoy !
I ’ve mentioned before on this blog at least once that I cut my skeptical teeth , so to speak , on Usenet , that vast untamed and largely unmoderated territory full of tens of thousands of discussion newsgroups which used to be a lot more active before the rise of the World Wide Web and then later blogs .
These days , few ISPs even offer much in the way of Usenet access ; it ’s become pretty much irrelevant since Google archived Usenet in the form of Google Groups .
My forays into skepticism started out with combatting Holocaust denial on a newsgroup known as alt .
revisionism ( as good an excuse as any to remind you that nearly all Holocaust “ revisionism ” is n’t historical revisionism but is actually denial ) and then branched out into more general skepticism , particularly about the claims of creationists and , of course , promoters of “ alternative ” medicine , the latter of which ultimately led me to being the editor of this wild and woolly thing we call the Science - Based Medicine blog .
After I began to participate in the debates in the main newsgroup where alternative medicine is discussed , misc.health.alternative , it did n’t take me long to encounter a favorite tactic of promoters of alt - med who were not happy with one who insists on evidence - based medicine and who therefore questions claims that are obviously not based in valid science :
The “ Pharma Shill ” Gambit .
This is a technique of ad hominem attack in which a defender of “ alternative ” medicine , offended by your questioning of , for instance , his / her favorite herb , colon or liver flush technique , zapper , or cancer “ cure , ” tries to “ poison the well ” by implying or outright stating you must be in the pay of a pharmaceutical company , hired for nefarious purposes .
Since I entered the blogosphere several years ago under another guise , I ’ve only occasionally checked back at my old stomping ground , mainly because blogging is so much less constraining than posting to Usenet , where mostly I used to respond to the posts of others , rather than writing about what I wanted to write about .
A while back , though , out of curiosity I checked back and found this interesting little tidbit from a poster calling himself PeterB that demonstrated such a perfect example of the “ pharma shill ” gambit that I thought it might serve as a perfect example of the sort of thing I ’ve had to put up with ever since I started speaking out against quackery :
To : All participants and readers of misc.health.alternative + other health - related newsgroups
Please be aware that many comments and responses posted to this forum are not those of casual posters interested in an honest exchange .
A number of individuals with ties to industry are engaging an effort to shape public sentiment about the risks of mainstream medicine while denigrating the benefits and validity of natural medicine .
I refer to these individuals broadly as “ Pharma Bloggers ” ( * ) .
Pharma Bloggers on usenet do n’t promote a specific company or product , as might be the case with standard “ blogging ” on a weblog .
Most of these people are likely to have an association with a PR campaign whose “ blogging ” efforts are underwritten by the media and marketing groups of industry .
They are not difficult to identify due to specific patterns of behaviour in posting .
Here are a few points to remember while participating in usenet newsgroups : Pharma Bloggers on usenet use intimidation , mockery , and insults to silence those who express belief or interest in natural medicine .
Pharma Bloggers on usenet attack those who question the effectiveness of mainstream medicine and defend disease - management “ healthcare ” as the only viable form of medicine .
Pharma Bloggers on usenet post the majority of their responses simply to bury the comments of others ; they also strive obsessively to have the last word .
Pharma Bloggers on usenet are much faster at posting than casual participants ; they almost always respond first to a new thread , question , or observation .
Pharma Bloggers on usenet use multiple “ bloggers ” in a swap - & - relay fashion to create an aura of the “ consensus view ” in an effort to isolate posters who question the value of mainstream medicine .
You will see this tactic used more often than any other .
Tip :
If you find yourself reading a response that is unusually dramatic in tone , or inexplicably vicious toward other posters , and if that response is a defense of mainstream medicine , you can be sure you have stumbled upon a “ Pharma Blogger . ”
Unfortunately , there are more of these individuals posting to usenet on a daily basis than virtually anyone else , which is why I am posting this alert .
If you find it odd that so few people on health - related usenet newsgroups are expressing an interest in natural medicine , it is n’t because they are n’t there , it ’s because they have been intimidated into silence .
The Pharma Bloggers have over - run the various newsgroups with their industrial brand of dogma , mockery , and ridicule .
Many casual posters are simply frightened away .
That ’s one of the goals of Pharma Blogging .
(*) Pharma Blogger :
An individual who uses the Internet to : 1 ) promote and defend maintstream medicine while denigrating natural medicine approaches ; 2 ) attack others who express a preference for natural medicine , or who question the value of mainstream medicine ; and 3 ) cite a variety of “ junk medical science ” funded by industry for the purpose of establishing markets for marginally effective , and often dangerous , medical products and devices .
PeterB
See what I had to deal with ?
First , let me just mention that I realize that astroturf campaigns do exist , but , quite frankly , die - hard defenders of alt-med on Usenet like PeterB tend to be interested in such Internet PR efforts only as a means of smearing those who criticize them for their claims or who have the temerity to ask them to provide scientific studies to back up their assertions .
To them , everyone who questions them is probably part of an astroturf campaign .
It goes with the conspiracy - mongering proclivities so common among cranks .
This sort of obvious pre-emptive ad hominem attack ( again , a.k.a. the logical fallacy of poisoning the well ) would be utterly laughable if it were not so common .
I sometimes get the impression that PeterB and his compatriots must think that there are hordes of “ pharma shills ” sitting behind banks of computers ( remember the claim “ more of these individuals posting to Usenet than anyone else ” ) , waiting to pounce the instant anyone like PeterB starts posting critiques of big pharma or praising herbal “ cures . ”
( Yes , that they seem to think they are worth that sort of effort implies PeterB and others like them do seem to have an inflated view of their own importance . )
My usual first response to such gambits tends to be facetious and runs along the lines of asking , “ Where do I sign up to become a pharma shill ?
How do I get me a piece of that action ?
After all , why should I waste my time seeing patients and working like a dog to do science , publish papers , and write grants and then only having a couple of hours in the evenings to blog , when I could make big bucks ruthlessly mocking online dissent against big pharma full time while sitting back in my pajamas and sipping a big hot mug of coffee ?
Count me in ! ”
( Expect to see my words posted somewhere out of context to make it seem as though I was being serious about this . )
However , facetiousness usually just infuriates people like PeterB to new heights of “ pharma shill ” accusations .
At that point , it ’s time to try to be rational , hard as it may be in the face of such provocation , but I try .
First , a lot of this smear tends to be a case of projection , of the pot calling the kettle black .
For example , # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 are more typical of supporters of alt - med than of anyone who questions alt - med claims .
Indeed , the denizens of misc .
health.alternative who are most pro-alternative medicine tend to react quite defensively to questioning of their assertions .
They are often like a group of Cyber Sisters ( except that they are comprised of both men and women ) ruthlessly descending upon anyone who questions the dogma of their favorite alternative medicine , criticizes their behavior , or suggests that maybe , just maybe , conventional medicine might have value .
( No , those on “ our side ” are not entirely innocent , but in my experience the certain promoters of alt - med tend to be quicker with the ad hominem . )
One reason for this , I suspect , is that many of them are also active on moderated groups such as CureZone.com , where anyone questioning the alt - med treatment du jour too long or too vigorously will be banned from the discussion groups , thus providing a nice , safe , cuddly environment , where never is heard a discouraging word towards quackery .
# 4 and # 5 are clearly designed to imply that the so - called “ Pharma Bloggers ” either do n’t have a regular job ( why else would they have so much time ? ) or that they are working for big pharma .
Of course , they never provide any evidence to support their accusations .
In fact , they almost never provide even any reasoning to support their accusations more substantive than variations on “ he ’s criticizing alternative medicine a lot so he must be a pharma shill . ”
The “ pharma shill ” gambit , like other varieties of ad hominem or well - poisoning rhetoric , conveniently frees defenders of “ alternative ” medicine from having to argue for their favorite remedies on the science and clinical studies supporting them ( which in most cases tend to be badly designed or nonexistent ) .
It ’s a technique that ’s not just limited to them , either .
Anti-vaccination cranks and mercury / autism conspiracy theorists like it too , and , indeed , I have been the subject of some particularly vicious attacks over the years at the hands of the anti-vaccine movement1,2 , Generation Rescue and its founder J. B. Handley in particular3 , 4,5 , all of whom appear to be trying very hard to poison my Google reputation .
( Indeed , another such attack rolled in just today , courtesy of AoA hanger - on Harold Doherty . )
Moreover , J.B. Handley , in particular , has also attacked our very own Steve Novella .
More recently , the late Hulda Clark ’s former attack Chihuahua Tim Bolen appears to have decided for some reason that I have been named the heir apparent to Dr. Stephen Barrett .
While I ’m flattered that he somehow seems to think this , I ’ll have to be at this for many more years and become much more effective even to approach Barrett ’s legacy .
Be that as it may , you have to have a tough skin if you ’re going to try to combat the infiltration of pseudoscience into medicine .
Skeptico pointed out , even if a newsgroup denizen were a pharma shill , that would n’t necessarily invalidate his argument .
Yes , in the case of a true “ shill ” who does not reveal that he works for a pharmaceutical company and pretends to be “ objective , ” it would be entirely appropriate to “ out ” that person with extreme prejudice , so that his bias could be taken into account .
That being said , I ’ll take this opportunity to point out that I have never over the last decade observed such a person in action , which tells me that they are probably a lot less common than people like PeterB like to claim .
Even in the case of a real shill , however , this sort of “ outing ” is not a refutation of that person ’s arguments ; it merely serves to increase appropriately the level of skepticism about what that person is saying .
Such an “ outing ” still leaves the task of actually using evidence , logic , and sound arguments to refute what that person is saying , something boosters of alt - med rarely even attempt to do .
It ’s far easier to fling the accusation of “ pharma shill ” about and see if they can get it to stick , as PeterB and his ilk do .
No doubt , may of our readers here at SBM have heard of Godwin ’s Law , which states :
As an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 .
Over the years , an assumed corollary to Godwin ’s Law has become commonly accepted that in essence states that once such an “ argumentum ad Nazium ” is made , the discussion thread is over , and whoever brought up the Hitler or Nazi analogy first automatically loses the debate .
Recently , this corollary was the basis of Scopie ’s Law , which is more relevant to the topics covered on this blog and states :
In any discussion involving science or medicine , citing Whale .to as a credible source loses you the argument immediately … and gets you laughed out of the room .
Over time , I and others have suggested that , although Whale .to is clearly The One Quack Site To Rule Them All , there are at least a few other sites whose promotion of pseudoscience lead them to deserve to be included in Scopie ’s Law , such as NaturalNews.com , Mercola.com , and the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism .
However , I think that there ’s another law , a law similar to the original formulation of Godwin ’s Law , that applies to virtually any online discussion of anything resembling alternative medicine .
Perhaps we could dub it “ Gorski ’s Law , ” and this is what I propose it to say :
As an online discussion of health , in particular vaccines or alternative medicine , grows longer , the probability of the invocation of the ‘ pharma shill gambit ’ approaches one .
If there ’s an exception to this law , other than in moderated forums and ( usually but not always ) here at SBM , I have n’t found it yet .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks tumbled Wednesday , led by the tech - fueled Nasdaq , as a weaker - than - expected new home sales report added to questions about the strength of the economic recovery .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 119 points , or 1.2 % , to close at 9,762.69 .
The S&P 500 ( SPX ) index dropped 21 points , or 2 % , to close at 1,042.63 .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) tumbled 56 points , or 2.7 % , to close at 2,059.61 .
The Dow and S&P have fallen for three of the last four sessions , and the Nasdaq for all three , as investors have turned cautious following a seven - month stock rally .
Since bottoming at a 12 - year low in March , the S&P 500 gained 63 % through its peak on Oct. 19 .
But since then , it 's lost 5 % , as of Wednesday 's close .
Enthusiasm about the largely better - than - expected quarterly earnings reports has been tempered recently by concerns about the still - burgeoning economic recovery .
" There 's been some nervousness over the last week , and today the worry is that the weaker new home sales report means the consumer is still flat on its back , " said Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments .
Gayle said Wednesday 's action shows investors are feeling less willing to take on risk at the moment , a factor made clear by the sector movement .
In particular , the weakness in areas such as retail , financial and technology - and strength in defensive sectors like consumer staples and healthcare .
GDP : Thursday 's reading on gross domestic product growth is the key economic event of the week .
GDP is expected to have grown at a 3.2 % annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at an 0.7 % annualized rate in the second quarter .
GDP has declined steadily for four straight quarters , as Americans have contended with the worst recession since the Great Depression .
But the end of the recession does n't necessarily mean a return to a period of robust growth , particularly amid rising joblessness and still - sluggish consumer spending .
Government stimulus programs have played a big role in the recovery , and there are concerns about the strength of the system once that support winds down .
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department is also due in the morning .
Housing : New home sales fell to a 402,000 unit annualized rate in September from a revised 417,000 unit annualized rate in August , the Commerce Department reported .
Sales were expected to rise to a 440,000 unit annualized rate , according to a consensus of analysts surveyed by Briefing.com .
Durable goods :
Orders for manufactured goods meant to last three years or more rose 1 % in September , after falling 2.6 % in the previous month .
The rise was in line with estimates .
Goods excluding transportation rose 0.9 % after falling 0.4 % in August .
Economists thought they would rise 0.7 % .
Another report showed that fewer metro areas reported jobless rates above 10 % in September than in the previous month .
GMAC seeks bailout : GMAC Financial Services is looking for a third bailout from the Treasury Department , according to a Wall Street Journal report .
The lender is seeking between $ 2.8 billion and $ 5.6 billion , according to the Journal .
The U.S. owns a 35 % stake in GMAC and has given it $ 13.4 billion since December 2008 .
On the move : Financial and technology shares were among the hardest hit stocks Wednesday .
Dow financial components American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) all declined .
Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) were among the other big bank shares sliding .
The KBW Bank index slid 3.3 % .
On the tech side , Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) , Dell ( DELL , Fortune 500 ) , Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) and Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) were among the big losers .
Telecom stocks gained , including Qwest Communications ( Q , Fortune 500 ) , which posted a higher - than - expected quarterly profit and lifted its full - year earnings forecast .
Shares gained 2.6 % .
Dow stock Verizon Communications ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) rallied 3 % after releasing more details about its iPhone challenging Droid smart phone - due for release next week .
The phone uses Google 's Android operating system , has a mini- keyboard and can run several applications at once .
It is expected to retail for $ 199 .
Fellow Dow telecom AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) also gained , rising just short of 2 % .
Currency and commodities :
The dollar fell versus the euro , resuming its slide after a few up days and moving closer to a 14 - month low hit last week .
The greenback fell versus the yen .
U.S. light crude oil for December delivery fell $ 2.09 to settle at $ 77.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
COMEX gold for December delivery fell $ 4.90 to settle at $ 1,030.50 an ounce .
Gold has surpassed records repeatedly this month due to the weak dollar and longer - term worries about inflation .
World markets : Global markets tumbled .
In Europe , London 's FTSE 100 , France 's CAC 40 and Germany 's DAX all lost over 2 % .
Asian markets ended lower .
Bonds :
Treasury prices rose , lowering the yield on the 10 - year note to 3.41 % from 3.44 % Tuesday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Prices held on to gains after the government sold $ 41 billion in five - year notes .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners nearly 9 to one on volume of 1.68 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers almost six to one on volume of 2.81 billion shares .
NAME
Getopt :: Flex
VERSION
version 0.11
SYNOPSIS
use Getopt :: Flex ; my $ foo ; my $use ; my $ num ; my %has ; my @arr ; my $ cfg = { ' non_option_mode ' => ' STOP ' , } ; my $ spec = { ' foo|f ' => {' var ' => \ $ foo , ' type ' => ' Str'} , ' use|u ' => {' var ' => \$use , ' type ' =>
' Bool'} , ' num|n ' => {' var ' => \ $num , ' type ' =>
' Num'} , ' has |h ' => {' var ' => \ %has , ' type ' => ' HashRef [ Int ] '} , ' arr|a ' => {' var ' => \@arr , ' type ' => ' ArrayRef [ Str ] '} } ; my $ op = Getopt : : Flex ->new ( {spec => $ spec , config => $ cfg} ) ; $ op->getopts ( ) ;
DESCRIPTION
Getopt :: Flex is an object - oriented way to go about option parsing .
Creating an option specification is easy and declarative , and configuration is optional and defualts to a few , smart parameters .
Generally , it adheres to the POSIX syntax with GNU extensions for command line options .
As a result , options may be longer than a single letter , and would begin with " - - " .
Support also exists for bundling of command line options , but is not enabled by defualt .
NAME
Getopt :: Flex -
Option parsing , done differently
Getting started with Getopt :: Flex
Getopt :: Flex supports long and single character options .
Any character from [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ? -] may be used when specifying an option .
Options must not end in - , nor may they contain two consecutive dashes .
To use Getopt : : Flex in your perl program , it must contain the following line :
use Getopt :: Flex ;
In the default configuration , bundling is not enabled , long options must start with " - - " and non-options may be placed between options .
Specifying Options
Options are specified by way of a hash whose keys define valid option forms and whose values are hashes which contain information about the options .
For instance ,
my $ spec = { ' file|f ' => { ' var ' => \ $ file , ' type ' => ' Str ' } } ;
Defines a switch called file with an alias f which will set variable $var with a value when encountered during processing .
type specifies the type that the input must conform to .
Both var and type are required when specifying an option .
In general , options must conform to the following :
$ _ =~ m/^[ a - zA - Z0 - 9| _ ?-]+$ / && $ _ !~ m/\|\|/ && $ _ !~ /--/ && $ _ !~ /-$/
The following is an example of all possible arguments to an option specification :
my $ spec = { ' file|f ' => { ' var ' => \ $ file , ' type ' => ' Str ' , ' desc ' =>
' The file to process ' , ' required ' => 1 , ' validator ' => sub { $ _ [ 0 ] =~ /\.txt$ / } , ' callback ' => sub { print " File found
" } , ' default ' => ' input.txt ' , } } ;
Specifying a var
When specifying a var , you must provide a reference to the variable , and not the variable itself .
So \$file is ok , while $ file is not .
You may also pass in an array reference or a hash reference , please see " Specifying a type " for more information .
Specifying a type
A valid type is one of the following :
Bool Str Num Int ArrayRef [ Str ] ArrayRef [ Num ] ArrayRef [ Int ] HashRef [ Str ] HashRef[ Num ] HashRef [ Int ]
Inc
These work like exactly like Moose type constraints of the same name , except Inc .
Inc defines an incremental type ( actually simply an alias for Moose 's Int type ) , whose value will be increased by one each time its appropriate switch is encountered on the command line .
When using an ArrayRef type , the supplied var must be an array reference , like \@arr and NOT @arr .
Likewise , when using a HashRef type , the supplied var must be a hash reference , e.g. \ %hash and NOT % hash .
For more information about types , see Moose : : Manual : : Types .
All of the following arguments to the option specification are optional .
Specifying a desc
desc is used to provide a description for an option .
It can be used to provide an autogenerated help message for that switch .
If left empty , no information about that switch will be displayed in the specification .
See " Using Getopt : : Flex " for more information .
Specifying required
Setting required to a true value will cause it make that value required during option processing , and if it is not found will cause an error condition .
Specifying a validator
A validator is a function that takes a single argument and returns a boolean value .
Getopt :: Flex will call the validator function when the option is encountered on the command line and pass to it the value it finds .
If the value does not pass the supplied validation check , an error condition is caused .
Specifying a callback
A callback is a function that takes a single argument which Getopt : : Flex will then call when the option is encountered on the command line , passing to it the value it finds .
Specifying a default
defaults come in two flavors , raw values and subroutine references .
For instance , one may specify a string as a default value , or a subroutine which returns a string :
' default ' => ' some string '
or
' default ' => sub { return "
" }
When specifying a default for an array or hash , it is necessary to use a subroutine to return the reference like ,
' default ' => sub { {} }
or
' default ' => sub { [ ] }
This is due to the way Perl handles such syntax .
Additionally , defaults must be valid in relation to the specified type and any specified validator function .
If not , an error condition is signalled .
Configuring Getopt :: Flex
Configuration of Getopt :: Flex is very simple .
Such a configuration is specified by a hash whose keys are the names of configuration option , and whose values indicate the configuration .
Below is a configuration with all possible options :
my $ cfg = { ' non_option_mode ' => ' STOP ' , ' bundling ' => 0 , ' long_option_mode ' => ' SINGLE_OR_DOUBLE ' , ' usage ' => ' foo [ OPTIONS ... ]
[ FILES ... ] ' , ' desc ' =>
' Use foo to manage your foo archives ' } ;
What follows is a discussion of each option .
Configuring non_option_mode
non_option_mode tells the parser what to do when it encounters anything which is not a valid option to the program .
Possible values are as follows :
STOP IGNORE
STOP indicates that upon encountering something that is n't an option , stop processing immediately .
IGNORE is the opposite , ignoring everything that is n't an option .
The default value is IGNORE .
Configuring bundling
bundling is a boolean indicating whether or not bundled switches may be used .
A bundled switch is something of the form :
- laR
Where equivalent unbundled representation is :
-l -a -R
By turning bundling on , long_option_mode will automatically be set to REQUIRE_DOUBLE_DASH .
Configuring long_option_mode
This indicates what long options should look like .
It may assume the following values :
REQUIRE_DOUBLE_DASH
SINGLE_OR_DOUBLE
REQUIRE_DOUBLE_DASH is the default .
Therefore , by default , options that look like :
-- verbose
Will be treated as valid , and :
-verbose
Will be treated as invalid .
Setting long_option_mode to SINGLE_OR_DOUBLE would make the second example valid as well .
Attempting to set bundling to 1 and long_option_mode to SINGLE_OR_DOUBLE will signal an error .
Configuring usage
usage may be set with a string indicating appropriate usage of the program .
It will be used to provide help automatically .
Configuring desc
desc may be set with a string describing the program .
It will be used when providing help automatically .
Using Getopt :: Flex
Using Getopt :: Flex is simple .
You define a specification , as described above , optionally define a configuration , as desribed above , and then construct a new Getopt : : Flex object .
my $ spec = { ' foo|f ' => {' var ' => \ $ foo , ' type ' =>
' Str'} , } ; my $ op = Getopt : : Flex ->new ( {spec => $ spec} ) ;
You then call $ op- getopts ( ) > to process options .
Getopt :: Flex automatically uses the global @ARGV array for options .
If you would like to supply your own , you may use set_args , like this :
$ op->set_args ( \@args ) ;
Which expects an array reference .
Getopt :: Flex also stores information about valid options , invalid options and extra options .
Valid options are those which Getopt :: Flex recognized as valid , and invalid are those that were not .
Anything that is not an option can be found in extra options .
These values can be retrieved via :
my @va = $ op->get_valid_args ( ) ; my @ia = $ op->get_invalid_args ( ) ; my @ea = $ op->get_extra_args ( ) ;
Getopt :: Flex may also be used to provide an automatically formatted help message .
By setting the appropriate desc when specifying an option , and by setting usage and desc in the configuration , a full help message can be provided , and is available via :
my $ help = $ op-> get_help ( ) ;
Usage and description are also available , via :
my $ usage = $ op -> get_usage ( ) ; my $ desc = $ op->get_desc ( ) ;
An automatically generated help message would look like this :
Usage : foo [ OPTIONS ... ]
[ FILES ...]
Use this to manage your foo files Options : -- alpha , -- beta , Pass any greek letters to this argument -- delta , --eta , -- gamma -b , -- bar When set , indicates to use bar -f , -- foo Expects a string naming the foo

So much is happening with the Food Network this fall !
Not only did they just release a video game ( for which we have a contest for : Cook or Be Cooked Wii Game ) but this is definitely the month when people really want to cuddle up in sweaters and cook warm , delicious foods in the kitchen by the hearth ( or whatever passes for a hearth these days ) .
Food Network gets into the feasting spirit with brand new specials and Thanksgiving - themed episodes of viewers ’ favorite shows .
Rachael Ray , Giada De Laurentiis , Sandra Lee , and Claire Robinson among others share their favorite recipes and tips for incredible Thanksgiving meals .
Food Network favorites answer viewers ’ questions during two primetime specials – Dear Food Network : Thanksgiving Top 10 premiering Monday , November 16th at 9 pm and Dear Food Network : Giada ’s Thanksgiving Family Therapy premiering Tuesday , November 17th at 9 pm .
Guy Fieri looks back at some of his favorite moments in Diner ’s Drive-ins and Dives : Best from the Road on Friday , November 27th at 10 pm .
I am especially interested in these Food Network specials because who DOESN’T want a way to literally spice up the traditional Thanksgiving menu ?
I ’m even considering trying to go from yams with marshmallows to a more elegant Sweet Potato Pie recipe .
( But brace yourselves , it ’ll probably get burnt no matter what it is . )
Aida ’s Thanksgiving episode is going to feature Apple - Sage Roast Turkey with Whole Wheat Stuffing .
Whole wheat is so much healthier for you ( although it DOES make you fuller faster – maybe not great for Turkey Day … ) so that ’s a good tip for those who are health conscious .
And I really love incorporating apples everywhere in Fall foods .
But Secrets of a Restaurant Chef is going to show us Apple Cider Gravy and Sausage , Apple , and Walnut Stuffing paired with Anne ’s Brined Herb Crusted Turkey which sounds a little bit better in terms of a combination .
It still has apples !
( I love apples , yes .
I could live off of apple crisp for an entire day ! )
Anyway , instead of green bean casserole I ’d love to try my hand at making Spicy Brown Sugar Carrots as passed down to us on Sandra ’s Money Saving Meals .
Hell , I wanna make them more now that I know they ’re good for people on a budget .
( I seriously do not care if the government is saying the recession is over , money is always tight with me ! )
I fully believe in honoring traditions , but making new ones can really be just as fun .
I know I wo n’t be trying to make everyone in my family do everything differently for this meal , but a few new surprises could be interesting .
Below I have a massive list of times and dates for Food Network shows in November :

YouTube 's System for removing videos is being abused and many users with opposing views have resorted to false flaging , votebotting ( running software that auto votes one star on videos ) and filing false DMCA notices on users in an effort to silence them .
Many people who have been unfairly censored have tried many things ( email , mirroring videos , phoning ... ) to try and get google to reform their broken system but to no avail .
This is a call to action , YouTube is the largest video sharing site in the world and the users demand reform !
Please sign the petition to help get the message across to google that freedom of speech is vital to every society .
We the undersigned YouTube is by far the largest personal video sharing site in the world , hence the YOU in YouTube .
It is a great service that google provides to millions of people world wide and is truly a great advance in technology .
Over the past years technology and law have clashed .
The tools set in place on YouTube to protect intellectual property are being abused with the intent to silence people unfairly , therefore hindering freedom of speech .
Quite frankly the false flagging system on YouTube is broken .
Many efforts by many people have been made to contact Google / YouTube but to no avail .
This has left people with the loss of years ' worth of work and partners with loss of income and an overall feeling of helplessness .
The consensus is that Google does not care about their user base , and that it is time that we stopped tolerating how Google is ignoring them and alienating them .
The problem has grown exponentially .
Emails , phone calls and mirroring videos have had no effect .
So now we are left to taking this matter to other media outlets .
This petition is the first step in what will become an ongoing effort to have Google publicly address this issue and reform the broken flagging system on youTube .
What is at stake here is freedom of speech .
Google 's motto is " Dont be evil " and it is time they were held accountable for adhering to running their site in accordance with their intent , as stated in YouTube 's community guidelines , to " Encourage free speech and defend everyone 's right to express unpopular points of view . "
By Cathy Young - December 3 , 2009
As the news of golf superstar Tiger Woods ' alleged multiple affairs spills all over the media , a fascinating - and disturbing - subplot to the story has become a revealing litmus test of societal attitudes toward gender and domestic violence .
Persistent rumors allege that the November 27 car accident in which Woods hit a fire hydrant and then a tree while backing out of his driveway around 2:30 a.m. was linked to an assault on the golfer by his wife Elin Nordegren - and that the cuts and bruises on Woods ' face were the result of the assault , not the accident .
These claims have been strongly denied by the police and by others ; the official version is that Nordegren rushed to her husband 's aid after the accident and smashed the car window with a golf club to free him .
Nonetheless , further tales of marital fighting will no doubt be fueled by Woods ' confession on December 2 to unspecified " transgressions " against his family and by new allegations of a recorded voice - mail message in which he supposedly tells his mistress his wife has found her number on his phone .
Whether or not the assault actually took place , the truly remarkable thing is that some voices in the feminist corner of the media have rushed either to defend it or to excuse it .
The Daily Beast website ran a piece by culture correspondent Rebecca Dana under the title " The Year of Women Fighting Back , " asserting that if Elin Nordegren did attack her cheating husband with a golf club , she belongs in the company of other scorned or betrayed women who have stood up to their no - good men .
On Slate.com and its soon - too - fold female - oriented offshoot , DoubleX , journalist Hannah Rosin does not go quite so far as to cheer an alleged perpetrator .
However , she speculates that Woods may have lied about the incident to spare his wife the arrest she would have faced under gender - neutral domestic violence laws - God forbid that " the glamorous Elin would be led out of their mansion in handcuffs " - and then proceeds to decry the absurdity of the gender - neutral approach .
Rosin readily concedes that if the roles were reversed and the rumors were about Woods assaulting his wife , even over a possible infidelity , " we would be a lot less ambivalent and complacent " - and if his wife had tried to cover up for him , we would appalled .
But , in her view , " all of these gender - dependent reactions make some instinctive sense . "
Yet one person 's common sense is another 's noxious cultural stereotype .
For vast numbers of people , it makes " instinctive sense " to feel that a mother with young children who spends long hours at work is bad mother but a father who does the same is a good provider , or that it is humiliating for a man but not for a woman to have a spouse with a more successful career , or that the opportunity to excel in athletics is more important to boys than to girls .
One does n't hear feminists defending these particular gender - based assumptions - quite the contrary .
Of course differences in size and strength can be legitimately taken into consideration in cases of assault , regardless of gender or relationship .
A small , slightly built person punching a taller , heavier , more muscular person is far less likely to do damage than the bigger person punching the smaller one .
But the male advantage in size and strength can be neutralized by a woman 's use of weapons - such as golf clubs - and by the constraints inculcated in the vast majority of men against using force toward a woman , even in self - defense .
To suggest that cultural complacency toward female - on - male violence should extend not only to slapping and shoving but to acts capable of causing serious injury is not only bizarre but offensive .
Chastising men's rights groups for using the Tiger Woods story to promote awareness of men as victims of domestic violence , Rosin dismisses the female abuser as a myth unsupported by " sociological research . "
Never mind that some of the most prominent sociologists specializing in domestic violence research , such as Murray Straus of the University of New Hampshire , have written extensively about abuse as a two - way street ( though recognizing that male violence poses a higher risk of harm ) .
A review of hundreds of studies , published in 2000 by British psychologist John Archer of the University of Central Lancashire , found that women are as likely to initiate partner violence as men and that male victims account for a third of domestic violence injuries .
But Rosin ignores this vast research , much of it done by women , in favor of a single " expert " on " the myth of the battered husband syndrome " : Jack Straton , an assistant professor of University Studies at Portland State University whose Ph.D. is in quantum physics and whose background in domestic violence is that of a feminist activist , not a scholar .
Yes , Rosin admits , there are some female perpetrators , but generally " women tend to use violence as self defense , or impulsively , not as a systematic method of control the way male abusers do " : while " they may slap a man or throw a cup of water at him , " they are " less likely " to engage in real abuse .
Therefore , she concludes , if Elin Nordegren really did assault her husband , the best course of action for him is to show " chivalry " and cover up for her .
Imagine the response to someone who tried to argue for a more lenient attitude toward wife - beaters who use violence impulsively rather than for systematic control - or who suggested that , since most male violence in the home consists of shoving , grabbing , or slaps without injury , a husband who leaves his wife with a bruised and bloodied face should be left off the hook .
That person would be promptly denounced as an apologist for abusers .
Domestic abuse may not be a " 50/50 issue , " as some men's rights activists claim .
Even researchers such as Straus who acknowledge the reality and importance of female violence in the home agree that male violence toward women is rightly a greater cause of concern .
But this does not mean that male victims do not deserve attention and services .
A double standard that excuses female violence is not " common sense " but common sexism .
However , speculation that Mr Fernandez might have had something to do with the death of Hector Saldana arose when it emerged that the barefoot , blindfolded corpse of " Black Saldana " had not been found until three and a half hours after the mayor 's speech , according to Mexico City prosecutors .
The body - which was found hundreds of miles away - was not identified until two days later .
Cool ads push the boundaries of what is acceptable , helping us to think in new and exciting ways .
But some just cross the line into downright creepiness …
15 . Toyota Prius – Killer
Image via alexisgentry
This spectacularly creepy advert from Toyota depicts a man dumping a body into a lake , with the line ‘ Well at least he drives a Prius ’ .
Suggesting that driving a Toyota can forgive all your sins is just downright too far – let ’s just hope this did n’t give anyone any ideas …
14 . NSPCC – Anti-Child Abuse
Image via trendhunter
This billboard is the visual equivalent of the following conversation : ‘ Where ’s Archie mommy ? ’
‘ He ’s dead .
I killed him with a hatchet . ’
Apart from the fact the scarily realistic blood is grotesque , surely this billboard would be even more creepy for kids on a day out in the back of the car ?
Mommy and Daddy have a surprise for you when we get home … and it ’s not nice .
13 . JBS Underwear – Women Behaving Badly
These ads for JBS underwear feature shots of semi-naked women doing things in stereotypically male fashion , such as having beer with breakfast , or reading a mag on the toilet .
Not only does this campaign , which bears the tagline ‘ Men do n’t want to look at men naked ’ , border on softcore porn , but it hits a little too close to home for many mens ’ tastes – hot girls having beer for breakfast ?
Nice .
But burping on the toilet …
12 . Use Condoms
This advert seems amusing enough but manages to leave a distinctly creepy taste in the mouth by implicitly begging the question , how many of us were noisy , messy , bratty mistakes ?
11 . IGN Surrogates – Sexy Robots
Image via flicks
These posters have been all over NYC and use sexually provocative poses with the jarring addition of sections of exposed mechanical insides .
Although everyone loves a saucy fembot , the juxtaposition between evil mechanical robot and sensual feminine flesh makes for uncomfortable viewing .
10 . Tampax – Red
Image via adsoftheworld
Adverts for women ’s hygiene products always have massive potential to creep people out .
The sheer volume of red on display here becomes nauseating as we gradually understand what this advert is getting at – anything that so forcefully and boldly draws attention to what really goes on down there really is just creepy ( at least , for men ) .
9. Virgin Trains – Animal Sex Party
This advert is meant to showcase the environmental perks of Virgin Trains in the UK , an idea that is fairly amusing – people dressing up as furry animals and pretending to ‘ do it ’ so often is – it ’s the over the top execution that becomes slightly disturbing .
Rabbits doing it one - leg - up against a tree sets alarm bells ringing , but for us the creepy line is crossed when a flock of sheep tackle a bumble bee before gang - raping the poor thing .
If that is n’t creepy , we do n’t know what is .
8. Dolce & Gabbana – Rose Tinted Glasses
Although this raunchy commercial sets pulses racing , when the glasses are taken off and the hot girl spanking herself is revealed to be a rotund cleaning woman , we ca n’t help but feel a little freaked out .
What ’s more , it draws attention to the subversive nature of all advertising : presenting things through rose tinted glasses , in their best light – as such it provides a creepy reminder of the way advertising manipulates our lives on a daily basis .
6. Comfeze – Canadian Men In Diapers
This at first seems like a crappy ad for diapers , and features a load of men running around in diapers with the line ‘ now your big guy does n’t have to worry about a thing ’ .
But by the end of the commercial we realize that the diapers are needed because the men can’t help but wet themselves whilst watching horror channel , Scream TV .
The combination of weird kiddy music and men frolicking around in diapers before weeing themselves , is more than a little bit creepy .
5. Pakistani Airlines 1979 – Twin Towers
Image in public domain , via randomdribble
This is n’t strictly speaking an example of ‘ subversive advertising ’ , but we felt merited a place in the list .
The ad is real and meant to show the glory and cosmopolitan nature of PIA – Pakistani Airlines – but the shadow of a plane looming large on the twin towers comes off as extremely creepy in retrospect , especially given the irony that it is an ad for a Muslim country ’s airlines .
4. Hansaplast Condoms – My Mom Said I Could
The weird combination of slighty - cute , slightly - mischevious boy who gets up to no good and justifies himself with the phrase , ‘ my mom said I could ’ , and the twist at the end where we realize all mom says every day is ‘ Oui ! ’
Oui ! ’ as she enjoys herself in the bedroom , or worse , services another client ….
that ’s just creepy .
3.Deutsch Magazine – Dogs on Heat
Image via shockvertsiements
Not much explanation needed here .
This ad does not hold back on the bestiality and really does cross the line into downright scariness .
We sincerely hope there are n’t people out there doing this – and in any case what impression does Deutsch magazine hope to give with this ad ?
2.French Anti-Aids Campaign
Image via shockvertsiements
These graphic and disturbing ads are part of a real life AIDS campaign conducted in France .
They consist of images of a man having sex with a giant , black scorpion , and a woman receiving oral sex from an enormous , hairy tarantula , and once again , although they get the point across , we ’re not sure if psychologically we ’re any better off for it .
1. Plane Stupid – Polar Bears Falling From the Sky
This sickening ad admonishing us to think twice before booking flights works around the idea that ‘ your flight has an impact ’ .
It takes this idea to extremes when it features polar bears falling out of the sky and impacting on hard tarmac , before panning out to show them lying bloodied and broken .
Climate change is bad , yes we get the picture , but is the reality really so direct and if it is , do we really need to see it like this ?
And should our kids see it ?

A Political Who ’s Who Of Global Warming Liars
By Alan Caruba
As the global warming fraud unravels , it ’s a good time to look at the politicians who have been some of the most outspoken advocates , using global warming / climate change to advance “ Cap - and - Trade ” legislation and other related laws and regulations .
Top of the list is President Barack Obama who has made many references to “ climate change ” and “ global warming ” to further this national and international fraud .
He ’ll pick up his Nobel Peace Prize in December ; the same one given to Al Gore and the United Nation ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a few years back .
Further proof of his mendacity will be his attendance at the UN Climate Change Conference in Denmark .
Speaking on World Environment Day last June , Obama said of global warming , “ We ’re going to have to make some tough decisions and take concrete actions if we are going to deal with a potentially cataclysmic disaster . ”
This mirrors years of similar doomsday statements by former Vice President Al Gore .
This is the kind of drivel Americans and others around the world have heard from their supposed “ leaders ” for far too long .
As we move through the congressional hierarchy , one of the biggest prevaricators about global warming / climate change has been Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi ( D - C ) and her counterpart in the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , manages to wheeze about it from time to time .
Former presidential candidate , Sen. John Kerry , ( D - MA ) has been leading the fight for “ Cap - and - Trade ” but after much reflection former presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain ( R - AZ ) concluded his support of global warming was a mistake .
Sen .
Kerry said that failure to pass the Senate version of “ Cap - and - Trade ” ( of greenhouse gas emission credits ) would be comparable to another 9/11 .
He also has blamed tornadoes on global warming .
The man is a complete idiot .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) has uttered every global warming falsehood and has been joined by Rep. Edward Markey ( D - MA ) and Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
All three have played a critical role in advancing the “ Cap - and - Trade ” bill despite the fact that it is a massive tax on energy use and based on a lie .
Writing for the Huffington Post in October , Sen .
Boxer said , “ Global Warming is one of the greatest challenges of our generation .
Addressing this challenge also represents enormous opportunities for economic recovery and long term prosperity . ”
Her commentary was titled , “ Telling the Whole Story on Global Warming ” !
Never mind that global warming has been the excuse environmental groups have used to stop the building of coal - fired plants , nuclear plants , drilling for oil offshore in our continental shelf , et cetera .
There ’s no economic recovery to be found in so - called “ green jobs ” and prosperity is a small light at the end of a very long tunnel as the result of the Obama administration ’s investments in “ renewable energy ” and massive increase of our national debt .
Among the other politicians hovering around Cap - and - Trade have been Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.VA ) , Sen . Max Baucus ( D - Mont ) , and Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) .
Sen .
Bingaman is a big fan of “ renewable energy ” ( solar and wind ) and proposed a nationwide renewable electricity standard even though it provides barely one percent of all the electricity Americans need and use every day .
Among the nation ’s prominent governors , California ’s Arnold Schwarzenegger has been vocal about environmental issues , many of which have left Californians trapped by idiotic measures ranging from restrictions on fireplaces in new homes or the purchase of large screen television sets .
California ’s failure to anticipate its growing need for electricity has left it dependent on importing it from other states .
Meanwhile , over at the Environmental Protection Agency , they are using global warming to justify securing the right to regulate carbon dioxide emissions , claiming that they “ cause ” a global warming .
The expose of the phony “ scientific ” data behind this massive fraud should , if truth mattered , end this power grab .
The ability to regulate CO2 is the ability to control the use of all energy in the nation .
That should be stopped !
Alone among his colleagues , Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma ( R ) has been the one outstanding voice for reason and for truth about global warming .
The odds are that history will not give his courageous effort to expose the massive fraud the recognition he deserves .
The nation owes him a debt of gratitude .
The lesson we can draw from this is that the next time any U.S. Senator or Representative , let alone the President and any member of his Cabinet , says anything positive about “ global warming ” or refers to “ climate change ” to justify some action , they are lying to you .

In a particularly good episode of the particularly good US remake of The Office , Pam ( American for Dawn ) happens upon her boss Michael Scott ( American for David Brent ) , standing in his office , naked .
Michael affects glorious indignation and reaches for a defence that is very much of the American zeitgeist : " European offices are naked all the time . "
Ah Europe !
So louche !
So permissive !
So je ne sais quoi !
No , really – je ne sais quoi the hell Europe is , because it seems to be many things to America , none of them particularly good .
But it is useful , because should you find yourself in America and you wish to describe something as bad but do n't quite have an argument to explain its badness , then you can just call it European " .
This is surely a more useful hint to tourists than to ask for " the bathroom " instead of " the toilet " .
It is also a slight shift from how " European " was used in the Bush years , when it meant something a bit fey , a bit pretentious , and a bit unsupportive of Bush .
Now , European means something even worse .
But what , precisely ?
Let 's investigate .
The Amanda Knox case – truly , a Henry James story gone very , very wrong – brought out all sorts of horrified references to " Europe . "
CBS
News legal expert Lisa Bloom partly blamed Knox 's conviction on " tabloid accounts throughout Europe " and expressed outrage over the trial from " an American point of view . "
Now , one can say much about the fairness or otherwise of this case .
But making it into an " upright America versus dodgy foreigners " issue is rarely a successful tactic , as Roman Polanski could testify , and we will return to that foreigner in a tick , or as we Americans say , in a sec .
Earlier this year , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused President Obama of " an audacious effort to Europeanise the country " .
Sadly , he did not mean that Obama was building an Eiffel Tower in Wichita and encouraging the population to develop a fondness for Robbie Williams , but rather that he was " governing from the left " .
The healthcare issue is this year 's most well - known , or at least most dragged out " European " threat to America , and as Jill Lepore wrote in last week 's New Yorker , this is not new .
When universal healthcare was proposed in 1916 , critics wailed that it was " made in Germany " , and it was duly rejected .
Germany is no longer the evil spectre it was then , but threats of dentist - deprived bad teeth ( so European ! ) are .
It is a mystery , though , how Americans cope when they visit " Europe " , what with all the dead bodies lying in the streets .
It 's not just Americans who have defined the term " European " .
The French made the Polanski case into an issue of permissive Europe ( or , at least , Europe minus Switzerland ) versus prudish America .
This has not exactly worked to the director 's benefit .
Ironically , it has worked to America 's benefit , allowing American news networks to frequently ignore support for Polanski in their own country , referring to Polanski 's supporters as " European film - makers " .
This group includes the European likes of Harvey Weinstein , Wes Anderson and Whoopi Goldberg .
Nor is this just about news stories .
Paul Auster is repeatedly described as an author with a " European sensibility " , suggesting that American book reviewers see " European " as meaning " repetitive and narcissistic , with a particular appeal to self - important male undergraduates . "
Craig Kennedy , in the Globalist , described Obama favourably as " ' European ' – not by birth , but by sensibility " ( make that " not by birth " point very , very clear , Craig ) .
Which would make Tony Blair , presumably , American .
So to recap , to be " European " is to be a jailer of American innocents , killer of grannies , supporter of statutory rapists , author of boring books , and the president .
Well , at least Michael Scott got the naked offices right .
We got another one !
That was not , sadly , quite the headline in the Jewish Journal announcing Chelsea Clinton 's upcoming marriage to Marc Mezvinsky , but it was n't far off : " Chelsea Clinton engaged to Marc Mezvinsky , a Jew . "
Did you get the point ?
He 's Jewish !
Hey , did I mention he 's JEWISH ????!!!
The recent years have been good to us Jews in terms of recruitment by marital alliances .
We got a Trump ( Ivanka ) , a Gore ( Karenna ) , almost certainly an imminent Bush ( Lauren , long - term girlfriend of David - son - of - Ralph Lauren ) , and we nearly got Lindsay Lohan ( thanks to ex- girlfriend Samantha Ronson ) – although , frankly , who has n't almost got Lindsay at one point ?
But it 's Chelsea with whom I would particularly like to share a pew and a phonetically written Hebrew prayer book .
I 've always liked Chelsea and perhaps that 's because I could sense her innate Jew - ness : she has smart yet often embarrassing parents ; she is a hard worker ; and she has suffered the indignities of difficult hair .
Chelsea , welcome home .
But let 's look back at our alpha – sorry , aleph – list : all women , marrying our boys .
I partly blame Judd Apatow for the recent slew .
As much as I love the Apatow oeuvre , it can grate on a Jewess 's nerves that the happy ending is often " Jewish schmuck gets hot shiksa . "
Oy vay !
But before I start ripping up my hupa , US men 's magazine Details is here to fight my corner with its article , The Rise of the Hot Jewish Girl .
Apparently , we Jewesses are the " ethnic fetish du jour " , despite our " frigidity , whininess and big hair . "
" There can be something creepy about wanting to dominate a Jewish chick , " the writer , Christopher Noxon , admits furtively .
Indeed there can , Christopher , when it 's you making the offer .
Gosh , wo n't we miss the men's magazine industry when it finally dies , ooh , next year ?
LISBON , Portugal — Portugal 's Socialist government has drawn up a proposal that would make Portugal the sixth European country to allow gay marriage .
The law is almost certain to pass , as the center - left Socialist government has the support of all left - of - center parties , who together have a majority in Parliament .
Right - of - center parties oppose the measure .
The proposal changes Portuguese law to remove references to marriage being between two people of different sexes , Cabinet Minister Pedro Silva Pereira told a news conference Thursday , adding the government will send its proposal to lawmakers for a debate , probably in January .
If approved by Parliament , the proposed law goes to Portugal 's conservative President Anibal Cavaco Silva , who can ratify or veto it .
A veto can be overturned by Parliament .
If there is no presidential veto , the first gay marriage ceremonies could take place in April -- a month before Pope Benedict XVI is due on a four - day official visit .
Gay marriage is currently permitted in five European countries -- Belgium , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and Norway .
In Portugal , an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country , previous efforts to introduce gay marriage have run into strong resistance from religious groups and conservative lawmakers .
Pedro Corte - Real , head of the Portuguese delegation of ILGA , the International Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Trans and Intersex Association , said the proposal was a vindication of his group 's battle to end sexual discrimination .
" We have been fighting for this for years , " he told The AP .
In July , the Constitutional Court upheld the country 's ban on gay marriage , rejecting an appeal by two lesbians seeking to wed .
It said the constitution , while granting equal rights , did not state that same - sex marriages must be permitted .

Conspiracy theorists awaiting Wednesday night 's premiere of " Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura " might take interest in a curious comment Ventura made in the Los Angeles Times this weekend .
Ventura , who has been doing the media rounds promoting his new venture on TruTV , told the paper that MSNBC cancelled his show " Jesse Ventura 's America " in 2003 because he did not support the Iraq War .
He said the network " in essence " paid him to be silent , which allowed him to purchase a house in Mexico .
This is not your first venture into TV hosting since leaving the governorship .
What happened to " Jesse Ventura 's America , " which ran briefly on MSNBC in 2003 ?
It was awful .
I was basically silenced .
When I came out of office , I was the hottest commodity out there .
There was a bidding war between CNN , Fox and MSNBC to get my services .
MSNBC ultimately won .
I was being groomed for a five day - a - week TV show by them .
Then , all of a sudden , weird phone calls started happening : " Is it true Jesse does n't support the war in Iraq ? "
My contract said I could n't do any other cable TV or any news shows , and they honored and paid it for the duration of it .
So in essence I had my silence purchased .
Why do you think you did n't hear from me for three years ?
I was under contract .
They would n't even use me as a consultant !
When you live in Mexico , your houses all have names .
I almost named my house Casa MSNBC because they bought it .
I was paid like a professional athlete , and I got very wealthy .
For doing nothing .
When Ventura 's show was cancelled in 2003 , a Star Tribune article noted that he was receiving " a reported " $ 2 million annually -- certainly enough to live comfortably in Baja .
A source " close to the production " said at the time that the show was cancelled because of high production costs .
MSNBC did not respond to a request for comment this morning about the allegation , which has been re-reported on several media blogs .
Though it seems like a fresh swipe at the network ( and an odd one since they are considered liberal ) , a search of the Star Tribune archives - most of which is no longer available online - reveals that Ventura made the same claim in 2004 .
[ Ventura ] said he no longer talks to news reporters partly because of media accounts of his son's parties in the governor 's mansion and partly because of his exclusive contract with the cable - TV network MSNBC .
Network spokesman Jeremy Gaines told the Associated Press that Ventura 's contract only governs his television appearances .
" They wo n't put me on the air because I opposed the Iraq war from Day 1 , " he said of the network .
" I honor my contract because they send me a check every two weeks . "
Update : MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines declined to comment via e-mail on Ventura 's accusations .
Gilad Shalit 's parents are concerned by the images of their son , as seen in the Hamas videotape Friday , the captured soldier 's father said Friday night during a brief statement .
" Aviva and I are concerned in the face of the images we saw , " Noam Shalit told the numerous media representatives gathered outside the family home in northern Israel .
" We must not forget that Gilad is suffering and rotting in the Hamas prison . "
Gilad 's father added that family members expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue working towards securing the soldier 's release .
" We thank the negotiating team headed by Hagai Hadas , " Noam Shalit said .
" At the same time , the family expects negotiations to continue determinedly until Gilad can go back home . "
Noam Shalit 's statement marked the family 's first response to the tape .
' Hello , this is Gilad ' After 1,195 days in captivity , Gilad Shalit was seen for the first time in a Hamas videotape released for publication Friday afternoon .
The roughly two - and - a - half minute video shows Gilad facing the camera .
The captive soldier holds a newspaper from September 14th and appears to be in sound mental condition .
In the tape , Shalit says : " Hello , this is Gilad , son of Noam and Aviva Shalit , brother of Hadas and Yoel , who lives in Mitzpe Hila .
My ID number is 397029 .
As you can see I am holding today 's Falasteen newspaper published in Gaza .
I read the newspaper in order to find information about myself , and in hopes of reading about information of my return home and my imminent release . "
Gilad then continues : " I hope the current government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu does n't waste this opportunity to reach an agreement and as a result , allow me to fulfill my dream and be released . "
Addressing his parents and siblings , Gilad says : " I wish to send my well - wishes to my family and tell them that I love them and miss them greatly , and hope for the day I 'll see them again .
Dad , Yoel , and Hadas , do you remember the day you arrived at my base in the Golan Heights , on December 31 , 2005 ?
We toured around the base and you took a picture of me on a Merkava tank and on one of the old tanks at the entrance to the base .
Later we went to a restaurant in one of the Druze villages and on the way we took pictures on the side of the road , against the backdrop of the snowy Hermon Mountain . "
" I want to tell you that I feel well in medical terms , and that the Mujahidin from the al - Qassam Brigades are treating me excellently .
Thank you very much and goodbye , " Gilad concludes .
Gilad 's parents , Noam and Aviva , watched the tape privately in their home earlier in the day , and later granted the Prime Minister 's Office permission to publicize it .
Prince of Wales Borrowed Money Then Paid Them Later
The Prince of Wales , Prince Charles reportedly borrowed around 3000 pounds in 2007 from his protection officers and later paid them .
He was short with money at that time and needed it for travel expenses .
The British throne heir paid via Clarence House 2,744.34 pounds ( 3,029 euros , 4,461 dollars ) December 4 , 2007 .
Scotland Yard cashed in the cheques December 17 of the same year .
Members of the royal family are not expected to be bringing cash or credit cards during travels abroad so they sometimes ask their protection guards money for expenses .
They pay them later of course .
However no one from Scotland Yard nor from Clarence House would confirm the 2007 incident .
Prince Charles earned around 16.46 million pounds last year from the Duchy of Cornwall while the government from the taxpayers ’ funds gave him three million pounds .
The last time the Prince was out of the country was last month when he went to Turkey and Uganda with his wife Camille , Duchess of Cornwall .
DNC circulates Palin memo ; ' God Bless '
The Democratic National Committee has been , for days emailing reporters gleefully about Sarah Palin 's media blitz , feeding the flames of what officials there see as a distraction for and a threat to the Republican Party .
This morning , they 're circulating a memo to local press in the places where Palin 's book tour is stopping , summarizing the voluminous Palin coverage and making the case that the memoir is " political payback " and " fiction . "
" This book tour has only reinforced the tabloid aspects of her profile , wasted a platform to add substance , driven deeper the schisms in the Republican party and sucked the oxygen out of the room for anyone else to emerge .
So , God bless , " email DNC Press Secretary Hari Sevugan .
The full memo is after the jump .
DNC MEMO
In advance of Sarah Palin ’s stop in Michigan today , please find below everything you need to know about Going Rogue – a memoir that has been received as 1 ) political payback for Palin ’s rivals that adds to the tabloid nature of her profile rather than provide a display of substantive policy chops that would reset her ability to be taken as a serious leader ; and 2 ) substantively more fiction than fact compounding the credibility problems she earned during the 2008 campaign .
These factors are reflected in recent polling which shows extraordinary disapproval numbers and small minorities who feel she 's qualified to be President .
The sensational nature of Palin 's book continues to dominate news cycles - and does so to the detriment of the Republican Party .
Combined with her dismal polling numbers and Republican willingness to cede the party to her and her polarizing tea party following , the political impact of her re-emergence , spells political disaster for the GOP going into 2010 and beyond .

PALIN CREDIBILITY CONTINUES TO PLUMMET :
Lie # 1 : Palin Lies About Family ’s Role In Her VP Decision : “ In a segment of her interview with Oprah Winfrey , which was posted online but did not air on television , Sarah Palin was asked whether her family had voted on her decision to accept John McCain 's offer to join him on the Republican ticket in August of 2008 .
‘ This time , there was n't a family vote , ’ Palin told Winfrey … But in September of 2008 , Palin told an entirely different story to Fox News ' Sean Hannity .
‘ What was your family 's reaction ? ’
Hannity asked .
‘ Was there time to huddle and have a hockey team meeting ? ’
‘ It was a time of asking the girls to vote on it , anyway , ’ Palin told Hannity .
‘ And they voted unanimously , yes ... ’ ” [ CBS News , 11/16/09 ]
Lie # 2 : Palin Blames McCain Campaign For Clothing Controversy : “ Palin has devoted a dismayingly prominent chunk of her book to scapegoating communications aide Nicolle Wallace for supposedly forcing her to wear designer clothes .
This claim is preposterous .
No one aspiring to be vice president of the United States takes orders from a communications aide .
The purchases themselves are fully documented in RNC records , including $ 75,062.63 at Neiman Marcus and $ 49,425.74 at two Saks locations .
Wallace , a former spokeswoman for George W. Bush , has no history as an outfitter .
No one close to the campaign backs up Palin ’s version .
‘ Totally fabricated , ’ said Wallace .
‘ Total fiction , ’ declared McCain ’s campaign adviser Steve Schmidt .
‘ Petty and pathetic , ’ said John Weaver , McCain ’s former strategist . ”
[ Boston Globe Editorial , 11/17/09 ]
Lie # 3 : Palin Enthusiastically Supported Her Appearance On Saturday Night Live From The Beginning : “ In one email thread , dated October 14 , 2008 , Palin says she is " not thrilled " with the idea of going on Saturday Night Live as a way of marginalizing the show 's unflattering impersonations of her …
Palin would ultimately make a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live days later .
But in her upcoming book she describes the deliberations about whether or not to go on the show much differently than the emails suggest .
In " Going Rogue " , the vice presidential candidate writes that " from the beginning , I liked the idea that John and I might appear on the show . " ”
[ Huffington Post , 11/15/09 ]
Lie # 4 : McCain Campaign Manage Steve Schmidt Yelled At Palin Over Prank Call From French President : “ Palin writes that Schmidt called her , something that two McCain aides ( including the one who provided the email ) insist never happened .
" He never called screaming at her , " said one of the aides , who was traveling with Palin at the time .
" There was no phone call . "
Moreover , in Going Rogue , Palin recalls Schmidt screaming directly at her , so much so that it " blew my hair back . "
In actuality , the irritation was directed at the staffers , the aide said .
" He was expressing his anger to staff .
And did it over email . " ”

Lie # 5 : McCain Made Palin Pay For Her Vetting : “ McCain said the bill was for legal work related to allegations that Palin made improper use of her influence as Alaska ’s governor to press for the dismissal of a state trooper named Mike Wooten .
Wooten was embroiled in a custody dispute with Palin ’s younger sister , Molly McCann .
“ That was addressed by Trevor Potter , ” said McCain , “ That was over the troopergate . ”
In a statement to the Associated Press , Potter , McCain 's general counsel , denied that McCain ’s campaign billed Palin for vetting her .
“ To my knowledge , the campaign never billed Gov. Palin for any legal expenses related to her vetting and I am not aware of her ever asking the campaign to pay legal expenses that her own lawyers incurred for the vetting process , ” he said . ”

Lie # 11 : Palin Calls Herself A Frugal Traveler .
“ Although travel records indicate she usually opted for less - pricey hotels while governor , Palin and daughter Bristol stayed five days and four nights at the $ 707.29 - per - night Essex House luxury hotel ( robes and slippers come standard ) overlooking New York City 's Central Park for a five - hour women 's leadership conference in October 2007 .
With air fare , the cost to Alaska was well over $ 3,000 .
Event organizers said Palin asked if she could bring her daughter .
The governor billed her state more than $ 20,000 for her children 's travel , including to events where they had not been invited , and in some cases later amended expense reports to specify that they had been on official business . ”

Lie # 12 : Palin Was Elected Governor With Small Donations – The Majority From First Time Givers : “ Of the roughly $ 1.3 million she raised for her primary and general election campaigns for governor , more than half came from people and political action committees giving at least $ 500 , according to an AP analysis of her campaign finance reports .
The maximum that individual donors could give was $ 1,000 ; $ 2,000 for a PAC .
Of the rest , about $ 76,000 came from Republican Party committees .
She accepted $ 1,000 each from a state senator and his wife and $ 30 from a state representative in the weeks after the two Republican lawmakers ' offices were raided by the FBI as part of an investigation into a powerful Alaska oilfield services company .
After AP reported those donations during the presidential campaign , she gave a comparative sum to charity . ”

Lie # 13 : Palin Conflates Federal Bailout And Recovery Act : “ Palin is blurring the lines between Obama 's stimulus plan — a $ 787 billion package of tax cuts , state aid , social programs and government contracts — and the federal bailout that Republican presidential candidate John McCain voted for and President George W. Bush signed .
Palin 's views on bailouts appeared to evolve as McCain 's vice presidential running mate .
In September 2008 , she said " taxpayers cannot be looked to as the bailout , as the solution , to the problems on Wall Street . "
A week later , she said " ultimately what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy . "
During the vice presidential debate in October , Palin praised McCain for being " instrumental in bringing folks together " to pass the $ 700 billion bailout .
After that , she said " it is a time of crisis and government did have to step in . " ”

Lie # 17 : Palin Claims She Was Above Conflicts Of Interest And Special Favors As Elected Official : “ Writes about a city councilman in Wasilla , Alaska , who owned a garbage truck company and tried to push through an ordinance requiring residents of new subdivisions to pay for trash removal instead of taking it to the dump for free — this to illustrate conflicts of interest she stood against as a public servant .
As Wasilla mayor , Palin pressed for a special zoning exception so she could sell her family 's $ 327,000 house , then did not keep a promise to remove a potential fire hazard on the property .
She asked the city council to loosen rules for snow machine races when she and her husband owned a snow machine store , and cast a tie - breaking vote to exempt taxes on aircraft when her father - in - law owned one .
But she stepped away from the table in 1997 when the council considered a grant for the Iron Dog snow machine race in which her husband competes . ”

Lie # 18 : Palin Contradicts Her Own Stance On Supreme Court Ruling In Exxon Valdez Case : “ PALIN : Welcomes last year 's Supreme Court decision deciding punitive damages for victims of the nation 's largest oil spill tragedy , the Exxon Valdez disaster , stating it had taken 20 years to achieve victory .
As governor , she says , she'd had the state argue in favor of the victims , and she says the court 's ruling went " in favor of the people . "
Finally , she writes , Alaskans could recover some of their losses .
That response is at odds with her reaction at the time to the ruling , which resolved the long - running case by reducing punitive damages for victims to $ 500 million from $ 2.5 billion .
Environmentalists and plaintiffs ' lawyers decried the ruling as a slap at the victims and Palin herself said she was " extremely disappointed . "
She said the justices had gutted a jury decision favoring higher damage awards , the Anchorage Daily News reported .
" It 's tragic that so many Alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision , " she said , noting many had died " while waiting for justice . " ”

All easy enough to disprove if the press had done its job . " …
Media outlets reporting on Palin 's speech noted that Palin , as a candidate for governor in 2006 , reportedly expressed support on several occasions for the bridge project and suggested that Alaska 's congressional delegation should continue to try to procure funding .
Moreover , as governor , Palin was in no position to reject the bridge project -- Congress had already appropriated the money to Alaska and left it to the state government to decide whether to spend it on the bridge .

Wired ’s Matt Blum asks geeky questions about popular sci- fi movies , including one that ’s always bugged me :
8. The Matrix : Why do the machines need humans ?
The intelligent machines have all humans hooked up to elaborate devices to harvest their body heat and chemicals , right ?
But they also have sophisticated fusion reactors .
The energy production of fusion reactors compared to that of humans ( with all the maintenance required , including The Matrix itself ) is so much more efficient it ’s just ridiculous -— and we ’re supposed to believe that intelligent machines , which would presumably operate logically , would keep the humans around anyway ?
It ’s obviously necessary for the plot , but it just makes no sense .
But what would make sense is if humans were used not as batteries , but rather as organic CPUs .
For all its processing power , perhaps the Matrix ca n’t do something that human brains can .
So they use the connected humans as a fleshy cloud computer to keep the Matrix running .
As a viewer , I ’d be willing to accept an incredibly simple answer here .

A novel anti-crime surveillance program that will record the license plate number of every car entering and leaving Tiburon should be up and running within six months , officials said Thursday .
The Town Council voted 4 - 0 late Wednesday - with Vice Mayor Miles Berger absent - to install six cameras that recognize license plate characters on Tiburon Boulevard and Paradise Drive .
Those are the only two roads that feed into the Tiburon peninsula , which also includes the smaller city of Belvedere on its southwestern edge .
Tiburon will be the first community in the Bay Area , and perhaps the country , to line its borders with the cameras , which have drawn criticism from privacy rights advocates .
Plates will be compared to databases of stolen or wanted cars , with matches triggering an immediate alert to local officers .
If detectives are investigating a crime , they will be able to search the records to try to find possible suspects .
" I think it makes the community safer , " Police Chief Michael Cronin said .
He said the town still needs to select a camera vendor and secure construction permits before installing the system .
Tiburon and Belvedere are affluent communities with low crime rates , and some residents at Wednesday 's meeting said the cameras would help keep it that way .
" If it lowers the crime rate even a little bit , then it's a great idea , " said Yami Anolik , a 64 - year - old real estate investor whose husband , Al Anolik , spoke in favor of the cameras at the meeting .
She said she did not share the privacy concerns of some of her neighbors , explaining , " If you 're driving on a public road , you gave up your privacy already .
If you want to be private , stay at home . "
William Rothman , a 72 - year - old retired physician from Belvedere , spoke against the cameras , saying he had concerns that went beyond the " creeping invasion of our privacy rights . "
He said he was concerned that detectives armed with a list of hundreds of cars that entered Tiburon around the time of a crime would profile suspects based on where they were from and what they drove .
He also worries that a stolen car alert could prompt a dangerous confrontation on busy Tiburon Boulevard .
Noting the low crime rates in Tiburon and Belvedere , he said , " This is overkill .
It 's like going after a flea with a cannon . "
Cronin said the license plate data will be kept for 30 days and then erased .
It will not be available to the public .
Officers can mine the data only in connection with crimes , Cronin said , and the program will keep a record of exactly what information police examine .
License plate readers have become a common police tool in the past several years .
Agencies have primarily mounted the cameras on patrol cars , not at fixed locations , but that may be changing .
The project is expected to cost from $ 137,000 to $ 197,000 .
Tiburon will spend $ 45,000 to $ 85,000 , Town Manager Peggy Curran said , after grants and contributions from two other governments that could benefit - Belvedere and Marin County .

Israeli security agents held a Palestinian patient for three weeks without charge , interrogated him repeatedly and offered access to hospital care if he agreed to become an informant , the Guardian has learned .
The treatment of Abd al - Karim al - Atal , 28 , is the latest in a series of cases over the past two years in which patients from Gaza referred for hospital treatment in Israel have been held without charge and pressed to become Israeli collaborators , human rights groups say .
Atal , who is losing his sight , is still waiting for a permit to travel from his home in the Jabaliya refugee camp , in Gaza , to an eye hospital in east Jerusalem for a cornea transplant operation now scheduled for tomorrow .
Physicians for Human Rights , a leading Israeli rights group , says the pressure exerted on these patients amounts to coercion , which is illegal under the fourth Geneva convention , and may even constitute a breach of the UN convention against torture .
It says around one in five Gazans who apply for permits to enter Israel for medical care are now submitted to detailed interrogations .
B'Tselem , another human rights group , says Israeli security agents " exploited the questionings to exert inappropriate pressure on ill persons , with the aim of forcing them to collaborate with the agency " .
Israel says such questioning is a necessary security measure to prevent terrorist attacks and says that 5,000 people – patients and their relatives – have been allowed out of Gaza for medical reasons this year .
But Ami Gil , of Physicians for Human Rights , said while initial screening of patients referred for treatment in Israel was a legitimate security consideration , the problem lay in the pressure put on patients under interrogation .
" There is a screening process to prevent a security threat and another to pressure patients to gather intelligence information that has nothing to do with their own case or background , " he said .
" That is not about screening .
It is about gathering information for intelligence purposes . "
Atal has a referral from Gazan health officials supported by the St John Eye Hospital in east Jerusalem , which states that he needs a penetrating keratoplasty – a cornea implant .
In the west that would be routine , but no hospital in Gaza can perform the operation .
He applied for a permit to enter Israel and in early September was called to the Erez crossing which leads into Israel .
He was blindfolded and handcuffed for a time .
An Arabic - speaking Israeli security officer accused him of falsifying his medical papers .
In fact , his vision is so poor he can barely see out of his left eye and has limited vision in his right .
Atal , a former member of Gaza 's Fatah - led police force , was asked to give detailed information about his five brothers and an uncle living in Egypt .
He was accused of involvement in the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , the military wing of the Fatah movement .
" They said if I accepted and gave them information they would allow me to return home and to get a permit in future .
If I refused they said they would arrest me , " he said .
When he said he had no information to give he was taken to a detention centre in the nearby city of Ashkelon .
He was photographed , fingerprinted and then held for 19 days alone in a cell with no windows .
He was interrogated for hours at a time while seated on a small chair with his hands cuffed behind his back underneath an air conditioner pouring out cold air .
Eventually he was questioned while attached to what he was told was a polygraph machine .
He was asked about his relatives , about his neighbours and about any Hamas leaders he knew .
Again he was accused of involvement in militant groups .
" I looked around and said : ' Are you talking to me ?
I can hardly recognise people in the street ? '
" They said if I collaborated with them it would be a good thing for the Palestinians , that it would help them target Hamas leaders , not accidentally kill civilians , " he said .
" They said I should call them and tell them about my neighbourhood : who is living where , is anyone from Hamas there .
They said I would get a permit to enter Israel in return .
They offered money , they said I would be allowed to travel abroad . "
Israeli officials deny that entry to Israel for medical reasons is conditional on patients becoming informants but they say security is an issue .
In June 2005 a female suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt tried to cross through Erez and Palestinians have used false medical papers in the past .
Last year a government official wrote to Physicians for Human Rights saying the questioning was " intended to evaluate the degree of danger posed by the applicant " .
" For us it is not only a legal issue , but a very basic moral issue , " said Gil .
" We are talking about patients here . "
Scientists at the University of California , Davis , have identified the dominant odor naturally produced in humans and birds that attracts the blood - feeding Culex mosquitoes , which transmit West Nile virus and other life - threatening diseases .
The groundbreaking research , published this week in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , explains why mosquitoes shifted hosts from birds to humans and paves the way for key developments in mosquito and disease control .
Entomology professor Walter Leal and postdoctoral researcher Zain Syed found that nonanal ( sounds like NAWN - uh - nawl ) is the powerful semiochemical that triggers the mosquitoes ' keen sense of smell , directing them toward a blood meal .
A semiochemical is a chemical substance or mixture that carries a message .
" Nonanal is how they find us , " Leal said .
" The antennae of the Culex quinquefasciatus are highly developed to detect even extremely low concentrations of nonanal . "
Mosquitoes detect smells with the olfactory receptor neurons of their antennae .
Birds , the main hosts of mosquitoes , serve as the reservoir for the West Nile virus , Leal said .
When infected mosquitoes take a blood meal , they transmit the virus to their hosts , which include birds , humans , horses , dogs , cats , bats , chipmunks , skunks , squirrels and domestic rabbits .
Since 1999 , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recorded 29,397 human cases and 1,147 fatalities in the United States alone .
The UC Davis researchers tested hundreds of naturally occurring compounds emitted by people and birds .
They collected chemical odors from 16 adult human subjects , representing multiple races and ethnic groups .
" We then determined the specificity and sensitivity of the olfactory receptor neurons to the isolated compounds on the antennae of the mosquitoes , " Syed said .
Leal and Syed found that nonanal acts synergistically with carbon dioxide , a known mosquito attractant .
" We baited mosquito traps with a combination of nonanal and carbon dioxide and we were drawing in as many as 2,000 a night in Yolo County , near Davis , " Syed said .
" Nonanal , in combination with carbon dioxide , increased trap captures by more than 50 percent , compared to traps baited with carbon dioxide alone . "
The UC Davis research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health ; a cooperative research agreement with Bedoukian Research , a supplier of specialty aroma and flavor ingredients headquartered in Connecticut ; and the National Science Foundation .
Everything we know about classic economic theory suggests the U.S. economy should be experiencing Zimbabwe - like hyperinflation right now , thanks to the nearly $ 2.2 trillion the U.S. Federal Reserve has pumped into the system .
But we 're not …yet .
Classic economic theory says that money supply can be used to stimulate the economy and our central bankers seem to agree .
That 's why they 've pumped more than $ 1 trillion dollars into the economy , engineered countless bailout bonanzas for zombie institutions , put Detroit on life support , and delivered a bunch of financial Band - Aids to the trauma ward – all in a desperate bid to make Americans feel better about the global financial crisis .
As Serious Eaters , you probably use a lot of fresh herbs in your cooking .
Dried basil just does n't have the aromatic sweetness of fresh basil .
But have you considered whether there are dried or fresh hops are in your beer ?
Hop flowers provide the bitter backbone that makes beer taste the way it does .
Some varieties of hops add a fruity citrus taste , while others give off a juniper - like scent .
Most of the time , brewers use dried , compressed hop pellets to do the job .
But once a year when hops are ready to be pulled from the vine , some brewers celebrate the season by heading out to local farms to harvest hops fresh .
Once gathered , the hops need to be added to the brewing kettle as quickly as possible — the delicate flowers spoil rapidly , especially if exposed to heat .
How do these fresh - hopped beers taste ?
Pretty delicious .
The fresh hops provide a uniquely refreshing , subtle herbal quality to these beers , and you know you 're getting something brewed recently if they 're using wet hops from this year 's harvest .
But like any fresh seasonal produce , these beers wo n't be on the shelves forever — you should grab some while you can !

Two Brothers Heavy - Handed IPA Illinois , 6.7 % ABV
This beer was a rich coppery color — a bit darker than the others .
It 's not , in fact , heavy handed at all , though it did have much more maltiness than most of the other examples .
The toffee malt notes are well balanced with herbal hoppiness : hints of rosemary and pine branches are present , but the bitterness fades away cleanly .
This is a slightly bigger beer than the others above , but we found it elegant and drinkable .
****
Tasty , but Less Subtle
Great Divide Fresh Hop Pale Ale Colorado , 6.1 % ABV
Each sip of this was a wallop of hoppiness : we tasted juniper , lawn clippings , and lemon peel .
We liked this paired with gruyere ; some found it a bit too potent and astringent on its own .
*** 1/2 for hopheads only , ** if you 're not
Southern Tier Harvest Ale New York , 6.4 % ABV
This aromatic beer had very gentle hopping and a lingering taste of honey .
If you like your beers a bit less bitter , then you 'll like this .
One taster found this beer to have a bit of cantaloupe flavor ; it might pair well with prosciutto .
We also think this sweeter beer would be nice with Peking duck .
***
Sierra Nevada 13th Release Harvest Wet Hop Ale California , 6.7 % ABV
Some of our tasters were n't sure this was that different from Sierra Nevada 's regular brew , but we liked it , even if we did n't find it quite as special as some of the others .
The hops bring traces of pine resin and citrus peel to this beer .
There 's an acidic grapefruit bite tempered by a hint of butterscotch .
***
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series Glacier Harvest '09 Massachusetts and Vermont , 6.7 % ABV
This malty ale was a bit richer than the others .
The flavors reminded us of dark honey , brown butter , lavender , and dried dates .
While one taster found it quite drinkable , others believed its funkiness masked the fresher flavors we found in the other beers .

Woods has been at the top of the profession for many years
World number one golfer Tiger Woods has been released from hospital after receiving treatment following a car accident in Florida on Friday .
Initial reports said he had been seriously injured , but Woods 's website later said he was " admitted , treated and released in good condition " .
The American 's car reportedly hit a fire hydrant and tree as he left his drive at 0225 local time ( 0725 GMT ) .
Woods , a 14 - time major champion , is thought to have suffered facial cuts .
The 33 - year - old 's Swedish wife Elin told police she used a golf club to smash out the back window of the car after hearing the crash from the house , local Windermere police chief Daniel Saylor told the Associated Press news agency .
IAIN CARTER'S BLOG
Woods craves control and privacy as much as trophies
Saylor said his officers , who found Woods drifting in and out of consciousness , do not believe alcohol was involved .
" She was frantic , upset , " Saylor said in a press briefing .
" It was her husband who was lying on the ground . "
He said Elin told officers she was in the family mansion when she heard the accident .
She came out and broke the vehicle 's back window with a golf club .
Saylor said when officers arrived , Woods had lacerations to his upper and lower lips and blood in his mouth .
" He was mumbling , but did n't say anything coherent , " said Saylor .
The couple , who were married in 2004 , have two children - Sam Alexis , aged three , and nine - month - old Charlie Axel .
An inquiry into the crash is under way , according to the Florida Highway Patrol .
Woods owns a property in the suburb of Isleworth , an exclusive area near Orlando .
Police said wife Elin Nordegren ( left ) was " frantic " at the scene
The accident report was not released until nearly 12 hours after Woods was injured , and BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter said the golf world was in shock as news of the crash emerged .
" The incident raises a lot questions , namely why did it take 12 hours for news of the crash to be in the public domain ? " said Carter .
" He is clearly a man who craves his privacy .
" He gives very little away and was telling me in Shanghai just two weeks ago that he hates the circus and the attention surrounding him and if he could get rid of it , he would love to . "
Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Kim Montes said the accident did not meet the criteria of a serious crash , and a press release was only issued because of inquiries from local media .
Montes added that air bags in Woods 's vehicle did not deploy .
TIGER WOODS Born : Eldrick Woods in December 1975 in Cypress , California
First major title :
In 1997 , less than a year after turning professional Winner : Of 71 official PGA
Tour events , including 14 majors Described as world 's most marketable athlete , sponsorship deals with GM , Nike and others A joint statement from Health Central Hospital and Tiger Woods 's office said : " Tiger Woods was in a minor car accident outside his home .
" He was admitted , treated and released in good condition .
" We appreciate very much everyone 's thoughts and well wishes . "
Woods , who has won six tournaments this year , is set to host the Chevron World Challenge in Thousand Oaks , California , on Thursday , although his agent Mark Steinberg of International Management Group said he did not know if his client planned to play .
European
Tour chief executive George O'Grady has expressed relief that Woods did not suffer serious injury in his crash .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" For the whole world of golf we wish him well and hope there 's no real damage and he recovers very soon , " O'Grady said .
" He 's a role model for the world of golf , not just the European Tour .
I think everybody will be delighted the injuries are not serious . "
Woods won the last of his 14 major titles at the US Open in 2008 when he beat countryman Rocco Mediate in an 18 - hole play - off despite struggling with a serious knee injury .
He then underwent reconstructive knee surgery but has since made a successful comeback on the US PGA Tour .
Woods has become an international sporting icon since winning his first major in 1997 at the age of 21 .

Boing Boing reader Brian says ,
After reading your earlier post about the LAPD using a " Sonic Blaster " I was reminded of a little gem from the Consumer Reports vintage photo gallery : " The Mattel Agent Zero M Sonic Blaster 5530 fires compressed air with a deafening blast .
Our measurements top out at 157 dB–above a level that can do permanent damage to the hearing of an adult .
We rate the toy Not Acceptable . "
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but is this not the single greatest children 's toy ever created ?
I certainly would have been very , very happy .
The rest of the photo gallery is pretty interesting as well , actually , including things like Radio Sunglasses and a Portable Steambath .

That kind of money would buy a very nice .

Such a dilemma !
Update : BB co-editor David Pescovitz asked Mark Pauline , founder of Survival Research Laboratories ( SRL ) :
Is n't this a photo of the toy that spawned SRL's Shockwave Cannon device ?
And —
Mark says yes !:
I got a Mattel engineer to send me all the engineering drawings in 1979 and started from there in around ' 83 .
However , I had my first one in 1963 .
It broke from excess use after 3 months and when I went to get a warranty replacement , I was told that the toy was " discontinued " .
The engineer remarked that it was probably Mattel 's most expensive toy from a lawsuit standpoint .
An awesome and dangerous toy !!
Photos of the shockwave cannon are available on the SRL site : Berkeley show , Tokyo show , and a 6 - barrel version appeared in the Barcelona show .
You know , that kid in the photo up top even looks as if he could have been Mark back then …

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE ECONOMIST
On Dec 11th , the Economist published an unsigned article attacking both me and my work .
This open letter is my reply .
TO : The Person Unwilling to Sign Their Economist Article
Dear Sir or Madam ;
Recently , you wrote a scathing article about me in the Economist discussing my post called The Smoking Gun At Darwin Zero .
Some of it was deserved , but most was undeserved and false .
The URL for your unprinicpled attack is http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/12/trust_scientists … trust_scientists ?
Trust_scientists ??
Have you read the CRU emails ?
But I digress … you begin by quoting from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , viz :
A change in the type of thermometer shelter used at many Australian observation sites in the early 20th century resulted in a sudden drop in recorded temperatures which is entirely spurious .
It is for this reason that these early data are currently not used for monitoring climate change .
Other common changes at Australian sites over time include location moves , construction of buildings or growth of vegetation around the observation site and , more recently , the introduction of Automatic Weather Stations .
The impacts of these changes on the data are often comparable in size to real climate variations , so they need to be removed before long - term trends are investigated .
While this is true , it does n’t apply .
None of the GHCN adjustments are from any of those sources .
This is because the GHCN does not adjust for location moves .
Nor does it adjust for construction of buildings , nor for any of the other items listed .
The GHCN uses none of those to make its adjustments .
So all of that is totally meaningless .
Next , you say the “ explanation for the dramatic change in 1941 is simple ” :
As previously advised , the main temperature station moved to the radar station at the newly built Darwin airport in January 1941 .
The temperature station had previously been at the Darwin Post Office in the middle of the CBD , on the cliff above the port .
Thus , there is a likely factor of removal of a slight urban heat island effect from 1941 onwards .
However , the main factor appears to be a change in screening .
The new station located at Darwin airport from January 1941 used a standard Stevenson screen .
However , the previous station at Darwin PO did not have a Stevenson screen .
Instead , the instrument was mounted on a horizontal enclosure without a back or sides .
The postmaster had to move it during the day so that the direct tropical sun did n’t strike it !
Obviously , if he forgot or was too busy , the temperature readings were a hell of a lot hotter than it really was .
This might make sense if there were any “ dramatic change in 1941 ” .
But as I clearly stated in my article , < b > there is no such dramatic change < / b >.
The drop in temperature was gradual and lasted from 1936 to 1940 .
The change from 1940 to 1941 was quite average .
So that claim of yours is nonsense as well .
In any case , the change in screening did not coincide with the 1941 move .
In my article I cited a reference to a picture of a Stevenson Screen in use in Darwin at the turn of the century .
Perhaps you did n’t bother to read that .
So , to sum up your first arguments , changes in the Stevenson Screens and other local conditions cannot be the explanation for any of the GHCN adjustments because 1 ) the GHCN does n’t use local conditions to make adjustments and 2 ) the timing of the screen change is wrong .
In addition , there was no “ dramatic change in 1941 ” .
Next , you point out two actual mistakes I did make .
First , in my proofreading I did not catch that I that I had written “ the 1941 adjustment ” when I meant the 1930 adjustment .
That should have been obvious to me , because there is no 1941 GHCN adjustment .
My bad .
Second , I had said that the Darwin temperature data could n’t have been adjusted by using the GHCN method .
This method requires five neighboring stations to which Darwin can be compared .
Why could n’t the GHCN method be used ?
I said it was because in the earlier time periods like the 1930s , there were no such stations covering that time period within 500 km of Darwin .
I was wrong , it fact there is one such station .
Neither of these errors of mine affect my point , which is that there are not enough neighboring stations to adjust Darwin using the main GHCN method .
The GHCN folks mention this possibility , saying : Also , not all stations could be adjusted .
Remote stations for which we could not produce an adequate reference series ( the correlation between first - difference station time series and its reference time series must be 0.80 or greater ) were not adjusted .
The homogeneity - adjusted version of GHCN includes only those stations that were deemed homogeneous and those stations we could reliably adjust to make them homogeneous .
SOURCE : http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/ghcn-monthly/images/ghcn_temp_overview.pdf
Unfortunately , they adjusted Darwin anyway .
Consider the GHCN adjustment in 1920 .
To find five stations around Darwin covering 1920 , you have to go out 1,250 km .
Nor is there any guarantee that those stations will be suitable .
You need to have five stations with an 80 % correlation with the Darwin record … I wish you the best of luck finding those five stations .
So while my statement about stations nearer than Daly Waters was wrong as you point out ( there is one nearer station that covers the 1930 adjustment ) , my point was correct – there are not enough neighboring stations to adjust Darwin using the GHCN method .
The first GHCN adjustment to Darwin was a single year adjustment in 1901 .
To get five “ neighboring ” stations for that adjustment , you have to go out 1728 km .
You fail to deal with that issue at all .
Instead , you say : “ So is it reasonable , if the GHCN is using complex statistical tools to adjust the temperature readings at Darwin based on surrounding stations , that they might come up with the figures they came up with ?
Sure .
No .
Yes .
I have no idea .
And neither does Mr Eschenbach .
Because in order to judge that , you would have to have a graduate - level understanding of statistical modeling .
…
I do n’t understand that formula .
I do n’t have the math for it . ”
“ Surrounding stations ” ?
We ’re talking about stations a thousand km away and more , not surrounding stations .
And while I am sorry to hear of the lacunae in your math education , please do n’t make the foolish assumption that others are similarly limited .
I have no problem with the GHCN math .
If you truly have no idea on the question as you say … then why are you excoriating my ideas on the question ?
Nor is it inherently a complex question .
The question is , should temperatures more than a thousand km away from Darwin be used to arbitrarily adjust Darwin ’s temperature by a huge amount ?
You do n’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out .
Next , as an aside you make the scurrilously false statement that I said that claims of damage due to sea level rise in Tuvalu “ stemmed from attempts by locals to blame subsidence problems on the developed world , and cash in on it ” .
I said no such thing nor do I believe it .
The claims stemmed from misguided environmentalists .
Next , you say “ He makes it sound as if he ’s just happened to stumble across this one site whilst perusing a debate over climate change in northern Australia .
But as his link to that conversation from 2000 makes clear , Mr Eschenbach is already aware that climate change denialists have been trumpeting the apparent anomalies at Darwin for nine years . ”
BZZZZT , poor understanding of the implications of chronology .
I looked up the conversation after I stumbled across Darwin .
How dare you accuse me of lying ?
As I said , I went to AIS to see if what Professor Karlen had said was true .
I called up a list of all of the stations in Australia that covered 1900 - 2000 .
Darwin was the first on the list , so that ’s the one I looked at .
Try it and see .
You accusation is both wrong and totally unfounded .
You go on to say
“ [ Climate change denialists ] do so because of that errant data at Darwin from before 1941 , which makes it look as though there was a cooling trend there .
The fact that climate - change researchers have to do a particularly strong correction on the data at Darwin , because they moved their dang instruments from the downtown post office to the airport , makes Darwin a perfect place to look for support if you want to claim that climate - change scientists are cooking the data . ”
While a correction in Darwin is perhaps necessary , it is cannot be because they “ moved their dang instruments ” in January of 1941 .
LOOK AT THE DATA .
There is no big change in January of 1941 .
It occurred gradually over the previous five years .
So your theory falls apart upon the simplest examination of the facts .
Next you say : “ Average guys with websites can do a lot of amazing things .
One thing they cannot do is reveal statistical manipulation in climate - change studies that require a PhD in a related field to understand . ”
Your understanding of statistics is as poor as your understanding of chronology .
The statistics used by GHCN are average college level tools .
You are dazzled by the fact that you do n’t understand them , so you make the incredibly foolish assumption that no one without “ a PhD in a related field ” can understand them either .
Some of us actually paid attention in class , you know .
Finally , you use your closing arguments to cheerlead for peer review .
Curiously , I agree with you in theory … but the peer review system in climate science is badly broken .
First , as the CRU emails clearly show , it has been subjected to enormous “ old - boy ” pressures to pass through bad studies without a second glance , and to deny opposing papers a fair hearing .
How do you think we got the Hockeystick and its cousins ?
Here ’s Phil Jones from the emails , talking about keeping peer - reviewed papers out of the IPCC report : I ca n’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
Kevin and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is !
And you give your article the URL “ trust_scientists ” ???
Second , the peer - review system is ripe for abuse .
This is because the reviewers often know who the author is , while the reviewers ( like you ) hide in anonymity .
This invites malfeasance .
The system needs to be changed so that after the review , the [ authors ] sign their names to the paper as well as reviewers .
At present , we have no way of knowing whether the paper was seriously reviewed by inquiring scientists , or simply passed through by the authors friends .
So I , like you , support peer review .
I just want a peer review system that works .
It must be double blind during the review period , with neither the reviewers nor the author knowing the others ’ names .
And the reviewers should reveal their names at the end , so that we know it was n’t just the author ’s best mates doing the author a favor .
Since we have an easily manipulated system instead of a real peer review system , I opt for public peer review by putting my work on the web .
This lets anyone , even anonymous innumerates like yourself , register your objections .
Finally , the Economist did not contact me before publishing an article full of false accusations , incorrect assumptions and wrong statements … looks like peer review is not the only system in trouble here .
I thought journalists were under an obligation to check their facts before making accusations … Willis Eschenbach

Following a recent investigation , European anti-trust regulators have formally objected to Oracle ’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems .
The main issue is MySQL , the world ’s most popular open - source database : the EU believes that the takeover could harm competition .
The $ 7.4 billion Oracle - Sun deal was announced in April 2009 .
Although US regulators have not raised objections , the EU investigation could put the merger plan at risk .
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is known to support open - source technology and Oracle have posted a statement responding to her concerns :
[ The EU objection ] reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics .
It is well understood by those knowledgeable about open source software that because MySQL is open source , it can not be controlled by anyone .
That is the whole point of open source .
Both Oracle and the US Justice Department have stated there are at least eight strong players in the database market so anti-competitive practices are unlikely to be successful .
However , investors had already responded to possible EU objections and Sun is currently trading at more than 12 % below Oracle ’s takeover offer of $ 9.50 per share .
Would Oracle Harm MySQL ?
MySQL is not a direct competitor to Oracle ’s enterprise databases , but developers will be suspicious of the company ’s motives .
Oracle could embrace MySQL and exploit the market by selling consultancy , training , reference guides and database migration tools .
However , they could also starve MySQL of developer resources and remove Sun ’s supporting websites and services .
Unfortunately , Oracle have remained tight - lipped about their plans for MySQL .
Although MySQL ’s open - source development does not depend on the company , forking the database into multiple systems is unlikely to benefit anyone .
Finally , are there really eight “ strong ” players in the database market ?
MySQL dominates the web and switching to another system is not a task many site owners and developers would be willing to undertake .
Are you concerned about Oracle ’s takeover of MySQL ?

This was a case like no other .
Not only was it the longest terrorism trial in Australian legal history , it was conducted under the tightest security and was almost derailed by one young woman .
Each morning , the prison van would arrive at the court in a convoy under police escort .
A busy Parramatta street was closed for a few minutes while the prison van sped down a steep driveway flanked by Extreme High Security Corrective Services Officers wearing flak jackets and armed with semi-automatic weapons .
Inside , there was the usual baggage screening in the foyer , but up on Level Three it was a different story .
Everyone who entered the court was required to show sheriff officers two forms of identification and the contents of any bags they were carrying .
Mobile phones could not be taken inside the courtroom .
The jury selection was a logistical exercise in itself .
A total of 5,000 potential jurors were called up , and in a week - long exercise they were whittled down to 15 .
The judge , Justice Anthony Whealy , was painstaking in instructing jurors that religion , specifically Islam , was not on trial here .
Throughout the trial , the jurors were incredibly attentive .
In the end , only 12 would decide on a verdict but it made little difference to these individuals .
The law had been changed to protect major and long - running trials like this one .
The empanelling of 15 jurors ensured the trial would not be jeopardised if one or more of the jurors had to stand down .
In the final months , three jurors were excused from the trial , leaving 12 in the last weeks of the case .
If there had been more than 12 jurors left at the end of the judge 's summing up , it would have been up to Justice Whealy 's associate to draw a ballot of the final 12 who would deliver a verdict .
Imagine spending more than 10 months of your life listening and digesting all the evidence in the trial and not having a seat at the table deliberating the guilt or innocence of the five accused .
Perhaps it would be a relief .
When I was asked to cover this trial for the ABC in 2008 , I was struck by the fact the five accused had been in custody since late 2005 without trial , or three years in jail without then ever having been convicted of a crime .
It 's now almost four years .
There was nine months of legal argument before this trial began .
A raft of applications by the Crown and the defence meant Justice Whealy had to deliver 65 judgments before a jury was empanelled .
The pre-trial judgments included a raft of non-publication and suppression orders that would prove a minefield for any journalist charged with covering the trial .
Defying or being ignorant of these orders came with a real prospect of aborting one of the most expensive trials in New South Wales , not to mention contempt proceedings .
But it was n't journalists that proved to be the worry .
It was the revelation that a young woman who had been coming to court had been following the jurors to their cars and allegedly taking down detailed descriptions .
The defence called for the jury to be dismissed and the trial aborted .
The jurors were asked whether the young woman 's surveillance would affect their deliberations .
They said no and the judge gave the green light for the trial to continue .
The young woman was a relative of one of the accused .
She told police she had acted entirely on her own .
The woman was not allowed to return to the trial and , funnily enough , I missed her friendly smile each morning as we both tried to get a good spot in the court to gauge the reactions of the five accused as they listened to the evidence .
I had been sitting next to her .
In an ideal reporter 's world , I would have loved to have found out more about the five men on trial .
My approaches to each of their lawyers were politely declined , however I was assured my request had been passed on to each of the men .
Not long afterwards , I was at the front of the court to request photographs of the men for the ABC 's coverage of the verdict and I was met with big smiles from each of the accused as they waited in the dock to be taken down to the cells .
One of their sisters told me her brother came from a good family and that they felt under siege .
She told me her family had a deep mistrust of the media and that she hoped the truth would prevail .

L4D2 Boycott [ Steam ]
Citibank is trying to gain regulatory permission for a $ 15B equity offering so that it can try to repay the TARP bailout money it received for its part in the largest swindle in history .
So they ’re borrowing money to pay back more borrowed money .
It would be funny ( like stupid - funny ) , if it were n’t such a crime .
Citi borrowed money from the government who stole it from the people .
The American government stepped in and handed $ 20B to Citigroup despite overwhelmingly public opposition to corporate bailouts ( depending on who you ask , this was either the result of collusion or blackmail ) .
Now , Citigroup would like to offer us — the public — the opportunity to buy equity shares .
The proceeds of this sale will then be used not as productive capital , but to simply repay the Government for the “ loan ” they granted of our money and without our permissions .
Citi is trying to sell equity to the people in order to raise cash to repay their “ loan ” from the government .
And if the people do n’t buy up these shares , the FED will .
Either most of us are totally f*cked .
The men and women who were robbed ( the first round cost an average of about $ 5,000 per taxpayer ) by Uncle Sam to finance Citi ’s TARP life support are not going to be “ repaid ” , instead the money will just be Hoovered up by the Government .
The Government has no intentions of giving it back to us .
It ’s a shell game .
And we ’re the marks .
Model of the brain - machine interface for real - time synthetic speech production .
The stroke - induced lesion ( red X ) disables speech output , but speech motor planning in the cerebral cortex remains intact .
Signals collected from an electrode in the speech motor cortex are amplified and sent wirelessly across the scalp as FM radio signals .
The Neuralynx System amplifies , converts , and sorts the signals .
The neural decoder then translates the signals into speech commands for the speech synthesizer .
Credit : Guenther , et al .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
By implanting an electrode into the brain of a person with locked - in syndrome , scientists have demonstrated how to wirelessly transmit neural signals to a speech synthesizer .
The " thought - to - speech " process takes about 50 milliseconds - the same amount of time for a non-paralyzed , neurologically intact person to speak their thoughts .
The study marks the first successful demonstration of a permanently installed , wireless implant for real - time control of an external device .
The study is led by Frank Guenther of the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems and the Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at Boston University , as well as the Division of Health Science and Technology at Harvard University - Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The research team includes collaborators from Neural Signals , Inc. , in Duluth , Georgia ; StatsANC LLC in Buenos Aires , Argentina ; the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Marietta , Georgia ; the Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville , Georgia ; and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta , Georgia .
The team published their results in a recent issue of PLoS ONE .
“ The results of our study show that a brain - machine interface ( BMI ) user can control sound output directly , rather than having to use a ( relatively slow ) typing process , ” Guenther told PhysOrg.com .
In their study , the researchers tested the technology on a 26 - year - old male who had a brain stem stroke at age 16 .
The brain stem stroke caused a lesion between the volunteer ’s motor neurons that carry out actions and the rest of the brain ; while his consciousness and cognitive abilities are intact , he is paralyzed except for slow vertical movement of the eyes .
The rare condition is called locked - in syndrome .
Five years ago , when the volunteer was 21 years old , the scientists implanted an electrode near the boundary between the speech - related premotor and primary motor cortex ( specifically , the left ventral premotor cortex ) .
Neurites began growing into the electrode and , in three or four months , the neurites produced signaling patterns on the electrode wires that have been maintained indefinitely .
Three years after implantation , the researchers began testing the brain - machine interface for real - time synthetic speech production .
The system is “ telemetric ” - it requires no wires or connectors passing through the skin , eliminating the risk of infection .
Instead , the electrode amplifies and converts neural signals into frequency modulated ( FM ) radio signals .
These signals are wirelessly transmitted across the scalp to two coils , which are attached to the volunteer ’s head using a water - soluble paste .
The coils act as receiving antenna for the RF signals .
The implanted electrode is powered by an induction power supply via a power coil , which is also attached to the head .
The signals are then routed to an electrophysiological recording system that digitizes and sorts them .
The sorted spikes , which contain the relevant data , are sent to a neural decoder that runs on a desktop computer .
The neural decoder ’s output becomes the input to a speech synthesizer , also running on the computer .
Finally , the speech synthesizer generates synthetic speech ( in the current study , only three vowel sounds were tested ) .
The entire process takes an average of 50 milliseconds .
As the scientists explained , there are no previous electrophysiological studies of neuronal firing in speech motor areas .
In order to develop an accurate neural coding scheme , they had to rely on an established neurocomputational model of speech motor control .
According to this model , neurons in the left ventral premotor cortex represent intended speech sounds in terms of “ formant frequency trajectories . ”
In an intact brain , these frequency trajectories are sent to the primary motor cortex where they are transformed into motor commands to the speech articulators .
However , in the current study , the researchers had to interpret these frequency trajectories in order to translate them into speech .
To do this , the scientists developed a two - dimensional formant frequency space , in which different vowel sounds can be plotted based on two formant frequencies ( whose values are represented on the x and y axes ) .
“ The study supported our hypothesis ( based on the DIVA model , our neural network model of speech ) that the premotor cortex represents intended speech as an ‘ auditory trajectory , ’ that is , as a set of key frequencies ( formant frequencies ) that vary with time in the acoustic signal we hear as speech , ” Guenther said .
“ In other words , we could predict the intended sound directly from neural activity in the premotor cortex , rather than try to predict the positions of all the speech articulators individually and then try to reconstruct the intended sound ( a much more difficult problem given the small number of neurons from which we recorded ) .
This result provides our first insight into how neurons in the brain represent speech , something that has not been investigated before since there is no animal model for speech . ”
To confirm that the neurons in the implanted area were able to carry speech information in the form of formant frequency trajectories , the researchers asked the volunteer to attempt to speak in synchrony with a vowel sequence that was presented auditorily .
In later experiments , the volunteer received real - time auditory feedback from the speech synthesizer .
During 25 sessions over a five - month period , the volunteer significantly improved the thought - to - speech accuracy .
His average hit rate increased from 45 % to 70 % across sessions , reaching a high of 89 % in the last session .
Although the current study focused only on producing a small set of vowels , the researchers think that consonant sounds could be achieved with improvements to the system .
While this study used a single three - wire electrode , the use of additional electrodes at multiple recording sites , as well as improved decoding techniques , could lead to rapid , accurate control of a speech synthesizer that could generate a wide range of sounds .
“ Our immediate plans involve the implementation of a new synthesizer that can produce consonants as well as vowels but remains simple enough for a BMI user to control , ” Guenther said .
“ We are also working on hardware that will greatly increase the number of neurons that are recorded .
We expect to tap into at least 10 times as many neurons in the next implant recipient , which should lead to a dramatic improvement in performance . ”
Overall , the work marks a milestone in the development of a permanent neural prosthesis that requires no major external hardware beyond a wireless receiver and laptop computer .
Previous brain - machine interfaces for communication applications are very slow , producing only about one word per minute .
The new system has the potential to enable real - time conversation , and help minimize the social isolation that accompanies profound paralysis .

* Iran seeks “ middle way ” on nuclear fuel proposal - Mottaki
* Mottaki speaks after U.S. warned of more sanctions
* Suggests Kish island as place to hand over uranium
( Adds Kish island proposal , paragraphs 10 - 13 )
By Raissa Kasolowsky
MANAMA , Dec 12 ( Reuters ) - Iran needs up to 15 nuclear plants to generate electricity , its foreign minister said on Saturday , underlining Tehran ’s determination to press ahead with a programme the West suspects is aimed at making bombs .
Manouchehr Mottaki , addressing a security conference in Bahrain , also cast further doubt on a U.N. - drafted nuclear fuel deal meant to allay international concern about the Islamic Republic ’s atomic ambitions .
“ First I think we could just totally abandon the whole thing or we could propose something more moderate , a kind of middle way ...
Iran has done that , ” he said .
Iran has sought amendments to the proposed deal , under which it would transfer stocks of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) abroad and receive fuel in return for a medical research reactor .
Tehran says it could produce the fuel itself if it is not able to obtain it from abroad .
The proposal to farm out most of Iran ’s LEU reserves is aimed at minimising the risk of the country refining the material to the 80 - 90 percent grade suitable for a weapon .
Iran , the world ’s fifth - largest crude exporter , says its nuclear programme is aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more of its gas and oil .
“ We need 10 to 15 nuclear plants to generate electricity in our country , ” Mottaki said .
Iran has one nuclear power plant , under construction by Russia .
On Friday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he expected the international community to impose significant additional sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme .
Iranian officials have repeatedly shrugged off the impact of such punitive measures .
“ It would be better not to experience that again , ” Mottaki said , referring to possible new sanctions .
He also appeared to say that Iran had told the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that Kish island , a free zone near the Straits of Hormuz , could be a point for handing over uranium to foreign parties for enrichment -- a proposal sure to meet with rejection from world powers .
“ We presented the proposed mechanism from the Islamic Republic of Iran , about 1,000 to 1,200 kilos of ( enriched ) uranium of 3.5 percent grade that should be exchanged with the fuel we need in our reactor in Tehran , ” he said , in comments translated into English at the conference .
“ In the first phase we can give you 400 kilos enriched uranium of 3.5 percent , which will be prepared by Iran and you give the equivalent ... of 20 percent uranium , and it should be exchanged simultaneously , ” he added .
Iran informally suggested Kish some time ago to the IAEA but Western countries object to such simultaneous transactions of small amounts of uranium on Iranian soil since that would not significantly cut down Iran ’s LEU stockpile .
TURKISH , SAUDI INVOLVEMENT ?
Earlier this month , the head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organisation , Ali Akbar Salehi , said Iran needed 20 uranium enrichment plants to provide fuel for its nuclear power plants .
That announcement came less than a week after Tehran said it would build 10 more sites like its Natanz underground facility , a statement that further heightened tension with major powers involved in efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the row .
The 35 - nation board of the IAEA last month voted to rebuke Iran for building a second enrichment plant in secret , near the holy city of Qom .
Refined uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power plants or , if enriched much further , provide material for bombs .
Separately on Saturday , an Iranian news agency said four inspectors from the U.N. nuclear agency watchdog had arrived to inspect the newly - disclosed enrichment site near Qom .
It would be the fourth such visit to the site , ILNA news agency added , describing it as a regular inspection .
It said such inspections should take place once a month , under an agreement between Iran and the Vienna - based agency .
Asked in Manama if Saudi Arabia or Turkey should join talks between Iran and the six major powers -- the United States , Britain , France , Germany , China and Russia -- Mottaki said : “ There is no limit to the members of 5+1 ( six powers ) .
We believe other countries from the region could participate in the talks . ”

Jeremiah Allison sits stone - faced inside the big yellow bus as it winds through a maze of South Los Angeles streets , escorted by police .
His jaws clench , his eyes narrow and his mind races to the hard , if not impossible , task ahead .
He is not alone .
All around him , shoulder - to - shoulder , sit 50 other nervous boys .
They crack their knuckles and wring their hands .
They crane their necks and say their prayers .
They stare out the windows , passing a row of dangerous apartments where some of them live .
This is Jeremiah ’s team , the Susan Miller Dorsey High School football team .
It is a Friday in mid-November , and this is their night , a night Jeremiah has dreamed of since grade school , when he first heard about the raw - nerved battles between Dorsey and Crenshaw High .
Dorsey - Crenshaw is the rivalry game in black Los Angeles ; tense and talent - kissed , pitting two of the last predominantly African American high schools in an increasingly Latino city against each other .
It splits friends and neighbors and sometimes city blocks , red against blue , Blood against Crip .
Fifteen , handsome and whip - smart , Jeremiah hears his coach ’s voice .
“ Quiet , ” says Paul Knox , disturbed by a din coming from the back of the bus .
“ Keep your focus , please . ”
He does not shout .
There is no bite to his voice .
But as they ’ve done at Dorsey for almost three decades , his players do as told .
Knox , 56 , who doubles as a U.S. history teacher , is the dean of high school football coaches in Los Angeles .
He ’s been coaching at Dorsey since 1982 , at the helm since 1985 .
He ’s a legend in South L.A. for his winning , and for his steady calm .
Poor and shopworn Dorsey , stuck in the path of crack wars that reached an apex in the 1990s , has imbued Knox with painful perspective .
He ’s spent a career wading through woe : players jailed , shattered by despair , swallowed by gangs . . . or worse .
It has not been uncommon for him to attend three funerals in a year .
Yet he ’s also overseen the creation of a football haven .
In Dorsey ’s 72 - year history , the school has won five city titles .
Knox was an assistant for the first , the head coach for the others .
Many schools would crow at sending a handful of players every decade to play college ball .
At least 100 of his Dorsey Dons have earned athletic scholarships .
Twenty - six are veterans of the NFL .
But for years , something more important than wins , losses and glory has been at work here .
With little fanfare , on a team where most players are raised by single mothers , sisters , grandparents or in group homes , Knox and his assistants have created a family for boys who need extra care , support and guidance -- particularly from men .
You can see it on the dusty practice field before the Crenshaw game .
There is Knox -- “ Pops , ” as he is sometimes called -- lips pursed , hands clasped behind his back , eyes trained on his team like a hopeful father .
Spread before him are not just his players but his assistant coaches -- 16 of them , 16 stand - in uncles .
Like Knox , they seem to need the team as much as the boys .
They work for next to nothing , a volunteer second job that keeps them busy almost all year .
Unlike Knox , they bark , push , cuss , tear down and prop up .
Among them is a probation officer who starts work before dawn , gets off at noon , then drives straight to Dorsey for hours of putting kids through their paces .
An assembly - line worker .
A teacher .
A contractor .
A former L.A. city councilman .
An ex-NFL receiver .
After practice , they sit with Knox in his cobwebbed office , and former players stream in .
They remain his kids , always .
There are men who struggle along with well - situated men .
There are men like onetime NFL star Keyshawn Johnson .
They watch their words and stand flag - pole straight , still seeking his approval .
But in all those years and with all those players , Knox has never coached a game like this .
He does n’t know what to expect .
His team has lost just one game , but is young , inexperienced and inconsistent .
Meantime , Crenshaw , a larger school less than three miles away , is undefeated , ranked first in the city and second in the state .
Some say they are the best inner-city L.A. team in history .
The bus presses close to Crenshaw .
Police have cordoned off the surrounding streets for safety .
Tension weaves through the cabin like a strangling weed .
Everyone on board knows this will be a chance to defy all odds , like the lives Jeremiah and many of his teammates are living .
It ’s just as the coaches promised , Jeremiah tells himself , walking from the bus , his eyes roaming the Crenshaw field as he remembers their words and warnings : “ It ’s gonna be a snake pit . . . .
You ’re gonna want to brag on this game , that you won it , when you ’re an old man at the barbershop getting a cut from some dude who went to Crenshaw . ”
It ’s just as he ’d dreamed .
As he ’d imagined when he woke that morning , draping a black shirt over his shoulders , reaching into a cabinet and pulling out two obituaries -- one for an uncle killed last year , another for a friend killed last March .
Neatly , lovingly , he had tucked the obituaries into a binder he carried all day .
“ Dorsey ! Dorsey ! ” he bellowed again and again .
A sophomore lineman , this is his first rivalry game .
“ Dorsey ! Dorsey ! ”
At Crenshaw , he hears it again .
“ Dorsey ! Dorsey ! ”
It comes from the stands , where throngs of his school ’s fans sit .
The sound weaves through the pulsing music , the crash of stomping feet and the sing - song replies from the home team ’s fans : “ Crenshaw ! Crenshaw ! ”
He takes it all in : the flags , the smoke from concession stand barbecues , the cheerleaders , the drill teams , even the police streaming through the stadium and hovering in a helicopter above .
He does his best to look unfazed .
He ’s good at that .
Jeremiah has endured a lot in life .
He was born when his mother ’s life was on the rockiest of ground .
Lucille “ L.A. ” Allison speaks of it through slow tears ; how she survived abuse .
How Jeremiah , just a toddler , saw a lot of it .
How the two of them and Jeremiah ’s sister found themselves in Minneapolis , living in a drafty motel she paid for by begging .
Those early years gave Jeremiah a resilience and toughness he ’d need .
Like so many others , he is handcuffed by the reality that survival for an African American boy in South L.A. is never certain .
Living on a forlorn block half a dozen gang neighborhoods from Dorsey , there ’s no riding city buses for him .
Too dangerous .
There is no hanging outside his small green house .
Too unpredictable .
He does n’t leave home in the morning without huddling with his mom , saying a prayer for prosperity and safety .
“ I sort of live indoors and on the football field with the team , ” he says .
“ I ca n’t cry about it .
I just have to deal with it .
And get me and my family out of here . ”
So Jeremiah dreams ; not just about football , which he loves because it releases his frustration .
Not just about Crenshaw .
But about his future .
Knox and his assistants , men like Lonnie “ Tex ” Pumphrey , make sure to push those dreams .
When Pumphrey drives Jeremiah home after practices , he warns him about the streets .
He speaks of being a “ Dorsey man ” -- strong and true and proud .
He shakes his head , smiling because Jeremiah is getting straight A ’s again .
“ Do n’t you limit yourself to thinking about playing in the NFL , ” Pumphrey says .
“ You can be the commissioner . ”
“ Coach Knox thinks I could play for one of those Ivy League schools , ” Jeremiah answers .
“ That ’s what I want , Tex , the Ivy League . ”
Despite his lack of experience , and the fact he ’s thinner than most opponents , Jeremiah leads the team in sacks .
He is also emerging as a leader .
“ All those people came back to Dorsey football this week , did you see them ? ” he shouts , just before getting on the bus in his crisp white No. 8 jersey .
“ They love it with a passion !
And I am sitting up here nervous because I want to cry , and I want to take my anger out because I love it too !
This is the biggest game y’all will ever play in !
So love and cherish every part of this game ! ”
In a Crenshaw dressing room , he sits in the front row as emotion builds and a series of assistant coaches pick up where he leaves off .
The room pulses with whoops and shouts .
It becomes a sea of raised fists and flexed biceps , of cursing and boasts .
In the thick of this appears the salt - and - pepper - haired Knox , walking carefully , hands in the pockets of his green jacket , calm to the bottom of himself .
“ Listen , ” he says , adjusting his wire - rimmed glasses , “ we already put the work in for this . . .
Today is the day to have fun .
There ’s no reason to be worried .
No reason to be nervous .
You guys just go out and execute .
. . . fly around the field and make plays .
We do that , we gonna be laughing in here at the end of the game . ”
It ’s hardly Knute Rockne .
It never is .
But it works .
It always does .
With the game minutes away , Jeremiah and his teammates line up behind him .
They walk toward the field holding hands .
Knox was not always so even - tempered , or so self - assured .
When he became head coach -- first sharing duties with another teacher , Eugene McAdoo -- he was unprepared .
He ’d never played in college .
His father kept him from suiting up for the varsity at Hamilton High .
He was simply a fan who ’d loved studying the chess match patterns of games .
It was n’t nearly enough .
Dorsey had just bumped up to the largest school category , and they struggled .
Knox became consumed with winning .
From his players , he demanded strict discipline .
He ran them ragged , forcing them to lift weights and run sprints until they nearly dropped , holding warlike , all - out scrimmages the day before games .
By 1989 , he was finally on to something good .
The Dons were led by a slashing wide receiver named Kevin Copeland , who was n’t just a great player but one of the smartest , most charismatic kids anybody at Dorsey had seen .
When Knox imagined having a second son , he imagined Kevin .
Then that October , Dorsey played San Pedro .
Kevin made a tackle and ran slowly to the sidelines .
With no warning , he collapsed .
He was dead at 17 .
“ It was the worst day of my life , ” Knox says .
“ Not a day goes by when I do n’t think of it .
It ’s safe to say what happened to Kevin changed the way I look at things .
I discovered there ’s a lot more to life than winning football games . ”
He let the team vote on whether to play the season out .
When they said yes , he vowed that from then on , his team would have more of the feel of a family .
He ’d provide routine and discipline .
He ’d be a constant touchstone .
The rules and customs laid down during that time exist today .
There are constant players - only meetings , encouraged by Knox .
Nobody is cut from the team .
Not the special - education kids who have trouble remembering plays .
Not the foster kids who miss practices .
Not the kids with one foot in gang life .
In 1989 , with the crack wars in full swing , gangs were brazen .
Kids were getting jumped in the hallways at Dorsey .
Knox began running his players through a special drill : what to do when guns go off during a game .
They were forced to use it during that year ’s Crenshaw game when shots rang from a nearby street .
The shooting showed Knox he was right : he ’d rather keep kids tempted by gangs near him than on the streets .
In that terrible year of Kevin ’s death , the team won its first city title for the biggest schools .
Kevin was posthumously named Southern California ’s best football player .
There ’s a bright mural on a wall at Dorsey .
Before each game the team kneels before it , prays before it , cries on it , touches it like it ’s connected to a spirit that hovers above , ready to descend at game time to help Dorsey win .
It ’s a mural of Kevin Copeland .
It ’s the first quarter , and the stadium is in a frenzy .
A Crenshaw back plows through the Dorsey defensive line : five yards , 10 yards , 20 . . . .
Touchdown .
Easy .
Too easy .
Dorsey tries to respond , but little works , then nothing works , and on the sidelines , players argue , coaches glare and shouts can be heard from the stands -- “ Knox ai n’t doin ’ his job ! ”
“ Calm down , ” Knox says on the sidelines , to his team as much as himself .
“ We ’ve just got to make a few plays .
Just got to keep chipping away . ”
Dorsey has to play perfectly to win .
They are n’t .
Not yet .
Knox looks out at his undermanned team , and he feels proud .
There ’s the kid whose mom , recovering from addiction , comes to every practice and game .
The defensive back who was kicked out of his house by his mother .
The safety who lives with his sister .
There ’s the team ’s best player , whose family has just been booted from their apartment .
He prepared for Crenshaw by sleeping at another player ’s home on a clump of blankets .
There ’s the tough lineman , whose father was recently murdered , whose mother was shot and paralyzed when he was just a baby .
With these kids , trying so hard and doing so much right , Knox ca n’t be too upset .
It ’s near the end of the first half .
Crenshaw sits a few yards from a two - touchdown lead .
If they score , a runaway begins .
It they do n’t , Dorsey has a chance .
A Crenshaw back takes off again .
Knox spots Jeremiah , socks low , thin ankles churning .
He ’s been playing a sophomore ’s game -- worried and tentative -- but he ’s something like Kevin Copeland , special .
Giving no quarter , he throws himself at the scrum , and the ball spurts loose .
“ Fumble ! ” Knox shouts .
“ Fumble ! ”
Jeremiah rises .
He cradles the ball in his large hands .
Dorsey ball .
“ I came to play ! ” he yells , running to the sideline , spotting his mother there .
“ We gonna win this thing , Momma .
We are going to win this game ! ”
Dreams do n’t always come true .
After the fumble , there are few moments of joy .
As time edges away , Crenshaw wears its opponent down , steady as a metronome .
The final score : 44 - 7 .
Tears well .
Shoulders slump , and helmets drop sadly to the ground .
It helps when the coaches speak .
“ Do n’t ever forget , ” one of them says , “ we love every last one of you .
We always will . ”
The team returns home , the assistants in their cars , Knox with his boys , on the bus .
It ’s quiet there again .
Some of the players stare out the window , spent .
Others shut their eyes .
The tension is gone but even though he does n’t show it , there ’s a hole in Knox ’s gut .
At first Jeremiah finds a seat in the back .
But it eats at him to see a clutch of reserves snickering there -- losing to Crenshaw does n’t burn them enough .
So he carefully gathers his gray pads and his green helmet and he limps down the aisle .
Near midnight , as the bus eases back to Dorsey , he sits down .
He ’s where he wants to be .
Right next to Coach Knox .
Dazed and depressed by the Crenshaw loss , Dorsey loses its final regular - season game .
But Knox turns his team around again .
In the city playoffs , they upset San Pedro High , 33 - 17 .
They travel to favored Taft High and win 24 - 20 , with Jeremiah making a key defensive play .
Tonight at 7 , in the playoff semifinals , Dorsey faces undefeated Crenshaw once more .
The odds are against them .

WSWS , December 31 , 2009
Five days after the unsuccessful attempt by a Nigerian student to set off a bomb aboard a Detroit - bound passenger jet , US military and intelligence officials are said to be preparing expanded military action against targets in Yemen , the Arab country where the student allegedly received terrorist training and was equipped with an explosive device .
A series of US media reports suggest that new US - backed military attacks inside Yemen are imminent .
Citing " two senior US officials , " CNN reported : " The US and Yemen are now looking at fresh targets for a potential retaliation strike . "
The network said the officials " both stressed the effort is aimed at being ready with options for the White House if President Obama orders a retaliatory strike . "
CNN continued : " The effort is to see whether targets can be specifically linked to the airliner incident and its planning .
US special operations forces and intelligence agencies , and their Yemeni counterparts , are working to identify potential Al Qaeda targets in Yemen , one of the officials said . "
The network said the Obama administration and the long - time Yemeni dictator , Field Marshal Ali Abdullah Saleh , had reached an agreement to allow the US to fly cruise missiles , fighter jets and armed drones , used for remote - control assassinations , in Yemeni airspace .
Talks were still ongoing on whether Saleh will give permission for the entry of US helicopter - borne Special Forces .
The report comes after a series of statements by top administration officials , including Obama himself , pledging that " all elements of US power " will be used in response to the failed attack on Northwest Flight 253 .
The White House has been under heavy fire from its Republican opponents over the evident security failure , and a military action would serve to divert public attention from the ongoing revelations of how the CIA and other US agencies ignored warnings about the impending attack .
Yemen�s foreign minister , Abu Bakr al Qirbi , told the BBC that his country was seeking stepped up military aid , presumably as part of a package deal �in effect , a bribe for allowing the country�s territory to be turned into a battlefield for US commandos .
The Wall Street Journal reported that the Obama administration was discussing nearly tripling its military and counterterrorism aid to Yemen in the coming year .
US aid jumped from $ 4.6 million in 2006 to $ 67 million this year , and would rise to as much as $ 190 million in 2010 , according to " a senior military official . "
Reuters , citing unnamed " defense and counterterrorism officials , " reported that " the Obama administration was exploring ways to accelerate and expand US assistance to Yemeni forces to root out the Al Qaeda leadership in the country , while keeping the role of the US military and intelligence agencies as behind the scenes as possible . "
The news agency reported a clash between Yemeni security forces and Al Qaeda fighters in the western Hudaydah province , around the town of Deir Jaber .
The Los Angeles Times cited a Yemeni terrorism expert as the source of an estimate that Al Qaeda has " as many as 2,000 militants and sympathizers exploiting the country�s economic and political chaos to create a base for jihad at the edge of the Persian Gulf . "
This is ten times more than other media estimates of the number of such militants in Yemen , and 20 times the number of Al Qaeda forces said by US officials to be in Afghanistan now .
The Times report is part of an effort by the US media to portray Yemen as a lawless hotbed of terrorism and a major threat to the United States , in order to justify in advance an American attack , or even a full - scale invasion .
It was followed by an even more apocalyptic comment by " terrorism expert " Steven Emerson , interviewed Wednesday morning on CBS � " Early Show . "
He said that while the Pakistan - Afghanistan border was still " number one " for terrorist activity , the area surrounding the Gulf of Aden , including Yemen and Somalia , was " fast coming up the ladder . "
" Yemen possibly could surpass Pakistan in the next year , given the terrorist trajectory for providing a haven for Al Qaeda , " he claimed .
In light of the fact that the Obama administration is mobilizing 100,000 American troops as well as hundreds of warplanes and drones for combat along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , such a comparison is extremely ominous .
Emerson took particular note of " literally scores of American Muslim students studying and being trained in Yemen to this day� .
There�s a pool of potential terrorists out there that have Western passports that can board planes without visas . "
The clear goal of such far - fetched claims is to create a pogrom atmosphere directed against all young American Muslims , particularly those of Arab or East African origin .
These comments were made one day after press reports of an alleged abortive attempt by a Somali man equipped with explosive powder and a syringe to board a passenger jet in Mogadishu , the capital city .
This is the same modus operandi as that of the Nigerian man , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , aboard Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day .
The Somali was arrested by African peacekeeping troops on November 13 and never succeeded in getting on the plane .
The Washington Post , the leading newspaper in the US capital , published an editorial Wednesday noting that in the wake of the Christmas Day bombing attempt , allegedly originating in Yemen , " some are asking whether the United States should launch a military offensive in that impoverished Arabian nation . "
The editorial continued : " The answer , of course , is that it already has . "
Citing a series of raids conducted by Yemeni and US forces , the Post praised the Obama administration for having " significantly stepped up US counterterrorism operations in Yemen , " including the dispatch of CIA and Special Forces personnel .
But it warned : " Still , Yemen�s steady slide toward failed - state status in recent years means that it , like nearby Somalia , will probably demand concerted and multifaceted US engagement for years to come .
More than Special Forces and missile strikes are needed . "
While declaring that " US ground troops are not needed , for now , in Yemen or Somalia , " the newspaper suggested that such forces may well be required in the future .
It declared , " in those countries , as in Afghanistan , a strategy limited to counterterrorism will not eliminate the threat . "
Once again , as in the case of Afghanistan and Iraq , American imperialism is preparing a military bloodbath in an impoverished country , using a terrorist attack �in this case a failed attempt�as the pretext .
According to reports by the UN and Yemeni government statistics , some 35 percent of the adult population of the country is unemployed .
Yemen is the poorest of the Arab countries , has exhausted its very limited oil export capacity , and now faces severe water shortages .
But Yemen possesses , like Afghanistan and Iraq , a highly strategic geographic location , adjacent to Saudi Arabia , the world�s largest oil exporter , and the Red Sea , controlling access to the Suez Canal .
Yemen also borders on the Gulf of Aden , the shipping route for much of the oil leaving the Persian Gulf .
US military forces are already deployed across the strait of Bab el Mandeb in Djibouti , the former French Somaliland , which remains a virtual French colony .
Djibouti hosts thousands of French and US troops who could quickly move into Yemen if so ordered by Paris and Washington .
A large US and NATO war fleet patrols shipping lanes through the Gulf of Aden and south along the Indian Ocean coast of Somalia .
Courtney Love no longer has legal control of her daughter .
TMZ has learned a legal guardian has been appointed to care for 17 - year - old Frances Bean Cobain .
Guardianships of this nature are frequently established when the parent is not capable of taking care of their children .
The guardians appointed by the court are Wendy O'Connor , Kurt Cobain 's mom , and Kimberly Dawn Cobain , Kurt 's sister .
The guardianship was established on Friday .
Courtney Love was not in court .
The guardianship is for both Frances Bean personally and her financial well - being .
The guardians do not have power over the trust established after Kurt Cobain 's death .
The guardianship was established after a fairly long period of unstable conduct by Courtney Love .
The court proceedings , however , are sealed .
UPDATE : TMZ just spoke with Courtney 's friend and lawyer , Keith Fink , who says , " Courtney wants to say she loves her daughter and she 's the most important thing in her life . "
As for the guardianship , Fink says Courtney knows her grandma will take care of Frances Bean .
Today The Wall Street Journal runs an article titled , Citi Management Gets Generally Good Review .
The Journal reports that an “ outside review of Citigroup Inc. ’s management team has concluded that it is generally in good shape , ” and explains :
The review , conducted this summer for Citigroup ’s board by recruiting and consulting firm Egon Zehnder International , was triggered by the government ’s stress tests of top banks last spring .
Companies found to need more capital were required to conduct assessments of their management and report the findings to federal regulators .
This evaluation of Citigroup ’s management is an indicator of how lack of accountability ultimately permeates any system that acknowledges firms are too big to fail .
In my book on practical entrepreneurship , one of the points I made was that when you go out on your own , as every small business person knows , there “ is no grade of A for effort , ” or particularly rewards for poor results that reflect “ events beyond your control . ”
When you run a smaller company , it does not matter how talented you are , how manifestly brilliant your plan is , or even if a totally unforeseeable , once in three decades hurricane , wipes out the total stock in your warehouse :
If expenses exceed cash flow , the business fails and you are out of a job .
Similarly , the question of whether Citigroup has talented leadership is irrelevant .
I suspect that the CEO is brilliant .
However , by definition , the leadership of the bank performed poorly .
The bank leadership , made decisions with negative ramifications that are almost unimaginable .
The bank performed so poorly that it ’s failure cost the taxpayers billions of dollars and required the government to put the institution on life - support .
Moreover , this was all done because management performed so poorly hat it not only imperiled the bank but the entire financial system of the nation .
Now , a Bloomberg survey , predicts that Citigroup will report a 2.6 billion loss for the third quarter , even as many other financial institutions have stopped bleeding .
In these circumstances , it seems inappropriate to even inquire about the managerial talent of the bank ’s management .
In any situation where market forces prevailed , the corporation would no longer exist , because of management ’s poor decisions .
What ’s particularly concerning here is that this type of report is probably a harbinger of what will happen if we adopt the Treasury Department ’s proposed “ too big to fail ” plan .
Under the currently proposed reform plan , our increasingly concentrated financial system will remain in place with additional regulations and the requirement that every firm maintain up - to - date plans for its dismantling should it fail .
Let ’s look at the reality of a situation where the government is confronted by a large firm , that has taken excessive risks , and should now be accountable for its action :
1. ) The situation confronting the federal government will look eerily like the events surrounding Citigroup today .
2. ) By definition , the potential failure will have been caused by something unforeseen by regulators or management .
Otherwise , it will not have occurred .
3. ) Since it was not foreseeable , management ( and probably regulators ) will shun accountability .
This aspect of the culture of our financial system and the behavior of regulators is one lesson of today ’s crisis .
4. ) The threatened entity will argue that — despite the in - place plans for unwinding required under the proposed Treasury legislation– recent developments demonstrate that no one really understands the consequences of the interconnections in the system .
In addition , as vividly demonstrated in the failure of AIG , the institutions that will be affected by this failure will add to this chorus of voices calling for government intervention .
In testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress last April , Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz put it this way :
“ Before a crisis , every financial institution will claim that it does not pose systemic risk ; in a crisis , almost all ( and those that would be affected by a collapse ) will make such claims . ”
5. ) The financial industry , aided by its well - documented political influence , will rally to argue that regulators risk further harm to the economy and the total financial system by shutting down the institution .
Under these circumstances , what are the odds that accountability will be enforced and the otherwise bankrupt institution will be closed ?
Perhaps 10 % .
6. ) So , the government will ultimately prevent this too large institution from failing and our economy will grow even weaker , as these institutions further distort the efficient allocation of capital , engage in high risk activities because of moral hazard , maintain pay scales unrelated to their actual profitability , and through their size and implicit ( or explicit ) government subsidies stifle competition and distort the market for their services .
Critics of this argument will correctly point out that the Treasury plan also mandates multiple new safeguards to create a less risky financial system .
This is true , and these reforms are unquestionably valuable .
However , they can not be enough .
The modern history of finance , combined with ever advancing technology , clearly shows that the locus of the next crisis is not predictable .
We will always be regulating to prevent the causes of yesterday ’s failure .
Sheila Blair , the head of the FDIC , recently argued that the doctrine of “ too big to fail ” must end .
According to The New York Tines , in speaking to a meeting of the Institute for International Finance , she said :
“ I believe that the new regime should apply to all bank holding companies that are more than just shells and their affiliates , regardless or not whether they are considered to be systemic risks , ”
Yes , all entities must be accountable for their results and subject to shut - down .
However , as suggested above , government authority is pointless when potential systematic risk is permitted to exist .
When the moment of decision comes , this shut - down authority will never be exercised .
Last week , as part of the New Deal 2.0 blog of the Roosevelt Institute , I argued that we needed smaller financial institutions , whose failure could occur unimpeded by the government , without creating a risk to the overall economy .
This will require enormous political will , and is the kind of hard decision that we must not avoid .
One of the reasons the reforms of the Roosevelt Administration stabilized the nation ’s banking system for almost a century was that it did not shrink from such hard choices .
In last week ’s article , I pointed out that then , as now , the choice was between large super - financial institutions ( favored by the industry ) and mandating smaller , focused entities — as ultimately required by Glass - Steagall .
New Deal efforts succeeded because FDR and his Administration did not shrink from making this hard decision and fighting to bring it to life .
Ultimately , market - based failures are the only way to ensure accountability .
Today ’s Citigroup report shows how easy it becomes , once market judgments are removed , to prevent the disciplines that govern all of the other sectors of the economy .
This is not an argument that Glass - Steagall in its original form would have prevented the current crisis .
Rather , it is an argument that the principles of Glass - Steagall provide a valuable guide for how we could reform today ’s system .
By separating companies according to lines of business , the nation gains the following advantages :
A more robust financial system .
Different types of entities ( commercial banks , underwriters , insurers ) would all be pursuing different business models .
In this diverse marketplace , they would be unlikely to follow the lemming - like strategies that made the entire system so vulnerable to securitized mortgages , or whatever becomes the popular product - of - the - moment .
This combination of smaller institutions , pursuing divers profit - making strategies , will dramatically decrease the potential that the failure of any one firm will create a systematic risk to the financial system .
Capital would be allocated more appropriately .
The efficient allocation of capital is the ultimate purpose of our financial sector , so this benefit should weigh heavily , if not absolutely , in our thinking .
As entities focus on specific aspects of financial activity , capital would flow to them , and be allocated in the larger society more efficiently .
We have witnessed how larger entities have systematically allocated capital to high risk activities ( often with zero - sum benefits for society ) , and failed in this fundamental mission .
Less distorting market power in the financial sector .
No one believes its good for the government to be involved in setting executive wages .
One reason this has happened is because the largest financial institutions lack effective competition , so profits ( or perceived profits or industry norms resulting from excess profits ) have permitted pay to skyrocket .
Greater competition , which becomes possible as existing entities decrease in size , has the potential to lower the market distorting advantages of the largest firms .
Over time , in this more competitive market without government subsidies , the excess profits now going into executive pay would disappear .
A less fragile financial system .
More is better .
Any system that is dependent on a limited number of entities or components is inherently weak .
Whenever possible , NASA create a backup capability in space crafts on the assumption that individual systems will fail –no matter how carefully they are checked — and this creates an unacceptable risk .
The benefits of competition .
Effective competition creates innovation , new approaches to business problems , innovative services , and a generally healthier , more dynamic system .
America desperately needs that kind of customer - focused creative , innovation in our financial system today .
Better regulatory oversight .
Do we really believe that in the future regulators will be able to understand the risk dynamics of our huge financial entities ?
Smaller , focused entities have fewer moving parts and require less expertise in multiple arenas .
To the extent the nation needs effective regulation , it ’s far more likely to occur under these circumstances .
Decreased political power that distorts markets .
Wealth inevitably leads to the accumulation of political power .
This power is inevitably used to protect entrenched interests .
One of the strengths of America has always been that we are a land where many voices are heard .
In a more diverse financial system , different participants are likely to have different viewpoints , and I would argue that the political influence of a few large entities is inherently higher than the sum power exercised by a diverse industry .
Last week ’s article on the principles of Glass - Steagall received a number of valuable comments .
Many raised important suggestions and valid criticisms .
However , I was nonetheless left with one lingering question :
What did the authors of the comments specifically suggest we should do ?
We all know moral hazard is a problem .
We know too big to fail is a problem .
To it ’s credit , the Treasury has proposed one solution .
I have proposed the outlines of another , because I cannot see a workable alternative to a break - up of financial firms .
At the Joint Economic Committee hearing , Stiglitz argued for a breakup modeled on a Glass - Steagall model , saying ,
“ We have little to lose , and much to gain , by breaking up these behemoths , which are not just too big to fail , but also too big to save and too big to manage , ”
In a similar spirit , MIT economist Simon Johnston argued for revising the antitrust laws thereby requiring a break - up based on regional size or type of business .
Right now , we need to solve this big question :
Should some version of the Treasury plan be adopted or should the nation mandate some form of break - up .
Last week ’s article led to many comments that said , in effect , “ I agree that the Treasury proposal will not work but I do n’t know that we need to break up the banks . ”
So , here ’s the challenge , and the nation desperately needs an answer .
If you disagree with the Treasury plan , and you disagree that the banks should be broken - up , what specifically should we do ?

Ed Schultz pretty well lays it in the line with what a whole lot of the progressive community thinks about President Obama right now .
Katrina Vanden Heuvel from
The Nation weighs in on how " angry , infuriated and heartbroken " the base is and that they need to stand up if they do n't want things to be very ugly in 2010 .
As Ed notes , the President needs to quit listening to Rahm Emanuel and the insurance lobby and start paying attention to those that got him elected .
Transcript via Lexis Nexis .
Mr. Personality , Rahm Emanuel , he must have gotten a hell of a deal .
So , the Democrats got together and they killed it .
So much for change we can believe in .
It would let consumers buy prescription drugs from overseas at a fraction of the price that we pay right now .
But you see , voting for it would have really endangered the deal that the White House cut with big pharma .
Now , the travesty continues .
Last night , 30 Democrats voted against an amendment that would help you and me , the consumers -- the drug importation bill .
Now , here`s what gets me .
The guy standing behind Obama is the biggest taker from big pharma and the insurance industry .
Our old buddy , Max Baucus , chairman of the Finance Committee , is taking $ 3.4 million from the health industry over the last six years , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
That`s an average of $ 1,500 a day to Baucus from big health care .
Apparently none of that matters .
You see , at the White House , not long ago , the president told liberal Democrats to suck it up and listen to Joe Lieberman`s version on health care .
SCHULTZ : Mr. President , don`t leave the room .
We`ve got some more talking to do .
You can`t make it ?
The insurance industry will be able to write the rules .
They are not being set in the legislation as currently written .
One in particular will allow employers to charge certain workers thousands of dollars more just based on health factors .
And it can be obesity , high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol .
WENDELL POTTER : The Senate bill is full of loopholes , and the insurance industry knows that .
In fact , they`ve made sure that they are in there .
Here is what Wendell Potter , a friend of mine , told me on the program last night .
Mr. President , I don`t know if you`ve noticed or not , but you have carved out the most important elements of reform .
The only people who like this current bill right now , Mr. President , is the insurance industry .
They get a bunch of new customers .
You aren`t listening to the very people who put you in office , Mr. President .
This isn`t about your legacy .
It`s about the people in America who need health care now .
Right now , Mr. President , your base thinks you`re nothing but a sellout , a corporate sellout , out that .
I know it`s tough audio , but I`m your buddy Ed. I`ve got to tell you this .
I don`t think anybody else is .
They want to know , where are you ?
They think we can do a heck of a lot better .
Liberals and progressives think that they`re not being treated properly .
The base is restless .
They are wandering in the wilderness , Mr. President .
They are looking for your GPS coordinates .
Mr. President , pull that chair up in front of the fireplace here .
What you say we sit down and have a little talk here tonight ?
What do you think , huh ?
ED SCHULTZ : Good evening , Americans .
And welcome to THE ED SHOW from New York .
I have to ask the question tonight to our listening audience , if you`re a liberal , tell me -- send me an e-mail at Ed@EdSchultzShow.com
Why do you support President Obama after the way he`s been coming down on all of this ?
Does he deserve your support at this point ?
Rahm Emanuel is nothing but a turncoat .
They are not listening to the base at all .
The Republicans -- I know this is heresy , but they do deserve credit .
See , they know how to close ranks , and nobody does it better than them .
It `s kind of like they still have the Tom DeLay effect .
The Democrats are always looking for a hero .
Now , Howard Dean finally did it today .
The Democrats just don`t know how to get tough .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
HOWARD DEAN :
You know , if we are Republicans , we would ram this thing through the way we want them to .
They wouldn`t have hesitated to do that .
And we`re not tough enough .
The Democrats aren`t tough enough .
We don`t have to be mean like the Republicans can be , but we have to be a lot tougher if we`re going to get anything done .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SCHULTZ : OK .
So we`ve got this list of progressives who are starting to line up .
Let`s see -- we`ve got Howard Dean , we`ve got Arianna Huffington .
We`ve got Markos Moulitsas of " The Daily Kos . "
We`re going to have a very interesting guest here in just a moment .
Is this the change that we all talked about , a gift to the insurance industry ?
Change is not back - door deals with big pharma and sticking it to the consumers .
Change is not Joe Lieberman calling the shots on health care reform .
Mr. President , before you leave the room , listen to your buddy , Big Eddie .
Your base is leaving you , and you need to listen to your base , because we`re the ones that put you in office .
Joe Lieberman didn`t put you in office .
None of the Republicans put you there .
In fact , they are still trying to defeat you at the water`s edge .
They won`t give up .
Folks , get your cell phones out tonight .
I want to know what you think on this .
Do you think the White House has sold out to big pharma ?
Text " A " for yes and " B " for no to 622639 .
We`ll bring you the results later on in the show .
Joining me now is Katrina vanden Heuvel , editor of " The Nation , " tonight .
Katrina , nice to have you with us .
KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL :
Thank you , Ed .
SCHULTZ : The base , is it in trouble with President Obama ?
I`m listening to those and the progressive talkers .
The blogosphere is wild .
This is a new set of dynamics for the president .
We`ve got some poll numbers coming up in a few minutes .
How do you see it at this hour ?
VANDEN HEUVEL :
Well , I think the base -- I mean , the people who put Obama in office , angry , infuriated , heartbroken .
This is not the change that we voted for .
I think Representative Anthony Weiner put it well just the other day .
The compromises are all going in one direction .
And so people who work very hard , not just the base , a majority of Americans who support a public option or a Medicare expansion , are looking at a White House which has emboldened the conserva- dems , people like Joe Lieberman , who not only worked for McCain , but is now holding hostage a bill that would really serve millions of Americans .
Instead , we`re getting this watered - down , diluted plan , and I think it`s not too late .
I think progressives can stand and fight .
There is another day .
Congress has two houses .
It `s going to go to the House , which has some spine , and we need to give it spine moving forward , because , otherwise , it`s going to be very ugly in terms of 2010 , and very ugly in terms of what emerges as a bonanza for the insurance companies .
SCHULTZ : Well , it`s just not the base and it`s just not the progressive media that`s out there .
It`s members of Congress .
John Conyers , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee ...
VANDEN HEUVEL : Absolutely .
SCHULTZ : He says this : " The president keeps listening to Rahm Emanuel .
The insurance lobby is taking over . "
Here`s Dave Obey , who is the chairman of House Appropriations .
" The White House has been useless . "
It `s ridiculous .
And the Obama administration is sitting on the sidelines .
That`s nonsense .
What do you make of this ?
VANDEN HEUVEL :
Well , I mean , you have in the House people like Obey and Conyers .
You have a Progressive Caucus , 83 strong , which stood firm , tall , with spine to counter these Blue Dogs who don`t represent much but the insurance companies .
And the Progressive Caucus will need to do some work moving forward .
So , you`re going to head in -- Steny Hoyer , majority leader , said today you`re looking at January .
You`re going to need to meld the Senate bill with a House bill that is a lot better , including , obviously , a public option or Medicare expansion , but better on affordability , better on any trust exemption for these insurance companies .
So , I think there is work to be done .
And in this period , progressives and citizens who don`t want to be held hostage by the insurance companies moving forward need to do some hard work and tell this White House that , yes , we`re not naive .
Compromise in politics is inevitable , but you want compromise that opens opportunities and takes into account those who have worked so hard for something , and not something that forecloses opportunity and is an insurance bonanza .
SCHULTZ : Katrina , good to have you on tonight .
VANDEN HEUVEL : Thank you .
SCHULTZ : Thanks so much .
Always the truth coming from you and " The Nation . "
A Jordanian court sentenced a 61 - year - old man to 10 years in prison on Wednesday after convicting him of killing his teenage daughter last year to " defend his honour " , a judicial official said .
" In 2008 , the 17 - year - old girl was kidnapped and raped by a group of men , who are currently on trial , " the official said .
" But the father suspected that his daughter was involved in a sexual relationship with one of the men .
He shot her dead before handing himself in to police , claiming he wanted to defend his honour . "
The court initially jailed the father for 15 years , " but decided to reduce the sentence after the man 's family urged leniency " , he said , adding the murder took place in Ein Basha , outside Amman .
In a separate case , a court commuted the death sentence of a man to 10 years in jail for strangling his married sister to death in 2007 " because he suspected the girl was involved in prostitution " , in the Red Sea port of Aqaba , an official said .

SEATTLE --
A police officer on patrol early Tuesday fatally shot the man suspected of killing four police officers after an intense two - day manhunt by authorities here .
Maurice Clemmons was shot and killed in a working - class south Seattle neighborhood after the officer noticed a stolen vehicle with the engine idling about 2:45 a.m .
When the officer stopped his car to examine the vehicle , Mr. Clemmons approached him on foot from behind .
Police said Mr. Clemmons was ordered to show his hands , but ran and was fatally shot .

Lawrence O'Donnell took his turn filling in for Keith on Countdown and Rachel Maddow called out the Cheney 's for their continual lying on her show the next hour .
CREW 's Melanie Sloan joined Rachel later in the segment to discuss the newly released interview by the FBI which did not reveal much -- other than his willingness to throw Scooter Libby under the bus .
More on that from Marcy Wheeler :
There are three general categories of information about which Cheney hangs Libby out to dry .
If I were Scooter Libby right now , I ’d be seething .
I ’d be utterly disgusted with the way Dick Cheney hung me out to dry , over and over and over , in his interview with Fitzgerald .
Cheney denies any knowledge of issues he and Libby worked on together repeatedly and he denies that his own orders and instructions had anything to do with activities that ultimately ( though Cheney of course did n’t admit this ) ended up outing Valerie Wilson .
Hung Out to Dry : One Former VP Chief of Staff
Transcript from Lexis Nexis below the fold .
MADDOW : It is the sort of moment that probably deserves to pass without too much extraneous political comment .
President Obama saluting the coffin of Army Sergeant Dale Griffin during the dignified transfer ceremony for Sergeant Griffin at Dover Airbase early yesterday morning .
The presence of the president of the United States at this stirring ceremony was to Liz Cheney just too good an opportunity to pass up to take a political whack at President Obama .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP )
LIZ CHENEY : I don`t understand sort of showing up with the White House press pool with photographers , and asking family members if you can take pictures .
I just -- that`s really hard for me to get my head around .
It was a surprising way for the president to choose to do it .
I think , you know , what President Bush used to do was to do it without the cameras .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
MADDOW : Actually , that`s not true at all .
President George W. Bush didn`t attend ceremonies at Dover , with or without cameras .
He never went .
A spokesman for the former president tonight confirming with us that Mr. Bush , in fact , never attended the arrival of an American soldier at Dover .
Which means that Liz Cheney is wrong again .
This is starting to feel familiar .
Not about her opinion about things , but about what she says are the facts of modern American political issues that she`s called on to discuss as a pseudo pundit , as a pseudo stand - in for her father .
Here she is talking about her father , former Vice President Dick Cheney , and the link between Iraq , al Qaeda and 9/11 .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
L. CHENEY : He has not said that there is a connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : So says Liz Cheney .
Let`s go to the videotape from the reality - based community .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
DICK CHENEY : If we`re success in Iraq , we will have struck a major blow right at the heart of the base , if you will , the geographic base of the terrorists who have had us under assault now for many years , but most especially on 9/11 .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Liz Cheney , wrong again .
She also had this exchange with Joan Walsh from Salon.com , on the subject of the prison at Guantanamo and the issue of sending Guantanamo prisoners to the United States .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
JOAN WALSH : President Bush , in June 2009 , gave a speech where he said he would close it , and he would bring people home and try them here .
L. CHENEY : No , I `m sorry .
He did not say ...
WALSH : President Bush said that .
( CROSSTALK )
L. CHENEY : No , he didn`t say that .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : In fact , in June 2006 -- not 2009 , but in June 2006 -- President Bush did say exactly that .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE W. BUSH : I`d like to end Guantanamo .
I`d like it to be over with .
There are some who need to be tried in U.S. courts .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Tried in U.S. courts , as in courts in the U.S. , the thing that Liz Cheney says he never said .
And then , there was Liz Cheney`s attack on President Obama and the issue of American exceptionalism .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
L. CHENEY : We`ve now seen several different occasions when he`s been on these international trips , when he`s not been willing to say flat out , you know , I believe in American exceptionalism .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : And then there`s the truth .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BARACK OBAMA : I believe in American exceptionalism .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Liz Cheney , wrong again .
And now to my favorite , Liz Cheney`s pressure group , Keep America Safe , and its Web ad showing clips of her organization receiving critical coverage on this network interspersed with provocative questions like this one .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
Why don`t they want to debate the issues ?
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Actually , we do want to debate the issues .
And as I`ve said many , many times before , our booking producers have repeatedly called Liz Cheney and invited her to be a guest on this show , to , as they say , debate the issues .
We called her again today and , as usual , got no response .
Why doesn`t Liz Cheney want to debate the issues ?
Today there is breaking news about Ms. Cheney`s father .
Interviews Dick Cheney gave to the FBI about the Valerie Plame scandal were released today .
Joining us now to talk about what news was made in this release of documents is Melanie Sloan , the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , whose organization fought to get the Cheney - FBI interview documents released .
Melanie , thanks for being here .
And congratulations on this .
MELANIE SLOAN : Oh , thank you .
It was nice to get a victory .
MADDOW : The lead in the A.P. wire report that announced this news today was that Cheney denied knowing who leaked Valerie Plame`s identity as a CIA officer to the media .
Do you find that denial to be credible ?
SLOAN : No .
That`s not at all credible .
Back in Scooter Libby`s trial , it came out at that time that Scooter Libby and Cheney had had discussions about Valerie Wilson back in June of 2003 .
But here it was in his transcript of his FBI interview , Mr. Cheney can`t remember ever talking about Valerie Wilson`s identity with Scooter Libby .
In fact , what`s really notable about this transcript is that Mr. Cheney can`t actually remember anything about anything .
He says , by my count , I don`t recall , I don`t remember , I don`t know , well over 75 times in this 25 , 28 pages .
And really , he just refuses to be pinned down .
And he`s certainly not going to let the facts get in his way .
He`s confronted by his interviewers with his own notes , and he still can`t manage to recall anything , sometimes not even able to recognize his own handwriting .
MADDOW : He`s literally confronted with things that he has written down in his own hand , and he denies knowledge of them .
SLOAN : Yes .
He just says he can`t remember and he can`t recall .
And what`s so interesting about this , of course , is Mr. Cheney is often considered to have a razor - sharp mind , a razor - sharp intellect and a terrific memory .
And certainly , he uses that to go on television and impugn other politicians on a regular basis .
And yet , here he sounds like , you know , your regular street perp .
" I don`t remember . " " I don`t recall . "
" Oh , did I say that ? "
" Yes , that just doesn`t really ring a bell with me . "
MADDOW : Is there anything in the documents that show or suggest that Dick Cheney might have given conflicting answers on some of these issues to what he had said on the record before ?
SLOAN : Well , you have to remember that he never really said anything on the record before .
This is the only time he was put on the record , and he didn`t say all that much .
As I said , what he goes through in here is , he says he doesn`t remember anything .
So , you`ve really got to wonder why the Justice Department spent so much time and so much effort hiding this transcript from the American people .
You may remember that Henry Waxman had subpoenaed it back when he was the chairman of the Government Reform Committee , and the attorney general at the time , Michael Mukasey , had said , " No , we`re not going to give that over , because of executive privilege . "
And so , Henry Waxman had dropped the matter , and that`s when CREW decided to sue for it , thinking , you know what ?
The American people deserve to know the truth here .
But sadly , we still don`t .
Special Counsel Fitzgerald had said at the end of the Scooter Libby trial that there was a cloud over the vice presidency .
And that cloud remains .
We still don`t know very much .
MADDOW : What would you still like to see released ?
SLOAN : Well , it`s hard to know what can be released .
I mean , there are redactions to this document , where certain things are left out .
But it`s very minor .
The fact is , I don`t know that it`s anybody`s transcript that`s going to be released that`s going to tell us the truth .
It would have to be that the principals would have to come clean .
Scooter Libby would have to tell us what really happened .
Karl
Rove would have to tell us what really happened .
And Dick Cheney would have to tell us what really happened .
And really , there`s not a lot of hope from those guys .
MADDOW : And it`s a little bit disappointing that they couldn`t come clean and tell what really happened to the Department of Justice , or at least they didn`t shed enough light on it when we look at their transcripts , to be able to tell the whole story from here out .
Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , again , congratulations on getting what has been released , released .
And thanks for joining us .
SLOAN : Thank you .

Episode 5 of Season 4
when it first aired on November 11 , 1978 .
( I am and I was . )
Buck Henry was the host .
The Grateful Dead were the musical guests .
And , there were several classic skits — including one at the end that introduced what would become a famous TV catchphrase .
The sketch takes place at a meeting of the St. Mickey ’s Knights of Columbus .
After dealing with a few business items , the organization ’s leader , played by SNL cast member John Belushi , announces that the club would have a special guest speaker that night .
Dan Aykroyd , playing the Knights ’ treasurer , notes that the group had to go into debt to pay the speaker ’s steep $ 900 fee .
Belushi then introduces this special guest : “ the immortal ” Chico Escuela , a former all - star baseball player for the Chicago Cubs who came to the US from the Dominican Republic .
After being introduced , Chico — portrayed by SNL cast member Garrett Morris — gets up , stands at the podium and says in a thick Hispanic accent :
“ Thank you berry much .
Baseball been berry , berry good to me .
Thank you .
God bless you .
Gracias ! ”
Then he sits down .
Astonished by the brevity of this $ 900 “ speech , ” Belushi ’s character asks : “ Is that it Chico ? ”
Chico thinks about it a second , gets up again and adds : “ Keep you eye ... keep you eyes ... on de ball . ”
After which , he sits down again .
Belushi says sardonically : “ Thank you , Chico .
You ’ve been an inspiration to all of us . ”
Three weeks later , during the December 9 , 1978 episode of SNL , Morris ’s Chico made a second appearance and repeated his line “ Baseball been berry , berry good to me ! ” several times — making this the night on which it gained official catchphrase status .
In that episode ( Season 4 , Episode 8 ) , the host was Monty Python star Eric idle .
Kate Bush was the musical guest .
Dan Aykroyd performed the insanely funny skit in which he plays a frantic Julia Child , who bleeds to death after cutting her finger .
And , Don Novello showed up as Father Guido Sarducci .
Chico was in the
Weekend Update
segment with Jane Curtin , who announced that he had been hired as the Weekend Update sports commentator .
After being introduced by Jane ( this time as a former New York Mets ballplayer ) , Chico says :
“ Thank you .
Thank you , berry , berry much .
Baseball been berry , berry good to me .
Thank you , Hane .
[ A photo of major league player Pete Rose , who had recently signed a four year , 3.2 million dollar deal with the Philadelphia Phillies , appears behind Chico . ]
Pete -ee Rose ... Baseball been berry , berry good to Pete Rose .
Three - point - two - million - dollar para Pete Rose .
Charlie Hustle , you bet .
Thank you berry , berry much .
In foot - ball ... I do n’t know football .
In Dominican Republic , football is — how you say , Hane ?
Um , Oh !
Soccer !
Your football ...
I do n’t know .
In National Hockey League ...
I do n’t know hockey .
In baseball … Baseball been berry , berry good to me !
Thank you berry much .
Thank you .
Thank you berry much .
Hane ?
Thank you , Hane . ”
Hearing Chico ’s fact - challenged report , Jane responds sarcastically : “ Great job , Chico .
I ’m glad that we have n’t hired just another stupid ex-jock sportscaster . ”
Morris went on to appear as Chico Escuela eight more times before leaving the Saturday Night Live cast in the summer of 1980 .
Each time , he repeated “ Baseball been berry , berry good to me ! ” ( sometimes written as “ Beisbol been bery , bery good to me ! ” and in various other ways ) .
It remains one of the most famous of the many memorable catchphrases created by SNL .

The BBC today asked users of its news website " Should homosexuals face execution ? " on a talkboard discussion for a World Service programme for African listeners .
Posted on a BBC News premoderated talkboard , the thread was designed to provoke discussion ahead of the latest edition of interactive World Service programme Africa Have Your Say .
" Yes , we accept it is a stark and disturbing question , but this is the reality behind an anti-homosexuality bill being debated on Friday by the Ugandan parliament which would see some homosexual offences punishable by death , " the post said .
The talkboard post asked users to send in their views to the programme , which goes out on the World Service and is also available online .
" Has Uganda gone too far ?
Should there be any level of legislation against homosexuality ?
Should homosexuals be protected by legislation as they are in South Africa ?
What would be the consequences of this bill to you ?
How will homosexual ' offences ' be monitored ? , " the post added .
Premoderated posts included one from Chris , Guildford , posted at 8.59 am , which attracted 51 recommendations of support .
He wrote : " Totally agree .
Ought to be imposed in the UK too , asap .
Bring back some respectable family values .
Why do we have to suffer ' gay pride ' festivals ?
Would I be allowed to organise a ' straight pride ' festival ?
No , thought as much !!
If homosexuality is natural , as we are forced to believe , how can they sustain the species ?
I suggest all gays are put on a remote island somewhere and left for a generation - after which , theoretically there should be none left ! "
Another , from Aaron in Freetown , said : " Bravo to the Ugandans for this wise decision , a bright step in eliminating this menace from your society .
We hope other African nations will also follow your bold step . "
The Africa Have Your Say programme aired at 4 pm today .
By 5.30 pm , the headline of the discussion had been changed to " Should Uganda debate gay execution ? " .
Liliane Landor , the BBC World Service acting head of Africa region , defended the radio programme and talkboard post , saying it allowed gay men and lesbians from Uganda , whose voices have never been heard in the UK , to talk with dignity about the impact the legislation would have on their lives .
The show also included the opinion of those who supported the anti-homosexual legislation , including religious leaders , she said .
" The programme was a dignified exchange between people who have differing beliefs , " Landor added .
Landor said that the World Service realised that the headline on the talkboard was blunt , but it was carefully put in context .
" We wanted to frame the question starkly , in order to reflect the stark reality of the Ugandan bill , " she added .
The BBC Pride board , composed of gay and lesbian staff at the corporation , lobbied the World Service to change the headline and close discussion " to minimise negative reflection on the BBC " .
Eric Joyce , the Labour MP for Falkirk , labelled the post " more than offensive " .
" It 's completely unacceptable .
And it 's mainly British people replying , " he said on Twitter .
The talkboard post is understood to have been written by a female member of the BBC World Service Africa bureau .
The World Service , which broadcasts in 32 languages on TV , radio and the web , is part of BBC Global News , but funded by the Foreign Office .

NEMESIS
Chapter 1 : Cosmic Terrorist
LUIS ALVAREZ walked into my office looking like he was ready for a fight .
" Rich , I just got a crazy paper from Raup and Sepkoski .
They say that great catastrophes occur on the Earth every 26 million years , like clockwork .
It 's ridiculous . "
I recognized the names of the two respected paleontologists .
Their claim did sound absurd .
It was either that , or revolutionary , and one recent revolution had been enough .
Four years earlier , in 1979 , Alvarez had discovered what had killed the dinosaurs .
Working with his son Walter , a geologist , and Frank Asaro and Helen Michel , two nuclear chemists , he had shown that the extinction had been triggered 65 million years ago by an asteroid crashing into the Earth .
Many paleontologists had initially paid no attention to this work , and one had publicly dismissed Alvarez as a " nut , " regardless of his Nobel Prize in physics .
Now , it seemed , the nuts were sending their theories to Alvarez .
" I 've written them a letter pointing out their mistakes , " Alvarez continued .
" Would you look it over before I mail it ? "
It sounded like a modest request , but I knew better .
Alvarez expected a lot .
He wanted me to study the " crazy paper , " understand it in detail , and then do the same with his letter .
He wanted each of his calculations redone from scratch .
It would be a time - consuming and tedious task , but I could n't turn him down .
He and I depended on each other for this kind of work .
We knew we could trust each other to do a thorough job .
Moreover , we had enough mutual respect so that we did n't mind looking foolish to each other , although neither of us liked looking foolish to the outside world .
So I reluctantly accepted the task , as I had many times before .
The Alvarez theory had slowly been gaining acceptance in the scientific world .
The astronomers had been the most receptive , perhaps because their photographs often showed large asteroids and comets floating around in space in orbits that crossed the path of the Earth .
They knew that disastrous impacts must have taken place frequently in the past .
Many geologists had likewise been won over .
But a majority of paleontologists still seemed opposed to the theory , which was disruptive to their standard models of evolution .
Alvarez took pride in the fact that some of the most respected paleontologists nevertheless liked his theory , including Stephen Jay Gould , Dale Russell , David Raup , and J. John Sepkoski .
I began my assignment by reading the paper by Raup and Sepkoski .
They had collected a vast amount of data on family extinctions in the oceans , far more than had previously been assembled .
That fact disturbed me ; I hate to dismiss the conclusions of experts , especially conclusions based on such minute study .
Their analysis showed that there were intense periods of extinctions every 26 million years .
It was n't surprising that there should be extinctions this often , but it was surprising that they should be so regularly spaced .
Alvarez 's work had shown that at least two of these extinctions were caused by asteroid impacts , the one that killed the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period , 65 million years ago , and the one that killed many land mammals at the end of the Eocene , 3539 million years ago .
( The age was uncertain because of the difficulty of dating old rocks . )
Astrophysics was a field I thought I knew ; my work in it had earned me a professorship in physics at Berkeley and three prestigious national awards .
But the paper beggared my understanding .
I found it incredible that an asteroid would hit precisely every 26 million years .
In the vastness of space , even the Earth is a very small target .
An asteroid passing close to the sun has only slightly better than one chance in a billion of hitting our planet .
The impacts that do occur should be randomly spaced , not evenly strung out in time .
What could make them hit on a regular schedule ?
Perhaps some cosmic terrorist was taking aim with an asteroid gun .
Ludicrous results require ludicrous theories .
I hurried to the end of their paper , like a reader cheating on a mystery novel , to see how Raup and Sepkoski would explain the periodicity .
I was disappointed to find that they had no theory , only facts .
Physicists have a wry saying : " If it happens , then it must be possible . "
Many discoveries had been missed because scientists ignored data that did n't fit into their established mode of thinking , their paradigm , and I did n't want to fall into that trap .
Maybe it would be best to review their data , I thought , and try to judge them independently of theory .
On a chart , they had plotted the varying extinction rate for the last 250 million years .
The big peaks in the rate were spaced 26 million years apart .
Next I turned to Alvarez 's letter .
He thought there were several mistakes in the way that Raup and Sepkoski had analyzed their data .
Several of the apparent peaks , he argued , should be removed from the analysis because of their low statistical certainty .
Likewise , both the Cretaceous and Eocene extinctions should not be considered as part of a periodic pattern , since they were due to asteroid impacts and therefore must be random in time .
This had been as obvious to Alvarez as to me .
With these extinctions removed , the remaining ones were so widely separated that it looked like all evidence for periodicity had vanished .
Alvarez 's approach was convincing , but was it right ?
It was my job to be the devil 's advocate , to defend the conclusions of Raup and Sepkoski .
I went back to their paper and looked at the chart again .
I must n't be too skeptical , I thought .
I replotted their data , substituting the conventions of physicists for those of paleontologists .
I gave each extinction an uncertainty in age as well as in intensity .
The new chart looked more impressive than I had expected .
It was a rough version of the one shown on page 6 .
I had placed the arrows at the regular 26 - million - year intervals .
Eight of them pointed right at extinction peaks ; only two missed .
The peaks certainly seemed to be evenly spaced .
Maybe they were right .
I realized I had better reexamine Alvarez 's case , and see if it was flawed .
This job was turning out to be more fun than I had expected .
On my second reading of Alvarez 's letter , I found it particularly dubious that the Cretaceous and Eocene extinctions should be excluded .
How do we know that asteroids do not hit the Earth periodically ?
I asked .
Maybe our failure to arrive at a theory just meant that we had n't been clever enough .
Not finding something is not the same as proving it is not there .
I decided to reserve judgment .
A few minutes later Alvarez stopped by to see if I had finished , and I told him that I had found a mistake in his logic .
It had been improper to exclude the Cretaceous and Eocene mass extinctions , I said .
I presented my case like a lawyer , interested in proving my client innocent , even though I was n't totally convinced myself .
Alvarez rejoined strongly , like a lawyer himself .
" To keep those extinctions in the analysis would be cheating , " he said .
His belligerent offense threw me momentarily off balance .
" You 're taking a no - think approach , " he continued .
" A scientist is not allowed to ignore something he knows to be true , and we know those events were due to asteroid impacts . "
I knew Alvarez far too well to acquiesce in his onslaught .
My approach was not no - think , I said .
It was proper to ignore certain " prior knowledge " in testing a hypothesis .
He had no right to assume that the Cretaceous and Eocene extinctions could not be a part of a larger periodic pattern .
Maybe if we were clever enough to find the right explanation , we would see that asteroid impacts can be periodic .
Alvarez repeated his previous argument , with a little more emphasis on the phrase " no - think . "
His body language seemed to say , " Why does n't Rich understand me ?
How can he be so dumb ? "
I repeated my old arguments .
We were talking right past each other .
He knew he was right .
I knew I was right .
We were n't getting anywhere .
This was not a question of politics or religion or opinion .
It was a question of data analysis , something all physicists should be able to agree on .
Certainly Alvarez and I should be able to agree , after nearly two decades of working together .
I tried again .
" Suppose someday we found a way to make an asteroid hit the Earth every 26 million years .
Then would n't you have to admit that you were wrong , and that all the data should have been used ? "
" What is your model ? " he demanded .
I thought he was evading my question .
" It does n't matter !
It 's the possibility of such a model that makes your logic wrong , not the existence of any particular model . "
There was a slight quiver in Alvarez 's voice .
He , too , seemed to be getting angry .
" Look , Rich , " he retorted , " I 've been in the data - analysis business a long time , and most people consider me quite an expert .
You just can't take a no - think approach and ignore something you know . "
He was claiming authority !
Scientists are n't allowed to do that .
Hold your temper , Rich , I said to myself .
Do n't show him you 're getting annoyed .
" The burden of proof is on you , " I continued , in an artificially calm voice .
" I do n't have to come up with a model .
Unless you can demonstrate that no such models are possible , your logic is wrong . "
" How could asteroids hit the Earth periodically ?
What is your model ? " he demanded again .
My frustration brought me close to the breaking point .
Why could n't Alvarez understand what I was saying ?
He was my scientific hero .
How could he be so stupid ?
Damn it !
I thought .
If I have to , I 'll win this argument on his terms .
I 'll invent a model .
Now my adrenaline was flowing .
After another moment 's thought , I said : " Suppose there is a companion star that orbits the sun .
Every 26 million years it comes close to the Earth and does something , I 'm not sure what , but it makes asteroids hit the Earth .
Maybe it brings the asteroids with it . "
I was surprised by Alvarez 's thoughtful silence .
He seemed to be taking the idea seriously and mentally checking to see if there was anything wrong with it .
His anger had disappeared .
Finally he said , " You surprised me , Rich .
I was sure you would come up with a model that brought in dust or rocks from outside the solar system , and then I was going to hit you with a fact I bet you did n't know , that the iridium layer associated with the disappearance of the dinosaurs came from within our own solar system .
The rhenium - 187 / rhenium -185 ratio in the boundary clay is the same as in the Earth 's crust .
I figured that you did n't know this .
But your companion star was presumably born along with the sun , and so it would have the same isotope ratios as the sun .
The argument I was holding in reserve is no good .
Nice going . "
Alvarez paused .
He had been trying to think a step ahead of me , anticipating my moves , like a chess master .
He had guessed what my criticism would be and had his answer ready - but I had made a different move .
He seemed pleased that his former student could surprise him .
He finally said , " I think that your orbit would be too big .
The companion would be pulled away by the gravity of other nearby stars . "
I had n't expected the argument to cool down so suddenly .
We were back to discussing physics , not authority or logic .
I had n't meant my model to be taken that seriously , although I had felt that my point would be made if the model could withstand assault for at least a few minutes .
He was right that I was ignorant of the rhenium discovery .
Alvarez 's son Walter , a geologist , had found a clay layer that had been deposited in the oceans precisely at the time the dinosaurs were destroyed .
This clay layer , the elder Alvarez hypothesized , had been created by the impact of an extraterrestrial body ( such as a comet or an asteroid ) on the Earth .
Rhenium comes in several forms - among others , rhenium - 185 , which is stable , and rhenium - 187 , which is radioactive and disappears with a half - life of 40 billion years .
In the 4.5 billion years since the formation of the solar system , approximately 8 % of the rhenium - 187 should have disintegrated .
And , in fact , roughly that amount had .
Unless the rhenium in the clay had been produced at the same time as the rhenium in the Earth ( i.e. , at the formation of the solar system ) , the ratios were very unlikely to be so nearly identical .
In other words , the extraterrestrial body would appear to have been born at the same time as the sun .
Now I took the initiative .
" Let 's see if you are right that the star would be pulled away from the sun .
We can calculate how big the orbit would be . "
I wrote Kepler 's laws of gravitational motion on the blackboard .
The major diameter of an elliptical orbit is the period of the orbit , in this case 26 million years , raised to the 2/3 power , and multiplied by 2 .
My Hewlett - Packard 11C pocket calculator quickly yielded the answer : 176,000 astronomical units , i.e. , 176,000 times as far as the distance from the Earth to the sun , about 2.8 light - years .
( A light - year is the distance that light travels in one year . )
That put the companion star close enough to the sun so it would not get pulled away by other stars .
Alvarez nodded .
The theory had survived five minutes , so far .
" It looks good to me .
I wo n't mail my letter . "
Alvarez 's turnaround was as abrupt as his argument had been fierce .
He had switched sides so quickly that I could n't tell whether I had won the argument or not .
It was my turn to say something nice to him , but he spoke first .
" Let 's call Raup and Sepkoski and tell them that you found a model that explains their data . "
So was born the Nemesis hypothesis , though I had no idea at the time where this would lead me .
The Wiltshire town of Swindon is to become the first in the UK to provide free wireless internet access to all its residents .
A " Wi - Fi mesh " would give blanket internet coverage for 186,000 citizens , the council said today .
The £ 1 m project will be funded by a mixture of public and private money .
It is hoped the scheme will break into profit with residents subscribing to faster , paid - for access , above the free service .
About 1,400 secure access points will be fitted around Swindon , similar to those used in homes , but " with a much higher performance " .
The borough council worked with a local businessman , Rikki Hunt , who came up with the concept , and the digital technology firm aQovia to create a new company – Digital City UK .
Under the brand name Signal , it will roll out the technology throughout the town .
Line rental is free and there is no connection charge .
The public will be able to access the internet and download emails without charge , but usage will be limited .
There are also plans to deliver information such as real - time home electricity usage and air - quality monitoring .
The mesh also has the potential to provide free internet phone - calls .
The council says this could be used by health professionals to carry out consultations and remote medical procedures or examinations through Telemedicine – a form of interactive online healthcare ) .
The council says subscribers can sign up for 20 Mb upgrades for " significantly less per month than major broadband competitors " after a free three - month trial .
There will also be pay - as - you - go options so visitors can use the network .
The wireless project will be run by Digital City UK Ltd , of which Swindon borough council has a 35 % share , with the intention of working on similar rollouts in other towns and cities .
Rod Bluh , Swindon borough council leader , said : " Not only will residents in the borough be able to access the internet for free , the council and its partners will be able to use the technology to provide cutting - edge services to the areas or individuals who need them . "
The council caused controversy this year when it shut down all its fixed - point speed cameras .
Willy the polar bear 's delight as he 's delivered a very special treat :
Two tons of ice cubes covered in maple syrup
It sounds like an odd gift to you or me - but for a polar bear , it 's just perfect .
At least , that 's what Willy the polar bear seemed to think as he played with the two and a half tons of ice cubes partially covered in maple syrup .
The ice cubes were trucked into Willy 's enclosure at the North Carolina Zoo in the U.S. as a special treat for the 24 - year - old .
Mmmm , tasty : Willy sticks out his grey tongue to lick up the ice cubes - and maple syrup - from his treat
What a cool gift !
Willy frolics happily on his bed of ice
Willy , who weighs a staggering 800 lbs or 57 stones , is pictured licking the ice , eating an apple and lounging , in scenes more like the Arctic than a zoo .
The ice cubes were donated to the zoo by a local ice company .
Photographer Valerie Abbott , 51 , took the pictures while watching Willy for two and a half hours .
She said : ' Willy was anxious to get out and play in the new ice .
He rolled around , dug into the ice , laid on his back and would root in it with his nose .
I 'm done now : Worn out from his play , a sleepy Willy plops onto his tummy for a n-ice nap
' When the keeper threw him the apple at first he did n't notice but his strong sense of smell eventually led him to it .
' I was incredibly lucky to get a picture of Willy sticking his tongue out so far as he licked the ice . '
The zoo used the event to launch a fundraising appeal to raise money to expand the polar bear enclosure .
Lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced companion bills that would enact a promise made by President Barack Obama — and touted by Michelle Obama — guaranteeing paid sick days to workers at all but the smallest companies .
The Healthy Families Act — introduced in identical versions earlier this year by Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass . — would allow workers to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked , up to seven eight - hour days per year .
They would be able to use this time to stay home when they are ill , care for a sick family member , visit the doctor , or seek help if they are victims of domestic violence .
Employers with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt from complying with the act .
Backers say the bill would bring the United States into line with other advanced industrialized nations .
" With the H1N1 [ flu ] outbreak , countless public health officials urged people to follow a simple guideline :
If you get sick , stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them , " DeLauro said in a statement when she introduced the bill on May 18 , 2009 .
" Yet for many Americans , following this sound advice is impossible .
Almost half of all private sector workers , 57 million , do not have a single paid sick day .
These workers put their jobs on the line every time they take a day off . ”
DeLauro has introduced a similar measure for three Congresses running , but backers say that the number of co-sponsors this year is higher than ever .
As of early November , 113 members of the House and 21 senators had signed on as co-sponsors .
However , all were Democrats , which poses challenges for the bill .
The lack of Republican support might not prevent passage in the House , where the majority party can often pass its agenda without minority votes , but it will likely pose a challenge in the Senate , where the Republican minority can effectively block contentious bills from being taken up .
Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business have spoken out against the measure , saying employers , already strapped by the recession , could suffer under the new requirements .
The measure has not progressed beyond a hearing in one House subcommittee , and action is not expected until the question of health care reform is resolved , at the earliest .
That could push the debate into next year .
Still , it 's enough for us to rate this one In the Works .

CNN 's Jim Acosta this morning filed the first part of a three - part report on the return of the militia movement , something we 've been tracking regularly here at C&L .
The piece , unfortunately , is like a lot of mainstream reportage on the movement -- that is to say , reporters " parachute " in to a location ( in this case , southeastern Michigan ) and provide a facile report that 's about toe deep in content .
As with so many such reports , it 's typically susceptible to swallowing whole the mythology that militia members like to toss up for mainstream consumption .
In this case , Acosta willingly transmits the main purpose of the militia movement -- which is to say , remaking genuinely extremist belief systems as mainstream and legitimate .
Lee Miracle , the Michigan group 's leader , is portrayed as just a gee - shucks ordinary guy concerned about his constitutional rights .
But then there were the other members , and it was clear there was the usual undertow of unhinged paranoia present -- along with clear statements that they were motivated by fear of a Democratic president , and particularly Obama :
ACOSTA ( voice - over ) : Training for what depends on who you ask , but this militia member , who did n't want to give his last name , worries the government will eventually take away his gun rights .
" BRIAN " , SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN VOLUNTEER MILITIA :
Well , any time we get a Democratic president in the office , people become concerned , including myself and we get a resurgence out here .
ACOSTA : Others just do n't like President Obama .
So , you do n't trust him ?
MICHAEL LACKOMAR , SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN VOLUNTERR MILITIA :
In short , I think he could be dangerous for the nation .
While overall it gives a pretty warm and fluffy view of the militias , it 's not a thoroughly bad report ; it at least manages to quote the SPLC's Mark Potok , who points out how they are driven by a combination of anti-liberal animus and wingnutty paranoia :
MARK POTOK , SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER :
The truth is , is that these groups are popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain .
ACOSTA ( voice - over ) : Earlier this year , Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center put out a report warning of a surge in militia activity that came with the election of President Obama .
Since that report was issued , Potok says his staff has counted 100 new militia groups across the country .
POTOK : There really is this kind of terrible fear mixed with fury about the idea that President Obama is somehow leading a kind of socialistic , you know , takeover of America .
In Acosta 's on - air segment after the report , he talked it over with John Roberts and Kiran Chetry , and noted that , as it was in the 1990s , the militias are being driven by fear about both gun rights and Obama generally :
ROBERTS : All right .
Is it all about gun rights then ?
ACOSTA : A lot of it is about gun rights .
A lot of it is about distrust .
They just do n't trust this president .
They think he is out to peel back rights and the gun issue is their big ones .
You know , we should mention that the gun control issue specifically is really unrealistic in many ways .
Because the Obama administration knows and Democrats know that it will be political suicide for them to go after gun control measures .
In fact , the attorney general indicated just recently that he's not even going to go back to the assault weapons ban that was enacted during the Clinton administration .
Then they ran one of their phone - in polls :
CHETRY : We also want to know what you think .
Are militia members patriots or are they extremists ?
And o you think that your rights are slipping away or do you think that these militias go too far ?
Join us tomorrow and we 're going to have part two of Jim 's piece .
At the CNN / am Fix blog , Acosta described what the next two parts will look like :
Not to worry , says the group 's leader Lee Miracle .
A military veteran and postal worker , yes postal worker , Miracle says he urges respect for the president .
He 's out to change the way the world views militia groups .
We get an up - close look at his family in part two of our series .
A family Miracle refers to as " Lee and Kate plus eight plus a gun rack . "
That 's because they have eight kids and 22 guns in the house .
And the kids take part in militia day .
In part three of our series , we go to Las Vegas to go behind the scenes with an organization called " Oathkeepers . "
It 's a group of ex-law enforcement officials and military veterans who say they 've sworn an oath to the Constitution , not the president .
The president they 're referring to , of course , is Mr. Obama .
The ADL released a report today about the growing rage in the American landscape , of which the militia movement is a significant part :
While anti-government anger has certainly spurred the rapid growth of these groups , modern technology has also played a role in the ability of militia groups to form and recruit , especially the use by militia groups of social networking sites such as MySpace to spread their message and recruit new members ( and inspire new groups to form ) .
One result of these developments , though , is that the 2009 version of the militia movement is more loosely organized than its predecessor , and many of the individual groups are considerably smaller .
Many militia groups have no more than around 10 regular members .
Some groups are essentially “ Web only ” and conduct little real world activity .
In addition to the groups , there are increased numbers of people who identify with the militia movement , and may even attend various trainings or events , but do not officially belong to any particular group .
These unaffiliated members now make up an important part of the movement .
The militia movement is a major source of anti-Obama and anti-government hostility , and a major audience for the extreme conspiracy theories revolving around FEMA , martial law , and gun confiscation .
Because the militia movement has had a fairly strong association with criminal activity , especially related to illegal weapons and explosives , or conspiracies to use them , the resurgence of this movement is a matter of some concern to law enforcement .
It 's not a surprise that militias are ordinary - seeming -- that is , after all , their entire purpose .
CNN needs to do a report that scratches beneath this surface .
I described the underlying dynamic in my 1999 book , In God 's Country : The Patriot Movement and the Pacific Northwest , :
WASHINGTON  Advisers to President Obama are preparing three options for escalating the war effort in Afghanistan , all of them calling for more American troops , as he moves closer to a decision on the way forward in the eight - year - old war , officials said Saturday .
The options include Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal ’s request for roughly another 40,000 troops ; a middle scenario sending about 30,000 more troops ; and a lower alternative involving 20,000 to 25,000 reinforcements , according to the officials , who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations .
Officials hope to present the options to Mr. Obama this week before he leaves on a trip to Asia .
While some civilian and military officials believe Mr. Obama is seeking a middle ground in the debate over Afghanistan , aides denied he has made any decision or is leaning toward any of the options .
Still , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates appears to be supportive of the middle option , some officials said , and his view is thought to be pivotal because of Mr. Obama ’s respect for him and his status as a holdover from a Republican administration .
The three options define the contours of a debate that has played out in public for more than two months .
General McChrystal , the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan , and his advocates argue the war cannot be won without a major infusion of forces to protect the population and ultimately turn it against the Taliban .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others oppose a buildup in a war they believe cannot be won through conventional means and that diverts attention from Pakistan , where Al Qaeda is primarily located .
There are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan .
The Fatah movement and other Palestinian political groups have criticized the Hamas organization for spending about $ 2 million on its anniversary celebrations , while most of the Gaza Strip 's residents are forced to live off United Nations aid .
The main rally marking Hamas ' 22nd anniversary was held in Gaza earlier this week and was attended by tens of thousands of the Strip 's residents .
According to sources in Gaza , Hamas pressured the residents , particularly those living in refugee camps , to take part in the rally .

Hamas ' expenditures included public transportation , advertising and marketing – including printing banners and instruments with the movement 's symbols .
Meanwhile , sources in Gaza have reported of a new corruption affair in Hamas ' transportation ministry .
According to one testimony , a senior ministry official named Ziad Harara took tens of thousands of dollars and disappeared .
Some claim he left the Strip , perhaps to one of the United Arab Emirates countries .
This affair is related to the driving studies industry in the Strip .
According to reports , senior transportation ministry officials take NIS 2,500 - 3,000 ( about $ 658-790 ) for issuing a driving license , even for people who do fail to meet the driving test 's demands .

Acceptable Genes : Religious Traditions and Genetically Modified Foods
Edited by Conrad G. Brunk and Harold Coward
( SUNY Press , 2009 )
Why is genetically modified food an issue for kosher Jews , halal Muslims , and vegetarian Hindus ?
How do religious beliefs intersect with ethical and moral views on biotechnology ?
A new collection of essays explores the links between religion , culture , and GMOs .
In their new book , Acceptable Genes : Religious Traditions and Genetically Modified Foods , Conrad G. Brunk and Harold Coward have compiled a unique set of religious , cultural , and indigenous perspectives on genetically modified foods .
Many of us are aware of at least some of the ways biotechnology has invaded the supermarket .
But dietary practice often intersects with religious faith , and despite the moral and religious convictions about modified foods , these perspectives have been marginalized in public debate .
Oddly enough , religious and moral beliefs may carry more weight with lawmakers and industry regulators than consumer attitudes do .
Combating the secrecy surrounding GMOs may only be possible with strong religious and moral arguments for equal tolerance and respect in play .
GMO Pros and Cons
GMOs are organisms that contain genetic material from other sources ( like a tomato that has been enhanced by animal DNA in a lab ) or organisms from which DNA has been removed .
Altering an organism ’s DNA can affect traits , measurable or observable quantities such as height , weight , color , or behavior ; it is crucial to understand that this new genetic material will be inherited by the organism ’s offspring .
More broadly , GM foods also include any plant infused with genes from other species .
The motivations for this type of scientific perversion are multifaceted and varied .
In addition to developing “ improved ” insect - resistant crops , scientists are able to create advanced pharmaceuticals and treatments for conditions including diabetes , hemophilia , and hepatitis .
Genetic disorders can be curbed , and perhaps in the future , eradicated .
At the same time , GM foods have caused considerable ethical controversy over the potential for unknown harm .
Particularly in Europe , Japan , and parts of Africa , the uproar over untested , unlabeled GM foods in the food supply has been dramatic .
Some of the controversy can simply be labeled Luddite resistance .
Yet legitimate concerns about food allergens , environmental degradation , crop homogeneity , and the unfair burden placed on small farmers to keep up in a quickly evolving economy defy the impulse to cast all naysayers as technophobes .
In the United States , GM foods remain largely — if not entirely — unlabeled in supermarkets , making it nearly impossible to determine the scientific or man-made origins of your food .
Then again , it ’s usually safe to assume that non-organic products contain traces of genetically modified corn or soybeans .
As of July 2009 , the USDA reported that over eighty percent of corn , soybean , and cotton planted areas contain genetically modified varieties of the respective crops .
Non-Vegetarian Plants ?
As Brunk and Coward are careful to point out , no religion or moral code is monolithic .
Expert scholars may hold different views than lay practitioners of a particular faith .
Throughout the book , lay adherents and expert interpreters alike offer perspectives on how GM foods intersect with their religious and ethical dietary traditions .
Each author conducted additional focus groups among their respective discipline or tradition .
In Lyne Létourneau ’s dietary overview , vegetarianism is examined as a multifaceted choice .
Meat eating is historically conflicted ; while consuming meat in some societies is a marker of wealth and class status , in other religious contexts , eschewing flesh consumption is thought to evoke higher consciousness .
Splitting her case study into ‘ health ’ and ‘ ethical ’ vegetarians , Létourneau argues that most vegetarians ( one to 2.5 percent of the US population ) choose the lifestyle for health reasons .
The “ health vegetarians , ” according to her , are less ideologically committed to vegetarianism and therefore place less emphasis on organic , non -GM foods than ethical vegetarians .
Létourneau ’s focus group of ethical vegetarians largely indicated that the transfer of genetic material from animals to plants would violate an animal ’s essence and integrity , while additionally causing unknown environmental harm .
Through genetic modification , some plants would be rendered non-vegetarian , in a sense .
Therefore , both transgenic plant and animal modification — the transfer of animal DNA into plants and vice versa — would require labeling of transgenic organisms to satisfy the group ’s ethics .
Some of these concerns also emerged in additional religious focus groups for faith that prescribe vegetarianism .
For Jews , there were myriad contradictions in consuming genetically modified foods .
Jewish ethics scholar Laurie Zoloth found that among Conservative and Orthodox Jewish focus groups , genetic modification presented little problem , in part because many North Americans participants were largely unaware that they had been consuming transgenic foods .
Reform scholars and liberal laypeople presented more opposition .
Most participants agreed that food was a central part of Jewish life and agreed that GM foods are technically allowable since they are not specifically forbidden in Jewish texts .
But Jewish ethics and kashrut seek to limit overproduction and unnecessary consumption , and genetically modifying animals may constitute hubris in that humans seek to alter God ’s perfect creation .
Yet while the Mishnah prohibits plant grafting , it does not indicate that Jews cannot use or consume hybrid products or species .
When viewed from a health perspective , many Jews surveyed were in favor of genetic modification for therapeutic or medicinal intervention .
Unlike Judaism , Islam has few specific requirements to classify food as inherently good or permissible , and only disallows wine , pork , and its byproducts .
The Qur’an states that food is part of living a full life , and caring for one ’s physical body — as part of the larger self — is an essential part of salvation .
In his essay , Associate Professor of Islamic Studies and Muslim ethicist Ebrahim Moosa examines the ways that Muslim leaders have thus far treated GMOs has both managed risks and with precaution .
The influential Saudi - based Council for Islamic Jurisprudence ( CIJ ) long ago approved GM products for therapeutic use , but its reasons for doing so have been largely shrouded in secrecy .
The CIJ decision paved the way for Muslim religious authorities in Indonesia , Malaysia , and North America to approve GM foods .
In certain Western Muslim communities , the precautionary approach has been one that favors the viewpoints of Muslim - educated scientists over religious leaders .
Muslim ethical teachings provide few guidelines on food safety , but one conventional ideal of Muslim ethics relates to fitra , the preservation of God - given naturalness .
Fitra is central to Muslim ethics and spirituality , and though open to interpretation and distortion , it generally refers to innate intuitive ability to discern between right and wrong .
Moosa argues that Muslim inability to probe scientific data relating to GMOs and to more actively engage in debates is a product of location .
With many Muslim communities located in the developing world , it can be politically disadvantageous to argue with potentially life - saving technology .
While science and technology are often presented as a panacea for issues in the Global South , it remains crucial that religious authorities remain pragmatic when determining their positions on such weighty issues .
Most Christian denominations lack specific requirements for food , although a few , like Seventh Day Adventists , eschew pork and certain other animal products .
Generally , Christians ’ primary association between food and religion is through Holy Communion or the Eucharist , and many associate food and meals with fellowship .
Scientist and theologian Donald Bruce attempts to sum up North American Christian perspectives on GMOs and conducted focus groups with Mennonites and Adventists .
Bruce also looks at Amish farmers that have embraced GM crop trials as an example of a seemingly technophobic religious community critically examining the potential benefits of biotechnology .
Overall , Bruce determines that Christians do not generally oppose GM foods from a religious standpoint .
Unlike some other faiths , their individual objections may be instead rooted in personal politics .
Hinduism , because of its diverse communities and pluralistic beliefs , would seem more split on the issue of genetic modification .
Instead , Vasudha Narayanan found that because of food ’s prominence in dharma texts , it is important to consider various Hindu rituals and traditions surrounding food — feasting and fasting among them — in determining if and when GM food is acceptable .
Narayanan does not believe there can be a single authoritarian viewpoint , but varying contextual rules may apply .
In Hinduism , certain foods are also associated with specific characteristics : purity ( sattva ) , sloth and stupor ( tamas ) , and energy and passion ( rajas ) .
Based on an individual ’s consumption , these characteristics may manifest in the person .
Whole foods are essential for character and well - being , but if genetic material were inserted into these otherwise “ pure ” foods , it might contaminate the soul .
Narayanan explains that this , and many other types of segmented Hindu food classification and understandings , would make GM foods appropriate only for certain occasions or ritual use .
Similar to dilemmas faced by Muslims in the Global South , some Hindu communities in the developing world have already adopted types of GM grains due to population and food distribution issues .
The Buddha lived in a time when genetic material had not been studied .
For that reason , David R. Loy extrapolates on Buddhist teachings to find answers as to whether GM foods would be permissible for Buddhist practitioners .
Loy also admits that because Buddhism has such porous boundaries , it can be difficult to find commonality in diverse traditions .
Buddhists surveyed by Loy were not so much concerned with the outcome of genetic modification but the motivations behind it .
Because everything is connected in Buddhism — human technology is linked to natural phenomenon — it is important to consider if genetic modification will reduce or increase suffering in the world , or dukkha .
If the world becomes sick , so will we .
It is therefore imperative to avoid creating additional harm in anything we do .
Genetic modification is not necessarily harmful , but in order for healthful products to have their intended benefits , it is important that producing them is carried out within healthful social , economic , and ecological frameworks .
In an essay on Indigenous traditions and genetic modification by Shiri Pasternak , Lorenzo Mazgul , and Nancy J. Turner the authors explain that maintenance of traditional food practices keeps people rooted to their past — especially people that have been historically colonized by Christian missionaries and European settlers alike .
Corn , for example , is an integral part of Mayan spiritual worldview and ecological practice , believed to be created perfect in its original form by God .
For many of the indigenous people surveyed , GM food was outright rejected as an offensive break from natural order and traditional dietary practice .
Perhaps not surprisingly , many indigenous people see genetic modification as further colonialism , unregulated capitalist , corporate power , and a few claimed GM food was one more example of cultural genocide .
The only piece that feels contextually misplaced in this collection is Hsiung Ping - chen ’s “ So That You May Do No Harm : Changing Attitudes Toward Food in Late Imperial China . ”
While Chinese food policy affects a significant percentage of the world population , it seems problematic to present “ Chinese food culture ” as a monolithic way of life .
The piece looks at concepts like the five elements and yin -yang but lacks a specific spiritual context I expected from the piece .
The focus of Ping - chen ’s writing is not on spiritual food ritual but on medicinal treatments and food remedies .
While it offers a thorough examination of The Book of Congee , I would have appreciated more critical analysis of Chinese food culture as it has descended from Taoism and Buddhism .
Regulating Food , Regulating Identity
In the end , Conrad G. Brunk , Nola M. Ries , and Leslie C. Rodgers lay out guidelines for food labeling in North America .
Equating food consumption with sexuality , they posit that both have been strictly regulated throughout history as defining characteristics of religious and spiritual identity .
Yet not unlike other individual moral and ethical choices , it can be difficult to explain why some people draw a line at eating GM foods when others do not .
The paradoxes displayed in many of the chapters are intriguing , to be sure , but can come coupled with frustration for scientists , researchers , and even other laypeople attempting to distill arguments about GM food into their simplest forms .
Yet all of the arguments do all provide one consistent reality : cultural and religious sensitivities to issues around food , consumption , safety , and technology deserve to be taken seriously by regulators and policy makers .
For government officials to treat complicated personal beliefs as whims or preferences is disrespectful and rather irresponsible .
To that end , labeling in the United States must be consistent so that all consumers can make the same informed choices .
By and large , voluntary labeling has simply not been adopted .
The governmental and industry opposition to mandatory labeling has long been rooted in several arguments : that GM labels will signal safety or nutritional problems for consumers only accustomed to seeing nutritional information on labels and should therefore not be included ; that labeling would greatly increase production cost due to additional monitoring of facilities , and that labeling would require further definition of terms “ GM ” and “ GM - free . ”
These supposed concerns about labeling have not stopped the European Union from adopting mandatory labeling .
As a result , consumer choice is enhanced and can be based on more thoroughly informed decision - making at an individual level .
Most people do not object to labels such as “ kosher ” or “ halal . ”
Why should another label that aids in personally ethical purchasing and consuming be any different ?
Indeed , divergent religious groups can often agree that in order to progress on issues that so greatly impact society , spiritual and cultural traditions must be considered .
Hundreds of millions of people around the world practice the religions surveyed in this collection , which should make their preferences all the more salient for legislators .
Believers may disagree on many things , but our collective health and well - being , in addition to being informed citizens , is rarely up for debate .
Recipes for Kids !
This blog was created for my 8 year old sister who loves to cook !
It has to be frustrating to find recipes you really want to make only to find that you do n't have that odd ingredient it asks for and Mom is too busy doing her own chores to take you to the store .
These recipes are ( I hope ) fun , easy , and call for common ingredients that you can almost always find in the cupboards and pantry !
If you have any ideas , PLEASE email them to me so we can share them !
I did follow the traditional " Texas " style of chili making and did not include beans .
This recipe is very thick , savory , and meaty .
One of my variations is to use two types of chicken meat for added flavor and texture .
I use the traditional ground chicken , and I also include whole shredded chicken from a store bought rotisserie chicken .
If you prefer beans in your chili , please feel free to add them ( I think pinto beans would be very good ) .
I included plenty of aromatics ( vegetables ) cooked until soft and brown , and a good dose of Louisiana hot pepper sauce for heat .
The addition of beer adds some flavor but mostly assist in deglazing the pan which is very important in this recipe since I recommend cooking this chili in a stainless steel pan ( do not use a non - stick pan ) in order to generate lots of those yummy brown bits ( fond ) that stick to the bottom of the pan ( which is always a good thing ! ) .

Starting with a store bought rotisserie chicken , shred the chicken from the bones ( discarding the skin ) , and temporarily store the meat in a bowl .
If you feel the need to roast your own chicken go for it , but in this case , I think a store bought roasted chicken saves lots of time and energy .
Some people ( like my daughter ) prefer to opt for larger cuts of meat and cut the chicken into cubes rather than shred .
This option is up to you .
I prefer the shredded meat because it adds a thicker texture to the chili , and also adds more surface area to blend with sauce .

For the aromatics ( vegetables ) , start with 2 carrots , 3 celery stalks , 1 red bell pepper , and 1 medium onion .
The addition of diced jalapeño pepper(s ) is optional for extra heat .
Cut the vegetables into a fine dice .
( Discard the seeds of the red bell pepper . )
Once again , the fine dice adds more surface area to the chili , which adds a more thicker texture , and richer flavor when sautéed .

Start by cooking the ground chicken meat in a med - high heatedpan with a little olive oil .
I prefer a stainless steel pan so that the meat will form little browned bits ( called fond ) that will stick to the bottom of the pan and provide lots of concentrated flavor later on .
Season the meat with salt and pepper .
Make sure the meat gets good and brown ( Browning = Flavor ) .

I love spicy buffalo chicken wings .
I also love chili .
And yes , I love to cook too .
So when the company I work for ( Boeing ) presented a chili cook - off contest a while back , I took the challenge to heart ( and the drawing board ! ) .
There are a few versions of buffalo chicken chili circulating the web , but I came up with a variation that I think adds much more texture , intense flavor , and plenty of heat while minimizing the labor and time .
And best of all , this chili recipe is quite healthy .
( Oh , and I won the cook - off with this chili . )
So the word on the street is that Sun will open source Java , the news came out this week from JavaOne .
Sun has been pressed for quite some time to open source Java .
On the corporate side , we have IBM who likes to be portrayed as the paladin of open source by sending open letters asking for the opening of Java .
IBM , a big supporter of software patents ( a concept that goes against the very spirit of the open source crowd ) , managed to earn trust points by making these public demands .
The real motivation is probably related to the terms attached to IBM 's current license of Java from Sun .
The terms were probably acceptable when they originally entered into an agreement to license Java , back in the days of Java Applets , and the " WebRunner " that was going to take over the web .
Java over - engineered architecture failed strepitously as a Web platform , a place that has been taken over by the vastly simpler and actually useful Flash .
But IBM played an important role in turning Java into a programming language for server - side applications and now a big chunk of their revenues are tied to Java .
Java is not only over - engineered , but also has severe architectural limitations that no Java licensor has been able to address .
And this is the genius of Sun 's licensing of Java .
Sun , being a fairly poor as a software house , managed to slow down every single one of their competitors that adopted their Java technology .
Sun was able through this licensing to dictate the pace of innovation effectively slowing down everyone to a grinding halt .
And this poses a problem for companies like IBM with large revenue streams based on technology from a competing company .
Their honeymoon with Linux continues to grow as they can outcompete everyone else with their services business , and they would love nothing more than to be able to treat Java as a commodity .
Over the years , Sun has used a number of tactics to avoid third party implementations of Java to compete .
They introduced a certification suite that effectively requires folks to license their software , tune it for their platform and get Sun to rubber stamp it .
When the pressure mounted they created the Java Community Process .
The JCP addressed some of the community grievances and was also a moderately slow process that it would fit well with Sun 's software development practices .
In the last few years there have been a few trends that probably forced Sun to take some new steps .
Red Hat has been funding the development of another Java implementation for the past couple of years ( as pointed by Eugenia Loli ) and has managed to produce something that is not tied directly to Sun 's implementation .
On the other side of the open source spectrum ( yes , there is another end of the spectrum ) , the Apache foundation decided that they needed something with their own license and they would start everything from scratch .
This is was called the Apache 's Harmony project .
Apache 's Harmony project under normal circumstances would be another harmless project and an easy one to dismiss as a threat ( considering that nobody in that group had any coding skills and the group only managed to produce a lot of extra smtp traffic with grand visions of the ultimate Java Virtual Machine implementation ) finally got some code in the form of a large code dump from Intel .
Intel has been developing Java VMs for as long as the eye can see and they have released them in some form or another over the years , but this time they have decided to make their effort last and have dumped the code on the Harmony project .
Now , Harmony is composed mostly of idealists with no time or experience to code has on its hands a serious foundation to start with .
IBM was coincidentally , one of the original instigators to create Harmony and even volunteered to provide some code .
Whether their contractual Java obligations allowed them to is a completely different matter .
IBM has distinguished itself by staffing all their executives with drones who hate Microsoft , but hate Sun much more .
It is not unconceivable to think that IBM probably negotiated some kind of deal with Intel to get that code contributed to Apache .
And finally , a minor inconvenience to Sun is the existence of the Mono project , a .NET implementation for Linux that has been taking hold in the space and key applications are being written on it .
And for a company as proud as Sun , having a technology originally developed on Windows by Microsoft on its home turf its something that they are having problems stomaching .
Where does this leave us ?
Red
Hat most likely is sinking money into a project that will never materialize , but if this ultimately forces
Sun to open source a technology that , like IBM , its betting its future on it is money well spent .
Half a million dollars spent on a skunkworks efforts is peanut change for them .
The Sun announcement might be for real , like the OpenOffice and OpenSolaris announcements in the past , and they might deliver an open source implementation .
But the dynamics of Java are very different and they might be using this merely as a stalling technique to get both Harmony and GNU 's effort to slow down .
The Harmony mailing list is already showing some of these cracks .
I remain unconvinced , despite Sun 's track record in open sourcing those two technologies , they have also played English games to stall people , and have more than once claimed that they would open source a technology and deliver something completely different .
With OpenOffice and OpenSolaris they remained in charge and to this date they have not been out engineered .
Java presents a more threatening scenario , loosing control over it might mean that Sun becomes the laggard and is unable to keep up with changes done by forks of Java .
So far the only substance in this week 's JavaOne announcement is that they offer yet another license to distribute Java .
Stephen O'Grady's of Red Monk has the details
The announcement has every Sun employee , twitching with joy .
It seems to be a victory over a group of lawyers over at Sun , but it smells like a minor change ( Simon Phipps ) .
