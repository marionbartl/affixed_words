Cook left NASA to become an analyst with the U.S. Treasury Department in 1986 .
There he developed and taught training courses on policy analysis and led project teams on financial policy and organizational restructuring .
Public policy attempts to provide balance are hamstrung by the fact that , from the financial viewpoint , regulations and tax are restrictions on entrepreneurship and profit to be opposed and if possible eliminated .
As for labor , return on capital is improved if its cost can be reduced .
Outsourcing , offshoring , and labor market flexibility have helped keep wages in check .
Hence a major symptom of the Anglo Disease is long - term stagnation of the majority of incomes .
Flat incomes might constrain domestic demand , but easy credit ( to the further benefit of the financial industry that channels it ) has buttressed household spending .
Expansionist monetary policies in the West have combined with Chinese mercantilism to offer rapid asset price increases with no consumer goods or wage inflation , generating high corporate profits .
Global trade imbalances and what was a massive asset bubble created an economy blessed with the appearance of strong , inflation - free growth -- an illusion that helped validate the underlying policies , despite rising inequality and ballooning , unsustainable , debt burdens .
Starting with subprime lending , but now extending to other financial activities , market players have suddenly become scared by their collective imprudence and have engaged in a brutal process of deleveraging .
While the credit crunch devastates bank balance sheets , the wider economy is also suffering .
Credit available to businesses is shrinking , and the spigot of house equity withdrawals is turned off for consumers .
The reality of declining or stagnant incomes for the majority can no longer be camouflaged .
Prospects are dire , and further damage to the banking sector and the overall economy is likely .
The imbalances will only be unwound , ultimately , if incomes match spending more closely .
That can , of course , happen through a consumer spending slump and an inevitably painful recession .
The financial wagers and high - priced assets that surfed on a nicely growing economy will , at some point , have to be marked down as losses , as is happening already .
The Anglo Disease will face treatment by the kind of drastic purge that threatens the patient 's very life .
There remains another way : higher wages across the board , and a more modest financial sector restrained by regulators and unable to impose the artificially high return - on - capital requirements made possible only by excessive leverage .
Making banking boring again is , compared to the alternative , a fairly gentle cure for the Anglo Disease .

About this time last year , my colleagues and I were preparing for the first of the " early look " SDK releases .
I remember being a little freaked out — November 12 was starting to sound awfully close !
But I think I can safely speak for the entire Android team when I say that we were all very excited about that upcoming release .
In the year since , we 've run and concluded the first Android Developer Challenge , given away $ 5,000,000 , released more SDK builds , and worked with our partners to prepare the first device for users .
It 's been quite the whirlwind of a year .
In one of those strange cosmic symmetries , here we are a year later , and we 're once again very excited about an upcoming release .
I 'm referring , of course , to the first Android - powered device that our colleagues at T - Mobile have just announced — the T - Mobile G1 .
We can't wait to see our hard work on store shelves and in the hands of users , but today we 're almost as excited because we 're announcing the brand - new Android 1.0 SDK , release 1 .
Yes , that means we 're officially at 1.0 .
Of course the SDK wo n't remain static — we'll keep improving the tools by adding features and fixing bugs .
But now developers can rely on the APIs in the SDK , and can update their applications to run on Android 1.0 - compatible devices .
The Android Market beta will also launch with the T - Mobile G1 , providing developers an easy and open way to distribute their applications on that and later devices .
I 've already seen a lot of applications that have me stoked , and I can't wait to see things really come together as developers cross that final mile to prepare their applications for Android 1.0 .
So what 's next for us ?
Well , we 'll keep working on the SDK , as I said .
But we 're also working hard with our partners in the Open Handset Alliance on the open - source release , with the aim of making the code available in the fourth quarter .
The second Android Developer Challenge is also on the horizon — watch this space for more details .
We 're also already working on the future of the Android platform , and on more devices .
We 've updated the Developer Roadmap , and we 'll keep updating it as more information becomes available .
It has indeed been quite an exciting road to get to where we are today .
The road stretches on ahead though , and we 're not slowing down for a moment .
I look forward to meeting and working with many of you developers out there — and trying out your apps on my phone !
Happy Coding !
Palin's only interview so far ?
People magazine .
Sarah Palin has yet to meet the press
When political junkies flip through television stations on Sunday morning , they 'll find policy - driven interviews with three of the four candidates on the presidential tickets — John McCain , Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
They wo n’t , though , see Sarah Palin .
Less than two months before voters hit the polls , Palin has yet to sit down for or even schedule an issues - oriented interview with any newspaper , magazine or television network .

Meanwhile , the McCain campaign has significantly scaled back the access of the national press he used to jokingly refer to as his “ base , ” and several speakers , including Palin , took shots at the media in their speeches at last week 's Republican convention .
Since her debut in Dayton , Ohio , the McCain campaign has been receiving about 80 - 100 requests a day from news organizations around the world , according to spokesman Ben Porritt , who said interest in an interview was " through the roof " and that the campaign was going through them now .
" There 's no doubt in my mind that the McCain campaign would like to run out on the clock on this , " said David Chalian , political director for ABC News .
He expects the campaign will tightly manage access to Palin , but give some national interviews shortly before the Oct. 2 vice presidential debate with Biden , moderated by PBS ' Gwen Ifill .
" They know they 're not going to get through the next 60 days without doing interviews and being tested and prodded , " Chalian said .
But even if Palin does submit to a few carefully selected interviews around the October debate , that means another month before the 37 - million - plus viewers who tuned into Palin 's speech and others get their first look at how the newcomer to the national stage performs outside of a campaign - controlled setting .
In the meantime , Fox News is rolling out a special ( as are other networks ) : " Gov. Sarah Palin : An American Woman , " a one - hour biography hosted by Greta Van Susteren that includes " exclusive video and photos " and " interviews with her family , friends and colleagues " — but not Palin herself .
Palin has already become a ubiquitous presence on newsstands .
Presently , her face adorns the cover of traditional newsweeklies Time and Newsweek , Beltway favorites The New Republic and The Weekly Standard , and even celebrity glossies Us Weekly and Ok !.
While everyone from the New Yorker to CNBC has rushed to republish their older interviews with the Alaska governor , it 's People magazine that has the only actual interview she ’s done since joining to the ticket .
Larry Hackett , managing editor of People , said the McCain campaign offered the magazine an opportunity to photograph McCain and " Nominee TK " at the Aug. 29 event in Dayton .
In addition to a brief Q&A with both Republicans ( as well as their spouses and McCain ’s daughter Meghan ) and an accompanying article that was mostly based on months - old reporting , the magazine also ran a lifestyle feature on Palin ’s life as a working mother running a statehouse and her own house .
People has a long history of reporting on the personal side of candidates and their families , but Hackett acknowledges that " we have a different job " than overtly political titles .
" Are we going to ask about Pakistan ? "
Hackett said rhetorically , adding that it 's not a focus for their readers .
That said , journalists are pushing hard to ask Palin about Pakistan — and Iraq , Iran , Russia , North Korea and Al Qaeda , not to mention a host of domestic issues , from the economy to health care .
Jay Carney , Time 's Washington bureau chief , questioned McCain spokesperson Nicole Wallace about the lack of access on MSNBC's " Morning Joe " last Thursday , resulting in a heated exchange that quickly got passed around via YouTube .
" We know now that Sarah Palin can give one hell of a speech , " Carney said .
" She 's a natural .
And that 's no mean feat .
We do n't know yet and we wo n't know until you guys allow her to take questions , you know , can she answer tough questions about domestic policy , foreign policy ? "
" But I mean , like from who ? ”
Wallace asked .
" From you ? ”
When Carney answered " Yes , " Wallace followed up with , " Who cares ?
" I think the American people want to see her , " Wallace continued .
" Who cares if she can talk to Time magazine ? "
Later that day , Carney — who last week had a much - buzzed about interview with McCain in which the candidate became testy , and refused to answer some questions — told Politico that the McCain campaign is acting " condescending and smug " toward the press .
" The national media , " he added , " will be kept far away " from Palin .
They may be at once close and far away .
Top newspaper reporters will be on the trail with her day after day , including The Washington Post 's Juliet Eilperin .
The New York Times will have a rotating cast , beginning with Monica Davey .
And each network will have an off - air producer , or embed , devoted to the Palin beat : Matt Berger ( NBC / National Journal ) , Shushannah Walshe ( Fox ) , Imtiyaz Delawala ( ABC ) , Scott Conroy ( CBS ) , and Peter Hamby ( CNN ) .
The bigger - name , on - air correspondents will also be on the road with Palin from time to time .
Sam Feist , CNN 's political director , said that since Palin has had to focus on regional issues as Alaska 's governor , he expects she 'll begin with media avails on the road and only offer wide - ranging interviews after getting thoroughly prepared for them by the campaign .
However , he said , " if a presidential candidate or a vice presidential candidate declines to do interviews , the news organizations will note that . "
Even when Palin does begin taking interviews , it remains to be seen if she ’ll grant them to outlets with which the campaign has had a hostile relationship — most notably the New York Times .
" There 's no question that we 've had less and less access to McCain himself , " said Richard Stevenson , the paper 's political editor .
" Certainly the Times has had a strained relationship with that campaign for a while . "
" Strained " might be putting it mildly .
Since February , when the McCain campaign talked about going to war with the paper over a front - page article that included allegations of an improper relationship with a female lobbyist , there have been several public disputes .
This past Tuesday , a McCain spokesperson described Elisabeth Bumiller , one the reporters on the McCain beat , as a " fiction " writer .
" I know whether or not they cooperate with us , we will be very actively looking into who [ Palin ] is , what she 's done , what her record is — as much as we can learn about her in as concentrated a time as we can , " Stevenson said .
" One of the costs to them of not putting her out there , " he added , " is the coverage is going to define her as much as the campaign . "

John McCain railed against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the campaign trail today , saying that the CEOs that led the lenders to ruin “ deserve nothing ” and should have to pay back their severance packages .
In an Wall Street Journal op - ed co-bylined by his vice presidential pick , Sarah Palin , McCain suggested bold reforms for Fannie and Freddie that would “ terminate future lobbying , which was one of the primary contributors to this great debacle . ”
If that ’s the case , McCain should look first to his campaign staffers as the cause of that debacle .
One of them was Fannie Mae ’s head of lobbying , and spread tens of millions of dollars around Washington in the form of lobbying contracts .
A number of McCain staffers were on the receiving end of those contracts , collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars each from the lenders to rep their interests .
And McCain ’s campaign manager served as president of a lobbying association that fought to protect Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae from the sort of regulation that McCain is now proposing .
In McCain ’s op - ed in the Journal , he and Palin wrote :
For years , Congress failed to act and it is deeply troubling that what we are seeing is an exercise in crisis management rather than sound planning , and at great cost to taxpayers .
We promise the American people that our administration will be different .
We have long records of standing up to special interests …
But McCain ’s own campaign staffers are those special interests , a fact that casts doubt on both McCain ’s hiring judgment and his ability to pursue tough reforms of Fannie and Freddie .
Aquiles Suarez , listed as an economic adviser to the McCain campaign in a July 2007 McCain press release , was formerly the director of government and industry relations for Fannie Mae .
The Senate Lobbying Database says Suarez oversaw the lending giant ’s $ 47,510,000 lobbying campaign from 2003 to 2006 .
And other current McCain campaign staffers were the lobbyists receiving shares of that money .
According to the Senate Lobbying Database , the lobbying firm of Charlie Black , one of McCain ’s top aides , made at least $ 820,000 working for Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2004 .
The McCain campaign ’s vice - chair Wayne Berman and its congressional liaison John Green made $ 1.14 million working on behalf of Fannie Mae for lobbying firm Ogilvy Government Relations .
Green made an additional $ 180,000 from Freddie Mac. Arther B. Culvahouse Jr. , the VP vetter who helped John McCain select Sarah Palin , earned $ 80,000 from Fannie Mae in 2003 and 2004 , while working for lobbying and law firm O’Melveny & Myers LLP .
In addition , Politico reports that at least 20 McCain fundraisers have lobbied for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , pocketing at least $ 12.3 million over the last nine years .
For years McCain campaign manager Rick Davis was head of the Homeownership Alliance , a lobbying association that included Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , real estate agents , homebuilders , and non-profits .
According to Politico , the organization opposed congressional attempts at regulation of Fannie and Freddie , along the lines of what John McCain is currently proposing .
In his capacity of president of the group , Davis went on record in 2003 and insisted that no further reform of the lenders was necessary , in contradiction to his current boss ’s sentiments .
“ [ Fannie and Freddie ] are subject to an innovative and stringent risk - based capital stress test , ” Davis wrote .
“ The toughest in the financial services industry . ”
At a campaign rally Wednesday morning in Fairfax , Virginia , John McCain said that the heads of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ought to give back the millions of dollars they ’ve earned .
What about the lobbyists who helped Fannie and Freddie game the system ?
Maybe McCain can ask them — at the next campaign strategy meeting .

WASHINGTON — President George W. Bush paid tribute to the Celtics ’ 17th NBA championship team during a 15 - minute ceremony this afternoon at the White House .
“ So , ‘ Celtic Pride ’ is back , ” Bush said , speaking before a crowd of about 250 in the East Room .
“ Welcome to the Boston Celtics team that has brought great pride to Boston . ”
Most of the Celtics team participated in a tour of the White House and in the presentation .
Sam Cassell , Eddie House , and James Posey ( now with New Orleans ) were missing because of personal reasons , according to director of media relations Jeff Twiss .
Bush joked he had n’t seen so many Celtic fans in the area “ since St. Patrick ’s Day . ”

The president said he got caught up in the spirit of unity that helped carry the franchise to the championship .
“ I appreciate very much the use of the word ‘ Ubuntu , ' ” Bush said during his often humorous speech .
“ I do n’t know if you know what that ’s talking about here .
Probably most people outside of Boston do n’t .
It is an African word for unity that the [ Celtics ] declared when they broke from the huddle .
I ’ve been looking forward to saying that with a Texas accent :
“ U - bun -tu . . . yeah , ” Bush said to laughter and applause .
Bush said he had particular respect for the turnaround the Celtics made from the previous season , when they had the second - worst record in the NBA .
“ It ’s amazing how sports works , is n’t it ? ” Bush said .
“ At the beginning of the season , few would have predicted how it would have ended . . .
The two - decade championship drought was pretty likely to continue .
At least that ’s what the experts said .
There ’s a lot of experts in life these days .
You probably had n’t noticed . ”
He noted that Celtics ownership , along with general manager Danny Ainge , did an outstanding job constructing the roster , particularly by acquiring longtime stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen , though he joked about their veteran status .

“ In the offseason , [ Ainge ] figured out the need to bring in some new blood — or maybe some old new blood . ”
Turning to Garnett behind him , Bush said with a laugh : “ Well , old - er new blood .
Bush offered particularly high praise for Celtics captain Paul Pierce , who played through a knee injury in the Finals .
“ Leadership comes in all different ways , ” Bush said .
“ Playing hurt in a championship game is an ultimate sign of leadership .
He won the MVP for the league finals , and that ’s why the league calls him ‘ The Truth . ’
That ’s why this team calls him the captain . ”
Pierce presented Bush with an autographed basketball and jersey with the No. 43 , signifying Bush as the 43d president .
Bush also acknowledged Celtic coach Doc Rivers .
“ I know [ Doc ] somewhat , he ’s a good man , ” Bush said .
“ He brought character to the clubhouse , unity to team , and a championship to Boston . ”
After the ceremony , Rivers said he introduced himself to Bush while playing a game in San Antonio in the ’90s .
“ I had contact with him , but I did n’t know he would remember me , ” Rivers said of Bush .
“ When I was with the Spurs , he was in front row – he was the governor of Texas — and I introduced myself and shook his hand .
At the time it was a good experience for me . ”
Asked about his political preferences , Rivers replied : “ When you meet the president you meet president .
You are not a Democrat or Republican when you come into this building , and that ’s the way it should be . ”

Bush noted that not only did the Celtics - Lakers Finals matchup revive a famous rivalry , but it ended up being one more memorable moment in a decade full of them for Boston sports fans .
“ For baby - boomers like me , [ Celtics - Lakers ] was the reminder of a great basketball rivalry .
Boston fans were screaming , ‘ Beat LA , ’ at the top of their lungs , and that ’s exactly what they did in six hard - fought games .
If you ’re a basketball fan or a sports fan , that was really awesome to watch , was n’t it ?
If you ’re a Boston Red Sox fan it was doubly awesome to watch .
If you ’re a Boston Celtics fan , man , you ’re in heaven ! ”
Perhaps the president ’s best line of the day was his final one :
“ I wish you well for the very next season , ” he said .
“ Should you win it , you can find me in Texas . ”

About the author
( NewsTarget ) According to a report by the Organic Consumers Association , a toxic chemical that is a byproduct of rocket fuel is rapidly poisoning the food and water supply in the United States .
Known as perchlorate , this chemical has been found in 93 % of the nation 's milk and lettuce supply in a recent FDA study .
It has also been found in the drinking water for at least 22 states at extremely alarming levels .
Perhaps the scariest statistic is that perchlorate has been found in the breast milk of 97 % of the mothers who were tested .
Unfortunately , lettuce and milk were n't the only foods that were found to be contaminated .
Perchlorate was found in tomatoes , carrots , cucumbers , spinach , citrus , melons and more .
Sadly , even organic vegetables were affected , because most crops are irrigated from polluted water sources .
In a article by Amit Asaravala , Bill Walker , the vice president of the Environmental Working Group 's West Coast operations , was quoted as saying , " The study confirms what we and some other people have been saying for a while -- that perchlorate is not only a problem in areas with known water contamination but for anyone who eats food grown in the U.S. " report by the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) warns that ingesting lettuce or any other vegetable that is grown anywhere irrigated by the Colorado River would result in an exposure to an unsafe level of perchlorate per standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Farms that use this water for irrigation are responsible for growing almost all of the lettuce sold in the United States during the winter months .
The EWG also reports that if a pregnant woman were to eat an ordinary serving of vegetables with the contamination levels that were found at , a San Bernardino grower of lettuce and other vegetables , she would get a dose of rocket fuel over 100 times greater than what the EPA would consider " safe " for a liter of drinking water .
Wow !
Health - conscious consumers who eat a plant - based diet consisting of lots of dark , leafy greens , fruits and vegetables could actually be harming their health by consuming toxic levels of perchlorate .
According to a website by Laura Power , MS , PhD , LDN , perchlorate is a toxin that interferes with thyroid function by supplanting iodine in the body , causing harm to iodine transporters .
This can be responsible for numerous health problems , notes Dr. Power , including " hypothyroidism , thyroid cancer , goiter , breast disease , disruption of the menstrual cycle , immune system dysfunction , poor fetal development , and mental retardation of newborns . "
A book by Mary J. Shomon , , reports that in areas with the greatest amount of perchlorate contamination , rates of congenital hypothyroidism are much higher than normal which means that pregnant mothers need to be particularly concerned about this .
To illustrate the severity of the problem , a CDC study demonstrated that in the 36 % of women in the U.S. with low iodine intake , just about any exposure to perchlorate at all was associated with a substantial change in levels of thyroid hormone .
That 's over one in three women .
Moreover , the Organic Consumers Association reports that for every one out of ten of these women , if they were exposed to as little as 5 ppb of perchlorate in drinking water , the subsequent hormone disruption would require treatment during pregnancy for sub-clinical hypothyroidism .
If a woman is overly fatigued , depressed or overweight , she may be suffering from hypothyroidism caused by perchlorate contamination .
According to Dr. Power , there are many other symptoms of hypothyroidism such as brittle nails , poor memory , constipation , menstrual irregularities , high cholesterol , poor concentration , irritability , dry skin , dry hair , hair loss and more .
Imagine how frustrating it might be for a woman who is drinking lots of water and eating lots of healthy salads but is n't making any progress losing weight due to thyroid disease caused by perchlorate ingestion .
Clearly , anyone who has the above symptoms should consult a qualified health care provider immediately .
One thing everyone can do is to check their water supplies .
A map provided by the EPA shows the location of all of the perchlorate releases as of April 2003 .
The Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) also provides a table of where top soil or ground water is contaminated by perchlorate and a table that shows sites of known perchlorate use in 36 states .
As previously noted , many who live near the Colorado River are affected ( about 20 million people ) .
Those who live in areas that have been contaminated should definitely install a water filter capable of removing perchlorate , probably some type of reverse osmosis filter .
These filters wo n't remove all of the perchlorate , but it is best to reduce the amount of perchlorate to the extent possible .
Reverse osmosis filters wo n't remove things like radon from the water and are probably best combined with a carbon filter .
Needless to say , those with children attending schools that use water contaminated with perchlorate should take action to demand that the schools install proper filters , too , as drinking perchlorate - contaminated water could cause developmental delays in children , according to Dr. Power .
Unfortunately , there is no way to remove perchlorate from contaminated vegetables , and buying organic produce does n't help when it comes to perchlorate .
One can try to purchase vegetables that are n't grown in areas that use contaminated water to irrigate crops , but this probably wo n't be possible for the majority of people .
Obviously , people can't stop eating .
However , it is absolutely essential to ensure that one 's diet has a sufficient amount of iodine to attempt to compensate for any perchlorate ingestion .
Some people may wish to supplement with kelp or eat more sea vegetables , but it is best to discuss the proper dosage of any supplements with a qualified healthcare provider .
Finally , one more thing that can be done is to write to lawmakers and demand that the people who are polluting the environment with perchlorate clean it up now .
A number of people in some communities in California that have water that has been poisoned by perchlorate are being charged 15 % surcharges to clean up the mess made by polluters , reports .
This is so wrong .
According to Senator Feinstein from California , " Nearly all perchlorate has been produced by the Department of Defense and its contractors and in the country 's space programs . "
Maybe everyone should write to NASA and The Department of Defense and complain , too .
The EPA has not established a maximum legal limit in tap water for perchlorate , according to a database maintained by the EWG .
This is outrageous - there are millions of people in the United States drinking water that has been contaminated with this toxin .
Since perchlorate is currently unregulated in tap water , there are no violations recorded in the EPA 's violations database , ironically labeled the " Safe Drinking Water Information System . "
Meanwhile , under the current federal tap water law , any level of perchlorate is legal !
That 's right .
Water suppliers are not even required to test for perchlorate .
Given the health implications of perchlorate ingestion , the stupidity of this kind of lack of regulation is just incredible .
Write to the EPA , and let them know that this lack of regulation is just insanity .
When people have to be concerned with drinking a glass of water or eating a salad , there is a problem .
The FDA reports that the inhibition of iodine uptake by perchlorate is a " precursor that can lead to hypothyroidism , " and pregnant women and their fetuses are " the most sensitive populations to the health effects of perchlorate . "
How bad will the situation have to get before environmental regulators will no longer be able to ignore the mass poisoning of the nation 's food and water supply Mailing address :

Interesting analysis by a tax attorney over at Huffington Post .
Gambling has tax implications .
According to IRS Publication 17 , “ Your Federal Income Tax ” , 2007 edition , page 89 “ Gambling Winnings .
You must include your gambling winnings in income on Form 1040 , line 21 .
If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A ( Form 1040 ) , you can deduct gambling losses you had during the year , but only up to the amount of your winnings . ”
In other words , you ca n’t subtract your losses from your winnings and just not report .
You have to report the winnings , and then claim the losses .
But McCain ’s tax returns say nothing about gambling winnings or losses .
As a casino gambler , McCain is likely to have lost more than he won .
But by not reporting his winnings , the different percentage calculations built into the tax calculation are thrown off , and if he gambled much at all , he has underpaid his tax .
The amount of understatement of tax may be minimal , but that ’s not the point .
The real purpose of preparing his tax return and omitting the gambling winnings is so that people would not know how much he gambled .
If he won $ 200,000 playing craps in Las Vegas , it would make a difference in the way voters viewed his suitability as a presidential candidate … .
I think we are looking at tax returns calculated to hide an aspect of the candidate .
My 35 years of experience in taxes tells me these tax returns are wrong , and we do not know the true scope of McCain ’s gambling or of his potential obligations to gambling enterprises .
A few of my friends from college and I have developed a taste for Renaissance faires .
Admittedly , the joy we derive from these faires is of the sour and ironic sort ; there ’s something tragic about the spectacle of three ageing pseudo - hipsters laughing up their sleeves at a pack of tubby guys flailing at one another with PVC swords .
It ’s as if God lost a bet with the devil about the essential goodness of human nature .
And how the soul of humanity shines through the renaissance faire !
Last weekend the weather was cool and sunny and the Lakewood , NJ Lion ’s Club had gathered a mighty host at Pine Park .
Pavilions dotted the greensward ; knights had assembled with their chargers and stout burghers had erected a surprising number of portable toilets .
The townsfolk prepared festive foods under grimy tarps .
We sampled the fried Oreos — they were chalky and took an unreasonably long time to prepare .
My friend Diana suggested that this was because the food tents used authentic , pre-Taylorism work systems .
Behind the counter a sad - eyed teenager dipped a pitcher into plastic tub filled with batter .
He apologized tersely when Diana asked for lemonade .
“ We do n’t have any cups , ” he explained .
This was early afternoon .
Our time in the line afforded us an ethnographic glimpse into the other fairegoers .
Behind us a local couple argued over souvenirs .
A combination of boredom and thrift drove the woman ( who was young and overripe as a nectarine left in a locked automobile ) to buy a peacock feather .
“ What the fuck is this ? ” her boyfriend asked .
“ It was the only thing I could afford , ” she rejoined .
Her boyfriend argued passionately that the vendors had rooked her ; he felt that the feather contained insufficient ancillary plumage and that the central shaft was “ not even thick . ”
While we waited for our Oreos the young woman returned and exchanged the feather no less than three times .
Eventually the arrival of a silent man wearing a rubber dragon skull helmet distracted them .
The faire offered intentional entertainments in addition .
We walked down a small hill to watch the archers at their targets ; up the hill a young man ran free , indulging both his several facial tics and a loose - jointed gait seen only in those who bear no financial responsibilities .
At the archers ’ course , uniformed marksmen struck rubber rats from ten paces .
A dreadlocked 14 - year - old hurled ash spears with an atl - atl .
I remarked that the atl - atl predated the medieval era by as many as 30,000 years — in the shadow of this nerdy correction I felt that I deserved at least hanging .
Clouds passed over the sun ; two girls photographed one another in their Hot Topic dresses .
Someone fired a cannon and everyone jumped in unison .
Across from the archers harquebusiers drilled with their heavy , smoking guns .
Uniformed police , brawny and tall , strode past .
The guns blew huge and perfect smoke rings .
We sat on the grass , toying with a colossal funnel cake .
At other Ren-faires I have sampled enormous pickles sold from plastic chests cunningly concealed in oak barrels .
I have seen , though never eaten , club - like turkey legs whose grease and bulk hark back to some fire - lit hunting lodge of the imagination .
The Lakewood faire preferred the ostensibly modern delights of thick breading dusted with sugar ; but what is more medieval than enjoying a grotesque meal while watching the jiggling back fat of an ersatz gypsy dancer ?
As we ate a young , sinewy man strolled by ; he wore a saber at his waist and was dressed all in brown .
He carried a ragged cardboard sign that said “ I bet you $ 5 I can light your cigarette without a lighter or matches . ”
A woman asked him “ are you the court jester ? ”
She leaned on a stroller in which her child slept .
The man replied , “ Madam , I am a wandering warrior .
I would never intrude on the court jester ’s territory . ”
His spiel , we had seen earlier , relied on a plastic magnifying glass .
The harquebusiers cleaned and stored their guns and departed the field ; a melee began , by turns , in their place .
Two hefty men dressed as samurai struck one another with wooden swords and , in one case , a cane .
An enormous skinhead in yellow and black check swung a rubber - padded sledgehammer .
Periodically men would seize in place and then fall , miming death .
No screams or gouts of blood , no ringing of metal on metal .
One of the fighters was handsome and tall , square - jawed like a man in a US Marines recruiting poster ; he walked arm in arm with a black - haired siren .
“ Some of these Ren-people are pretty hot , ” my friend Kean commented .
We were surprised .
At 4:30 we walked through a deserted tennis court to the jousting lists .
The aluminum bleachers were filled with families facing the field , where a whip - thin woman with stringy blond hair carried bundles of lances to and fro .
We sat near a booth that rented bows and arrows for target shooting ; at any moment we could have been pierced like Saint Sebastian , and it would have been a mercy .
The jousting MC , a portly man in plate mail riding an embarrassed - looking Percheron , spent forty - five minutes warming the crowd up .
I do not exaggerate .
He relied on nerd humor of the sort enjoyed by people who answer “ or ” questions with “ yes . ”
This he spiced with casually delivered slurs against gays ( “ This is n’t ‘ Bareback [ sic ] Jousting ’ ! ” he crowed after claiming that the opposing champions enjoyed long walks on the beach with one another ) and skin- crawling , embarrassing invitations for audience participation .
These mostly consisted of him ordering underage girls to gyrate for the audience ; he was unrelenting and humorless .
Possibly these qualities would have worked had he been a general , but they are little valued in comedians .
We stood with the sun in our eyes as the knight clutched his microphone and turned his steed back and forth before the audience .
He brought the champions out ; one was bald , one pony - tailed .
One suffered silently under the MC ’s inane banter , the other participated with the glee of an invert who has found himself through happenstance at the center of attention .
“ Hey guys , ” Diana said , “ Let ’s ditch this and go to DSW shoe warehouse . ”
And lo , we did .
Sony on Monday unveiled a new combination of TV - like content and video - game features that may give its PlayStation 3 console a stronger foothold among the many devices competing to provide digital entertainment for TV screens .
Starting Thursday , Sony ’s online PlayStation Network will sell monthly episodes of a new high - definition show called “ Qore , ” a combination of traditionally viewed programming and game - related options .
Consumers who use the PS3 ’s broadband connection to download “ Qore ” will be able to go back and forth between watching original material , such as interviews with game developers , or using game demos and other features that are interactive in some way , such as zooming in visually on examples of concept art .
“ Qore ” is based on appealing to the natural PS3 audience of gamers .
But it also could represent another step toward delivering a much wider range of video and Web - linked entertainment that would allow Sony to compete with cable , satellite and Internet companies for the time families spend in front of one screen or another .
“ The idea is to have another magnet to keep eyes glued , ” said Richard Doherty , director of the Envisioneering Group , a consumer electronics consulting firm .
Doherty said research shows slightly more high - definition screens connected to PS3s than Microsoft ’s Xbox 360s , opening the door for Sony to court a market of videophiles .
A spokeswoman for the Xbox Live online network had no immediate comment on Sony ’s “ Qore ” announcement .
The monthly “ Qore ” episodes , which include some short commercials , will sell for $ 2.99 apiece or $ 24.99 for a 13 - episode subscription plus the PlayStation Network game “ Calling All Cars . ”
During World War II , soldiers crouching in foxholes penned letters assuring their sweethearts that they ’d be home soon .
Now , between firefights in the Iraqi desert , some infantrymen have been sending a different kind of mail stateside : two or three hundred dollars — or whatever they can spare — towards a presidential election that could very well determine just how soon they come home .
According to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , Democrat Barack Obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has Republican John McCain , and the fiercely anti-war Ron Paul , though he suspended his campaign for the Republican nomination months ago , has received more than four times McCain ’s haul .
Despite McCain ’s status as a decorated veteran and a historically Republican bent among the military , members of the armed services overall — whether stationed overseas or at home — are also favoring Obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 , by a $ 55,000 margin .
Although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to Republicans this cycle , of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees , 57 percent has gone to Obama .
Contributions from U.S. Troops Deployed Abroad Recipient Total Number Obama , Barack $ 60,642 134 Paul , Ron $ 45,512 99 McCain , John $ 10,665 26 Huckabee , Mike $ 7,950 10 Thompson , Fred $ 6,350 7 Romney , Mitt $ 5,550 10 Clinton , Hillary $ 3,240 6
With the latest campaign finance filings , detailing June fundraising , McCain has overtaken Paul among all military donors , though Paul still leads with contributors listing an overseas address .
Financial support from military personnel for anti-war candidates Obama and Paul is a trend that the Center for Responsive Politics first observed last September .
Individuals in the Air Force , Army , Navy and Marine Corps have all leaned Republican this cycle , but the only branch in which that ideology has carried over to the presidential race is the Marine Corps , where McCain leads Obama by about $ 4,000 .
In each of the other branches — including the Navy , in which McCain served when he was taken prisoner during the Vietnam War — Obama leads by significant margins .
“ That ’s shocking .
The academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly Republican and some who say it ’s about equal , but no one would point to six - to - one ” in Democrats ’ favor , said Aaron Belkin , a professor of political science at the University of California who studies the military .
“ That represents a tremendous shift from 2000 , when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in Florida and elsewhere , and leaned heavily towards the Republicans . ”
In 2000 , Republican George W. Bush outraised Democrat Al Gore among military personnel almost 2 to 1 .
In 2004 , with the Iraq war underway , John Kerry closed the gap with President Bush , but Bush still raised $ 1.50 from the military for every $ 1 his Democratic opponent collected .
A former West Point professor , Jason Dempsey , noted that the small set of contributions from deployed troops at this point in 2008 — just 323 donations — should not be extrapolated to form conclusions about military personnel overall .
“ If , on a bad day , a guy gets that letter that says [ his tour has been extended ] from 12 to 15 months , that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger , ” he said .
“ Donating helps members of the military express their political views privately . ”
Seeing political activity of any sort among soldiers is notable , Dempsey added .
“ It ’s hard to describe how apolitical a lot of the enlisted ranks are .
He ’s worried about other things than following the news . ”
Obama , who opposed the war in Iraq but was not in the Senate when it was authorized , has said that as president , he would withdraw most troops from Iraq within about 16 months .
McCain , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a staunch proponent of the Iraq war , has resisted setting a timeline for withdrawal .
CRP ’s totals based on employer are limited to donors contributing more than $ 200 , since information is not provided to the Federal Election Commission for smaller contributions .
So these figures are likely to disproportionately represent the mood of officers , who have more disposable income to spend on politics than do the lower ranks .
But because young people tend to be more liberal than their elders , the total dollar figures could lean even more in Obama ’s favor .
“ One possibly mundane explanation ( for the tilt in contributions from deployed soldiers ) is that the Obama campaign has just been so much savvier with web - based donors .
It may be a logistical question , ” Belkin pointed out .
Army Specialist Jay Navas contributed $ 250 while deployed in Iraq , but it was n’t over the Internet .
“ It took some effort to get that check .
I had my mom send me my checkbook and I walked to the post office in Camp Liberty in Baghdad with an envelope addressed to Barack Obama in Chicago , Illinois , ” he said .
“ He was right on Iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings , and that ’s hard to do .
We ’re soldiers and we respect courage . ”
Only the Coast Guard prefers Democrats across the board , with 78 percent of employees ’ total federal contributions going to members of that party , and Obama beating McCain $ 7,795 to $ 250 .
Navas anecdotally confirmed that soldiers are often conservative but that many are making an exception in the presidential race .
“ Most of my friends are conservative Republicans and they say , ‘ I ’m voting for Barack . ’
McCain does not have a lock on the military vote , that ’s for sure , ” he said .
“ We ’ll complete our duty — I ’m deploying next year — because it ’s a commitment I made to the nation , not to a president .
But we all know that Iraq was a big mistake . ”
The decisions of the U.S. government affect Navas more than most Americans , he said .
“ What happens politically in America affects us immediately , ” he said .
“ As soon as the surge was ordered , my tour was extended , just by a pronouncement from the president .
For very few Americans can the president say something and your lives are changed . ”
Contributions from All Military Personnel Recipient Total Number Obama , Barack $ 335,536 859 McCain , John $ 280,513 558 Paul , Ron $ 232,411 537 Clinton , Hillary $ 167,050 376 Republican National Cmte $ 135,902 219 Huckabee , Mike $ 66,751 127 Thompson , Fred $ 46,400 93 Romney , Mitt $ 43,307 96 Giuliani , Rudolph W $ 22,050 47 National Republican Senatorial Cmte $ 21,885 26 DNC Services Corp $ 16,873 53

Here ’s the deal : I ’m going to blog this Islamabad blast every day for a while , try to talk honestly about how to sift through the crap to try to figure out what ’s really going on .
It should be a good case study , because there are all sorts of rumors flying around , and I ’ve already learned some surprising stuff , found out I was wrong in the guesses I made from the first reports .
Of course , if you ’re really slow anything ’s a surprise .
There was a headline today , “ Al Qaeda suspected in Islamabad Blast . ”
No , ya think ?
Sure it was n’t the Basques ?
Maybe the Corsican Liberation Front ?
What surprised me was the news , in reports coming out today , that the suicide truck was n’t loaded with fertilizer - based explosive but high - quality commercial explosive .
Since that ’s more effective , you need less of it .
Latest reports are saying it was about a half - ton of commercial explosive , not a whole ton of fertilizer .
Which raises all kinds of questions .
Like why bother ?
If a ton of fertilizer with a small core detonator charge of high - grade stuff wired to a blasting cap or two will do the job , why waste high - grade explosive ?
At this point I do n’t have any smart answers to this kind of question .
This is when you ’re asking the questions , and the key is being willing to see what DOESN ’T make sense .
That ’s the first mistake wannabe war nerds always make , assuming that the story they get in the press makes sense .
A lot of times the key is seeing what ’s wrong with this picture , not making sense of it too soon .
Lots of possible reasons to use high - grade explosive , like space .
More powerful explosive means you can pack it in a smaller vehicle .
I ’ve been watching the closed - circuit TV pictures of the blast ( video 1 , video 2 ) to get an idea of the truck they used but so far I ca n’t really tell what size it was , or whether that matters .
Then there ’s the matter of supply and demand : if you ’ve got an endless supply of high - grade explosive you do n’t need to bother with the smell and bulk of fertilizer .
Maybe they thought the dogs at the hotel gate were sniffing for fertilizer , not commercial explosive .
And here ’s another point where I start with the fact I do n’t know key info , in this case : do these dogs sniff for a wide range of explosives or just one kind , like ammonium nitrate or dynamite ?
Anybody know ?
Al Q may not have to worry about supply in this case because they ’re very strong in Pakistan — I mean duh , when the CIA can’t find Osama in seven years of trying , even though they know he ’s somewhere in Pakistan , you have to figure the Jihadis are pretty strong there .
Pakistan is actually safer now for Al Q than Afghanistan .
That ’s why there ’s all that noise in the press about US troops charging over into Pakistan from Afghanistan : because Pakistan is the safe zone now for Taleban / Al Qaeda troops fleeing ISAF / NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Waziristan is like Cambodia was for the NVA , a big R&R depot where they keep their supplies and hospitals .
With actual control of territory , like they ’ve got in parts of Pakistan , they can stockpile materiel , including all kinds of explosives , which — to get back to the Islamabad blast story — means they may not have to bother with fertilizer at all .
They sure spent a whole lot of high - quality stuff on this blast , which you can tell from that crater they left in front of the hotel .
Anybody need a well dug ?
Osama ’s cratering service , excavation while U inspect our truck , results guaranteed .
All kinds of calculations go into a truck blast operation like this .
One of the biggest is making a coldblooded honest guess about how close you ’re going to be to the target when you detonate .
The ideal is to be inside the building , because almost all the energy of a blast goes straight up .
It still hurts me even to mention this , but the most effective suicide truck blast was the one that killed 241 of our Marines in Beirut , where some idiot had housed them in a high - rise apartment building .
The Shiites drove a truck literally into that building , stopped and detonated , and the whole thing came down .
That was long ago though , before anybody was truck - bomb savvy .
People have had their consciousness razed , if you ’ll pardon the pun , so it ’s not likely your truck will get that close .
You ca n’t assume the truck will make it right up to the loading zone of the hotel ; you have to size the bomb by how far away you think you ’ll be when you ’re stopped .
Maybe the bomb designer this time assumed the truck would n’t get any further than the gate where the dogs started barking .
( By the way , anybody found any pieces of dog in their yards , in places like Delhi or Ankara ?
If so , keep that scrap of dog meat , it ’ll be worth something to souvenir hunters because it probably flew there from Islamabad . )
The crater is maybe 20 yards in front of the hotel but when Al Q cased the hotel they may have noticed that there ’s nothing between the gate and the front of the hotel , and it ’s a very simple design , all frontage , five stories of rooms almost leaning out into the parking lot .
That ’s a bomber ’s dream , because even if the truck is stopped far from the hotel , the blast will travel up and out , right into those balconies .
Which it did .
Another question I ’m wondering about now is how they detonated it .
You can see from the closed - circuit video that the truck flared up — did n’t blow up but just burned hot — for what seems like a Hell of a long time before it blew .
That should n’t happen .
Very weird .
The classic suicide - truck design has a driver and a passenger , with the passenger holding a deadman switch that detonates the bomb when he stops pressing on it .
That way , even if both men are shot , the dead guy ’s fingers relax and it goes off .
And when it does , there should be a small blast from the detonator followed in a nanosecond by the big blast .
There should n’t be a car fire in the parking lot , which is what this looked like .
You can even see hotel workers standing around giving helpful advice like idiots watching a car fire in Fresno : “ You got an extinguisher ? ” “ That happened to me once ! ” “ You insured ? ”
I ’m watching the video waiting and wincing for the thing to go off and I ’m amazed by the stupidity of these guys .
One of them even walks up with a little handheld fire extinquisher and starts spraying this truck , which is packed with high explosive .
I mean , the driver was probably kissing his Quran and bobbing up and down like Stevie Wonder , sobbing , “ Bye bye Mom !
See ya sis !
I ’ll miss you , Dad ! ” or maybe a Redd Foxx number about Paradise , “ I ’m a - comin ’ to jine ya , 76 virgins ! ” – and this helpful citizen type thinks it ’s a good idea to approach the vehicle with a WalMart extinguisher in his hand .
And keep in mind , this is Islamabad , a place where every backfire says “ Allah at work ! ”
There are some brave , dumb people out there .
Me , I ’d be trying to see how fast a fat man can run the Islamabad - to - Anywhere marathon the second I saw that truck burning .
Then there ’s the issue of why they hit the Marriott .
I do n’t mean because Hilton ’s classier , I mean why hit a hotel , when the Prime Minister was having a big dinner up the road on the same night ?
In my first dispatch I mentioned that I ’d read reports saying it was because security was too tight at the PM ’s house , so Al Q looked off like a good NFL QB , found the secondary receiver , so to speak , and threw there .
It ’s possible .
I mean , it ’s not as easy to do this terrorism thing as people think , and you ca n’t just drive one of these trucks back to the garage to wait for another day .
They ’re primed to go , and nobody really likes the idea of leaving one of them in storage for very long .
Besides , the suicide driver ’s primed too , got himself all worked up ready to go see Allah , and you ca n’t really tell a Kamikaze to return to base and have a good sleep , we ’ll try next week .
He ’s probably got a big head of steam up , so you have to have a second target if the first one ’s blocked .
So it may have been that ; I do n’t know yet .
But today another theory came up : there were apparently two dozen CIA brass staying at the Marriott that night , and maybe Al Q decided they were worth the effort .
Me , I ’d leave them alone the way the VC left incompentent or corrupt ARVN officers and officials alone : better to have those idiots on the job than kill them and risk getting smart replacements .
I have a lot of moles in US forces and bases around the world and they all say pretty much the same thing : “ Gary , I stopped believing in the CIA long , long ago . ”
The buzz is that the SEALs are for real , they actually do stuff , but the CIA is a joke .
I remember reading a book about the glorious activities of the Agency way back when , and their example of CIA skullduggery was an agent posing as an aircraft worker in Yemen to steal the piss - bag from a Russian airliner a Kremlin bigwig was riding in .
According to the book , by processing this secret piss , they discovered one of Brezhnev ’s cronies had diabetes .
Well , that ’s the CIA in a nutshell , sniffing an ugly old bureaucrat ’s stale pee and calling it top - secret national security work .
Their main job is keeping the Langley real estate market high and making sure every sleaze in the third world has money for another villa in France .
That ’s about it .
So why waste a good kamikaze and all that “ high quality ” HE on them ?
Maybe it ’s just that they were there .
Not too many Americans visiting Islamabad this time of year , it ’s been the low season there , tourist - wise , ever since they burned down the US embassy and stomped every Westerner they could find because a Saudi nutjob and his followers stormed Mecca in 1979 .
If you ’re asking , “ What did the Americans have to do with that ? ” the answer is not a damn thing , but that ’s the thing about Islamabad mobs : they tend to take it out on the same targets every time .
Creatures of habit .
So maybe they just saw red , like Islamic bulls , when they heard the CIA was in town , did n’t stop to think whether that target ’s really worth hitting .
Like I said , I do n’t know yet .
The main thing I want to say in this entry is how important it is NOT to be sure of anything at this point and not to believe what you read .
It ’s all up for grabs now : why did the truck burn ?
Why hit the Marriott ?
And biggest of all : how deeply was the Pakistani Intelligence Service , the ISI , involved ?
These are very scary guys , they ’re the only part of the country that really works well , like way too well , and it ’s pretty much a sure thing that some of them at least knew this was coming .
I ’m stressing “ at least . ”
They may have done a lot more than just know .
We ’re gonna find out , and I ’m gonna stay with it , getting stuff wrong and trying to tell you the truth , take you with me to figure this out .
Over the past few hundred years , as scientists have grappled with understanding the source of the amazing processing power in our skulls , they have employed a number of metaphors based on familiar technologies of their given era .
The brain has been thought of as a hydraulic machine ( 18th century ) , a mechanical calculator ( 19th century ) and an electronic computer ( 20th century ) .
In the latest attempt to shore up sales of music on physical media , SanDisk Corp . and the four major music companies plan to announce Monday a new format called slotMusic .
SlotMusic is be introduced in mid-October at retail outlets including Wal - Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. Each unit is to contain an album , plus extras , on a compact memory card that can be played on mobile phones , PCs and some portable MP3 players .
The cards are inserted into vacant slots on phones and other devices .
( The slots are increasingly common on newer phones , but the placement of the slot depends on the phone model . )
SanDisk is a maker of flash data storage card products .
People close to the record companies and retailers said they view the effort as an experiment .
The initial batch of releases is to comprise 29 albums , from all four of the big recorded music companies : EMI Group Ltd. , Warner Music Group Corp. Vivendi SA 's Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment , a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG .
The releases are mostly by current pop artists including Rihanna , Ne - Yo , Robin Thicke , New Kids on the Block , Weezer , Usher , Chris Brown , Akon and Leona Lewis .
In a nod to older buyers , Elvis Presley is also represented .
The music is to be sold in the MP3 format , with no digital locks that prevent copying .
An adapter is to be included allowing users to transfer their music to PCs via their USB slots .
The albums are expected to cost about $ 15 and are likely to be stocked by retailers near CDs and portable devices such as MP3 players and mobile phones .
CD sales have been decimated in recent years , as consumers have migrated to digital downloads , whether they pay for them or not .
Earlier this year Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store surpassed Wal - Mart to become the largest music retailer in the world .
The record labels have tried various ways to prop up sales of albums , which are more profitable than the 99 - cent single tracks that make up the vast majority of iTunes sales .
John McCain has asked that this Friday 's first presidential debate be postponed .
He says it needs to be put off in order for him to " focus on the financial crisis , " and he needs that time to fix this mess in his position as a Senator without any authority over any of it .
Wtf .
According to MSNBC , he 's returning to Washington right now to personally solve this bailout thing .
So — " country first , " right ?
No time for debating , because Senator McCain — who is not on the Joint Economic Committee btw ! — is asking Obama to join him in Washington .
Jesus Christ .
We 're thinking this will very quickly come off as a " political stunt , " and also make McCain look like a moron next time he trots out the " I lie about Obama because he would n't debate me 100 times from now until the election " line .
But whatever , maybe it'll play well ?
For a day or two , anyway .
But !
What does Obama do ?
He calls it a cheap political ploy , hopefully , says he wants to debate right away .
It is a sign , probably , that McCain 's debate prep was n't going well .
It 's a naked attempt to look on top of the news cycle and to insert himself into the economic debate , but canceling a debate wo n't instill confidence in anyone , will it ?
It seems desperate and reactive , especially in the face of bad polling for McCain .
He 's painting it as a post - partisan 9/11 thing , of course , and maybe that 'll fly .
Once again , we reiterate : there is nothing McCain can do about this .
This is the stupidest and emptiest of political gestures .
On the plus side , your Friday wo n't be wasted watching the debate !
Update : Stuff we heard on the tv : The University of Mississippi ( they 're hosting the debate ) say the debate is still going on as planned .
Obama 's camp is probably going to announce that they 're going ahead with the debate soon .
I can turn a phrase .
High school journalism is where I discovered this .
Mrs. Wickett kept bringing stories to me in my junior year “ Needs a clever headline . ”
I ’d read the story and throw out a terse , clever headline .
No clue where this ability come from .
If I actually think about how I pick the words and construct the idea , the ability vanishes .
The less I know about it , the better .
I ’ve been riding this talent for years .
Turns out the ability to summarize is n’t only handy for writing headlines ; it ’s useful in meetings , too .
“ He just said that , you think this , let ’s move on and stop saying the same thing over and over again . ”
It was this appreciation of summarization that I took into my first executive product presentation at the last gig .
10th floor of corporate headquarters .
Four VPs and their minions surrounding the table .
My thought :
Wow them with crisp , clean , and clever thoughts .
Alliteration .
Witty .
Headlines .
So I did .
“ This is the product .
Here are the 20 clever phrases to describe it .
Thank you very much ! ”
Silence . 30 seconds of awkward silence followed by the VP of Marketing breaking the tension , “ What exactly are we reviewing here ? ”
The next five minutes were less pleasant as the room realized I was done and all I ’d accomplished was filling the air with clever alliterative phrases .
There was no obvious strategy behind the headlines .
The Russian Lit Major was standing outside my door as I limped back from the beat down “ How ’d that feel ? ”
“ Disaster . ”
“ Yeah , details bore the shit out of you and you suck at talking to executives . ”
“… I what ? ”
I See Bell Curves
You are horrible at something .
You are a bell curve .
A standard distribution .
At one end of the curve , you have your talents .
You ’re naturally and uniquely good at them , but you ’re not quite sure why .
At the other end of the curve , you have your natural deficiencies and , while I am an optimist and I do believe you can learn your way through just about anything , you ’re genetically predisposed to be pretty bad at these things .
Now , chances are you are a horrible at a whole bunch of things , but I want to focus on one thing .
It ’s the thing that will have the most impact on your career .
By being bad at this thing , you limit your career growth .
I ’m going to make a leap and assume that you ’ve already identified your horrible .
At some point in the past , you realized you were bad at this thing .
“ I am unable to read people . ” “ I love to program , but I am a lousy architect . ” “ I dress like a goofball . ”
Whatever your realization was , you become aware that you were deficient relative to the rest of the world , and you took one of two paths .
The first path : you structured your days and your life so that you would n’t stumble over this deficiency .
Bad programmer , but deeply technical ?
Ok , you stuck with QA .
Unable to read people ?
Ok , stick with code , do n’t manage .
Horrible fashion sense ?
Right so , you ’re not first in line for customer visits .
As path of least resistance strategies go , this can work .
You can sit there and hide from the horrible , but my thought is , if you ’re reading this weblog , you chose the other path and you attacked the horrible .
Your thought , “ I refuse to suck at this , ” so you took the other path and forced yourself to learn through the horrible .
Educating yourself in your deficiencies .
Learning .
Researching .
Practicing .
I ’m a fan .
There is nothing quite like the sense of accomplishment when you know that Darwin is rooting against you .
I would go so far as to say that success at overcoming the horrible is far sweeter than success when you know what the hell you ’re doing .
And yet … you still might suck at your horrible .
I Want More of You
Back to the Russian Lit Major lurking outside my executive disaster ,
“ Yeah , details bore the shit out of you and you suck at talking to executives . ”
“… I what ? ”
“ You have a product there , but your problem is that you believe that since you can see , everyone else can .
They can’t .
You need to stitch together the details of how you discovered the product and you need to say it in the language of executives .
I ’ll show you . ”
That night , she took my presentation home and ripped it to shreds .
The following morning she sat me down with a completely revised presentation and she walked me through it , slide by slide , pointing out that while I was making fine points , I was skipping over essential details the executives needed to hear .
My thoughts were big , but they lacked meat and executive - friendly messaging .
It sucked .
It ’s one thing to know you ’re horrible at the something , but discovery of this horribleness by the rest of the team is a whole other order of magnitude of embarrassment .
Except the slides were better .
My messages were still there , but the deck made sense to someone other than me .
Two weeks later when we presented again , the questions were enthusiastic , not problematic .
I was saying the same thing , but the additions of the Russian Lit Major ’s natural ability made my message clear .
Big Trust
There ’s a defining moment in your career when you choose to trust someone beside yourself .
I ’m not talking about trusting them with the small stuff : “ Hey , can you fix this bug for me ? ” I ’m talking about big trust “ Hey , your design sense is 10 x mine , what the hell is wrong with this dialog ?
Be brutal . ”
It ’s tricky to leave that swell little island of you .
It ’s hard to suck up your pride and acknowledge there are those who excel where you suck .
But whether you ’re an individual or a manager , your job is to learn to scale at what makes you great .
Yes , you want to fill your professional experience gaps , but if you work where I work , you ’re in a hurry .
Getting anything done requires a balance of your natural talent and your ability to find and leverage the talents of those around you .
By putting big trust in someone else , you ’re solving three problems : you ’re increasing the chance you ’ll get your project done , you ’re building a strong team , and , oh yeah , you get to watch and learn as someone deftly works in a place where you ’re horrible .
By watching someone be great , you ’ll learn just like I learned .

Marijuana Arrests
For 1996 Most In Nation 's History
642,000 Individuals Arrested On Marijuana Charges
Of the 642,000 arrests made for marijuana in 1996 , approximately 85 percent ( 544,700 arrests ) were for simple " possession . "
The remaining 15 percent ( 96,300 arrests ) were for " sale / manufacture , " a category that includes all cultivation offenses - even those where marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use .
The new FBI statistics indicate that one marijuana smoker is arrested every 49 seconds in America .
The drastically rising number of marijuana arrests suggests that law enforcement officials are specifically targeting marijuana smokers .
According to annual data from the U.S. Department of Health National Household Survey on Drug Abuse , marijuana use among adults has remained relatively stable throughout the 1990s .
Despite this fact , marijuana arrests have risen 80 percent since 1990 and constituted 43 percent of all drug arrests made in 1996 .
Presently , the total number of marijuana arrests under the Clinton administration stands at approximately 2.1 million .
" These skyrocketing marijuana arrest figures are not the result of rising marijuana use patterns among American adults , " NORML Executive R. Keith Stroup said .
" They are indicative of a conscious decision by law enforcement to seek out and arrest marijuana smokers in greater numbers than ever before at a tremendous fiscal and social cost to society . "
While there is a lack of information on the precise costs of marijuana prohibition in the available literature , the newest FBI data help to shed some light on the issue .
Annual federal government expenditures on the " war on drugs " average $ 15.7 billion .
In addition , state and local governments also spend $ 16 billion per year enforcing drug laws .
Since nearly 642,000 of the total 1.5 million drug arrests in America were for marijuana offenses , it is reasonable to assume that at least 40 percent of the total $ 32 billion annual costs are related to marijuana prohibition .
A second way to quantify the costs of marijuana prohibition is to isolate the yearly financial burden inflicted on the

Record Arrests
continued from page 1
criminal justice system by arresting over six hundred thousand otherwise law - abiding citizens on marijuana charges .
Every time a marijuana arrest occurs - even the most trivial arrest - at least two police officers are taken off the street for several hours to prepare the paperwork and process the defendant .
If one assumes for simplicity that all of the approximately 642,000 marijuana arrests reported in 1996 were simple cases involving no prior use of police time or resources and taking no more than two hours to process , then marijuana prohibition costs law enforcement a minimum of 2,568,000 man hours annually .
" Marijuana prohibition is clearly a waste of precious law enforcement resources and taxpayers dollars , " Stroup summarized .
Stroup also noted that the increased enforcement of marijuana laws fails to serve as a deterrent for adolescent use .
In fact , federal statistics note just the opposite .
" As marijuana arrests rose throughout the 1990s , so did the number of adolescents reporting experimentation with marijuana , " said Stroup , citing annual data from the University of Michigan Monitoring the Future study indicating rising adolescent marijuana use since 1992 .
" The fact that marijuana use among youth appears to be growing at a time when law enforcement is arresting record numbers of adult users confirms that marijuana prohibition is not an effective deterrent in marijuana consumption . "
Since 1965 law enforcement has arrested approximately 12 million Americans on marijuana charges .

Recent figures released in the FBI 's Uniform Crime Report illustrate that America 's " war on drugs " is nothing short of a war on marijuana smokers .
According to the report , state and local law enforcement arrested nearly 642,000 individuals on marijuana charges in 1996 .
This arrest total is the highest number ever recorded by the FBI and indicates that one marijuana user is arrested every 49 seconds in America .
Marijuana arrests rose 80 percent since 1990 and now constitute 43 percent of all drug arrests .
Of this record number of arrests , approximately 85 percent were for simple " possession . "
The remaining 15 percent were for " sale / manufacture , " a category that includes all cultivation offenses - even those where marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use .
Yet , in spite of the significant increase in the enforcement of marijuana laws , recent surveys indicate that marijuana use is rising in popularity among adolescents .
The fact that marijuana use is growing at the same time law enforcement officials are arresting record numbers of users clearly confirms that marijuana prohibition does not effectively deter marijuana consumption .
Statistics indicate that over one - third of the adult American population admits to experimenting with marijuana .
Is it rational to continue a federal policy that would place all these individuals in jail ?

The “ star ” of the Olympics may not be multiple medalists but the Great Wall of China .
Every TV network covering the Olympics took the world to see the Wall .
It seemed as if almost every newspaper and magazine reporter also visited the Great Wall .
But , the Great Wall , which was built and rebuilt many times over its 22 century history , eventually was a failure .
Although formidable , and one of the world ’s greatest engineering feats , the wall by the 16th century could no longer protect China from neighboring armies .
The Maginot Line , which France thought could protect it from Germany and Italy in the decade leading up to World War II , was largely a failure .
The Berlin Wall , at first barbed wire and then concrete , was built not to keep others out but East Germans in .
But , there were more than 5,000 escapes during its 28 year history before the wall finally came down in 1989 .
As we now know , poorly - constructed levees in New Orleans did n’t keep the flood waters of Katrina from destroying the city .
And now the U.S. is building its own wall .
The Bush Administration is putting up about 700 miles of fencing and other barriers along the U.S. - Mexico border by the end of the year .
The cost just to build that barrier is about $ 2$ 3 million per mile .
But , in certain places , the cost far exceeds that .
This week , the government began excavating an area near San Diego .
When the three and one - half mile fence is finished , the cost will be about $ 57 million .
That ’s about $ 16 million a mile .
Most illegal immigrants pose no problems .
They do n’t receive American benefits , contrary to a lot of Internet gossip .
Most try to avoid getting into trouble , since their purpose of being in America is n’t to get noticed by the police .
And , for those who think putting up a wall will keep terrorists out of the country , reflect upon this :
The 9/11 hijackers had American - issued visas to be in the U.S .
Like the great Wall , the Maginot Line , the Berlin Wall , and the levees , this wall will also fail , as persons desperate to enter the U.S. will find many other ways to cross the border .
But , Americans will have spent more than $ 2 billion for that lesson .
McCain 's hypocrisy knows no limits .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain has been on a tear of late about the exorbitant buyout packages that dismissed executives take from their companies .
He has proclaimed that former Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac CEOs ( and Obama supporters ) Jim Johnson and Franklin Raines should " give back " the $ 21 million and $ 25 million severance packages they received .
So would n't it seem logical that former Hewlett - Packard executive ( and McCain supporter ) Carly Fiorina should send back her $ 42 - million golden parachute ?
Apparently not .
But what about Fiorina ?
" I believe that Carly Fiorina is a role model to millions of young Americans , " McCain said .
" She started out as a part - time secretary and she ended up a CEO of one of the major corporations in America .
I 'm proud of her record and so I want everybody to know that Carly Fiorina is a person that I admire and respect . "
On the TODAY
Show he tried to peddle this garbage to Meredith who did n't buy it .

Viera :
You have said , bottom line , it ’s those fat cats .
It ’s the greed of Wall Street .
You promised to crack down on CEOs who walked away with huge severance packages .
And yet the person who up until recently was your public face on your economic policy was Carly Fiorina .
She ’s the former CEO of Hewlett Packard , she was fired in 2005 , but she left with a $ 45 million dollar golden parachute while 20,000 of her employees were laid off .
She is an example of exactly the kind of person you say is at the root of the problem .
How can you say that ?
McCain : I do n’t think so .
…
Because I think she did a good job as CEO in many respects .
I do n’t know the details of her compensation package .
But she ’s one of many advisers that I have .
Viera :
But she did get a $ 45 million dollar golden parachute after being fired while 20,000 of her employees were laid off .
McCain : I have many of the people , but I do not know the details of what happened .
Sure , he does n't know all the details about Carly while letting her speak for his campaign almost daily .
Right , and I got a bridge to nowhere to sell you .
Researcher are developing technology to translate thought into messages that can be wirelessly delivered .
Funded by the US military ( ' natch ) , the aim is " synthetic telepathy , " using EEG signals monitored non-invasively to communicate by brainpower alone .
Apparently , this research goes back to the 1960s when a scientist used EEG to communicate in Morse code .
Now though , the scientist are using brain scans to better understand how to detect and identify the brain signals .
From MSNBC :
The Army grant to researchers at University of California , Irvine , Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Maryland has two objectives .
The first is to compose a message using , as ( UC Irvine professor Mike ) D'Zmura puts it , " that little voice in your head . "
The second part is to send that message to a particular individual or object ( like a radio ) , also just with the power of thought .
Once the message reaches the recipient , it could be read as text or as a voice mail …
Mapping the brain 's response to most of the English language is a large task , and D'Zmura says that it will be 15 - 20 years before thought - based communication is reality .
Barack Obama and John McCain made a lot of claims about one another during the first US presidential debate .
The BBC News website took a look to see whether or not they were telling the whole truth .
KISSINGER'S POSITION ON TALKS WITH IRAN Claim : Barack Obama said : " Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger , who 's one of his advisers , who , along with five recent secretaries of state , just said that we should meet with Iran - guess what - without precondition . "
Mr McCain countered by saying : " Dr Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face - to - face meetings between the president of the United States and the president - and Ahmadinejad . "
Fact : CBS
News spoke to Henry Kissinger on 25 September and asked him to clarify his position on US talks with Iran .
He told them he " supports talks , if not with Ahmadinejad , then with high level Iranian officials ... without preconditions " .
And Dr Kissinger , shortly after the debate , issued a statement saying : " Senator McCain is right .
I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the presidential level .
My views on this issue are entirely compatible with the views of my friend Senator John McCain .
We do not agree on everything , but we do agree that any negotiations with Iran must be geared to reality . "
Verdict : Mr Obama was correct to note that Dr Kissinger favours talks with Iran , but , since he was making his remarks in response to a question about his policy of meeting the leader of Iran , he could have made it clearer that the former secretary of state did not favour talks at the presidential level .
OBAMA'S POSITION ON TAXES Claim : John McCain said Mr Obama " has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $ 42,000 a year " , to which Mr Obama replied : " That 's not true " .
Fact :
To back up their claim , the McCain team has pointed to two votes Mr Obama made on budget resolutions , one in March 2008 and another in June 2008 .
But budget resolutions are not legally binding - they merely set targets for the committees that write the actual legislation on taxes and spending .
Mr Obama did vote in favour of a resolution calling for the repeal of George W Bush 's tax - cuts , which if enacted would have raised taxes on everyone , including those earning $ 42,000 or more .
But he has made it clear that , as president , he would only increase taxes on couples making $ 250,000 per year , or single people earning $ 200,000 .
Verdict : John McCain 's claim is technically accurate , but not a fair reflection of Mr Obama 's actual policy on taxation .
TAX BREAKS FOR OIL COMPANIES Claim : Mr Obama said that " oil companies would get an additional $ 4bn in tax breaks " under John McCain 's tax plan .
Fact : John McCain does support a cut in the maximum rate of corporate taxes from 35 % to 25 % .
A study from the Center for American Progress Action Fund estimated that such a cut would save the five largest oil companies some $ 3.8 bn .
But Mr McCain 's corporate tax cut would apply to all companies - not just oil firms .
Verdict : Mr Obama was correct to say that Mr McCain would give $ 4bn in tax breaks to oil companies , but it was misleading for him to suggest that only oil companies would get the tax break .
OBAMA'S 'LIBERAL ' RANKING Claim : John McCain said that Barack Obama " has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate " .
Fact :
The non-partisan political magazine , the National Journal , conducts an annual study into the voting records of US senators .
In January 2008 , the magazine published its 2007 rankings , concluding that Mr Obama had been " the most liberal senator in 2007 " .
This ranking was based on analysis of 99 key votes , 33 of which Mr Obama had missed .
And Mr Obama had not been rated " most liberal " in 2006 or 2005 ( he ranked 10th in 2006 and 16th in 2005 ) .
Verdict : Mr McCain has some basis for describing Mr Obama as the " most liberal " senator - but only in 2007 .
And even that ranking is based on a much smaller sample of votes than many of his fellow senators were rated on .

What are these ?
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A diplomatic row broke out between Iceland and Britain Thursday over how to deal with hundreds of millions of pounds of British deposits trapped in collapsed Icelandic banks .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Iceland ’s failure to guarantee the deposits was “ completely unacceptable . ”
“ This is fundamentally a problem of an Icelandic registered company ( and ) Icelandic registered financial services authority -- they have failed not only the people of Iceland , they have failed the people of Britain , ” he told the BBC .
His Icelandic counterpart Geir Haarde had earlier expressed anger at Britain ’s use of anti-terror laws to freeze Icelandic assets in Britain , and said he had made his views clear to Chancellor Alistair Darling in a telephone call .
“ That was not very pleasant .
I ’m afraid that not many governments would have taken that very kindly , to be put in that category and I told the Chancellor that we were not pleased with that ... I could not regard us in any way as the people that this act is supposed to apply to -- terrorists , ” Haarde told a news conference .
Brown remained unrepentant , saying he had been left with no other option .
“ I think the public ... will understand that when people ’s savings and deposits are at risk , we are entitled to take the action that is necessary to seize the assets if we are not going to get any other way of making it clear that people ... will find that their savings and deposits are safe , ” he told Sky television .
“ Now we took that action -- I do n’t apologise for it .
I think it is the right thing to do in the circumstances . ”
British officials have said repeatedly this week that they were having difficulty “ getting complete clarity ” from Icelandic authorities on how British savers were exposed and whether they would be able to recover their deposits .
It emerged Thursday that 108 British local councils had a total of 799 million pounds on deposit with Icelandic banks .
Most of them will be able to continue to provide services , but the British government said it would help any councils with short - term cash flow problems on a case - by - case basis .
Iceland has taken control of three banks this week : Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir .
The British government has pledged to protect the deposits of all British retail savers with those banks , but has not extended this guarantee to corporate investors .
FAQ : What you need to know about mail - in voting
( This guest posting comes via Lauren Gelman , deputy director of the Center for Internet & Society at Stanford Law School . )
UPDATED
When we asked for your questions , we never expected that 80 % would be about taking photographs or videos at the polls .
Research by student fellows at the Stanford University Law School ’s Center for Internet & Society has , ironically , concluded that this is one question without a clear answer .
So the students compiled a 50 - state guide ( we missed a couple in the first posting ; are any missing now ? – they ’re still working on the last few — to point you to the laws and regulations , with a little commentary on how they think the laws might apply to the following questions :
Can you photograph or video your vote inside the polling station– either a paper ballot or electronic screen ?
Can you photograph or video yourself voting inside the polling station ?
Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station and can you video or blog their answers ?
Remember :
This is not legal advice .
This is especially true as there are no clear legal answers to all these questions in all states .
Because the information is written for a general audience , without investigation into the facts of each particular case , it is not legal advice : we have no attorney - client relationship with you .
Again , while we have endeavored to provide accurate responses to the questions we received , we cannot guarantee the answers .
( This is for your protection and ours — we do not have the resources to analyze every situation individually . )
What we have tried to do is to point you to the sections of the code that apply to your question , and the give you some general thoughts on how those sections of the code apply .
Please contact your local Board of Elections and / or a lawyer if you ’re searching for legal advice on your specific activities .
Use your common sense .
We encourage you to ask election officials if they mind your taking a picture of yourself voting or of your vote .
We encourage you not to take pictures of other people voting unless you get their permission .
You do not want to do anything to intimidate someone , or appear to be trying to influence their vote .
Call your local election board before you go to vote and ask them your questions .
Most poll workers on election day are just trying to do their job and make sure everyone gets a fair chance to vote .
Be sensitive to making sure they are able to get their job done right .
Report any incidents to the People for the American Way Voter Hotline : Or go to Video the Vote .
( Also check out the advice on this site for people planning to video their vote ) .
Meanwhile , here ’s the state - by - state rundown — apologies for the earlier missing states — ( again , this is based on research by the Stanford students ) :
Alabama
Only voters , police , and election officials are allowed within 30 feet of polling places .
( Code of Ala . § 17-7-18 . )
This would seem to prohibit media and individuals who have already voted .
Appointed watchers have the right “ generally to observe the conduct of the election . ” ( Code of Ala . § 17-9-29 . )
But this rule says nothing about unappointed observers , nor the ability to record images .
Loitering around a polling place “ for the purpose of discouraging qualified electors ” is a misdemeanor , carrying fines between $ 25 and $ 500 .
( Code of Ala . § 17-7-19 . )
The language implies that mere loitering , without this purpose , is technically permitted .
Alabama enacted new election statutes that will take effect on January 1 , 2007 .
These answers reflect current law .
Code of Ala. § 17-7-18 ( 2006 ) : Persons prohibited near polling place .
Except as electors are admitted to vote and persons to assist them as herein provided , and except the sheriff or his deputy , the inspectors , returning officer , clerks of elections and watchers , no person shall be permitted within 30 feet of the polling place .
Code of Ala. § 17-7-19 ( 2006 ) : Loitering near polling place .
( Repealed effective January 1 , 2007 )
Any person who loiters in , around or about a polling place on election day for the purpose of discouraging qualified electors from entering the voting place , or from voting , or whoever having voted enters or stands in a line or file of voters waiting to vote , is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not less than $ 25.00 nor more than $ 500.00 .
Code of Ala. § 17-23-8 ( 2006 ) : Obstructing voting process .
( Repealed effective January 1 , 2007 )
Any person who , on election day , disturbs or prevents , or attempts to prevent , any elector from freely casting his ballot must , on conviction , be fined not less than $ 500.00 nor more than $ 1,000.00 , and also sentenced to hard labor for the county , or imprisoned in the county jail for not less than six months nor more than one year .
Code of Ala. § 17-9-29 ( 2006 ) : Watchers .
( Repealed effective January 1 , 2007 )
At all elections in which voting machines are used , duly appointed watchers shall have the right to see all oaths administered and signed , the record of assisted voters , the list of qualified voters , the poll lists and any and all records made in connection with the election .
Watchers shall have the right to observe the preliminaries of opening the polls , as provided in Section 17 - 9 - 18 , and the right to remain in the polling place throughout the election and until the results of the election shall have been posted , and the machines sealed , as provided by law .
Watchers shall have the right generally to observe the conduct of the election .
An official who refuses to allow any watchers to exercise such rights shall be guilty of a misdemeanor , and , upon conviction , shall be punished as prescribed by law .
Alaska
Alaska has a statute prohibiting the identification of ballots ( Alaska Stat . § 15.15.290 ) , which might be used to prohibit video / photo activities that can identify voters and their ballots .
Alaska also permits watchers to monitor elections , but is unclear about whether they can take images .
( Alaska Stat . § 15.10.170 . ) The laws for “ unlawful interference with voting ” ( Alaska Stat . § 15.56.030 ) and “ voter misconduct ” ( Alaska Stat . § 15.56.040 ) do not explicitly outlaw video / photo activities .
Alaska Stat. § 15.15.290 ( 2006 ) : Prohibiting the identification of ballots .
While the polls are open , an election official may not open any ballot received from a voter , or mark a ballot by folding or otherwise so as to be able to recognize it , or otherwise attempt to learn how a voter marked a ballot , or allow the same to be done by another person .
Alaska Stat. § 15.10.170 ( 2006 ) : Appointment and privileges of watchers .
The watcher may be present at a position inside the place of voting or counting that affords a full view of all action of the election officials taken from the time the polls are opened until the ballots are finally counted and the results certified by the election board or the data processing review board .
Alaska Stat. § 15.56.030 ( 2006 ) ( unlawful interference with voting ) and Alaska Stat. § 15.56.040 ( 2006 ) ( voter misconduct ) do not explicitly outlaw video / photo activities .
Arizona
The general law about the conduct of the election and placement of voting machines ( A.R.S. § 16-570 ) implies that only one voter may access machine at a time , and that the machines will be locked , possibly implying that no photography of other voters is allowed .
A.R.S. § 16-603 ( 2006 ) : Inspection of ballots by party representative .
A mutually agreed upon number of representatives and alternates of each political party represented on the ballot by a party designation and column , appointed in the manner provided by section 16 -590 , may remain inside the voting area from the time the polls are closed , and , without unduly hindering or delaying the count , one representative from each party at a time may inspect the ballots as they are read and the tally lists as the votes are tallied or counted , but the ballots and tally lists shall at all times remain under the personal charge and keeping of the election officers and shall not be permitted to pass from their hands .
A.R.S. § 16-570 ( 2006 ) : Conduct of election ; duties of officers ; placing machines .
A . One election official shall attend the voting machine , and the other officers shall attend the poll books and perform the duties of election officials as provided by law .
B . The voting machine shall be so placed and protected that it is accessible to only one voter at a time and is in full view of all election officers and watchers at the polling place .
C. The election official attending the machine shall inspect the face of the machine periodically to ascertain whether the ballot labels are in their proper places and that the machine has not been injured or tampered with .
D. During elections the door or other compartment of the machine shall not be unlocked or opened or the counters exposed except for good and sufficient reasons , a statement of which shall be made and signed by the election officers and attached to the returns .
Arkansas
Interfering with voting is a felony , though there is no mention of photo / video activity .
( A.C.A. § 7-1-104 . )
Election officials “ shall not allow any person to pass to the part of the room where the machine is situated , except for the purpose of voting . ”
( A.C.A. § 7-5-521 . )
It is not clear whether this applies to photographing your own vote , or voters entering and exiting the polling place .
A.C.A. § 7-1-104 ( 2006 ) : Miscellaneous felonies – Penalties .
( a) The following offenses shall be deemed felonies punishable as provided in this section : ( 6 ) It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent or to interfere with any qualified elector from voting at any election or to attempt to prevent or interfere with any qualified elector from voting at any election , provided that this subdivision ( a ) ( 6 ) shall not prohibit good faith challenges of ballots or voters according to law by candidates , authorized representatives of candidates , political parties , or ballot issues ;
A.C.A. § 7-5-521 ( 2006 ) : Arrangement of polling place .
[ Effective until January 1 , 2006 . ] .
( a ) The exterior of the voting machine and every part of the polling place shall be in plain view of the election officials .
( b)
The machine shall be placed so that no person can see or determine how the voter casts his vote and so that no person can see or determine from the outside of the room how the voter casts his vote .
( c ) After the opening of the polls , the election officials shall not allow any person to pass to the part of the room where the machine is situated , except for the purpose of voting .
California
California has a clear ban on photography and videography : “ No person shall , with the intent of dissuading another person from voting , within 100 feet of a polling place , . . . [ p ] hotograph , videotape , or otherwise record a voter entering or exiting a polling place . ” ( Cal Elec Code § 18541 . )
It ’s not clear whether this applies to the media .
Only voters engaged in voting can stay within the “ voting booth area . ” ( Cal Elec Code § 14221 . )
Cal Elec Code § 18541 : Prohibited activities within 100 feet of polling place ; Punishment for violation .
( a) No person shall , with the intent of dissuading another person from voting , within 100 feet of a polling place , do any of the following : ( 3 ) Photograph , videotape , or otherwise record a voter entering or exiting a polling place .
Cal Elec Code § 14221 ( 2006 ) : Persons permitted within voting booth area .
Only voters engaged in receiving , preparing , or depositing their ballots and persons authorized by the precinct board to keep order and enforce the law may be permitted to be within the voting booth area before the closing of the polls .
Cal Elec Code § 14224 ( 2006 ) : Occupation of voting booths or compartments .
Voters shall not remain in or occupy the booths or compartments longer than is necessary to mark their ballots , which shall not exceed 10 minutes .
Colorado
No statute prohibiting , however , some counties and polling sites will and can restrict people bringing in items used for video / photography .
( per telephone conversation with Lisa Doran on November 3 – by the contents of 8 CO ADC 1505 - 1 which are the statutes governing elections . )
Connecticut
A copy of the laws referenced below governing Connecticut ’s elections can be found at http://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/pub/Title9.htm.
1 . Can you photograph or video yourself inside the polling station ?
I found nothing prohibiting this .
It is worth noting that absentee ballots might be treated differently .
Under Section 9-359 of the Connecticut General Statutes , it is a felony to execute an absentee ballot for the purpose of telling someone else how you voted .
I think there might be a concern here that posting the picture of an absentee ballot violates this provision .
See 9-359 of the Connecticut General Statutes , which states it is a felony to “ executes an absentee ballot for the purpose of informing any other person how he votes , or procures any absentee ballot to be prepared for such purpose . ”
2 . Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Maybe .
Under Section 9-236 of the Connecticut General Statutes , news media can enter the polling place for the purpose of observing the election .
This might indicate that they can also photograph it .
This does raise the question of whether a blogger qualifies as a member of the news media though .
See Section 9-236 of the Connecticut General Statutes , “ Representatives of the news media shall be allowed to enter , remain within and leave any polling place or restricted area surrounding any polling place to observe the election , provided any such representative who in any way interferes with the orderly process of voting shall be evicted by the moderator . ”
I spoke with an attorney with the Connecticut Board of Elections and he indicated an individual blogger not affiliated with the news media would likely have to maintain a 75 foot distance from the polling place , except when voting .
Anyone doing this type of photography should be careful though .
Under Section 9-364 of the Connecticut General Statutes , it is a crime to influence an elector to stay away from the polls .
Therefore , the photography / videoing should not be done in a way that might keep someone from voting .
See Section 9-364 of the Connecticut General Statutes , “ Any person who influences or attempts to influence any elector to stay away from any election shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars and imprisoned not more than one year nor less than three months . ”
3 . Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
I found nothing indicating this was prohibited .

4 . Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
I found nothing indicating this was prohibited .
5 . Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station ?
I found nothing indicating this is prohibited .
I called the Connecticut Board of Elections and one of their attorneys told me that individuals not affiliated with the media would likely have to stay beyond 75 feet .
See Section 9-236 of the Connecticut General Statutes , “ Representatives of the news media shall be allowed to enter , remain within and leave any polling place or restricted area surrounding any polling place to observe the election , provided any such representative who in any way interferes with the orderly process of voting shall be evicted by the moderator . ”
6 . If you do ask people questions when they leave the polling station , can you video or blog their answers ?
According to an attorney at the Connecticut Board of Elections , the media is allowed to do this all the time .
They go in and out of the polling stations , taking photographs and video .
However , there is a strict penalty for trying to induce someone to do something to enable others to see how he voted .
Under this provision , a blogger might get in trouble for asking people questions with the intent to share their answers with the world .
See Connecticut General Statutes 9-366 , “ Any person who induces or attempts to induce any elector to write , paste or otherwise place , on a write - in ballot voted on a voting machine at any election , any name , sign or device of any kind , as a distinguishing mark by which to indicate to another how such elector voted , or enters into or attempts to form any agreement or conspiracy with any person to induce or attempt to induce electors or any elector to so place any distinguishing mark on such ballot , or attempts to induce any elector to do anything with a view to enabling another person to see or know for what persons or any of them such elector votes on such machine , or enters into or attempts to form any agreement or conspiracy to induce any elector to do any act for the purpose of enabling another person or persons to see or know for what person or persons such elector votes , or attempts to induce any person to place himself in such position , or to do any other act for the purpose of enabling him to see or know for what candidates any elector other than himself votes on such machine , or himself attempts to get in such position to do any act so that he will be enabled to see or know how any elector other than himself votes on such machine , or does any act which invades or interferes with the secrecy of the voting or causes the same to be invaded or interfered with , shall be imprisoned not more than five years . ”
Delaware :
A copy of the laws referenced below governing Delaware ’s elections can be found at http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title15/index.htm.
1 . Can you photograph or video yourself inside the polling station ?
No .
I spoke with Frank Calio , the Commissioner of Elections in Delaware .
He told me that it is the Commissioner ’s policy that no cameras are allowed inside the voting place .
I believe this is an unwritten policy , as he was unable to provide me with a hard copy .
The policy is based in his belief that the voter should be allowed to vote in privacy , without having cameras around .
Even if a voter is only intending to photograph their own vote , this will be disallowed because of concerns that once pictures are being taken , it is difficult to control who they will be taken of .
2 . Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
No .
I spoke with Frank Calio , the Commissioner of Elections in Delaware .

I believe this is an unwritten policy , as he was unable to provide me with a hard copy .
3 . Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
This seems to be okay , provided you are filming / photographing the outside of the station .
I think trying to photograph the inside of the station might be a problem , given the policy rationale behind the Commissioner of Elections ’s rule that you cannot have cameras where people are voting .
4 . Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
I found nothing indicating this is prohibited .
5 . Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station ?
Yes .
You can even be within 50 feet of the polling station if you are conducting an exit poll .
However , you cannot talk to people who have not yet voted .
See 15 Delaware Code Section 4933 .
6 . If you do ask people questions when they leave the polling station , can you video or blog their answers ?
I found nothing indicating this is prohibited .
Frank Calio , the Commissioner of Elections in Delaware confirmed that exit pollers may photograph and video responses and said he did not think he could keep people from sharing those photographs and videos once they left the polling place .
Florida
A copy of the laws referenced below governing Florida ’s elections can be found at http://election.dos.state.fl.us/publications/pdf/2006_election_laws.pdf
1 . Can you photograph or video yourself inside the polling station ?
No . See 102.031 ( 5 ) of the Florida Code , “ no photography is permitted in the polling room or early voting area . ”
2 . Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
No . See 102.031 ( 5 ) of the Florida Code , “ no photography is permitted in the polling room or early voting area . ”
3 . Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
I found no law indicating you could not photograph the outside of a polling place .
You cannot photograph people in the polling area , according to an interpretation of 102.031 ( 5 ) made by an attorney with the Florida Division of Elections .
See 102.031 ( 5 ) of the Florida Code , “ no photography is permitted in the polling room or early voting area . ”
4 . Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
I found nothing prohibiting this .
An attorney with the Florida Division of Elections warned me that the election supervisor might ask you to stop if your photographs or videos included shots into the polling place .
5 . Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station ?
You cannot ask people questions within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling station .
See 102.031 ( 4 ) of the Florida Code , “ ( 4 ) ( a ) No person , political committee , committee of continuous existence , or other group or organization may solicit voters inside the polling place or within 100 feet of the entrance to any polling place , or polling room where the polling place is also a polling room , or early voting site .
Before the opening of the polling place or early voting site , the clerk or supervisor shall designate the no-solicitation zone and mark the boundaries .
( b )
For the purpose of this subsection , the term “ solicit ” shall include , but not be limited to , seeking or attempting to seek any vote , fact , opinion , or contribution ; distributing or attempting to distribute any political or campaign material , leaflet , or handout ; conducting a poll ; seeking or attempting to seek a signature on any petition ; and selling or attempting to sell any item .
( c ) Each supervisor of elections shall inform the clerk of the area within which soliciting is unlawful , based on the particular characteristics of that polling place .
The supervisor or the clerk may take any reasonable action necessary to ensure order at the polling places , including , but not limited to , having disruptive and unruly persons removed by law enforcement officers from the polling room or place or from the 100 - foot zone surrounding the polling place . ”
A very recent case in a court in Florida has removed the 100 foot requirement for exit pollers , according to an attorney with the Florida Board of Elections ( I cannot find a cite to the case ) .
However , the supervisors of the elections will set up strict rules for how you can be qualified as an exit poller and you should contact the supervisor of elections to determine how to be qualified as an exit poller .
6 . If you do ask people questions when they leave the polling station , can you video or blog their answers ?
I found no prohibitions on this , provided you are not an election official or an assistant to an election official .
Georgia
A copy of the laws referenced below governing Georgia ’s elections can be found at http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/GaCode/?title=21&chapter=2.
1 . Can you photograph or video yourself inside the polling station ?
No .
You cannot use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices within the enclosed space in a polling place .
Although the statute is not clear , this seems to apply to both the voting booth itself as well as the polling station more broadly .
See 21-2-413(e ) of Georgia ’s Annotated Code , “ No elector shall use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices or cellular telephones while such elector is within the enclosed space in a polling place . ”
2 . Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
No .
You cannot use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices within the enclosed space in a polling place .
Although the statute is not clear , this seems to apply to both the voting booth itself as well as the polling station more broadly .
See 21-2-413(e ) of Georgia ’s Annotated Code , “ No elector shall use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices or cellular telephones while such elector is within the enclosed space in a polling place . ”
3 . Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
I found no law indicating you could not photograph the outside of a polling place .
Of course , you could not photograph the outside of a voting booth if you were standing within the polling place .
See 21-2-413(e ) of Georgia ’s Code , “ No elector shall use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices or cellular telephones while such elector is within the enclosed space in a polling place . ”
4 . Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
I found no law indicating you could not do this .
However , make sure the camera is outside of the polling place itself .
See 21-2-413(e ) of Georgia ’s Annotated Code , “ No elector shall use photographic or other electronic monitoring or recording devices or cellular telephones while such elector is within the enclosed space in a polling place . ”
5 . Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station ?
You cannot conduct an exit poll within 150 feet of the outer edge of the building of the polling place or within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote .
Nor can you conduct an exit poll within a room where absentee ballots are being cast or within 150 feet of a voter waiting to cast absentee ballots ( unless in a private office out of earshot of voters ) .
See 21-2-414 of Georgia ’s Code , “ (a ) No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method , nor shall any person distribute any campaign literature , newspaper , booklet , pamphlet , card , sign , or any other written or printed matter of any kind , nor shall any person conduct any exit poll or public opinion poll with voters on any primary or election day : ( 1 ) Within 150 feet of the outer edge of any building within which a polling place is established ; ( 2 ) Within any polling place ; or ( 3 ) Within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place . ” , “ ( c ) No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method , nor shall any person distribute any campaign literature , newspaper , booklet , pamphlet , card , sign , or any other written or printed matter of any kind , nor shall any person conduct any exit poll or public opinion poll with voters within a room under the control or supervision of the registrars or absentee ballot clerk in which absentee ball ots are being cast on any day or within 150 feet of any elector waiting to cast an absentee ballot pursuant to subsection ( b ) of Code Section 21-2-380 .
No campaign literature , booklet , pamphlet , card , sign , or other written or printed matter shall be displayed in any building containing a room under the control or supervision of the registrars or absentee ballot clerk in which absentee ballots are cast during the period when absentee ballots are available for voting .
These restrictions shall not apply to conduct occurring in private offices or areas which cannot be seen or heard by such electors . ”
However , there seems to be no prohibition on exit polling provided the proper distance is kept .
6 . If you do ask people questions when they leave the polling station , can you video or blog their answers ?
Assuming annonyminity in the blog , I could find no law indicating this is prohibited , assuming the proper distance is kept during polling .
However , you may not be able to show specific responses to exit poll questions ( such as identifying someone by name in the blog or showing their picture in video ) .
It is a misdemeanor to disclose to anyone how another person voted , unless the law requires the disclosure .
See 21-2-568 of the Georgia Code , “ Any person who … ( 5 ) Discloses to anyone how another elector voted , except when required to do so in any legal proceeding shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . ”

Idaho Code , Title 18 – Crimes and Punishments , Chapter 23 – Elections
18-2305 . INTIMIDATION , CORRUPTION AND FRAUDS .
( available at http://www3.state.id.us/cgi-bin/newidst?sctid=180230005.K )
Every person who , by force , threats , menaces , bribery , or any corrupt means , either directly or indirectly attempts to influence any elector in giving his vote , or to deter him from giving the same , or attempts by any means whatever , to awe , restrain , hinder or disturb any elector in the free exercise of the right of suffrage , or furnishes any elector wishing to vote , who can not read , with a ticket , informing or giving such elector to understand that it contains a name written or printed thereon different from the name which is written or printed thereon , or defrauds any elector at any such election , by deceiving and causing such elector to vote for a different person , for any office , than he intended or desired to vote for ; or who , being officer , judge , or clerk of any election , while acting as such , induces , or attempts to induce , any elector , either by menace or reward , or promise thereof , to vote differently from what such elector intended or desired to vote , is guilty of a misdem eanor .
18-2313 . RIOTOUS CONDUCT AND INTERFERENCE WITH ELECTION .
( available at http://www3.state.id.us/cgi-bin/newidst?sctid=180230013.K)
Any person who wilfully disturbs , or is guilty of any riotous conduct at or near , any election place or voting precinct , with intent to disturb the same , or interferes with the access of the electors to the polling place , or in any manner , with the free exercise of the election franchise of the voters , or any voter there assembled , or disturbs or interferes with the canvassing of the votes , or with the making of the returns , is guilty of a misdemeanor .
Idaho Code , Title 34 – Elections , Chapter 11 – Conduct of Elections
34-1110 . OFFICERS NOT TO DIVULGE INFORMATION .
( available at http://www3.state.id.us/cgi-bin/newidst?sctid=340110010.K )
No judge or clerk shall communicate to anyone any information as to the name or number on the registry list of any elector who has not applied for a ballot , or who has not voted at the polling place ; and no judge , clerk or other person whomsoever , shall interfere with , or attempt to interfere with , a voter when marking his ballot .
No judge , clerk or other person shall , directly or indirectly , attempt to induce any voter to display his ticket after he shall have marked the same , or to make known to any person the name of any candidate for or against whom he may have voted .
The Idaho Code does not include any references to the use of film cameras or video cameras at polling places .
One provision ( Idaho Code 18-2305 ) makes it a misdemeanor to “ awe , restrain , hinder or disturb any elector in the free exercise of the right of suffrage . ”
Another provision ( Idaho Code 18-2313 ) makes it a misdemeanor to “ wilfully disturb [ ] . . . any election place or voting precinct . . . [ or to ] interfere [ ] with the access of the electors to the polling place , or in any manner , with the free exercise of the election franchise of the voters . ”
These provisions may or may not apply to the use of film or video cameras ; it is unclear what level of disturbance is required to trigger a violation of the law .
Overall , though , it seems like it would be legal to stand outside of a polling place to photograph or video the polling place and the people leaving the polling place , so long as the person with the camera does not interfere with access to the polling place or otherwise interfere with others ’ ability to vote .
A third provision ( Idaho Code 34 - 1110 ) states that no person “ shall , directly or indirectly , attempt to induce any voter to display his ticket after he shall have marked the same . ”
Therefore , it may be illegal to photograph or video others while they are voting – particularly if the person with the camera views the another person ’s ballot .
However , the statute does not indicate whether a person can photograph or video his / her own ballot .

Any person who , by force , intimidation , threat , deception or forgery , knowingly prevents any other person from ( a ) registering to vote , or ( b ) lawfully voting , supporting or opposing the nomination or election of any person for public office or any public question voted upon at any election , shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony .

Sec. 29 - 9 . Unlawful observation of voting .
Except as permitted by this Code , any person who knowingly marks his ballot or casts his vote on a voting machine or voting device so that it can be observed by another person , and any person who knowingly observes another person lawfully marking a ballot or lawfully casting his vote on a voting machine or voting device , shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony .
The Illinois Compiled Statutes do not include any references to the use of film cameras or video cameras at polling places .
One provision ( 10 ILCS 5 / 29 - 4 ) makes it a felony to “ knowingly prevent [ ] any other person from . . . lawfully voting . ”
This provision probably would not apply to the use of film or video cameras , unless the person with the camera actually prevented someone from voting .
Another provision ( 10 ILCS 5/17 - 29 ) makes it a felony to “ interrupt , hinder or oppose any voter while approaching [ a polling place ] for the purpose of voting . ”
It is not clear whether this would apply to the use of film or video cameras .
A third provision ( 10 ILCS 5 / 29 - 9 ) makes it a felony to mark a ballot or cast a vote “ so that it can be observed by another person . ”
The same provision also makes it a felony to “ observe another person lawfully marking a ballot or lawfully casting his vote . . . ”
This would prevent a person from photographing or recording someone else voting , but it would not prevent a person from photographing or recording himself / herself voting .
In addition , 10 ILCS 5/17 - 11 requires voters to enter the voting booth alone ( or with a child ) .
This would also prevent a person from photographing or recording someone else voting .
I sent an email to the email address provided on the Illinois State Board of Elections website and asked about these questions .
Response from Steve Sturm ( Illinois State Board of Elections ) :
“ There are no provisions either allowing or disallowing video or audio
taping of election proceedings .
The only provisions which would affect
the ability of a person to tape proceedings are those which allow the
election judges to take complete control of the polling place and those
which prevent anyone from compromising the ability of voters to cast a
ballot in secret .
Our general advice to election authorities is that cameras should not be
allowed if they are disrupting the proceedings but that each
circumstance should be considered separately depending on the facts of
the individual cases . ”

( 3 ) notified before the ballot is cast regarding the effect of casting multiple votes for the office and provided an opportunity to correct the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted .
IC 3-11-11-16
Disclosure of ballot ; record
Sec. 16 .
If a voter shows the voter ’s ballot or a part of the ballot to another person after the ballot has been marked so as to disclose any of the candidates voted for or how the voter voted on a public question , the ballot may not be deposited in a ballot box .
A record of the occurrence shall be made on the poll list , and the voter may not vote again at the election .
IC 3-11-11-17
Voter to leave polls after voting ; requirement of voting or returning ballot ; returning of pencil
Sec. 17 .
After voting , a voter shall leave the polls .
However , a voter to whom ballots and a pencil have been delivered may not leave the polls without :
(1 ) voting the ballots or returning them to the poll clerk ; and
( 2 ) returning the pencil to the poll clerk from whom the voter received it .
The Indiana Code ( IC 3 - 6 - 10 - 5 ) states that appointed “ media watchers ” may photograph the proceedings of a precinct election board .
Media watchers must be appointed by a “ newspaper of general circulation , ” a news service ( such as the AP ) , or a radio or television station .
However , the media watchers may not photograph a voter if the voter objects or in a manner that would divulge how a voter cast his / her vote .
The Indiana Code does not mention whether any other people may photograph election proceedings .
IC 3-11 - 8- 16 states that only voters are permitted near the entrance to the polls .
This may prevent a person with a film or video camera from positioning himself near the entrance in order to photograph or record voters entering and exiting the polling place .
IC 3 -11 - 11 - 8 states that only one person may be in a voting booth at a time .
IC 3 - 11 - 11 - 9 states that a “ voter shall mark all ballots while screened from observation , and IC 3 - 11 - 11 - 16 states that a voter may not submit a ballot that has been disclosed to another person .
Together , these provisions may prevent a person from photographing or recording someone else voting .
They do not appear to affect the ability of a person to record himself / herself when voting .
I sent an email to the Indiana Election Commission and asked about these questions .
Response from email :
Thank you for your message , which has been referred to Dale Simmons ,
Co-General Counsel of the Election Division , for a response .

questions leaving the polling station and can you video their answers ? ” ,
would be yes , provided that you did so outside the area where
unauthorized presence of persons is prohibited under IC 3 -14 - 3 - 15 .
That
area would include the room where voting is taking place ( “ the polls ” )
and the 50 feet area beyond the entrance to the polls ( “ the chute ” ) .
Of course , this answer assumes that you have the permission of the
property owner to be present .
Many polling locations are not located in
government facilities , but instead on rented private property .
But if
you were standing in a public area ( a sidewalk , a street , for example )
outside of the chute , then I think the answer would be yes .
This type of
“ exit polling ” is not a common practice in Indiana , but sometimes does
occur .
Thanks again ,

39A.4 Election misconduct in the third degree .
1 . A person commits the crime of election misconduct in the third degree if
the person willfully commits any of the following acts :
a. Election day acts .
Any of the following on election day :
(1) Loitering , congregating , electioneering , posting signs , treating voters , or
soliciting votes , during the receiving of the ballots , either on the premises of a
polling place or within three hundred feet of an outside door of a building
affording access to a room where the polls are held , or of an outside door of a
building affording access to a hallway , corridor , stairway , or other means of
reaching the room where the polls are held .
This subparagraph does not apply to
the posting of signs on private property not a polling place , except that the
placement of a sign that is more than ninety square inches in size on a motor
vehicle , trailer , or semitrailer , or its attachment to a motor vehicle , trailer , or
semitrailer parked on public property within three hundred feet of a polling
place is prohibited .
(2) Interrupting , hindering , or opposing a voter while in or approaching the
polling place for the purpose of voting .
(3) As a voter , submitting a false statement as to the voter ’s ability to mark a
ballot .
(4) Interfering or attempting to interfere with a voter when the voter is
inside the enclosed voting space , or when the voter is marking a ballot .
(5) Endeavoring to induce a voter to show how the voter marks or has
marked a ballot .
(6) Marking , or causing in any manner to be marked , on a ballot , any
character for the purpose of identifying such ballot .
49.84 Marking and return of ballot .
After receiving the ballot , the voter shall immediately go alone to one of the
voting booths , and without delay mark the ballot .
All voters shall vote in booths .
No special lines shall be used to separate voters who state that they wish to vote
only a portion of the ballot .
Before leaving the voting booth , the voter shall fold the ballot or enclose it in
a secrecy folder to conceal the marks on the ballot .
The voter shall deliver the
ballot to one of the precinct election officials .
No identifying mark or symbol
shall be endorsed on the back of the voter ’s ballot .
If the precinct has a portable
vote tallying system which will not permit more than one ballot to be inserted at
a time , the voter may insert the ballot into the tabulating device ; otherwise , the
election official shall place the ballot in the ballot box .
This section does not prohibit a voter from taking minor children into the
voting booth with the voter .
[ C51 , §257 ; R60 , §492 ; C73 , §617 ; C97 , § 1117 , 1119 ; S13 , § 1119 ; C24 , 27 , 31 , 35 , 39 ,
§ 801 ; C46 , 50 , 54 , 58 , 62 , 66 , 71 , 73 , 75 , 77 , 79 , 81 , § 49.84 ]
94 Acts , ch 1180 , § 16 ; 2002 Acts , ch 1134 , §41 , 115
49.88 Limitation on persons in booth and time for voting .
No more than one person shall be allowed to occupy any voting booth at any
time .
No person shall occupy such booth for more than three minutes to cast a
vote .
Nothing in this section shall prohibit assistance to voters under section
49.90 .
Iowa Code 39A .4 ( 1 ) makes it a crime for a person from “ congregating . . . either on the premises of a polling place or within three hundred feet of an outside door of a building affording access to a room where the polls are held . ”
This may prevent a person with a film or video camera from positioning himself near the entrance in order to photograph or record voters entering and exiting the polling place .
Iowa Code 39A .
4 ( 5 ) makes it a crime to “ induce a voter to show how the voter marks or has marked a ballot . ”
This provision may prevent a person from photographing or recording someone else voting .
It does not appear to affect the ability of a person to record himself / herself when voting .
The Iowa Code does not include any references to the use of film cameras or video cameras at polling places .
Kansas
Can you photograph or video your vote inside the polling station–either a paper ballot or electronic screen ?
No : Kansas law prohibits “ disclosing or exposing the contents of any ballot or the manner in which the ballot has been voted . ”
Assuming that “ contents of any ballot ” would cover an unmarked ballot , it appears illegal to photograph a ballot even before it has been marked .
KS ST 25-2422 ( available at http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-statutes/getStatute.do?number=13509).
Can you photograph or video yourself voting inside the polling station ?
Probably : Although Kansas law prohibits “ disorderly conduct ” within the polling place , it is likely that you can photograph or videotape yourself in the process of voting .
KS ST 25-2413 ( available at http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-statutes/getStatute.do?number=13499).
Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Probably :
As long as you do not “ interrupt , hinder or obstruct ” other voters in the polling place , you should not be restricted from photographing or videotaping others voting or the working of the polling station from within .
KS ST 25-2413 ( available at http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-statutes/getStatute.do?number=13499).
Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
Yes :
There does not appear to be any restriction on photography or videotaping a polling place from outside the actual building .
Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
Yes :
Without delving into rights of publicity , there does n’t appear to be any restriction on photographing or videotaping people leaving the polling place .
Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station and can you video or blog their answers ?
Yes :
There does not appear to be a restriction on interviewing people leaving the polling station .
Kentucky
While KRS 117.235 (1 ) literally prohibits all persons other than voters and election officials from entering a voting place , First Amendment rights of the media to observe and report the election process must be given due consideration .
Therefore , news media should be given access to voting places for the limited purpose of filming the electoral process , and county boards of elections are to designate those representatives of the news media who are to be allowed in each precinct for the purpose of observing the vote count .

B. Powers and duties .
A watcher shall be admitted within all parts of the polling place during the election and the counting and tabulation of votes , and shall call any infraction of the law to the attention of the commissioners .
A watcher may keep notes on the conduct of the election , but he shall not take part in the counting and tabulation of votes .
A watcher shall not electioneer , engage in political discussions , or unnecessarily delay a voter at the polling place .
A watcher shall be subject to the authority of the commissioners and shall not interfere with the commissioners in the performance of their duties .

Maryland
A citizen will need to get approval of the state or local board to enter a polling place for purposes other than voting .
A 2002 article suggests that members of the media must contact the chief election judge at the polling place for permission to photograph it .
MD Code , Election Law , § 10-308
( a) An election judge shall allow the following individuals to have access to the voting room at a polling place : ( 1 ) a voter ; ( 2 ) an individual who accompanies a voter in need of assistance in accordance with § 10 - 310 ( c ) of this subtitle ; ( 3 ) polling place staff ; ( 4 ) a member or other representative of the State Board or local board ; ( 5 ) an accredited watcher or challenger under § 10 - 311 of this subtitle ; ( 6 ) an individual under the age of 13 who accompanies a voter in accordance with § 10 - 310 ( c ) of this subtitle , provided that the individual is in the care of the voter and does not disrupt or interfere with normal voting procedures ; and ( 7 ) any other individual authorized by the State Board or local board .
Maine
A citizen will need to contact his or her state or local board to determine the relevant rules .
Massachusetts
Can you photograph or video your vote inside the polling station–either a paper ballot or electronic screen ?
Not after marked : A Massachusetts voter shall not “ allow the marking of [ his or her ] ballot to be seen by any person for any purpose not authorized by law . ”
MA ST 56 - 25 ( available at http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/56-25.htm).
Can you photograph or video yourself voting inside the polling station ?
Probably : Although a voter is restricted from disclosing the contents of his or her marked ballot , photographing or videotaping the ballot before marking a vote , or the voting process generally does not appear to be restricted .
Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Probably :
You may not “ hinder , delay or interfere with ” a voter , be disorderly , or restrict open and unobstructed access to the polling station , there does not appear to be a restriction on photographing or videotaping the working of a polling station .
MA ST 56 - 29 ( http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/56-29.htm), MA ST 56 - 46 ( http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/56-46.htm), MA ST 54-71 ( available at http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/54-71.htm).
Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
Yes :
There does not appear to be any restriction on photography or videotaping a polling place from outside the actual building .
Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
Yes :
Without delving into rights of publicity , there does n’t appear to be any restriction on photographing or videotaping people leaving the polling place .
Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station and can you video or blog their answers ?
Yes :
There does not appear to be any restriction on interviewing voters as they leave a polling station .
Michigan
The Michigan Department of State has released an informational bulletin on the conduct of the November 7 , 2006 general election , which is available at http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Issue_40_177190_7.pdf.
Page two of the bulletin states :
“ To ensure that all voters who attend the polls on November 7 have a full opportunity to exercise their right to vote in private without undue distractions or discomfort , the following must be observed :
The use of video cameras ( including cell phone video cameras ) , cameras and recording devices by voters , challengers and poll watchers is prohibited in the polls during the hours the polls are open for voting . ”
Furthermore , page one of the bulletin provides the following instructions for precinct boards :
“ Inside each room where a polling place will be established , clearly mark off the ‘ public area ’ of the room .
The ‘ public area ’ of the polling place must be clearly distinguishable from the ‘ voting area ’ of the room .
All poll watchers and media representatives must remain in the ‘ public area ’ of the polling place at all times . ”
As for representatives of the news media , the bulletin states on page two :
“ Broadcast stations and news media representatives may be permitted to briefly film from the public area of the polling room .
In no case can personnel working for broadcast stations or the news media set up a camera in the voting area of the polling room . ”
According to page one of the bulletin , Michigan election law , MCL 168.678 , extends precinct boards full authority “ to maintain peace , regularity and order at the polling place …. ”
Precinct boards are extended such authority as voters have a right to vote a secret ballot in a secure , orderly environment which is free of distractions .
According to Steven Luck , an elections specialist with the Michigan Bureau of Elections , in a phone conversation on November 3 , 2006 , although voters who are not members of the news media are prohibited from taking photographs or videorecordings inside the polling station , once outside , they are authorized to do so as long as they do not cause disruptions or distractions .
Minnesota
Minnesota election law does not address the issue of taking photographs or videorecordings in or near polling places by individuals who are not news media .
The following provision concerns access for news media :
“ A news media representative may enter a polling place during voting hours only to observe the voting process .
A media representative must present photo identification to the head election judge upon arrival at the polling place , along with either a recognized media credential or written statement from a local election official attesting to the media representative ’s credentials .
A media representative must not : ( 1 ) approach within six feet of a voter ; ( 2 ) converse with a voter while in the polling place ; ( 3 ) make a list of persons voting or not voting ; or ( 4 ) interfere with the voting process .
Minn. Stat. 204C.06 Subd .
8 . The following provision applies to the conduct of voters in and near polling places :
“ An individual shall be allowed to go to and from the polling place for the purpose of voting without unlawful interference .
No one except an election official or an individual who is waiting to register or to vote shall stand within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place .
The entrance to a polling place is the doorway or point of entry leading into the room or area where voting is occurring . ” ( Minn. Stat. 204C.06 subd . 1 ) . Furthermore , “ an individual may remain inside the polling place during voting hours only while voting or registering to vote , providing proof of residence for an individual who is registering to vote , or assisting a handicapped voter or a voter who is unable to read English .
During voting hours no one except individuals receiving , marking , or depositing ballots shall approach within six feet of a voting booth , unless lawfully authorized to do so by an election judge . ” ( Minn. Stat. 204C.06 subd . 2 ) .
Since taking photos or videorecording is not one of the enumerated activities for which “ an individual may remain inside the polling place , ” such activities may well be prohibited by this statute .
Minnesota election law does not address the issue of taking photographs or videorecordings in or near polling places .
Mississippi
According to Willy Allen of the Elections Division , Office of the Mississippi Secretary of State , in a phone conversation on November 3 , 2006 , no photographs or audio or video recordings may be taken inside the polling stations , in order to uphold the integrity of the voting process .
Mr. Allen cited concerns about people selling their vote , and noted that photographs or videorecordings could be used as evidence of how a person voted .
Mr. Allen also referred to a 1994 Memo issued from the U.S. Justice Departmentto to the Mississippi Elections Division , which had responded to a question from said Division about taking photographs in and around polling stations .
According to Mr. Allen , the Memo stated that taking photographs was prohibited within polling stations , out of concerns over voter intimidation .
Mr. Allen noted that DOJ re-issued the memo to the Mississippi Elections Division last week , reaffirming DOJ ’s position on this issue .
The following provision concerns voter conduct in and about polling places .
“ A space thirty ( 30 ) feet in every direction from the polls , or the room in which the election is held , shall be kept open and clear of all persons except the election officers and two ( 2 ) challengers of good conduct and behavior , selected by each party to detect and challenge illegal voters ; and the electors shall approach the polls from one direction , line , door or passage , and depart in another as nearly opposite as convenient . ”

Missouri
Missouri election law does not address the issue of taking photographs or videorecordings in or near polling places , it merely stipulates that each voter shall vote without undue delay .
( 115.441 R.S.Mo. )
Missouri state statute classifies as an election offence “ [ e ] xit polling , surveying , [ and ] sampling . ”
It is unclear whether “ surveying ” includes the act of taking photographs or videorecordings by individual voters .
( 115.637 subd . 18 R.S.Mo. )
As for members of the news media , the Missouri statue explicitly grants access to polling places to “ members of the news media who present identification satisfactory to the election judges and who are present only for the purpose of bona fide news coverage . . . provided that such coverage does not disclose how any voter cast the voter ’s ballot on any question or candidate or in the case of a primary election on which party ballot they voted or does not interfere with the general conduct of the election as determined by the election judges or election authority . ” ( 115.409 R.S.Mo . )
Montana
Can you photograph or video your vote inside the polling station–either a paper ballot or electronic screen ?
Not after marked : A Montana voter “ may not show the contents of [ his or her ] ballot to anyone after it is marked . ”
MT ST 13-35-201
( available at http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/MCA/13/35/13-35-201.htm).
Photographing or videotaping an unmarked ballot does not appear to be restricted .
Can you photograph or video yourself voting inside the polling station ?
Probably : Although a voter is restricted from disclosing the contents of his or her marked ballot , photographing or videotaping the ballot before marking a vote , or the voting process generally does not appear to be restricted .
Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Maybe :
You may not photograph or video any voters marked ballot , but there does not appear to be any restriction on photographing or videotaping other voters within the polling place itself .
Election officials in Montana restrict media access to the actual polling place , but you should be able to photograph or video the operation of the polling place while you are voting yourself .
If your actions are seen as disruptive , however , election officials may ask you to stop .
To be safe , you should consult the chief election judge about how best to record your voting experience while minimizing disruption .
See MT ST 13-35-203 ( available at
http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/MCA/13/35/13-35-203.htm), MT ST 13-35-218 ( available at http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/MCA/13/35/13-35-218.htm).
Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
There does not appear to be any restriction on photography or videotaping a polling place from outside the actual building .
Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
Without delving into rights of publicity , there does n’t appear to be any restriction on photographing or videotaping people leaving the polling place .
Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station and can you video or blog their answers ?
Questions about votes must be outside : Montana does not allow asking anyone “ within a polling place or any building in which an election is being held ” about how they voted or plan to vote .
MT ST 13-35-211(3 ) ( available at http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/MCA/13/35/13-35-211.htm).
Additionally , the Montana secretary of state has restricted media access to the actual polling room .
It is likely that once you have completed voting , you will be required to leave the polling room , but questions unrelated to votes for / against a particular candidate or initiative should be permissible there .
Nebraska
Can you photograph or video your vote inside the polling station–either a paper ballot or electronic screen ?
Not after marked : A Nebraska voter shall not “ show his or her ballot after it is marked to any person … ” NE ST 32-1527(4 ) .
Photographing or videotaping an unmarked ballot does not appear to be
restricted .
Can you photograph or video yourself voting inside the polling station ?
Probably : Although a voter is restricted from disclosing the contents of his or her marked ballot , photographing or videotaping the ballot before marking a vote , or the voting process generally does not appear to be restricted .
Can you photograph or video others voting or the working of the polling station from within it ?
Probably :
You may not obstruct passageways , doors or entryways , and only voters “ engaged in receiving , preparing , or marking a ballot ” are allowed within 8 feet of voting booths or the ballot box , but otherwise there does not appear to be a restriction on photography or videotaping within the polling place ( apart from interviewing restrictions described below ) .
See , NE ST 32-910 , NE ST 32-925 , NE ST 32-1523 .
Can you photograph or video the polling station from outside it ?
Yes :
There does not appear to be any restriction on photography or videotaping a polling place from outside the actual building .
Can you photograph or video people leaving the voting station ?
Yes :
Without delving into rights of publicity , there does n’t appear to be any restriction on photographing or videotaping people leaving the polling place .
Can you ask people questions leaving the polling station and can you video or blog their answers ?
20ft from polling place or 100ft from voting booth : Interviews may not occur “ within twenty feet of the entrance of any polling place or , if inside the polling place or building , within one hundred feet of any voting booth . ”
NE ST 32-1525 .
Nevada
Nevada election law permits members of the general public to observe the conduct of voting at polling places , but explicitly prohibits members of the general public from taking photographs ( or recording by means of sound or video reproduction ) the conduct of voting at polling places .
( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 293.274 ) .
The statute states :
1 . The county clerk shall allow members of the general public to observe the conduct of voting at a polling place .
2 . A member of the general public shall not photograph the conduct of voting at a polling place or record the conduct of voting on audiotape or any other means of sound or video reproduction .
3 . For the purposes of this section , a member of the general public does not include any person who : ( a ) Gathers information for communication to the public ; ( b ) Is employed or engaged by or has contracted with a newspaper , periodical , press association , or radio or television station ; and ( c ) Is acting solely within his professional capacity .
( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 293.274 )
There is some ambiguity in the case of registered voters who , in the process of voting , wish to take photographs or other recordings for the purpose of publicly posting to their personal blogs .
The ambiguity turns on whether such a voter - blogger should be considered a “ member of the general public , ” and hence prohibited from taking photographs or other recordings under this section , or whether such a person is simply “ gather[ing ] information for communication to the public , ” and hence not prohibited under this particular section of the statute .
However , voter - bloggers may be prohibited from photographing or recording under Nev. Rev. Stat.
293.247 , which gives the Secretary of State of Nevada the authority to adopt regulations for the conduct of elections throughout the state .
As of November 1 , 2006 , it is no longer unlawful for a “ person to speak to a voter on the subject of marking their ballot ‘. . . within 100 feet from the entrance to the building or other structure in which a polling place is located . ’” ABC v. Heller , 2:06 - CV-01268-PMP -RJJ ( D. Nev. 2006 ) .
ABC v. Heller granted a preliminary injunction to a news - gathering agency that sought to conduct exit polls of voters leaving polling places in the State of Nevada within the 100 - foot barrier formerly imposed under Nev. Rev. Stat. 293.740 ( 1 ) ( a ) at the forthcoming general election on November 7 , 2006 .
Nev. Rev. Stat. 293.740 ( 1 ) ( a ) , which is no longer good law , states :
[ I]t is unlawful inside a polling place or within 100 feet from the entrance to the building or other structure in which a polling place is located : ( a ) For any person to solicit a vote or speak to a voter on the subject of marking his ballot .
New Hampshire
New Hampshire law prohibits people from interfering with or intimidating voters at a polling place or doing anything that would reveal someone ’s marked ballot .
This means you cannot take pictures of your ballot or anyone else ’s ballot , or videotape yourself or anyone else in the process of casting a vote .
Aside from these restrictions , you cannot take pictures , videotape , or interview voters in any way that would be perceived as interfering with or intimidating voters .
Much of this is a judgment call left to county boards of election , so the specific restrictions at a polling place will vary from county to county .
New Jersey
New Jersey law prohibits more than one person from entering a polling booth , or for anybody to reveal their marked ballot to another person .
These prohibitions mean that you cannot film or photograph another person as he is marking his ballot in the voting booth , and you cannot film or photograph your own marked ballot .
New Jersey also prohibits any loitering , interference , electioneering , or solicitation of any voters .
This means any photography or filming that occurs within the polling place can be stopped if it is judged to violate any of these restrictions .
Each county board of election makes its own regulations , which will vary from county to county .
For instance , Essex County prohibits all photography and videotaping completely , even for the media , but will allow exit polling by credentialed groups .
New Mexico
New Mexico law generally prohibits those who are not voting from approaching the polling place within 50 feet , from willfully blocking the entrance to a polling place , or from disrupting or interfering with the conduct of the election .
The media is allowed inside a polling place to photograph and film , as long as those actions do not interfere with voting or indicate how a voter is voting .
Specific guidelines for who constitutes the media and what non-media individuals are allowed to do are made on a county by county basis , so you should contact your county clerk for details .
New York
New York law prohibits voting booths from being occupied by more than one person .
It also prohibits voters from memorializing anything that occurs within the booth and prohibits voters from showing or asking others to show them the contents of a marked ballot .
Under these laws , no photography or video recording can occur within the voting booth .
Outside of the voting booth but within the polling place , what activities are allowed will vary from county to county .
In some counties , the media is allowed access in order to film , photograph , or conduct exit polls .
For this media access , you must fax in a letter of interest with your contact info to get an exit letter , which will give access to a polling site to non-voters .
Check with your county to find out what qualifies you as media and what non-media are allowed to do within a polling place .
North Carolina
The North Carolina law bearing any relation to photographing or videoing around polling places is titled “ Limitation on activity in the voting place and in a buffer zone around it . ”
N.C.G.S.A. § 163-166.4 .
This law makes unlawful activities that “ hinder access , harass others , distribute campaign literature , place political advertising , solicit votes , or otherwise engage in electionrelated activity in the voting place or in a buffer zone which shall be prescribed by the county board of elections around the voting place . ”
This law does not explicitly mention filming or photography , and these activities may be lawful so long as they are not done in a harassing manner .
However , North Carolina may be particularly in flux regarding the issue of observing people at polling places .
In 1998 , the North Carolina Attorney General issued an advisory opinion that polling place observers appointed by political parties should not use video cameras .
1998 N.C. AG LEXIS 43 , October 22 , 1998 .
This same opinion noted that use of video cameras by the news media was appropriate .
However , this opinion was issued 8 years ago , and relies in part on statutes that are no longer law ( §§ 163- 135 through 163- 159 , labeled “ General Instructions , ” were repealed in 2002 ) .
According to Sec. 4.1 of the Raleigh municipal code ( http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=10312&sid=33), they follow the North Carolina state voting laws with only one except relating to campaign expense regulation .
North Dakota
The relevant section of North Dakota law ( http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t161c04.pdf) only prohibits commercial activity at polling places .
ND ST 16.1-10-06.2 .
This law disallows approaching people entering or inside a polling place for the purposes of “ of selling , soliciting for sale , advertising for sale , or distributing any merchandise , product , literature , or service . ”
Ohio
Ohio ’s Revised Code has a few restrictions on activity at polling places .
R.C. § 3501.35 .
Specifically , “ no person ” should :
(1) Loiter , congregate , or engage in any kind of election campaigning within the area between the polling place and the small flags of the United States placed on the thoroughfares and walkways leading to the polling place , and if the line of electors waiting to vote extends beyond those small flags , within ten feet of any elector in that line ; ( 2 ) In any manner hinder or delay a [ voter ] in reaching or leaving the place fixed for casting the elector ’s ballot ; ( 5 ) Solicit or in any manner attempt to influence any [ voter ] in casting the [ voter ] ’s vote .
( B ) Except as otherwise provided in division ( C ) of section 3503.23 of the Revised Code , no person who is not an election official , employee , observer , or police officer shall be allowed to enter the polling place during the election , except for the purpose of voting or assisting another person to vote as provided in section 3505.24 of the Revised Code .
( C ) No more [ voters ] shall be allowed to approach the voting shelves at any time than there are voting shelves provided . ”
These prohibitions do not explicitly extend to filming or photography , and these activities may be lawful so long as they are not done in a harassing manner that does not appear to coerce voters or hinder their physical access to the polling place .
Note that members of the press probably do not have to abide by these restrictions .
See Beacon Journal Publishing Co. , Inc. v. Blackwell , 389 F.3d 683 ( 6th Cir. 2004 ) ( allowing injunction preventing enforcement of R.C. § 3501.35 against “ members of the press . ” )
Whether citizen journalists such as bloggers must abide by these rules is not clear .
The Columbus city code ( http://www.ordlink.com/codes/columbus/maintoc.htm) does not add to these prohibitions .
Oklahoma
Oklahoma ’s state code allows “ reporters and photographers ” access to the interior of polling places for up to five minutes .
26 Okl.St.Ann. § 7-112 ( http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78549).
This access cannot “ interfere with voters or election officials ” and reporters and photographers cannot observe or photograph the actual marking of ballots .
Oklahama also prohibits “ electioneering ” within 300 feet of a ballot box , and no person can within 50 feet of a ballot box .
26 Okl.St.Ann. § 7-108 ( http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78549).
This prohibition extends to print material , none of which can be “ publicly placed or exposed within three hundred ( 300 ) feet of any ballot box , while an election is in progress . ”
26 Okl.St.Ann. § 7-108 ( http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78549).
Oklahoma also allows misdemeanor criminal sanctions against any pollster who is within 50 feet of a ballot box while an election is in progress .
26 Okl.St.Ann. § 7-108.3 ( http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=439348).Nothing in Oklahoma City ’s Municipal Code adds to these laws .

Oregon
Laws
1. Or. Rev. Stat. § 260.695 ( 2006 ) governs “ Prohibitions relating to voting in elections conducted by mail or at polling place . ”
This statute provides a long list of things you ca n’t do .
It generally prohibits interference with voting at a polling place or improper influence of a voter there .
For example , you cannot
– “ examine or attempt to examine [ another ] person ’s ballot , ” subsection ( 8 )
– “ obstruct an entrance of a building in which a polling place is located , ” subsection ( 2 )
– “ remove a ballot from any polling place , ” subsection ( 15 )
– In addition , “ No person shall show the person ’s own marked or punched ballot to another person to reveal how it was marked or punched . ” subsection ( 9 )
These rules apparently apply to absentee voting as well as at a polling place .
The statute does not explicitly mention , or ban , photography at a polling place .
2. Or. Rev. Stat. § 260.715 ( 2006 ) governs “ Prohibitions relating to voting and ballots . ”
None of them involve photographing a ballot .
3. Salem Revised Code , Title I ( Government ) , Chapter 11 ( Elections ) lists a number of “ unlawful acts ” that relate to fraud .
Nothing related to photography .
Observations
Overall , the Oregon state and local statutes do not explicit prohibit photography , for the reason that it does not seem to be contemplated .
It might technically not be illegal for a blogger to take a picture inside his polling place with his cameraphone , or to take a picture of her unpunched ballot , as long as she does not disrupt the polling .
The main risk , under this legal framework , seems to where if the photography or video recording disrupts polling , captures confidential voter choices , or displays one ’s own voter choices .
What attitude the Oregon pollworkers and government workers will take towards those with cameras could be another issue entirely .
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania has no explicit rules on photography , but there are strict rules about what you can do and how long you can stay in the voting booth .
The Pennsylvania statutes are incredibly detailed and mundane , and govern the smallest details of how the electoral process shall be carried out .
25 Penn. Stat. § 3057 .
Time allowed elector in voting booth or voting machine compartment
No elector shall remain in a voting compartment or voting machine booth an unreasonable length of time , and , in no event , for more than three minutes , and if he shall refuse to leave after said period , he shall be removed by the election officers : Provided , however , That they may grant him a longer time if other electors are not waiting to vote .
25 Penn. Stat . § 3060 lays out “ Regulations in force at polling places . ”
These are mostly your run -of - the - mill regulations ( no soliciting votes , no flyers posted up in the polling place .. ) .
No explicit prohibition of cameras .
The most applicable subsections are as follows :
Subsection ( a ) : You are only allowed in the polling place outside of the “ enclosed space ” at any primary or election unless you a voter awaiting your turn to vote – and not more than ten voters at a time [ or you are a “ watcher ” or a police officer , but that ’s irrelevant ] .
Subsection ( d ) : You have to remain 10 feet distant from the polling place unless you are a “ person in the course of voting ” or are helping run the thing .
( “ All persons , except election officers , clerks , machine inspectors , overseers , watchers , persons in the course of voting , persons lawfully giving assistance to voters , and peace and police officers , when permitted by the provisions of this act , must remain at least ten ( 10 ) feet distant from the polling place during the progress of the voting . ” )
Subsection ( f ) : Whoever is in charge of the voting ( “ the judge of the election ” ) may call upon any constable , deputy constable , police officer or other peace officer to aid him in the performance of his duties under this section .
25 Penn. Stat . § 2602 , Definitions uses “ elector ” is a synonym for “ voter . ” § 2602 explains that “ watcher ” has a very narrow and specific definition and does not mean any media observer .
( “ Each candidate for nomination or election at any election shall be entitled to appoint two watchers for each election district in which such candidate is voted for . ” )
§ 3054 indicates that the “ enclosed space ” is roughly the inside of the polling place , containing the voting compartments or voting machines .
Rhode Island
Rhode Island has switched over to optical scan voting machines , and have measures in place to make sure there ’s no fraud .
§ 17-19 -21 . Arrangement of polling places –Election officials –Police officers . “ ( b ) .
One bipartisan pair of supervisors , the clerk , and the warden shall be stationed , in that order , along the guard rail so that a voter desiring to cast a ballot will pass first in front of the bipartisan pair , then in front of the clerk , and finally in front of the warden .
A second bipartisan pair shall be stationed within the guard rail and shall be available to relieve the first bipartisan pair or the clerk , and to assist voters within the limits prescribed by this title .
The second bipartisan pair , when not engaged in the preceding duties , shall watch the voters in and about the voting equipment and shall call to the attention of the warden any violation , or circumstance suggesting a violation , of the provisions of this title . ”
Suggests that they want people to be watching you vote at all times .
Might not be easy , practically , to take a picture .
§ 17-19 -23 . Wardens and supervisors –Powers and duties .
“ The wardens shall : … (9 ) Cause to be removed or arrested any person or official who commits a violation of the election law in their presence or disturbs the conduct of the voting ; provided , that they shall not cause any removal or arrest without the approval of the election inspector , unless the clerk agrees with the wardens that the person or official should be arrested or removed ”
Nothing on point about cameras .
South Carolina
Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976 § 7-13-130 , § 7-13-740 , § 7-13-760 provide for mundane details such as the dimensions of a voting booth and the materials with which they are constructed — not useful .
Only concern seems to be that a voter be alone in the booth and not talk to anyone else while he / she is inside .
City codes available on link from < http://www.columbiasc.net/?pageid=13>http://www.columbiasc.net/?pageid=13 ( on municode.com ) .
They do not regulate conduct at the polls .
Tennessee
The Tennessee Election Code can be found in Title 2 of the Tennessee Code .
Interestingly , Tenn . Code Ann. § 2-7-103 explicitly says that “ (a ) No person may be admitted to a polling place while the procedures required by this chapter are being carried out except election officials , voters , persons properly assisting voters , the press , poll watchers appointed under § 2 - 7- 104 and others bearing written authorization from the county election commission . ”
So I guess the answer to our questions really comes back to the questions of whether bloggers are “ the press ” or not .
Texas
The Texas elections code ( which can be browsed at < http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/el.toc.htm>http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/el.toc.htm ) has nothing directly on point prohibiting the use of recording equipment by voters .
But section 33.051 ( c ) of that code does prevent election “ watchers ” from using any equipment to record sounds or images at the polling place .
A watcher is defined as “ a person appointed under this subchapter to observe the conduct of an election on behalf of a candidate , a political party , or the proponents or opponents of a measure . ”
In general , watchers are allowed to “ be present at the voting station when a voter is being assisted by an election officer , and the watcher is entitled to examine the ballot before it is deposited in the ballot box to determine whether it is prepared in accordance with the voter ’s wishes . ” ( section 33.057 ) .
Watchers are not allowed to “ ( 1 ) converse with an election officer regarding the election , except to call attention to an irregularity or violation of law ; ( 2 ) converse with a voter ; or ( 3 ) communicate in any manner with a voter regarding the election . ” ( section 33.058 ) .
I am not sure how the rights and prohibitions of these watchers may interact with what our bloggers may want to do .
While I ca n’t say if bloggers can photograph their own experience , it looks like they ca n’t stick around and video / photo and interview others inside the polling places .
Section 61.001 ( a ) of the Election Code makes it a Class C misdemeanor to be a “ bystander ” that is actually inside the polling place .
More seriously , § 61.006 says it is a felony of the following occurs “ ( a ) A person commits an offense if the person was in a polling place for any purpose other than voting and knowingly communicates to another person information that the person obtained at the polling place about how a voter has voted . ”
This sounds like you ca n’t ask people how they voted and blog about it if you interviewed them inside .
Also , you ca n’t “ loiter ” within 100 feet of the polling place .
Actually , all the Texas stuff is summarized pretty aptly by the following web site .
It basically concludes that “ The bright line rule seems to be no reporter or photographer in the ” polling place , arguably the area defined by the registration desk , the voting booths , and the ballot box .
Outside of that , photographers can take pictures from outside into the polling area so long as it does not reveal someone else ’s vote or indicates to a voter in the polling place how to vote ( Texas Election Code Section 61.008 ) , and interviews just outside the polling place that do not involve electioneering are probably okay as well . ”
Utah
The Utah Election Code can be found in Title 20 A of the Utah code ( can be searched here ) .
It has nothing on point , but Utah Code Ann . § 20A -3-501 says “ ( 2 ) ( a ) A person may not , within a polling place or in any public area within 150 feet of the building where a polling place is located :
( i ) do any electioneering ;
( ii ) circulate cards or handbills of any kind ;
( iii ) solicit signatures to any kind of petition ; or
( iv ) engage in any practice that interferes with the freedom of voters to vote or disrupts the administration of the polling place . ”
So as far as interviews go , bloggers might want to keep their interviews 150 feet away , especially since the same section of the law goes on to say that no municipality can prevent you from electioneering or the like if you ’re more than 150 feet away .
But as far as recording your own experience , nothing at all seems to be on point .
Wisconsin
No . ( per Nov. 2 telephone conversation with representative from the Wisconsin election commission – there is no formal legislation about this and therefore is a decision made by the election board . )
Wyoming
No .
( per telephone conversation on November 2 with Debbie Latrop of the elections commission of Wyoming – the decision is made by the board and their decision making authority over this issue is governed by the statute regarding “ disturbing the polling place ” WY Code 22-15-109 ( c ) ) .
Vermont
Vermont election law does not address the issue of photography or videography in polling places .
However , the “ Media Guide to Vermont Elections ” on the website of the Vermont Secretary of State makes the following statement :
“ Every stage of the election process in Vermont is public .
The media and the public have the right to be present and observe the election ; however the presiding officer can set rules for administration of the election as provided by VT election law . ”
Given the scarcity of information on media involvement in the election law , it is unclear what kind of restrictions the presiding officer would be authorized to make .
It is similarly unclear whether “ the right to be present and observe the election ” includes a right to take photographs .
The “ Media Guide ” also notes that “ Pictures should not be taken of voters putting ballots into the ballot box ( voters are guaranteed privacy of their votes ) . ”
Read literally , this might bar a voter from photographing her or his own ballot .
However , it seems that the stated purpose of the regulation — to guarantee voter privacy — would not be applicable when photographing one ’s own ballot .
Finally , in regards to exit polling and interviewing , the “ Media Guide ” provides that “ Exit polls must be taken outside the polling place .
”
http://vermont-elections.org/elections1/2006MediaGuidetoElections90406.pdf
Virginia
Va. Code § 24.2-604( J ) : “ The officers of election shall permit representatives of the news media to visit and film or photograph inside the polling place for a reasonable and limited period of time while the polls are open .
However , the media ( i ) shall comply with the restrictions in subsections A and D of this section ; ( ii ) shall not film or photograph any person who specifically asks the media representative at that time that he not be filmed or photographed ; ( iii ) shall not film or photograph the voter or the ballot in such a way that divulges how any individual voter is voting ; and ( iv ) shall not film or photograph the voter list or any other voter record or material at the precinct in such a way that it divulges the name or other information concerning any individual voter .
Any interviews with voters , candidates or other persons , live broadcasts , or taping of reporters ’ remarks , shall be conducted outside of the polling place and the prohibited area .
The officers of election may require any person who is found by a majority of the officers present to be in violation of this subsection to leave the polling place and the prohibited area . ”
Virginia ’s election laws allows the media to access the polling place for reporting purposes .
It is unclear from the law whether bloggers would qualify as “ representatives of the news media ” Taken literally , section ( iii ) would prevent a voter from taking a photograph of her or his own ballot , because doing so would “ divulge [ ] how any individual voter is voting . ”
However , seeing as the apparent purpose of the law is to protect voter privacy , it seems unlikely that it would be applied to people who choose to reveal their own individual votes .
Interviews and exit polls must be conducted outside of the polling place and the “ prohibited area , ” which under Va. Code § 24.2-604 ( A ) is within “ 40 feet of any entrance of any polling place . ”
Washington
Neither the Washington election laws nor the state ’s election website provide any information about media access to the polling place .
My attempts to get answers from state officials were unsuccessful .
West Virginia
West Virginia election law forbids anyone except for election officers or voters from coming within 300 feet of the polling place :
“ Except as otherwise provided in this section , no person , other than the election officers and voters going to the election room to vote and returning therefrom , may be or remain within three hundred feet of the outside entrance to the building housing the polling place while the polls are open . ”
W. Va. Code , § 3-1-37(a)
Thus any interviews or exit polls would need to be conducted outside of that range .
Neither the statute nor the state ’s website have anything to say about photography in the polling place , but W. Va. Code , § 3 -1-37 ( d ) limits voting time to five minutes , so all photography should be done quickly .
today I was walking to a neighbors house to get into a sword fight with them , since they have been a pain ever since they moved in 3 months ago .
All day they play their music really loud and are constantly screaming and fighting .
I over the past 3 months i have called the cops on them 5 times and had a screaming match with them 50 times .
So today i finally had it , I went to the bathroom and grabbed my sword and rushed out of the house and headed over for a fight .
But as i was rushing there , i tripped over and landed flat on my face .
As i got up , I was dazed really bad , but i saw a figure in front of me , and just as i realized it was jesus it disappeared .
That should i do ?
Is this a sign that what I was doing was the work of god ?
Or was that Jesus who stopped me from getting into a sword fight ?
Can someone who is well versed in things like this please help me fast .
The violence by bandit groups was so bad when he was young that his parents sent him to live with his grandmother in the nearby city of Valledupar , near the Venezuelan border .
He returned at age 16 with a high school degree and got a job teaching reading to schoolchildren .
By the time he was in his 20s , Colombia ’s long internal war had drawn paramilitary bands to the lawless marshlands and hills surrounding La Gloria , leading to clashes with guerrillas and intimidation of the local population by both groups .
Into that violence , which has since ebbed , Mr. Soriano ventured with his donkeys , taking with him a few reading textbooks , encyclopedia volumes and novels from his small personal library .
At stops along the way , children still await the teacher in groups , to hear him read from the books he brings before they can borrow them .
A breakthrough came several years ago when he heard excerpts over the radio of a novel , “ The Ballad of Maria Abdala , ” by Juan Gossaín , a Colombian journalist and writer .
Mr. Soriano wrote a letter to the author , asking him to lend a copy of the book to the Biblioburro .
After Mr. Gossaín broadcast details of Mr. Soriano ’s project on his radio program , book donations poured in from throughout Colombia .
A local financial institution , Cajamag , provided some financing for the construction of a small library next to his home , but the project remains only half - finished for lack of funds .
There is little money left over for such luxuries on his teacher ’s salary of $ 350 a month .
Already the family ’s budget is so tight that he and his wife , Diana , opened a small restaurant , La Cosa Política , two years ago to help make ends meet .

The Measure of a President
During the Presidential campaign , much has been made of Barack Obama ’s slender physique , with some commentators going so far as to argue that he is too thin for most Americans to relate to him .
Does candidate height and weight play a role in electoral success ?
With Mr. Obama and John McCain set to square off in the second of three presidential debates tomorrow , it seemed worth taking a look through recent history .
An earlier version of this chart incorrectly identified attributes for Jimmy Carter , Thomas E. Dewey and John W. Davis .
The correct heights and weights appear below .
DIGG THIS
If America were a laissez faire economy , it would be impossible to create the financial bubble we have just experienced .
Critics of President Bush as well as some pundits in the media claim that deregulation and our " laissez faire " economy have been responsible for the financial markets ’ meltdown .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Here ’s what President Bush recently told a visiting group of journalists in the Oval Office about the recent $ 700 billion bailout package :
" We might have done nothing .
That would have been utter ruin .
Instead , we met the situation with proposals to private business and to Congress of the most gigantic program of defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic .
We put it into action . "
You may be wondering how our grammatically challenged president came up with such an articulate response to a question about his administration ’s reaction to the financial crisis .
Well , the above was not uttered by Bush but by another president who has been vilified by historians and others as a " do nothing " president , Herbert Hoover .
Hoover accepted the Republican nomination for president in 1932 to seek another term in the midst of the financial meltdown that engulfed the United States more than 75 years ago ; he made the above remarks in accepting his party ’s presidential nomination .
The historical record is clear , according to the late economist and historian Murray Rothbard in his classic America ’s Great Depression .
Hoover intervened massively in the economy from the time of the stock market crash in October 1929 up until he left office in March 1933 .
Easy money policies
As Rothbard documents in his 1963 study , the financial bubble of the 1920s was caused by the Federal Reserve ’s easy money policy that pumped up real estate and stock market prices .
When the bubble burst in 1929 , Hoover did all he could to prop up prices in the name of stability and recovery .
All his efforts failed .
The economy continued to spiral downward .
Hoover ’s legacy was sealed .
However , court historians and mainstream economists have been blaming Hoover ’s " inaction " for nearly eight decades instead of his big government policies that turned a much needed correction into a full - scale panic and massive depression .
If America were a laissez faire economy ( and limited government society ) , it would be impossible to create the financial bubble we have just experienced .
For example , in a laissez faire economy , the federal government would not be able to subsidize housing for families who could not afford mortgages .
In addition , there would be no government - created entities like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that could buy subprime mortgages from banks .
And banks would not be forced by laws such as the Community Reinvestment
Act to lower lending standards for low - income families , many of whom are now defaulting on their mortgages .
So history is repeating itself in terms of the cause and effects of another Federal Reserve - created bubble .
How do we end once and for all the booms and busts that have characterized the American economy for decades ?
First , a laissez faire economy would end the moral hazard of the financial system and the mortgage market .
In a laissez faire economy , banks would not be able to borrow short and lend long , creating a huge amount of leverage in the banking system .
There would be no FDIC , which means depositors would have to be vigilant about how their banks are lending their money .
Banks therefore would extend credit only to the lowest - risk borrowers so depositors would have confidence in uninsured banks , knowing that depositors would not tolerate lax lending practices .
Second , in a laissez faire economy there would be no barriers for entrepreneurs to enter the banking business as there are today .
More competition would mean stronger banks .
Wal - Mart or other enterprises could enter the banking business and compete against the entrenched subsidized financial elites .
No central banks
Third , in a laissez faire economy , there would be no central bank like the Federal Reserve that could print money out of thin air and manipulate interest rates to ridiculously low levels .
Instead , interest rates would be set by savers and borrowers , not by the actions of a few unelected members of the Fed ’s open market committee .
In a laissez faire economy , inflation would be abolished because the dollar would once again be as " good as gold . "
All dollars therefore would be convertible into real money .
With both McCain and Obama voting for the bailout bill , there is indeed virtually no difference between the GOP and Democratic presidential standard bearers .
They are both subservient to the financial elites who influence the federal government ’s policy agenda .
Make no mistake , we still have one - party rule in D.C. , the Washington Party , an observation I made in 1971 , when another Republican president , Richard Nixon , turned his back on limited government principles and imposed wage - and - price controls and severed the last link between the dollar and gold .

Everything possible is done to prevent the fraud of the monetary system from being exposed to the masses who suffer from it .
~ Rep. Ron Paul , TX , before the U.S. House of Representatives , February 15 , 2006
The gold standard did not collapse .
Governments abolished it in order to pave the way for inflation .
~ Ludwig von Mises , The Theory of Money and Credit , 1953
The quotes from Paul and Mises are political heresy , yet they hint at why government crises have long dominated the headlines .
Why does n't the public understand this ?
Libertarians often observe that government does n't work , but clearly , it does some things right or those statements would be conventional knowledge .
Put another way , why is the idea of sound money so foreign to most people ?
Why do they trust the state 's inflatable notes and the inflationist in charge of them , then wonder why the economy blows up ?
Given its record , why do they trust the state at all ?
Year in and year out , government schools produce students who either ( a ) could care less about monetary issues , or ( b ) have state - approved ideas of them .
Government crop management weeds out potential trouble - makers .
What is inflation ?
In the mid-Sixties , I was aware of none of this .
But having read about gold in Atlas Shrugged , I decided to find out something about inflation and wrote to the Treasury Department to request a brochure that purported to lay it out in terms anyone could understand .
In reply , they sent me a Peanuts comic book .
Though I did n't know it at the time , using cartoon stars to promote government viewpoints was nothing new .
In 1942 , Treasury had commissioned Walt Disney to produce a film called The New Spirit in which Donald Duck 's radio tells him it is ' your privilege , not just your duty , but your privilege to help your government by paying your tax and paying it promptly . '
The following year the government revoked that ' privilege ' and imposed withholding , a temporary measure to see the country through The Good War that killed an estimated 73 million people , over half of whom were non-combatants .
Like Donald
Duck a generation earlier , the Peanuts gang attempted to charm people into the state 's bed .
Inflation , you see , was a rise in prices , and if we want robust economic growth and low unemployment , some inflation is necessary .
It was only bad if it got out of hand .
But we need n't worry because here in the USA we were privileged to have an agency called the Federal Reserve ready to pounce on inflation if it got too high or too low .
Charlie Brown and company were singing the same tune as my 1968 Alchian & Allen economics textbook , which states flatly that ' Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices . ' [ p. 649 ] World War II was the Good War , withholding was temporary , moderate inflation is a good thing , even if , at 3 percent , the dollar loses half its value in 14 years .
God 's in his heaven , all 's right with the world .
Hazlitt and Mises
A little later I descended into the catacombs of dissent and discovered authors no one ever talked about , such as Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises .
In particular , I found this astonishing claim on page one of Hazlitt 's What You Should Know About Inflation :
. . . the plain truth is our political leaders have brought on inflation by their own money and fiscal policies .
They are promising to fight with their right hand the conditions brought on with their left .
Inflation , always and everywhere , is primarily caused by an increase in the supply of money and credit .
In fact , inflation is the increase in the supply of money and credit .
Hazlitt was saying our leaders were in the business of manufacturing money .
Later on he said the cure for inflation was to stop inflating .
' It is as simple as that . '
Zero inflation , as measured by the money supply , not prices , was the ideal condition .
Given what I knew about government , here was an explanation that made sense , and I mentioned it in a conversation I had with an engineer friend .
' The government is in complete control of inflation , ' I said , ' because it controls the money supply .
It creates inflation by printing money . '
He looked askance .
' The government prints money ?
That does n't sound right .
As much as I distrust government , I can't believe they 'd try something like that .
Not as a policy , at least . '
This was during the late 1960s , the guns and butter years of the Johnson administration , when Vietnam and the Great Society were bleeding people literally and financially , when few books challenged the status quo on money and banking .
No authoritative voice condemned the government for inflating the money supply to pay for the slaughter overseas and the handouts at home .
Inflation was a topic of discussion only because goods and services started to cost more , and blame for that , of course , was placed on business and labor , not government .
When seen only as a rise in prices , inflation not only shields the guilty , it places them in the role of the people 's champion .
Even Mises , in his classic The Theory of Money and Credit , avoided using the term ' inflation ' and talked instead about inflationism :
Inflationism is that monetary policy that seeks to increase the quantity of money .
Further on , he said it would be ' highly dangerous ' to use the word ' inflation ' in a theoretical book such as his because the precise definition of the term is far different than 'its meaning in everyday discussions of currency policy . ' [ p. 240 ]
That brought my inquiries to a temporary close .
I engaged myself with other interests and forgot Hazlitt , Mises , and the countless Keynesians of the world .
Let the professional economists fight it out .
I had a decent day job and a programmer 's subroutine library I was marketing , not to mention twin daughters I was helping to raise .
Besides , Greenspan became
Fed chairman in 1987 , and who better to serve in that post than a man who cherishes free markets and the gold standard ?
Discovering Rothbard
Then sometime in the 1990s , I read Murray Rothbard 's What Has Government Done to Our Money ?
Rothbard filled in the gaps .
He discussed how money emerged from barter economies , how banks came into being and began loaning out its depositors ' money without their knowledge ; how government , always hungry for revenue , came to the aid of the banks whenever their depositors lined up demanding their money , allowing bankers to suspend specie payment , sometimes for years , while letting the banks remain in business .
He talked about how the government imposed a central bank on the economy to safeguard the bankers ' racket of fractional reserve banking , which most of the world accepts as normal and uncontroversial , and how the central bank , as the monopolist in control of the money supply , could ' buy ' government securities in the manner of a child playing make - believe , with money created out of thin air , and that the government could use this money to do whatever furthered its interests .
Inflation , he said , was legal counterfeiting .
As it turns out , legal counterfeiting is indispensable for maintaining the state 's health .
In The Case Against the Fed , Rothbard explains :
As luck would have it , the new Federal Reserve System coincided with the outbreak of World War I in Europe , and it is generally agreed that it was only the new system that permitted the U.S. to enter the war and to finance both its own war effort and massive loans to the allies ; roughly , the Fed doubled the money supply of the U.S. during the war and prices doubled in consequence .
For those who believe that U.S. entry into World War I was one of the most disastrous events for the U.S. and for Europe in the twentieth century , the facilitating of U.S. entry into the war is scarcely a major point in favor of the Federal Reserve . [ 120 ]
Rothbard 's Wall Street , Banks , and American Foreign Policy covers this episode much further , explaining how ' World War I came as a godsend ' for the financially - troubled Morgan empire and how the Morgan - dominated Fed played a crucial role by creating the money needed to keep the slaughter going and the profits rolling .
The era of Greenspan
Well , that was then , but we had Greenspan running the Fed now , and was n't he trying to manage the monetary system as if we were still on the gold standard ?
In the years since his insightful defense of gold , Greenspan had fallen in love with political power .
Commenting on Greenspan 's nomination as Fed chairman , Rothbard noted that
Greenspan 's real qualification is that he can be trusted never to rock the establishment 's boat .
He has long positioned himself in the very middle of the economic spectrum .
. .
[ H ]e wants moderate deficits and tax increases , and will loudly worry about inflation as he pours on increases in the money supply .
What did Greenspan actually do during his tenure ?
By the close of 2001 , he had increased the money supply by $ 4.5 trillion as measured by the late M3 , more than twice the amount of all other Fed chairmen combined ( according to Bonner and Wiggin ) .
In late 2002 , Nobel laureate Milton Friedman praised Greenspan for having ' the best record of any Fed chairman in history . '
Friedman , the alleged champion of free markets , blamed the Great Depression on the Fed for not printing enough money and for not forbidding bank runs .
No one ever complained of insufficient ' accommodation ' under Greenspan 's watch , and it's no surprise that a man who saw inflationism as a necessary element of a modern economy had such praise for Greenspan 's printing press .
Innocent blunder or great hoax ?
In a speech on December 19 , 2002 , Greenspan admitted the CPI had gone ballistic in the half - century following Roosevelt 's gold confiscation order , but in recent decades central bankers had shown they could ' contain the forces of inflation ' by maintaining more ' prudent ' monetary policies .
If we should wonder about all those trillions flying off the presses during the 1990s , it was justified by the ' New Economy , ' in which globalization and information technology would create permanent gains in productivity much like electricity had done during the early decades of the 20th Century .
For almost a decade , the technology - dominated NASDAQ index offered living proof of this proposition , soaring from 500 in April 1991 to 5,132 in March 2000 .
Most importantly , the New Economy , with its innovative inventory and productivity management , had seemingly eliminated the boom ' bust cycle , the demon that had haunted capitalism [ p. 188 ] since the advent of the Industrial Revolution .
For the first time ever , the good times were here to stay .
Given the train wrecks piling up on the financial landscape and the current massive bailout proposal , it 's clear that once again many people have been seduced by the Fed 's fairy dust .
In December 1996 , Greenspan worried his party guests were behaving with irrational exuberance , but people imbibing cheap credit have never been paragons of restraint .
Greenspan 's wanton inflationism funded today 's mess .
No inflation , no crisis ' it 's as simple as that .
Re-seeding the crop
But this is a minority viewpoint .
Few people in the MSM see this crisis as the outcome of Fed inflationism .
Why ?
Sixty years ago , Garet Garrett wrote :
There is a long history of monetary experience .
It tells us that government is at heart a counterfeiter and therefore cannot be trusted to control money , and that this is true of both autocratic and popular government .
The record has been cumulative since the invention of money .
Nevertheless it is not believed .
[ my emphasis ]
It 's as if ' monetary delusions are , by some strange law of folly , recurring and incurable , ' he says .
When sound money was in use , its supply was limited ' by nature and economic law , not by government planners .
For that reason , the state abolished it and stuck us with a money they can create at will .
The state 's money removes the idea of limited means , and since it 's controlled by the state , it removes the idea of limiting the state .
Given the federal influence on education , media , and just about everything , should we be surprised no one is on center stage calling the government a counterfeiter ?
But exposing the fraud , as Garrett said , results in disbelief .
People can handle corruption .
The fiat money ' central banking system we 're under is an insidious form of enslavement .
That sounds too much like a government conspiracy , which the public has been taught to marginalize if not outright reject .
Then there are those who see the damage counterfeiting causes but claim the reason is the Fed 's sin of being privately - owned , discounting the government 's role in appointing the FOMC voting majority and other aspects of the system .
They call for moving the printing presses to some pristine government agency responsible to elected officials , as if we would be better off if the Fed were run like the SEC , FDA , or FEMA .
Perhaps the severity of this crisis , as government ' solutions ' become more nakedly larcenous , will move people to search out the causes of the mess for themselves .
If so , they might start listening to Ron Paul .
From there , they might turn to the extensive literature of the Mises Institute or the many commentaries on Strike The Root and other libertarian websites .
Yes , it 's somewhat fantastic to imagine the public not acquiescing in whatever government does to them , but the Paulson proposal could act as a kind of shock therapy .
Now is the time for people to be asking :
How can we establish a system of sound money and free banking ?
The guys running the show certainly wo n't ask it for them .
People in the 1930s did n't have the Internet , and that is what today 's public must begin with if they want straight answers .
Just when you think that the bailout mania could not become any more absurd , a " conservative " mainstream economist enters the picture to up the ante of outright stupidity .
Martin Feldstein of Harvard , who once served as the chairman of President Reagan 's Council of Economic Advisors , had declared he has discovered the real secret of the current economic downturn : falling home prices !
Yes , just as the advisors to Hoover and FDR claimed that the Great Depression was caused by falling commodity and labor prices , Feldstein insists that falling home prices are bringing down the entire financial system .
Of course , no bad theory is complete without a harebrained scheme to accompany it , and Feldstein does not disappoint :
We need a firewall to break the downward spiral of house prices .
Here 's how it might work .
The federal government would offer any homeowner with a mortgage an opportunity to replace 20 % of the mortgage with a low - interest loan from the government , subject to a maximum of $ 80,000 .
This would be available to new buyers as well as those with mortgages .
The interest on that loan would reflect the government 's cost of funds and could be as low as 2 % .
The loan would not be secured by the house but would be a loan with full recourse , allowing the government to take other property or income in the unlikely event that the individual does not pay .
It would by law be senior to other unsecured debt and not eligible for relief in bankruptcy .
The individual could repay the loan at any time or could refinance the remaining loan on more favorable terms as long as the principal did not increase .
A 30 - year amortization of the government loan would make the payments low , and a life - insurance policy would protect taxpayers if the borrower dies before the loan is repaid .
If the homeowner chooses to accept the loan , creditors would have to accept the 20 % mortgage repayment , reducing the monthly payments of principal and interest by 20 % .
One of the real problems with the economic mainstream , even with those who claim to support free markets , is that they do not understand the simple equation of cause and effect , often confusing effect with cause .
It never occurs to Feldstein that a financial bubble is not a good thing , and the only way for a recovery to occur is for prices to fall back to levels that are commensurate with current economic fundamentals .
There is no other way .
Otherwise , we will see one bailout scheme after another , just as Hoover and Roosevelt destroyed the economy by trying to save it .
Associated Press calls McCain ' two- faced ' John Byrne
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This " John McCain embraces and expels Washington like an accordion player belting out a song , " the Associated Press ' Glen Johnson writes Wednesday .
" Squeeze in and he touts his vast knowledge of the capital city .
Draw out and he casts himself a reformer bent on changing its ways . "
Focusing on the tendency of McCain to try and straddle the Republican fence , the wire service leads with the headline , " McCain has 2 faces : Washington in - and outsider . "
" It 's a remarkable dichotomy echoed throughout the Republican establishment , " Johnson adds , " as a party that 's held the White House for the past eight years tries to retain its grip in what has shaped up as a change election .
None other than the current president 's brother has shown the GOP 's willingness to deny the past as it looks to the future . "
After several weeks focused on McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , some of the press seems to be turning their sights back on the Arizona senator .
For Johnson , at least , the light is n't terribly flattering .
He even mocks former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush .
He quotes Bush telling a McCain " is the right guy at the right time to make that happen . "
Retorts Johnson , " The Good Lord knows we need reform in Washington ? "
" Did George W. Bush disown his younger brother after that close call with the hanging chads in 2000 ?
Is Jeb harboring a grudge after those stories about how the Bush family expected him  not George  to follow their father as president ?
Did the Democrats control the White House for the past eight years , or both chambers of Congress for the first six of them ? "
" No , " he quips .
" Republicans did . "
He does credit McCain for challenging Congress on campaign finance and other " reform measures , " whose credentials were such that he could be thought of as bipartisan enough to be considered for the Democrats ' 2004 ticket .
Johnson pokes fun at McCain when speaking of his current running mate , saying that McCain is " the new capital tour guide " for Sarah Palin , quoting McCain : " I can't wait to introduce her to Washington , D.C. I can't wait . "

We are hearing some sense out of someone on the Fed .
Bloomberg is reporting Fed 's Fisher Says Bank Rescue Plan Would Worsen Fiscal ' Chasm '
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said the proposed $ 700 billion rescue of financial institutions backed by Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke would plunge the U.S. government deeper into a fiscal abyss .
The plan by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy troubled assets from financial institutions would put " one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal government ledger , " Fisher said today in the text of a speech in New York .
" We are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm . "
Fisher made the comments as the central bank expands its role in the biggest government intrusion into markets since the New Deal , with Bernanke trying to persuade Congress to approve Paulson 's bailout plan .
Bernanke has already cut the benchmark interest rate at the most aggressive pace in two decades , invoked emergency powers to loan to securities firms and pumped billions of dollars into banks to try to restore liquidity .
Also , the central bank loaned $ 85 billion this month to American International Group Inc .
" The seizures and convulsions we have experienced in the debt and equity markets have been the consequences of a sustained orgy of excess and reckless behavior , not a too - tight monetary policy , " Fisher said to the New York University Money Marketeers Club .
" I was , and I remain skeptical , that lowering the fed funds rate is the most effective antidote , " he said .
" Rates held too low , too long during the previous Fed regime were an accomplice to that reckless behavior . "

Here is the story as originally posted on Bloomberg :
" Sept. 25 ( Bloomberg ) -- Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said the proposed $ 700 billion rescue of financial institutions backed by Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke would plunge the U.S. government deeper into a fiscal abyss .
The plan by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy troubled assets from financial institutions would put ``one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal government ledger , '' Fisher said today in the text of a speech in New York .
``We are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm . ''
Now here is how it reads after " Update 1 "
" Sept. 25 ( Bloomberg ) -- Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said the U.S. Treasury 's proposed $ 700 billion rescue of financial institutions would be ``a critical first step ' ' toward calming markets even while adding to the U.S. government 's fiscal burden .
The plan by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy troubled assets from financial institutions ``is an incremental addition to the federal government ledger , '' Fisher said today in a speech in New York .
Existing federal obligations in Medicare and Social Security mean ``we are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm , '' he said . "
Hmmm .
The actual speech is here ; this is what it says :
" Even before tackling the task of cementing capital adequacy , we need to bear in mind that the TARP places one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal government ledger . "
The words " a critical first step " do not appear in the speech .
Anywhere .
The Bloomberg reporter made them up and removed his actual words about a camel 's back .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - A small Arctic gull has set a record as the bird most contaminated by two banned industrial pollutants , scientists said on Thursday .
Eggs of the ivory gull , which has a population of about 14,000 from Siberia to Canada , were found to have the highest known concentrations of PCBs , long used in products such as paints or plastics , and the pesticide DDT .
“ Environmental poisons are threatening ivory gulls , ” the Norwegian Polar Institute said in a statement of eggs collected off northern Norway and Russia .
“ Levels of PCB and DDT are higher in ivory gulls than in other Arctic seabirds . ”
The long - lasting chemicals , swept north by prevailing winds and currents from industrial centers , often end in the Arctic where they build up in fatty tissues of animals , fish and birds .
A 2001 U.N. convention outlawed most uses of 12 so - called persistent organic pollutants after the chemicals were found in the breast milk of Inuit women and in polar bears .
Levels of many of the “ dirty dozen ” in the Arctic have been falling .
“ Ivory gulls are top predators , that ’s a main reason why they have high levels of contaminants , ” said Hallvard Stroem , of the Polar Institute .
The gulls eat cod and other fatty fish and also scavenge dead seals or polar bears for a fat - charged diet .
“ We ’re not sure why the levels are higher than for other birds , ” he told Reuters , adding there were no known local sources of the pollutants to explain the high concentrations .
PCBs , at up to 0.02 percent of the egg weight , were comparable with those found in some polar bears 20 years ago .
Previous studies show that the chemical pollutants can have effects on birds such as shortening lifespans or thinning of eggshells .
Ivory gulls can live about 10 to 20 years .
The shrinking of Arctic sea ice in recent years , apparently because of global warming , also threatens the birds by reducing the size of their habitat .
The gulls feed most around the fringes of the ice , where fish and plankton thrive .
“ Climate change is an added stress -- the ivory gull is dependent on the sea ice , ” Stroem said .
The survey was carried out after reports that numbers of ivory gulls had plunged by 80 percent in Canada .
Stroem said population trends elsewhere were not clear .
Mr Mao's name , Xinyu , was given to him by his grandfather shortly before he died and means " new universe " .

MCCAIN’S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR ….
John McCain chatted with NPR this morning , and during the interview , the senator made a very odd remark about where he ’s turned for foreign policy advice .
NPR : Given what you ’ve said , senator , is there an occasion where you could imagine turning to Gov.
Palin for advice in a foreign policy crisis ?
McCain : I ’ve turned to her advice many times in the past .
I ca n’t imagine turning to Senator Obama or Senator Biden because they ’ve been wrong .
They were wrong about Iraq , wrong about Russia .
Obviously , this is silly .
But more importantly , I do n’t think McCain appreciates how much this undermines his own campaign ’s message .
For a year and a half , McCain , his aides , and his surrogates have insisted that McCain is an unrivaled expert when it comes to foreign policy and national security .
It ’s a bogus claim — McCain has been strikingly confused on international affairs throughout his campaign — but it ’s been the principal selling point of McCain ’s candidacy from the outset .
Talking to NPR , however , McCain tried out an entirely new line — he , the expert , turns to his novice running mate , who has no foreign policy experience at all , for advice .
In fact , he ’s already done so “ many times . ”
The campaign argument has been that voters can support the Republican ticket , knowing that McCain will be calling the shots , especially in his area of expertise .
Indeed , a month ago , one of McCain ’s top advisors announced , “ [ Palin is ] going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years , and most doctors think that he ’ll be around at least that long . ”
But this morning , McCain argued the exact opposite , insisting he ’s turned to her for advice .
This , despite the fact that , according to Palin , her most notable foreign policy experience is living in a state near other countries .
What is McCain thinking ?

This is a bit different than a recession , although we 'll likely have one of those as well .
A recession simply means that the economy stops growing for a little while .
Countries typically shake those off within 6 - 12 months or so .
What effect some of the largest banks in the world collapsing upon one another will have is as yet unknown , but public policy experts can't rule out the possibility that we 'll soon all be clad in leather clothes , wandering a sun-parched wasteland searching for petrol .
The experts also state that they can't discount the possibility that the survivors will envy the dead .
__If you 're an average Cracked reader ( statistics say you are ) then your " retirement savings " are an Xbox 360 and 6 games .
Those should hold their value fairly well until the electrical utilities crumble in late September .
But what if you 're a " high - net - worth Cracked reader " ( perhaps an Assistant Manager at Sunglass Hut ) , and have a few thousand dollars saved in a checking / savings account .
Although this amount is insured by the FDIC in the event your bank fails , there is a non-trivial chance that the FDIC is inadequately funded to insure all deposits at failed banks in the event of a financial meltdown related zombie outbreak .
With that in mind , the wisest course might appear to be to withdraw all your money immediately and stuff it into whatever it is you sleep on .
However by mid October , financial experts agree cash will be essentially worthless , after the United States Government collapses following the seizure of the capitol by a faction of lost and confused New Jersey separatists .
For that reason , I suggest you immediately convert your savings to hard goods .
You should purchase goods that will have a high intrinsic value in the World - To - Come .
Obvious suggestions include petrol , shotgun shells and hockey pads , but really anything that can be improvised into a weapon will be extremely valuable for bartering purposes .
Buying a case of double ended dildos now could be the smartest investment you ever make .

When she appeared for a candidate ’s forum in front of a room filled with unionized Alaskan electrical workers during her run for governor in early October 2006 , Sarah Palin was woefully unprepared .
When the union members grilled her on labor policy , Palin faltered .
Afterward , a furious Palin cursed in anger and berated her staff , recalled two former senior campaign aides who blamed her unwillingness to bone up on workplace issues for the blunder .
But just a few weeks later , when Palin jousted with her two main rivals during critical pre-election debates , she was much more at ease .
She distilled policy questions into simple answers and countered her opponents ’ attacks with verbal thrusts delivered with a sunny smile .
When one moderator asked what she would do if one of her unmarried daughters became pregnant , Palin had a ready answer , defending her antiabortion stance and deflecting the question toward her male rivals : “ I would choose life .
And I am confident you will be asking my opponents these same scenarios ? ”

During Palin ’s brief exposure to the high - stakes environment of political debates , she has unnerved both her handlers and her opponents .
At times she has been handicapped by her lax approach to learning the nuances of policy and state issues , but she has also projected a Reaganesque ability to offer up pithy answers and charm on camera .
“ The political landscape here is littered with people who have underestimated Sarah Palin , ” said Eric Croft , a former state representative who ran for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2006 and appeared with Palin during several early forums .
Palin ’s split - personality debate persona -- mirrored in her confident speech to the Republican convention in Minneapolis in early September and in a series of wobbly performances in recent television interviews -- poses a challenge for her Democratic opponent , Delaware Sen .
Joe Biden , as Thursday ’s nationally telecast vice presidential debate in St. Louis approaches .
Biden could face trouble , Alaskan political observers said , if he takes Palin too lightly .
But he also has to take care not to be overly aggressive against a candidate who radiates telegenic appeal .

“ She has a Reagan - like ability to win over audiences .
But for someone who cares about issues and facts , it was rather startling to see her gloss over important questions , ” said Andrew Halcro , an Alaska businessman who ran as an independent candidate for governor against Palin .
Biden , the garrulous Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman , is also at ease on camera and often showed his command of foreign policy issues and his flashing wit during a string of Democratic Party presidential primary debates in 2007 .
But he has stumbled before .
A debate gaffe ended his presidential hopes in August 1987 , when he used an anecdote about a family hampered by lack of economic opportunity -- without crediting the source , British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock .
For its part , Sen .
John McCain ’s campaign appears to be taking no chances that Palin will prepare properly .
It flew her Monday to McCain ’s Arizona ranch to cram with a coterie of the GOP presidential candidate ’s advisors .

As she began her run for governor of Alaska , Palin repeatedly proved difficult to prep for a debate , recalled her two former political aides , who had pivotal roles during her campaign but declined to be identified because of their continuing involvement in Alaska politics .
Palin , the former aides said , had a sharply limited attention span for absorbing the facts and policy angles required for all - topics debate preparation .
Staffers were rarely able to get her to sit for more than half an hour of background work at a time before her concentration waned , hindered by cellphone calls and family affairs .
“ We were always fighting for her attention , ” said one of the aides .
In mid-October 2006 , Palin ’s staffers saw their worries justified in the first political forum of the campaign season , an event at Anchorage ’s 49 Supper Club , where candidates unveiled their stump speeches before a room filled with political players .
The former Wasilla mayor breezed through an upbeat speech about “ taking back Alaska ” but struggled during a question - and - answer session .
“ To her credit , she gave a lot of ‘ I do n’t knows , ’ ” one former aide recalled .
“ But it was clear she did n’t start out with a great range of knowledge about Alaskan affairs . ”

In the weeks that followed , Palin ’s senior campaign aides took care not to let her repeat the dismal performance .
“ I was always frustrated because 30 minutes before game time , I ’d want to say , ‘ Let ’s turn off the phone and lock the door .
And please calm down , ’ ” one of her former aides said .
But as time went on , Palin increasingly managed to zero in on the policy issues set before her during debate preparations , and her comfort level rose dramatically .
During two final debates broadcast by Alaska public television and an Anchorage news station , Palin appeared to ace her performances , deftly crystallizing her talking points for voters .
“ If you can sit her down , she has a talent for listening to a policy presentation that is so boring it would bring tears to your eyes , ” the aide said .
“ Then -- boom -- she will nail it down to its essence . ”
Palin often toted index cards when she walked out in front of the cameras , cribbing from them when the cameras were on her rivals .
“ She ’d carry these cards with her like she was cramming for a test , ” Halcro said .

Her debate strategists also warned Palin not to stray onto such hot - button topics as creationism and same - sex marriage .
On questionnaires sent to socially conservative activists , Palin backed “ intelligent design ” alternatives to the theory of evolution and opposed nontraditional unions .
But she managed to avoid those subjects during most of the debates .
Palin remained so low - key that even her pollster , David Dittman , confessed he was unaware of her strong Christian conservative tenets .
“ I did n’t know what she believed in , ” he said .
“ We never had any discussions about it , and from our polls , Alaska voters had the same impression . ”
By the final key televised debate in late October , Palin had grown used to the format , her aides and rivals recalled .
Still using index cards , she was breezily confident in her back - and - forth with Halcro and former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles .
Palin had ready answers on tough questions about social concerns such as native needs , abortion and assisted suicide .
Sometimes her remarks seemed glib , but she was usually poised and sometimes kicked back at her opponents and questioners when they took the offensive .

Larry Persily , a panelist questioner in the campaign ’s final televised debate , said Palin flummoxed her rivals “ like Muhammad Ali dancing around the ring . ”
She avoided statements and tough questions that could have impaled her and repeatedly stung her opponents .
And Palin , a former sportscaster , was easily the most comfortable in front of the camera .
“ She knows television , ” said Persily , who participated in other debates and has watched Palin closely for years .
“ She knows how to look at her interviewer . ”
Palin saved her most devastating riposte for the final question of the debate , when Persily asked the three candidates whether they would hire their opponents for a state job .
Knowles and Halcro offered halting jokes .
But when it was Palin ’s turn , she pounced .
Smiling at Halcro , who recited reams of statistics by rote , Palin observed that the businessman “ would make the most awesome statistician the state could ever look for . ”

As the debate audience laughed , Palin pivoted to Knowles , who had owned an Anchorage restaurant .
“ Do they need a chef down in Juneau ? ” Palin asked , smiling as she twisted the verbal knife .
“ I know Mr. Knowles is really good at that . ”
Two years on , Halcro and Knowles admit they are still baffled by how their mastery of policy and state issues was trumped by Palin ’s breezy confidence and feel - good answers .
“ When you try to prove she does n’t know anything , you lose , because audiences are enraptured by her , ” Halcro said .
“ And her biting comments give you a sense of how competitive she is .
Anybody who does n’t take her seriously does so at their peril . ”

BEIJING , Sept. 25 ( UPI ) --
China 's state - run news agency made a gaffe Thursday when it published an " in space " conversation among the Chinese astronauts even before they left Earth .
Xinhua news agency posted the story on its
Web site well before the launch of the Shenzhou VII space craft , The Times of London reported .

The story , which was headlined " Sleepless Night on the Pacific , Sidelights on the Observation and Control of the 30th Lap of the Shenzhou 7 Spaceship , " was removed from the Xinhua Web site and was described as a technical error .
The newspaper reported that it is unclear whether the astronauts were interviewed for the story .
The spacecraft is scheduled to return to Earth on Saturday .

" The fundamentals of our economy are strong , " John McCain said as Wall Street went into white - knuckle panic over diving investor confidence .
Does he believe that ?
It does n't really matter , because the Republican has outsourced his economic policy to the ideologues whose opposition to regulations brought the financial markets to their knees .
McCain 's former economic adviser is ex-Texas Sen. Phil Gramm .
On Dec. 15 , 2000 , hours before Congress was to leave for Christmas recess , Gramm had a 262 - page amendment slipped into the appropriations bill .
It forbade federal agencies to regulate the financial derivatives that greased the skids for passing along risky mortgage - backed securities to investors .
And that , my friends , is why everything 's falling apart .
That is why the taxpayers are now on the hook for the follies of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Bear Stearns and now the insurance giant AIG to the tune of $ 85 billion .
On Monday , McCain issued a tough - talk statement that he was " glad " that the feds " have said no to using taxpayer money to bail out Lehman Brothers , a position I have spoken about throughout this campaign . "
On Tuesday , the government did the daddy of all bailouts .
It took over AIG , fearing its bankruptcy could set off a cataclysmic chain of events .
And do you know where the problems lay at AIG ?
They were n't in its main insurance business .
They were in its derivatives - trading unit .
Last February , Fortune Magazine called Gramm " McCain 's Econ Brain . "
Gramm lost the official title of economic adviser for making an impolitic remark about this being " a nation of whiners . "
But Gramm 's belief in letting speculators do as they please was never an issue .
And even after he left the campaign , Gramm had been mentioned as a possible treasury secretary in a McCain administration .
Another Gramm contribution was the " Enron loophole , " which prevented federal oversight of Enron 's electronic energy trading .
Such favors proved very expensive to consumers but profitable to the Gramms .
Enron CEO Ken Lay chaired Gramm 's 1992 re-election campaign , and wife Wendy Gramm spent years on the Enron board , earning as much as $ 1.8 million , according to Public Citizen , a consumer advocate .
So McCain 's reassurances to the little people that he wo n't let what 's happening to them happen again is rather unconvincing .
McCain now talks about the need for more regulations , but he 's been highly stingy with the for - instances .
He wants a commission to look into it .
( Too bad he did n't name Mitt Romney as his running mate .
A former venture capitalist , Romney knows something about Wall Street . )
The Bush economy was built on baloney .
It was built on keeping interest rates low so that people could borrow lots of money to spend on real estate and at the mall .
The resulting housing bubble left middle - class people feeling prosperous , even as their earnings stagnated or fell .
The Democrats were n't exactly tigers on containing the housing bubble , but they did try to put the brakes on some of the lending outrages that are the root of the current crisis .
For example , Barack Obama sponsored a bill that would have prevented lenders from pressing abusive loan terms onto unsophisticated , subprime borrowers .
That went nowhere .
" I certainly do n't fault Sen. McCain for these problems , " Obama said early in the crisis , " but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to . "
Obama need not be so mild - mannered .
McCain 's economic philosophy is McCain 's fault .
He does n't know much about economics -- and has admitted as much -- so his philosophy became a simple - minded faith in the opinion of others .
And look whom he listens to .
Americans will be paying for this philosophy well into the 21st century .

BHOPAL , India ( Reuters ) - A teenage girl in central India killed herself on Wednesday after being traumatized by media reports that a “ Big Bang ” experiment in Europe could bring about the end of the world , her father said .
Scientists look at a computer screen at the control centre of the CERN in Geneva September 10 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fabrice Coffrini/ Pool
The 16 - year old girl from the state of Madhya Pradesh drank pesticide and was rushed to the hospital but later died , police said .
Her father , identified on local television as Biharilal , said that his daughter , Chayya , killed herself after watching doomsday predictions made on Indian news programs .
“ In the past two days , Chayya had asked me and other relatives about the world coming to an end on September 10 , ” Biharilal was quoted as saying .
“ We tried to divert her attention and told her she should not worry about such things , but to no avail , ” he said .
For the past two days , many Indian news channels held discussions airing doomsday predictions over a huge particle - smashing machine buried under the Swiss - French border .
The machine , called the Large Hadron Collider , was switched on on Wednesday , at the start of what experts say is the largest scientific experiment in human history .
The machine smashes particles together to achieve , on a small - scale , re-enactments of the “ Big Bang ” that created the universe .
Leading scientists and researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research , said the experiment was safe .
They dismissed as “ pure fiction ” doomsday predictions that the experiment could create anti-matter , or black holes .
But in deeply religious and superstitious India , fears about the experiment and the minor risks associated with it spread rapidly through the media .
In east India , thousands of people rushed to temples to pray and fast while others savored their favorite foods in anticipation of the world ’s end .
“ There were a thousand more devotees yesterday as well as today compared to ( any ) other normal day , ” Benudhara Sahu , a temple official in Orissa state , told Reuters .
Many women and children rushed to temples and observed fasts as they prayed for deliverance , officials and witnesses said .
Assurances by scientists and the media that nothing would happen counted for nothing for housewife Rukmini Moharana .
“ I visited temple , prayed to god , ” Moharana said .
“ I am observing the fast for safety because god can only save us . ”
Here ’s something fantastic you can do when you get bored at that holiday party : Construct complex fractals out of light using a few shiny Christmas tree ornaments .
Who says the holidays are n’t exciting ?
Here is our starting point : $ 5 worth of Christmas tree ornaments from Target that are shiny , silver , and spherical .
Making fractals is probably not what Target had in mind when they decided to sell these things , but it ’s nice of them to help out anyway .
Also , if you choose to get your ornaments by removing them from someone ’s tree ( especially if it ’s at that holiday party ) please remember to put them back when you ’re done playing .
First , we place two of the shiny ornaments up against each other on a table top .
These are pretty good spherical mirrors and you can see a lot of the surrounding room– and the camera in particular– reflected .
When you have two reflective spheres like this , there are an infinite number of reflections between them .
The pattern of the reflections in this case is relatively straightforward : it ’s very much like two flat mirrors facing each other .
You ’ve probably at some point been standing between two parallel mirrors and seen that infinite - tunnel effect .
( Lots of reflections , but no chaos or fractals here , move along . )
Here we have three spheres , which is where the fractal nature of the system will begin to emerge .
However , these are a little hard to hold in place , which is why my hand is there .
Let ’s fix that first :
If you pull out the hanger in the ornament , you ’re left with a flat end and so it becomes much easier to stand them up steady .
Now that they are steadied , here is a close - up view of the three ornaments .
They sit in the same plane and are resting against each other .
If you look at the number of images of the camera lens that appear on one of the three spheres , you can construct a one - to - one mapping between the number of images and the number of line segments in the Cantor set .
That shows that the set of reflections has a fractal dimension equal to that of the Cantor set , which is one of the most famous types of fractals .
Another neat thing to notice here is the emergence of a virtual triangle in the center– an apparent white triangle ( point down ) , whose corners are formed by the three intersection points of the spheres .
Here is our set of four stacked ornaments in a tetrahedral pyramid .
The three lower ornaments have had their caps removed and are sitting upside down on the flat ends .
In order to keep them from separating , a long piece of transparent tape holds the three together .
Atop those three rests a fourth ornament ( which still has its cap ) .
Now things can start to get interesting .
We position the camera such that we look through the hole in the center of the front “ face ” of the tetrahedron , directly at the fourth sphere in the pile .
As we move closer , we can begin to see the fractal in detail .
Move the camera in closer ( at the expense of range of focus ) , and you can now see the fractal nature of the pattern inside– the effect is very much like an optical Sierpinski gasket .
( If it does n’t yet look like a fractal , it might be because the picture is small– click on the photo to get to the higher resolution versions . )
For proper holiday spirit , we need red and green colored lights , which will help to differentiate where the different reflections are coming from .
The three light sources on the left , bottom , and right sides of the little pyramid ( respectively ) are a desk lamp with a green filter , a bright white LED , and a red LED bike tail light .
Everything is held up by Mr. Hands in the background there .
Here ’s what it looks like inside with more the proper festive lighting .
A high - resolution version of this one is available– take a look !.
Okay , so what are we looking at here ?
This type of fractal is called a Wada basin .
One of my favorite ways to look at these is by rendering them in ray tracing programs .
I like POV - Ray , and you can read more about Wada basins and rendering them in POV - Ray here .
Some photos of “ real ” Wada basins are shown here .
That lab uses the name “ optical gasket ” which is a play on the fact that this is a light - ray version of the Sierpinski gasket .
One other collection of information about Wada basins mainly consists of photos and graphics lifted the two sites that we just linked to , however it also includes a Wada basin photo that was on the cover of Scientific American in 2002 .
What ’s next ?
One of the interesting things about fractals is that they tend to be intimately linked to chaos of some form of another .
Generally speaking , chaos is characterized by a high sensitivity of a trajectory to initial conditions .
The trajectories that we are interested in here are neighboring rays of light , which you can create with an inexpensive laser pointer .
A truly remarkable thing happens if you merely point your beam into the space between the spheres– it neatly illuminates the entire fractal pattern .
( Because some of that light will go into your eyes , this is * not * the time to show off your new super - bright laser pointer !
Use the $ 5 one , please . )
This happens because neighboring light rays from the pointer initially are very close together , but rapidly diverge once they start bouncing around between the spheres .
Eventually , the rays become nearly random , filling up most possible stable trajectories between the spheres , which defines the pattern that becomes visible .
Enough talk , let ’s see how it looks !
Here are two photos of the same stack of spherical ornaments .
The photo on the left has normal lighting , but in the picture on the right , you can see me ( in reflection ) pointing a laser pointer at the inside of the pile .
It ’s really quite remarkable , the entire inside area of the stack lights up when you point the beam almost anywhere inside .
Again , that ’s a signature of chaotic behavior .
Here ’s the same thing but with a slightly different viewpoint .
In this case , I ’ve mounted the laser pointer in one place so that I can use a longer time exposure on the camera– six seconds .
I also took a picture of the same thing with the room lights off , it ’s quite different looking !
All of the photos from this project , including some not shown above are available in this flickr set , and many of the pictures there have high resolution versions .
Keep it chaotic !
The US economy is rightly the top priority of most Americans in the 2008 presidential election .
Without a strong economy it makes it hard for the US to improve its health care system , fix education , and maintain a robust foreign policy that will encourage peace and prosperity in the rest of the world .
Given the above , what is a thoughtful voter to do ?
This is beyond the scope of my little blog , but if I were voting strictly on the economy I would vote for Barack Obama .
Why Barack ?
One man – his senior economic advisor Austan Goolsbee .
Mr. Goolsbee is an impressive young economist who shares the same practical economic policy principles as centrist economic luminaries such as Greg Mankiw , but Goolsbee also possesses the charisma of a television personality .
If you missed it , he recently made an appearance on Charlie Rose .
While Barack Obama spent a lot of time during the primaries criticizing NAFTA and talking about raising taxes , he is no left wing tax and spend liberal .
To be sure , Barack often sounds like a populist - pandering to the audience to which he is speaking - but his appointment of and friendship with Goolsbee tells me otherwise .
A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for a stronger US economy .
McCain 's top campaign aides devoted a healthy chunk of a conference call today to complaining about what they say is imbalanced media coverage , reserving special criticism for The New York Times .
Steve Schmidt complained that the Gray Lady and other news organizations had n't sufficiently scrutinized Barack Obama and Joe Biden , seizing on the ties of Biden 's son , Hunter , to the credit card industry as a prime example .
To illuminate that connection , RNC communications director Danny Diaz sent out to reporters just now a piece he said " clearly states [ Hunter Biden 's ] work for MBNA . "
The story Republicans are hanging their hat on ?
You guessed it , published in The New York Times on Sept. 13 .

UNITY , N.H .
Unity was spared the banality of unanimity .
Carmella Lewis , with her Hillary T - shirt and Hillary placard , came all the way from Denver to make sure there would be plenty of ambiguity , duality and ferocity in Unity .
Just as Hillary was testing out the unfamiliar familiarity “ Barack and me ” Friday and talking about “ his grace and his grit , ” Carmella began loudly booing and waving her sign .
“ We want Hillary ! ” screamed the 57 - year - old retired ad saleswoman and Clinton delegate .
“ It ’s over , lady ! ” yelled some Obama supporters a few yards away .
Standing between the Sharks and the Jets , David Axelrod took pity on an older friend of Carmella ’s who was suffering from aridity in the Unity humidity .
The chief Obama strategist fetched a glass of water and brought it to the woman , who was wearing five Hillary buttons .
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) -- California officials began issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples Monday evening after a state Supreme Court ruling legalizing the ceremonies took effect .
The May 15 ruling took effect at 5:01 p.m. ( 8:01 p.m. ET ) Monday .
Gay and lesbian couples had lined up for hours outside county clerk 's offices in anticipation of the decision coming into force .
Lesbian rights activists Del Martin , 87 , and Phyllis Lyon , 84 , were the first same - sex couple to receive a marriage license in San Francisco on Monday , with Mayor Gavin Newsom presiding over their wedding ceremony .
" This is an extraordinary moment in history , " Newsom told a cheering , standing - room - only crowd at City Hall .
" I think today , marriage as an institution has been strengthened . "
The high - profile mayor heated up the debate on same - sex marriages in February 2004 , when he ordered city officials to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples .
Martin and Lyon were the first to exchange wedding vows after the order , only to see the ceremony voided later .
iReport.com : Share your feelings , photos and videos
" I think it 's a wonderful day and I have to thank our mayor for most of it , " Lyon said .
" I 'm very happy and very grateful for all of you . "
Clerks expect a much larger number of couples to show up Tuesday morning to complete marriage - license applications that replace " Bride " and " Groom " with " Partner A " and " Partner B . "
Watch as longtime lesbian couple emerges from wedding »
The decision makes California the nation 's second state , after Massachusetts , to legalize same - sex marriage .
Four other states allow civil unions .
Robin Tyler and Diane Olson , one of the first couples to obtain a marriage license Monday evening , rushed outside the courthouse in Beverly Hills for their Jewish wedding ceremony .
There , they were greeted by a crowd of family , friends , supporters -- and a few opponents protesting the same - sex marriages with signs reading " repent . "
" It 's not about us , " Tyler said .
" It 's about the entire movement that helped make this day possible . "
Critics of the ruling have talked about staging protests against same - sex marriages this week .
Opponents say they 've collected enough signatures to call for a statewide vote on a constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and woman .
The California secretary of state must verify the signatures before a November vote can be held on the proposed amendment .
Though the law affects only California , it has national implications .
" Because we 're in a presidential campaign right now , it 's going to be a real flash point for the electorate to come together and say this really matters to us , " said Charmaine Yoest of the Family Research Council , a conservative Christian group based in Washington that opposes gay marriage .
Meanwhile , the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , California , issued a statement on behalf of seven bishops Monday , saying the Catholic Church " cannot approve of redefining marriage . "
Marriage " has a unique place in God 's creation , joining a man and a woman in a committed relationship in order to nurture and support the new life for which marriage is intended , " the statement said .
" The meaning of marriage is deeply rooted in history and culture , and has been shaped considerably by Christian tradition .
Its meaning is given , not constructed . "
Newsom said the issue " is about civil marriages , not about religious marriages .
...
We 're not telling religious institutions what to do .
They can continue to do what they 've done . "
In the May 15 ruling , the California Supreme Court struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage as unconstitutional .
The ruling surprised legal experts because the court has a conservative reputation .
Six of its seven judges are Republican appointees .
CNN 's Ted Rowlands and Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report .
All About Same - Sex Marriage • California Supreme Court
WHEN DISHONESTY IS THE STORY ….
I think there ’s a temptation on the part of some observers to find contemporary events unprecedented .
It ’s not enough to witness an extraordinary development ; we want to believe it ’s the most extraordinary development ever .
In politics , this leads to routine hyperbole .
We heard plenty of observers argue , for example , that the fight for the nomination between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was the most vicious and aggressive Democrats had ever seen .
That ’s utter nonsense .
On some occasions , though , what sounds hyperbolic might actually be true .
I started reading up last night on some of the campaign styles of presidential candidates of the television era ( every race since Kennedy - Nixon ) , and it led me to conclude that John McCain is running the most fundamentally dishonest campaign of the last half - century .
Every candidate from both parties has spun , accentuated , and exaggerated .
They ’ve all taken cheap shots and made promises they almost certainly knew at the time they could n’t keep .
But there ’s just something breathtaking about John McCain ’s 2008 campaign , and it ’s not just because he ’s running in part on his reputation for candor and integrity .
We ’re talking about a candidate who ’s been lying about everything — his record , his running mate , his opponent , his agenda , his past , and his policies .
He ’ll lie , get caught , and then repeat the same lie .
He ’ll lie , get caught , and then lie about lying .
He ’ll lie about some things in which the truth was just as good , but lying came more naturally .
And he seems to be lying more as the race unfolds .
It ’s reassuring to know others have noticed the same thing , especially over the last 24 hours .
Josh Marshall asked how voters can trust “ a liar as big as John McCain . ”
[ L ]et ’s slow down and look at the facts that are not being disputed .
John McCain is telling lie after lie .
Not off the cuff remarks that can be excused as accidents or flubs but the same lies consistently and many of them .
Serial liars are never trustworthy people — that is a truism .
But it also demonstrates a deeper character flaw .
A normal job applicant would be disregarded out of hand after such a record became clear .
Andrew Sullivan expressed surprise at the “ barrage of lies ” from the McCain campaign .
I mean , what is going on ? …
I know many people believe that the American people — especially the under - informed swing voters — are too dumb to know when they are being lied to .
But these lies are so obvious and irrefutable that this can not be true .
Paul Krugman lamented the McCain campaign ’s “ out - and - out lies . ”
Dishonesty is nothing new in politics ….
But I ca n’t think of any precedent , at least in America , for the blizzard of lies since the Republican convention .
Ezra Klein noted what would be the obvious conclusion “ if there were justice , or consistency , in electoral politics . ”
… McCain is an opportunistic liar .
And that ’s not a partisan judgment , there ’s simply no other way to interpret these facts .
And the New York Times ’ Michael Cooper and Jim Rutenberg report in a news story today that this might , slowly but surely , be on its way to becoming a campaign narrative .
Harsh advertisements and negative attacks are a staple of presidential campaigns , but Senator John McCain has drawn an avalanche of criticism this week from Democrats , independent groups and even some Republicans for regularly stretching the truth in attacking Senator Barack Obama ’s record and positions .
That ’s an exceedingly polite way of noticing all of the people who ’ve noticed McCain ’s pathology .
I could n’t help but love the response from McCain spokesperson Brian Rogers who said the campaign “ stands fully by ” all of McCain ’s lies , adding , “ And if you and the Obama campaign want to disagree , that ’s your call . ”
McCain and his gang have their reality , and they like it just fine .
Whether everyone else prefers a different reality is not their problem .
John McCain has a problem telling the truth .
There ’s no reason this should n’t be just as big a campaign narrative as Gore ’s so - called “ exaggerations , ” or Kerry ’s so - called “ flip - flops . ”
MSNBC tried a bold experiment this year by putting two politically incendiary hosts , Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews , in the anchor chair to lead the cable news channel ’s coverage of the election .
That experiment appears to be over .
After months of accusations of political bias and simmering animosity between MSNBC and its parent network NBC , the channel decided over the weekend that the NBC News correspondent and MSNBC host David Gregory would anchor news coverage of the coming debates and election night .
Mr. Olbermann and Mr. Matthews will remain as analysts during the coverage .
The change — which comes in the home stretch of the long election cycle — is a direct result of tensions associated with the channel ’s perceived shift to the political left .
“ The most disappointing shift is to see the partisan attitude move from prime time into what ’s supposed to be straight news programming , ” said Davidson Goldin , formerly the editorial director of MSNBC and a co-founder of the reputation management firm DolceGoldin .
If you saw it just sitting there , you ’d never guess that the new Nikon D90 is a mind - blowing , game - changing camera .
It looks like any other big , black intermediate single - lens reflex camera : much more compact than a professional model , but much bigger and heavier than a pocket camera .
An S.L.R. comes with a shoulder strap because it needs one .
What you get in return for looking like a tourist , of course , is the potential for absolutely stunning photos .
Thanks to factors like high - quality , interchangeable lenses , a huge light sensor and high - speed circuitry that reduces shutter lag to zero , the pictures you get from an S.L.R. generally make pocket cameras ’ output look like amateur hour .
The new D90 , which arrives in stores next month , happens to be a superb S.L.R .
At $ 1,000 ( or $ 1,300 with a new 18 - 105 millimeter , image - stabilized lens ) , it ’s priced neatly between the D300 ( Nikon ’s bigger , heavier , all - metal professional model , $ 1,650 online ) and the intermediate D80 ( $ 720 online ) , which will soon be discontinued .
( These last two are body - only prices ; lenses are not included . )

The healthiest way to lose weight is neither crash diets nor bursts of exercise .
The body likes slow changes in terms of food and exercise .
For example , someone who has n't exercised for years should n't rush into running miles a day or pounding the treadmill .
Not only will the struggle likely leave you feeling disheartened and demotivated , you 're also far more likely to injure yourself and set your fitness levels back further .
The same goes for people who suddenly start depriving themselves .
Diets that severely restrict calories or certain foods can lead you to be deficient in the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs .
Evidence often shows that once you inevitably give up on your new ' diet ' , you then often regain the weight and possibly more when going back to old ways .
This is not to say that if you need to lose weight you should n't do so , but it is important to do it the right way .
So , what should you do ?
Energy needs and weight loss
Your body uses food for energy .
It stores any excess energy as fat .
This means if you eat more food than your body needs for daily activities and cell maintenance , you 'll gain weight .
To lose weight , you need to get your body to use up these stores of fat .
The most effective way to do this is to :
reduce the amount of calories you eat
increase your levels of activity
This is why experts talk about weight loss in terms of diet and exercise .
Introduce changes gradually
Small changes can make a big difference .
One extra biscuit every day adds up to a significant number of calories over a month and then a year .
Similarly once the sugar hit of the biscuit goes you are left craving more – one is often never enough .
You 're also more likely to stick to , say , swapping full - fat milk for semi- skimmed or making time for a healthy protein and fibre dense breakfast each morning than a diet that sets rules for all foods .
Any changes you make in your weight loss quest should be sustainable .
The end game is to sustain these changes over months and years .
Simply think of it as a lifestyle not a diet .
Increase your activity levels
Someone who increases the amount they exercise , but maintains the same diet and calorie intake , will almost certainly lose weight .
No matter if you hate gyms – even light exercise , such as a short 20 minute walk , will be beneficial if done most days of the week .
Every single time you exercise more than usual , you burn calories and fat .
There are lots of ways to increase the amount of activity you do .
Team sports , racket sports , aerobics classes , running , walking , swimming and cycling will all improve your fitness levels .
If you need some motivation or just want to keep an eye on your activity , it could be worth buying a fitness tracker .
Find something you enjoy that 's easy for you to do in terms of location and cost .
You 're then more likely to build it into your routine and continue to exercise , despite inevitably missing the odd session through holidays , family commitments , etc .
Get out and about when you can .
Leave your car on the drive and walk to the shops .
Try to incorporate longer walks into outings to the park , coast or countryside and take a picnic , so you 're in control of what you are going to eat that day .
Every extra step you take helps .
Walking up and down stairs uses the larger muscle groups in our legs and is great for burning calories .
Always use the stairs instead of the lift , or get off the bus a stop before the usual one and walk the rest of the way .
Use commercial breaks between TV - programmes to stand up and do exercise , or consider using an exercise bicycle in the living room while watching your favourite programme .
Calculate your BMI
Doctors use BMI to assess weight :
A BMI of 18.5 to 25 is healthy
If you have a BMI of more than 25 , you 're overweight
Over 30 is obese
Over 40 is morbidly obese
To calculate your BMI , you 'll need to know your weight in kilos and your height in metres , then follow the example below .
Multiply your height by itself , eg 1.7x1.7= 2.89 .
Divide your weight ( eg 80kg ) by this figure .
80 ÷ 2.89 = 27.7 .
Your BMI is 27.7 .
If you 're overweight , you can't continue with your current eating habits if you really want to lose weight .
Waist to height ratio
Waist to height ratio has been studied in recent years as possibly being even more relevant than BMI to our future health .
Measure your waist at the narrowest point in the same units to your height and a value of greater than 0.5 may be an indicator of you being at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes and so on .
This is because this waist measure is more indicative of the visceral fat around our organs than simply measuring our weight or BMI alone .
Simply knowing that your clothes do not fit can be a good motivator to losing some weight healthily .
Reduce your calorie intake
It 's not possible to reduce body fat while eating lots of food , cakes and sweets .
This does n't mean you can never have any treats , but you need to learn how to limit these foods to small quantities – say , for special occasions .
In terms of weight loss , you can get your body to use up existing stores of fat by eating less and making healthier choices .
This does n't mean crash diet ( a significant calorie drop for you ) , which usually ends up with you either getting weaker or giving up in desperation .
Quick - fix diets can lead to a yo- yoing effect of drastic weight loss followed by weight gain , resulting in a vicious cycle .
There are no shortcuts to losing weight in a healthy and reasonable way .
Eating 300 to 500 calories less per day should lead to a loss of between one and two pounds per week .
This is a realistic target .
It may seem slow , but it would add up to a weight loss of more than three stone in a year .
It might not be so tough to reduce your intake if you are simply consuming a large number of ' empty ' non nutritious calories in cakes , sweets , biscuits and fizzy drinks .
You just might need to replace these with more healthy choices .
Fat contains the most amount of calories out of all the food types ( protein , carbohydrates ) , so a good way to achieve this is to cut down on fatty foods and eat more wholegrain bread , fruit and vegetables .
Below are ways to reduce calorie intake without having to alter your diet significantly :
Replace fizzy drinks and fruit cordials with water .
Swap whole milk for semi-skimmed , or semi-skimmed for skimmed .
Eat less lunch than usual .
For example , make your own sandwich and limit the use of margarine or butter and full - fat mayonnaise ( store - bought sandwiches often contain both ) .
Choose healthier breads with wholegrains or make a salad with a good protein source such as chicken , fish or egg .
Stop taking sugar in tea and coffee .
Have smaller portions of the food you enjoy .
Avoid having a second helping at dinner .
Cut out unhealthy treats ( such as confectionary , sugary biscuits and crisps ) between meals .
Cut down on alcohol intake .
All these things will influence your health in a positive way .
Finally , do n't be tempted to skip breakfast – or any meal to lose weight .
While skipping a meal will reduce your calorie intake for that hour , it will leave you much hungrier later on .
Not only are you likely to overeat to compensate , but you 'll often make bad choices to fill the gap : a cereal bar is not as healthy as a bowl of healthy fortified cereal or as filling , leading you to ' need ' something extra for lunch .
Wholegrain toast with some avocado will score more healthy points than over - processed sugary cereal in the morning .
Irregular eating habits also disrupt your body 's metabolism , which makes it harder to lose weight in the first place .
Keep a food diary
If you 're not sure what 's wrong with your diet , try keeping a daily diary of everything you eat and drink .
You can use a notebook or an online diary .
At the end of the week , review your entries for problem areas .
Look out for processed foods , alcohol , fast food , roasts , creamy sauces , fried foods .
If your diet seems largely healthy , look at portion sizes .
Once you 've decided on what changes you 're going to make , write them down .
For example :
Week 1
Exercise : one 20 minute walk every lunch hour .
Alcohol : none in the week , two small glasses of wine on Friday , Saturday , Sunday .
Food : no chocolate or biscuits in the week , choose healthy snacks such as fruit , trim all fat from meat , eat no fried or fast food .
For each week list your targets concerning alcohol , exercise and your food plan .
Each day should then be listed in a simple chart and items you have had should be written down .
It is also important to make a note of your mood and any comments you would like to get off your chest for each day .
Play the long game
It might take a week or two before you notice any changes , but they will steadily appear .
After the first month you 'll be able to see the results and measure them in terms of looser fitting clothes .
Keeping your motivation up is one of the most difficult aspects of dieting .
There will be days when healthy eating goes out the window , and there will be weeks where you may not lose any weight – or put a little back on .
This is normal for everyone – dieters or not – so do n't let it undo your plans for a slimmer you .
You 're not doing anything ' wrong ' , but you may need to look at your plan .
Do you need to increase your activity levels ?
Make a few more changes to your diet ?
Put more effort into sticking to your current plan ?
The other side of this is to make sure you celebrate your goals .
While there 's joy enough in stepping on the scales and seeing them dip lower , be sure to mark long - term progress with a reward – such as new clothes or time off from domestic chores .
Celebrating is also a way to involve your nearest and dearest – it's up to you whether you want their encouragement in the form of gentle reminders not to eat certain foods .
But support from other people can get you through the bumpy patches .
Health benefits of weight loss
Studies show that overweight women who lose between 10lb and 20lb halve their risk of developing diabetes .
For men , the risk of heart problems reduces considerably .
Generally , we gain weight as we age .
A few pounds over the years are not a problem , but people who gain more than 20lb compared to their weight as an 18 - year - old will rapidly increase their risk of health problems due to that extra weight .
In particular , women increase their risk of heart attack and increase their risk of dying from cancer .
It may seem like these are problems to worry about in the future , but time flies by and tomorrow becomes today .
By keeping your weight in the healthy range , you 're less likely to be troubled by illnesses in your later years .

Former Wall Street exec wants bailout and more … much much more

A Council on Foreign Relations member and former policy planner under prominent Bilderberger Henry Kissinger has penned a piece in the Financial Times of London calling for a “ new global monetary authority ” that would have the power to monitor all national financial authorities and all large global financial companies .
“ Even if the US ’s massive financial rescue operation succeeds , it should be followed by something even more far - reaching – the establishment of a Global Monetary Authority to oversee markets that have become borderless . ” writes Jeffrey Garten , also a former managing director of Lehman Brothers .
Garten , now a professor of business at Yale , served on the policy planning staff of Kissinger during his time as Secretary of State .
He also served on the White House Council on International Economic Policy under the Nixon administration and went on to become the Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade under Bill Clinton .
Citing “ globalization ” , A “ clash of philosophies ” and the “ vacuum at the centre ” of the current global institutional apparatus , Garten describes his vision for a new monolithic world authority to oversee all financial activity around the globe .
Here are some of the highlights ( emphasis added ) :
A GMA ( global monetary authority ) would be a reinsurer or discounter for certain obligations held by central banks .
It would scrutinise the regulatory activities of national authorities with more teeth than the IMF has and oversee the implementation of a limited number of global regulations .
It would monitor global risks and establish an effective early warning system with more clout to sound alarms than the BIS has .
It would act as “ bankruptcy court ” for financial reorganisations of global companies above a certain size .
The biggest global financial companies would have to register with the GMA and be subject to its monitoring , or be blacklisted .
That includes commercial companies and banks , but also sovereign wealth funds , gigantic hedge funds and private equity firms .
The GMA ’s board would have to include central bankers not just from the US , UK , the eurozone and Japan , but also China , Saudi Arabia and Brazil .
It would be financed by mandatory contributions from every capable country and from insurance - type premiums from global financial companies – publicly listed , government owned , and privately held alike .
( Article continues below )
In a conclusion that smacks of problem , reaction , solution Garten adds “ In terms of US and international politics , a Global Monetary Authority is probably an idea whose time has not yet come .
That may change as today ’s crisis evolves . ”
What he describes is nothing less than a global financial dictatorship , operating across borders and forcing nations and corporations to register and adhere to strict monitoring and obey the same regulations .
The implementation of such a system would represent total interventionism and the absolute final nail in the coffin of the free market .
Garten ’s call for a GMA echoes a piece published in the FT back in June by Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Fresh from attending the Bilderberg conference in Chantilly , Virginia , Geithner called for a globalized banking system with “ appropriate requirements for capital and liquidity ” .

Comment on this article
Recent researches in our planet 's lava flows seem to indicate that the North Pole is becoming weaker and weaker , as the magnetic field Earth generates is decreasing in intensity .
According to the September 26 issue of the journal “ Science , ” secondary magnetic sources , other than the constant , turbulent flow of molten iron and rock beneath the ground , exist under the crust .
Apparently , they can , at times , influence the magnetic field generated by our planet 's poles , usually when the main “ generators ” are dwindling .
Such seems to be the case in recent times , as Brad Singer , a geology professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , has discovered that the streaming , molten iron core , which generates most of Earth 's magnetic field capabilities , is currently becoming slower and weaker in its output .
Apparently , Earth goes through this cycle at various intervals .
The last all - time low registered by geologists was about 780,000 years ago , when the North and the South poles came dangerously close to shifting .
According to paleomagnetist Kenneth Hoffman , hardened lava from eruption sites in Germany and Tahiti may show us how Earth 's magnetic field looked at various times throughout history .
When molten rock swirls underneath Earth 's crust , it orients metal particles inside towards certain stream lines , which determine the orientation of the magnetic lines , Hoffman explains .
This means that , even after lava erupts and hardens , it still retains a sort of “ memory ” of its orientation while inside the crust .
Hoffman and Singer are currently trying to find out ways of determining when and how polar shift occurs .
This is very important , because such a shift will have devastating effects on life as we know it .
Communication breakdowns and ice ages are just two of the many catastrophic effects we should expect .
While analyzing the sites in Germany and Tahiti , geologists uncovered that , when the poles are weak , there is great potential for extreme anomalies on the globe , including massive storms , hurricanes , very high or subzero temperatures and so on .
Though the next low in magnetic activities is still about 1,500 years away , scientists aim at being able to predict when a polar shift occurs and the possible implications it might have for humankind .
So , basically , she ’s a liar for standing up in front of the American people , every single day , and saying that she was opposed to the Bridge to Nowhere ( she was n’t ) , and that she opposed efforts of Alaska ’s congressional delegation to get pork for the state through earmarks ( she did n’t ) .
Josh Marshall spliced together several videos of Sarah Palin supporting both the bridge and the earmarks .
She ’s a liar .
Why would McCain pick someone like this ?
( Because he caved to the religious right . )
Why would McCain approve of his campaign repeatedly lying about facts that are already well established ?
( Because he does n’t think media has the backbone to call him on it . )
Does McCain even know what his own campaign is doing any more ?

I looked at this information about the four candidates , and thought about the disparity that the resumes point out .
The difference between building your life from nothing , and coming from a life of privilege where everything is handed to you .
A life of privilege where you can get into one of the top military schools in the country as a legacy , but party and brawl your way to the bottom of the class .
A life of privilege where you can flit from school to school , taking your time to check out the scenery .
A life of privilege where you know that if things get too tough academically or personally , you can just move on to another school with a less rigorous curriculum , or perhaps go back after a break .
" Privilege " does not have to mean " wealth " in this case .
Looking at these four educational resumes * , without knowing their race or their gender , who would you give an interview to ?
Suppose you are a hiring manager and have four young candidates to choose from to work in your business .
The job involves managing a diverse group of people , having a basic knowledge of economics , politics , foreign relations , education , law , and government .
You need someone who is a team - player , is decisive , and has a " get the job done " attitude .
Compare that to the student who comes from working - class or low - income parents , who attends college and then graduate school on scholarships and student loans , the student who knows that this is their one and only chance to make something of themselves and do better than his parents .
Certainly , none of the candidates ' resumes end with his or her educational accomplishments .
Each has participated and served in government at varying levels , and we could argue all day about what those qualifications mean or do n't mean .
But , consider this :
What does it say about them , when the playing field was as level as it might ever be , how they chose to use their educational opportunities ?
To me , it speaks volumes about their character , and their ability at a young age to seize an opportunity or let it nearly slip away .
I have a son who is in third grade .
Like most kids , he would rather play than study .
How can I tell him to work hard in school so he can get ahead in life , if the top leaders in the land took school as a joke ?
If their example shows that anyone can be President , but not because of hard work and brains , but based on their connections or good looks ?
Moreover , what does their experience with higher education say about how much they themselves value education , and whether or not it will be a priority to them that all children get a good education ?
As a mom , I know who I want as a educational role model to my child .
As a hiring manager , I know which candidates I would give an interview to and who would not get past the paper phase .
Hint : Their names are not Palin or McCain .
* Hat Tip to Stephen Fox , an Obama supporter , for sending this information .
When not drilling her kid on spelling words and math facts , Glennia is an attorney and hiring manager at a large educational institution , and blogs as The Silent I .
Ron Artest is not going home to play for his beloved New York Knicks .
Artest did n't get the fairy - tale trade to join his Southern California buddy Kobe Bryant , either .
He 's also not complaining .
Artest was unmistakably giddy in the early hours of Wednesday morning in a phone conversation with ESPN.com as he discussed his forthcoming trade to the Houston Rockets .
" I 'll be a kid in a candy store , " Artest said .
" I 'll be a kid in a store with a lot of candy .
I 'm going to dance with the stars . "
Instead of the trade to Hollywood to Bryant 's Los Angeles Lakers , as many around the league expected , Artest is headed to Houston for a reunion with Rick Adelman , who ranks as his favorite pro coach .
In a swap first reported Tuesday night by The Houston Chronicle , Sacramento has agreed to part with its rugged but controversial swingman in exchange for newly drafted Rockets rookie Donte Greene , Kings alumnus Bobby Jackson ( and his salary cap - friendly contract ) and a first - round pick in 2009 .
NBA front - office sources confirmed to ESPN.com that the Kings also will receive approximately $ 1 million in cash considerations .
But the deal can't be completed and announced before Aug. 14 because Greene is not eligible to be traded until then , per league rules , since he signed with the Rockets on July 14 .
" For this trade to happen it means the Rockets have to start winning right now , " Yao Ming told Houston television station KRIV from Nanjing , China .
Artest simply can't wait .
He has been second - guessing his decision not to opt out of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent since the first day of free agency July 1 , telling ESPN.com earlier this month that he was hoping to be dealt to " a team out there that can be more committed than Sacramento to me . "

Technology
Scientists at the US Department of Defence ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) have set what they claim is a world record in solar cell efficiency with a photovoltaic device that converts 40,8 % of the light that hits it into electricity .
The new cell differs significantly from the previous record holder – also based on an NREL design .
Instead of using a germanium wafer as the bottom junction of the device , the new design uses compositions of gallium indium phosphide and gallium indium arsenide to split the solar spectrum into three equal parts .
These are absorbed by each of the cell ’s three junctions for higher potential efficiencies .
The new cell , which is extremely thin and light , is a natural candidate for use on space satellites and in solar concentrators on Earth .
International Rectifier has announced the successful development of a gallium nitride ( GaN ) - based power device technology platform that it claims can provide customers with improvements in key application - specific figures of merit ( FOM ) of up to a factor of 10 compared to state - of - the - art silicon - based technology platforms , to dramatically increase performance and cut energy consumption in end applications in a variety of market segments such as computing and communications , automotive and appliances .
The technology platform is the result of five years of research and development by IR , based on the company ’s proprietary GaN - on - silicon epitaxial technology .
NXP Semiconductors has developed its latest SmartMX security chip , the P5CD081 , a high performance contactless IC for ePassport and electronic identification applications .
The IC processes transactions extremely fast and offers the highest security level with an EAL5 + level common criteria certification .
The chip is also the first smartcard controller to feature Secure Fetch technology , which offers increased protection against attack scenarios with light and lasers ( so - called fault attacks ) , thereby facilitating the development of highly secure software applications .
At the CTIA Wireless IT & Entertainment 2008 expo , a company called Elektrobit demonstrated Web browsing and Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) calling on what is said to be the industry ’s first ever dual - mode satellite - terrestrial HSPA smartphone reference design .
This reference design automatically switches between cellular and satellite networks , allowing laptops , automobiles and mobile users to maintain Internet connectivity regardless of location .
Sarah Palin is the product of a design flaw -- the unintended consequence of the founders ’ decision to create the vice presidency .
For two centuries , presidential nominees have used the office to balance the ticket by naming a running mate from a different region , or one who speaks with a different ideological accent to a specific constituency .
This means that a president ’s death generates a double shock :
The nation not only mourns a fallen leader , it must deal with a replacement who may push politics in a new direction .
FOR THE RECORD :
Vice presidency : An Op - Ed article Wednesday on doing away with the office of vice president indicated that President Lincoln ’s motive for choosing his second - term running mate , Andrew Johnson , was to carry Tennessee .
In fact , his motive was to attract votes from the border states ; Tennessee was contested between the Confederacy and the Union ; it was not counted in the Union presidential election .
Teddy Roosevelt -- who replaced William McKinley when he was assassinated in 1901 -- may have been a great progressive president , but he had been named as vice president by the arch - conservative McKinley simply to carry New York .
The country elected a right - winger but ended up with something else entirely .
Similar perverse logic led Abraham Lincoln to choose Andrew Johnson as a running mate .
Lincoln knew that Johnson was a racial conservative , but he was more interested in carrying Tennessee .
This tragic blunder clouds Lincoln ’s claim to greatness .
When Lincoln was killed , Johnson ’s bitter opposition to Reconstruction helped poison race relations for generations .
Recent elections have lulled us into a false sense of security .
Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush nominated like - minded , known - quantity running mates , as has Barack Obama this time around .
But John McCain ’s surprising choice should lead us to think again .
Mexico and France see no need for a vice president .
We should designate the secretary of State to be in charge until a special election can be held to replace a president .
This is n’t a question on which the founders deserve any deference .
They designed their system for a very different political world .
Their electoral college aimed to give the power to choose the president to wealthy , important men in each state .
But politics was emphatically local in the 18th century , and the founders feared that each state ’s electors would cast their ballots for a favorite son -- depriving the leading candidate of a majority .
To solve this problem , they hit upon an ingenious scheme .
The original Constitution gave presidential electors two votes , not one , and provided that they could only vote for one nominee from their own state .
The idea was that electors would use one vote to flatter a local favorite and the other to select a national leader like , say , George Washington , giving him a strong majority .
But alas , the two - vote system could be sabotaged .
Electors could simply vote for their favorite Joe Schmoe and cast a blank second ballot , thereby maximizing Schmoe ’s chance for success .
Enter the vice presidency , a consolation prize for favorite sons ( or whoever polled second in the electoral college ) .
It was meant to assure the election of a proper president ; providing a replacement executive was a distinctly secondary objective .
This clever scheme did not survive the rise of political parties .
By 1800 , electors followed the instructions of the national Democratic - Republican and Federalist parties , generating a crisis .
The Democratic - Republicans won the election , and their 73 electors all wrote the names of Thomas Jefferson and his running mate , Aaron Burr , on their ballots , without having the power to say that they wanted Jefferson to be president .
This created a tie for the top spot , and Jefferson and Burr were obliged to compete for the presidency in what turned out to be a bitterly contested runoff in the House of Representatives .
After the smoke cleared , Congress and the states merely tinkered with the election system .
Their 12th Amendment simply told electors to cast one ballot for president and one for vice president .
This made a repeat of the Jefferson - Burr crisis impossible , but it paved the way for the vice presidential shocks that have redirected our national history .
If McCain wins the presidency , we can only wish him a long life .
But however the race turns out , we should recognize that the founders did n’t have the slightest idea that the vice presidency would episodically explode in our face , and it ’s about time we fixed it .

Re “ Wall St. in Worst Loss Since ’01 Despite Reassurances by Bush ” ( front page , Sept. 16 ) :
First it was Bear Stearns , then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and now the word is of a possible bailout of Lehman Brothers .
Where does the emergency aid come from when the government steps in ?
Ultimately from my wages and yours .
The Republicans talk a good game about tax cuts .
But when untold billions are siphoned off of public funds that might go to any number of worthy causes  what is that if not an abuse of our tax money ?
Indeed , after the fact , intervention is the only option .
But the Republicans can’t have it both ways .
They ca n’t tout tax - cutting credentials and condemn government spending while refusing to regulate financial markets and letting them run amok .
If that is n’t lavish government spending in the extreme , what is ?
We would n’t be in this situation if the Bush administration had cared about the hard - earned money of average Americans , which it gladly takes from us every pay period .
It would be one thing if this were an entirely new phenomenon .
But we ’ve been down this road before , in the 1980s , under another Republican administration that also touted tax cuts , even as it poured a chunk of our wages down the drain of bailouts .

A new poll from a major Russian news outlet reveals that 84 % believe that the truth behind the 9/11 attacks is being deliberately hidden by the U.S. government .
At time of writing , the poll on the Russia Today website indicates that only 16 % of readers feel that the 9/11 Commission report represents the full extent of the evidence as to who carried out the attacks over seven years ago .
The 84 % figure mirrors almost exactly that of similar polls conducted in 2006 and 2004 .
The poll comes on the heels of a survey conducted across 17 countries by WorldPublicOpinion.org that revealed less than half of those surveyed believe Al - Qaeda was behind 9/11 , with a full 15 per cent believing that the terrorist outrage was directly perpetrated by the U.S. government .
A recent New York Times article also covered the fact that it has become conventional wisdom across the middle east that the official 9/11 story is a fraud .
Russia Today , one of Russia ’s primary news channels also today features a balanced article and video report documenting the activities of the 9/11 truth movement in New York yesterday .
Watch the report :
We Are Change ’s Luke Rudkowski , and Infowars reporter Jason Bermas have joined hundreds of other activists in promoting the 9/11 truth movement and raising awareness and much needed aid for sick first responders on the seventh anniversary of the atrocities .
The events in New York continue today .
The 9/11 truth movement has received much attention in Russia throughout the week with Russian State TV today set to broadcast a feature length documentary that questions the official version of events along with a pre-recorded studio debate on the matter .
Up to 30 million Russians will see Giulietto Chiesa ’s ZERO , which covers some of the pertinent unanswered questions and inconsistencies surrounding the received reality of 9/11 .
The figures that consistently emerge from the now voluminous polls , surveys and reports regarding 9/11 from all over the globe represent a blow to debunkers who have attempted to argue that skepticism towards the official 9/11 story is a radical fringe belief .
In reality , it is now beyond any doubt that a majority of people believe an explanation other than the official story or at least have suspicions about the official version .

It is being reported that the presidential campaign of Barack Obama has purchased 30 minutes of primetime airtime to air a special at 8 pm Eastern and Pacific .
Obama is also talking to NBC and Fox about buying airtime .
The question is , is this a good idea ?
The Live Feed is also reporting that NBC is close to a deal with Obama for the same date and time as CBS , and the only thing stopping Fox from making the deal is that the date and time Obama wants might conflict with Game 6 of the World Series .
For the first time in the three election cycles , both candidates are buying network airtime .
The difference between Obama and McCain is that Obama can afford to make such an expensive purchase because of his vast fundraising network .
At one time these kinds of programs were common place in presidential campaign politics .
For example , John F. Kennedy bought network TV time first at the state level the night before the Democratic primary in West Virginia , and also before the general election .
The most recent candidate to do this was Ross Perot in 1992 , but Obama ’s 30 minute special about a week before the general election is likely to be used deliver a pitch on the economy and the need for change .
Advertisements
If Obama lands on 3 of the 4 television networks in primetime with the ability to shape and deliver his message , this could be used to close the deal with American voters .
The Obama camp knows that McCain ca n’t afford to match this buy , so in essence , Obama will get to talk to America unopposed .
This is why the Obama campaign has been working so hard to raise money , because McCain is already running out of cash , and he will probably have to rely on the ads that have already been purchased in swing states and free media to get him over the finish line .
The Obama media strategy has been much different from recent campaigns .
Instead of running a strictly targeted campaign that is based on local and cable markets , the Democrat has been able to run a dual level campaign that targets local and cable stations in swing states along with a national element such as this 30 minute special .
I live in Pennsylvania , and I get tons email from the candidates , but the other day was the first time that I have received a piece of direct mail .
It is interesting that a campaign that is so 21st Century focused with their media would use a tactic from the past such as the network primetime media buy .
This is a completely low risk move .
At best , it helps Obama get his message out during his last push before the election .
At worst , people will ignore it and watch something else .
My guess is that people are so locked into this election , that they will watch , but if the stock market keeps tanking , Obama may have this race locked before the special airs .
Obama and Biden have done a good job at sticking to the issues , basically THE ONLY issue — the economy .
Seems like everyone in the country is talking about the economy — except John McCain , Cindy McCain , Sarah Palin and their creepy surrogates .
While our guys are sticking to the issues , our v.p. candidate did n’t miss a chance to take a swipe at McCain and McCain ’s idiotic running mate :
After weeks of treading carefully on all things Palin , Biden has showed a new willingness to take the Alaska governor on on a host of issues .
The latest example came as he discussed McCain ’s mortgage plan and made reference to one of Palin ’s criticisms of himself .
“ Sarah Palin says , ‘ You know , I was in second grade when Joe Biden was elected to the United States Senate at age 29 , ’ ” he said this afternoon .
“ That ’s true , but she was in sixth grade the last time John had a new idea . ”
In another thread here , a commentor asks , “ What , exactly , is un-libertarian about “ loser pays ” laws in civil suits ? ”
This sentiment is common among libertarians who seem to assume that the “ loser pays ” rule is preferable , from a libertarian point of view , to a system in which each side pays its legal costs .
The push for a loser pays system seems to be a reaction to frivolous and unjust lawsuits .
But such suits are inevitable in a state - run legal system , which will be less efficient than a private system–and also less just , since the relevant laws will often be unlibertarian .
This means that the wrong party will often win , either because the more - inefficient and less - accurate state court system makes a factual mistake and rules for the “ wrong ” side ; or because the law that supports the winner is unjust .
Attempting to solve this problem by shifting legal fees is addressing the symptom , not the cause .
Besides , in any compulsory legal system , either the loser - pays , or winner - pays , rule can result in unjust restults .
For example , Sally sues Harry for a battery that he committed .
If she wins , and there is a winner - pays rule , this is unjust , since a guilty Harry ought to have to pay her damages including her legal costs in having to sue him .
But suppose she loses , and there is a loser - pays rule : this is also unjust since injury is being added to injury .
In a state - run system , neither loser - pays , nor winner - pays , nor each - side - pays - his - own - fees , is just .
The only just system is a voluntary , private justice system where customers of competing justice agencies agree voluntarily ahead of time to some rule–in this case , any of the fee - payment schemes is libertarian since it is agreed to by all sides .

There ’s a Native American site in Ohio that appeared to be a fort .
But recent discoveries by archaeologists at the University of Cincinnati show that ’s not the case .
Instead , it ’s a two - thousand year old Shawnee water management system .
It stretches out almost six kilometers .
That ’s much larger than what had been thought to comprise the so - called fort .
It ’s one of the largest such sites in the country .
What had been thought to be gates for military protection are actually a series of dams and irrigation canals .
There are logs and clay bricks for damming ; raceways for flowing water originate in far - off springs .
The water was stored and channeled for irrigation .
Drill cores show water sediments and clay .
The site demonstrates a sophisticated knowledge of engineering — which archaeologists did not realize that Native American communities might have .
The site also reveals an emphasis on public works , rather than on war .
So this discovery might rewrite a bit of history .
Another interesting note : Shawnee remains from the time are typically of petite , graceful men — and robust , muscular women .
So it was probably the women who built the water system .
Which means even more history to rewrite .

Irish voters give their reasons for voting No or Yes for the Lisbon treaty
In pictures
Governments in the European Union are exploring what to do after the Ireland 's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty to reform the expanded EU .
France and Germany have described the " No " vote as a serious blow but urged the EU to press ahead with the project .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said ratifications must carry on so that the Irish vote did not " become a crisis " .
But Czech President Vaclav Klaus said the treaty was finished , since any further ratification was impossible .
His is a lone voice among EU leaders , but his views will probably resonate with many European voters who did not get a say in a referendum , says the BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels .
The third failed referendum on an EU treaty in three years can only be seen as a serious blow to the EU 's credibility at home and abroad , our correspondent adds .
' Take their course ' Voters in the Irish Republic rejected the Lisbon treaty in a vote by 53.4 % to 46.6 % .
At the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken
Dermot Ahern , Justice Minister
EU mulls options after ' No ' vote Mark Mardell 's Euroblog
In quotes : Referendum reaction
The 27 - nation EU requires all its members to ratify the treaty but only Ireland has held a public vote .
A referendum was mandatory in the Republic as the country would need to change its constitution to accommodate the treaty .
The European Commission says nations should continue to ratify the treaty , designed to streamline decision - making .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said that Ireland remained " committed to a strong Europe " .
" Ratifications should continue to take their course , " he added .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the UK would press on with its ratification .
Lisbon is supposed to replace the European constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters three years ago .
The treaty , which is designed to help the EU cope with its expansion into eastern Europe , provides for a streamlining of the European Commission , the removal of the national veto in more policy areas , a new president of the European Council and a strengthened foreign affairs post .
It is due to come into force on 1 January , 2009 .
Fourteen countries out of the 27 have completed ratification so far .
Long weekend European governments will spend the weekend trying to chart a way forward for the EU , the BBC's Jonny Dymond reports from Dublin .
EU leaders appear to be in for a weekend of deep reflection Ireland has thrown a spanner deep into the EU 's machinery and Europe 's leaders have just a few days before they meet for their summer summit in Brussels , to come up with some credible ideas as to how to move forward .
The most obvious course of action might be to tinker with Treaty and then ask Ireland to vote again .
But Thursday 's " No " vote was more than the usual anti-European suspects , our correspondent says .
The No campaign successfully increased its vote in the Irish Republic and asking a population to vote again is a trick you can only pull so many times .
The weekend will be a period of deep reflection for many governments across the EU , our correspondent says .

What are these ?
I had been thinking about this idea for a while , mentioned it to my colleagues , etc .
Then I saw this piece by John Tierney entitled " Malthus v. the Singularity " at the NYT a couple of weeks ago , which has kept it on my mind .
My questions for you and some other ideas are under the fold .
It seems to me that what we are all ultimately trying to figure out is how to handicap this race ( or fight or pick your metaphor ) if it exists and which factor will win out in the end knowing what we all know and making educated guesses at what we do not .
So , I ask you , are there other ideas / factors that should also be thought of " in this race " that are not already captured by these two concepts ?
What is the end point or criteria by which this race can be judged ?
Is it whether or not we reach this singularity ( e.g. , what if we end up one ounce of coal away from accomplishing the singularity ? ) ?
Is it net human suffering we incur along the way ?
Is there a / another signpost by which we can gauge progress / failure ?
What other factors need to be considered in this race ?
Is petroleum just distracting us from other resources , that efficiencies and other marginal replacements with less net energy and elegance will help us continue this move towards the singularity ?
or is this just the 1970s revisited and we 're engaging in " Limits to Growth Discussion # 2 ? " , with the same result ?
I realize this is inherently theoretical and rather reductionist , but I 've been thinking about it all morning , so I thought I would throw it out to you all as it seemed apropos of the discussion we are having these days .
Feel free to link to arguments or concepts in the comments .
Thomas Schelling showed that it could sometimes pay to be irrational , or at least to appear to be irrational .
If they think you ’re crazy then in a game of chicken it ’s your opponent who will backdown .
It ’s known that Nixon understood the theory but in an frightening article in Wired we learn the insane extent to which the theory was practiced .
Frustrated at the state of affairs in Vietnam , Nixon resolved to :
… threaten the Soviet Union with a massive nuclear strike and make its
leaders think he was crazy enough to go through with it .
His hope was
that the Soviets would be so frightened of events spinning out of
control that they would strong - arm Hanoi , telling the North Vietnamese
to start making concessions at the negotiating table or risk losing
Soviet military support .
Much more was involved than words , at one point nuclear bombers were sent directly towards Soviet airspace where they triggered the Soviet defense systems .
On the morning of October 27 , 1969 , a squadron of 18
B - 52s – massive bombers with eight turbo engines and 185 - foot wingspans
– began racing from the western US toward the eastern border of the
Soviet Union .
The pilots flew for 18 hours without rest , hurtling
toward their targets at more than 500 miles per hour .
Each plane was
loaded with nuclear weapons hundreds of times more powerful than the
ones that had obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The Soviets went nuts but following Nixon ’s orders Kissinger told the Soviet ambassador that the President was out of control .
Apparently neither Nixon or Kissinger had absorbed another Schelling insight – if you want to credibly pretend you are out of control then you have to push things so far that sometimes you will be out of control .
The number of ways such a plan could have resulted in a nuclear war is truly frightening .
After all , Nixon was gambling millions of lives on the Soviets being the rational players in this game .
Next time you are told how a madman threatens the world remember the greatest threats have come from our own mad men .
Updated , 10:05 a.m. | A New York City police lieutenant who gave the order to fire a Taser stun gun at a man who then fell to his death in Brooklyn committed suicide at Floyd Bennett Field early on Thursday , law enforcement officials said .
The lieutenant , Michael W. Pigott , a 21 - year veteran of the force , had been placed on modified assignment without his gun and badge after he gave the order to a sergeant to fire the Taser at a Bedford - Stuyvesant man , Iman Morales .
Mr. Morales , naked and with apparent signs of emotional disturbance , fell to his death from a building ledge after an officer shot him with the Taser , at the instruction of Lieutenant Pigott .
Mr. Morales had been yelling at passers - by and swinging a long light bulb tube at officers before he fell .
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement :
Upon behalf of all of the members of the New York City Police Department , I extend deepest condolences to the family and friends of Lt. Michael W. Pigott who served with dedication for 21 years .
In the aftermath of Mr. Morales ’s death , the department announced that the use of the Taser appeared to have violated departmental rules , and a new commander of the Emergency Service Unit was named .
Mr. Kelly also emphasized the need for additional training .
Asked about the development on Thursday morning , the chief spokesman for the police department , Paul J. Browne , said only : “ A New York City police lieutenant was killed this morning apparently as the result of a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
The identification is being withheld pending family notification . ”
Later , Mr. Kelly issued a statement acknowledging that the lieutenant was in fact Lieutenant Pigott , and Mr. Browne provided details about what happened early this morning .
He said that Lieutenant Pigott went to Floyd Bennett Field alone , early in the morning , and entered a locker room , where he gained access to a weapon that was not his : a 9 - millimeter Glock .
Then , he shot himself in the head , Mr. Browne said .
His body was discovered in the locker room by a service member who was coming on duty at about 6 a.m .
Following the death of Mr. Morales , Lieutenant Pigott had been on desk duty with Fleet Services , which handles the Police Department ’s vehicles .
This will be the home page of a debate which stems from an article published by new Nolan Chart columnist Master C on September 21 , 2008 .
Entitled “ Financial Bailout or Refilling the Cookie Jar ? ” it was Master C's first contribution to the Chart .
I often reply to first - time columnists via the Reader Comments section to try to get a little debate and discussion going .
It 's my way of welcoming newcomers .
He replied not via the Reader Comments section of the article , but rather via email .
This led to a little give - and - take , and before we knew it , we were in a debate .
The quality of the discussion and the range we covered led me to believe that this was a debate that others would want to follow .
So we 're bringing it online for your viewing pleasure .
While Master C's bailout article was the instigator of our debate , we 've decided that it wo n't be the official starting point .
Instead , each of us will publish a short piece which constitutes our respective “ first proposition , ” to borrow a phrase from the British debating tradition .
This article will serve as the Table of Contents of the articles of the debate , which shall be offered in chronological order as he and I contribute new articles to the discussion .
We will also include links in each article included in the debate , both to this article 's table of contents and to the previous and ( ultimately ) the next article in the debate , so that readers can easily follow the give - and - take .
Depending upon how much readership this debate attracts , the format might become the basis for additional programming done to the site to enhance this kind of discussion on issues between consenting debaters .
So let 's begin .
Question :
Is the Federal Reserve System fraudulent , and should it be reformed or abolished ?
Let 's introduce the participants .
Master C taught college level Economics for 18 years before retiring .
He also worked in significant occupations in banking ( 7 years ) and manufacturing ( 6 years ) .
He has an extensive interest in many things from photography , movies , books , theater , sports , computers , travel , restaurants , and politics .
Walt Thiessen is the founder of the Nolan Chart website and a long - time libertarian .
After years working in both corporate and small company positions , primarily in computer - related positions , he became a small - time entrepreneur .
He was the Libertarian Party 's candidate for Congress from Connecticut 's 5th District in 1996 .
Today , he works at home and helps promote freedom - related issues .
Articles published in this debate so far :
The blogospheric economists ( e.g. Krugman , e.g. Atrios ) have put out a lot of econobabble about why the Paulson plan ca n’t work .
Having actually done financial statements , I can tell you why theoretically it might work .
Suppose a company holds assets that normally deliver a 10 % rate of return .
Under those conditions , they are valued at $ 100 .
Operating expenses are $ 10 and liabilities are $ 90 .
The firm is solvent and will remain so indefinitely since , in principle , it could sell off its assets , pay off its liabilities , and have cash in the kitty .
Now , suppose that 10 % of the assets are impaired .
For example , they represent a mine that has flooded and will take some time to pump out .
When it is pumped out , its value will be fully restored .
If it will be pumped out this afternoon , it ’s worth full market price .
But if it wo n’t be pumped out for 20 years , its value is only 64 cents–essentially zero– because these investors are expecting a rate of return of 10 % (* ) .
Now , if the company had to sell its assets , it could only raise $ 90 , an amount equal to its liabilities .
Furthermore , with operating expenses of $ 10 and revenues of $ 9 , it will be insolvent within one year .
Any sane shareholder would dump his stock ( making it impossible for the company to raise capital ) .
If the Federal government steps in and buys the impaired mine for $ 10 , and the company buys an equivalent but unimpaired mine for $ 10 , then the company is restored to solvency .
The value to the federal government is actually much greater than 64 cents , since the Federal government is only looking for a return equal to T - bills , say 3 % .
Over an infinite period of time , the mine is worth $ 33 , and losing 20 years of production only costs them $ 15 , so the net value of the impaired mine is $ 18 .
And that ’s why the government can , theoretically , make money on what is a losing proposition to business .
Whether the Paulson plan is good or not is yet to be determined –it really depends on how large a fraction of the assets are impaired to Level 2 and Level 3 – but economists should ask their business school brethren before running on at the mouth .
As I commented to Krugman , the reason to be uneasy is not that this ca n’t work .
It can .
The reason to be uneasy is that the Administration is a bunch of steel - welded , road - tested , lying , incompetent weasels .
_________________________
Over an infinite period of time , an asset delivering $ 1 per year at a rate of interest of 10 % is valued at 1/.1 = $ 10 .
But the value of the first twenty payments is $ 1 + $ 1/1.1 + … $ 1/1.1^20 = $ 9.36 .
So , if 20 payments are withheld , the asset is only worth 64 cents .

NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - U.S. banks and money managers borrowed a record amount from the Federal Reserve in the latest week , nearly $ 188 billion a day on average , showing the central bank went to extremes to keep the banking system afloat amid the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression .

The data on borrowing from the Fed closed out another day of high anxiety in global money markets .
Key measures of funding stress hit record levels on both sides of the Atlantic as nervous market participants awaited developments from Washington on a $ 700 billion U.S. financial bailout plan .
Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday the total amount banks borrowed nearly quadrupled the previous record of $ 47.97 billion per day notched just the week before .
“ This looks like the balance sheet of a central bank that is keeping the financial system on life support , ” said Michael Feroli , U.S. economist with JPMorgan in New York .
Borrowings by primary dealers via the Primary Dealer Credit Facility , and through another facility created on Sunday for Goldman Sachs GS.N , Morgan Stanley MS.N and Merrill Lynch MER.N and their London - based subsidiaries , totaled $ 105.66 billion as of Wednesday , the Fed said .
The Federal Reserve ’s lending to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of high - quality asset - backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds via a new lending facility the Fed announced on September 19 , came in at $ 72.67 billion as of Wednesday .
The Fed designed the loan facility to help money market funds meet huge demands for redemptions from fearful investors over the past week after one U.S. money market mutual fund ’s value fell below $ 1 a share , and to foster liquidity in the asset - backed commercial paper markets .
The move followed the U.S. Treasury ’s action last Friday to set up a temporary guaranty program for the money market mutual fund industry .
Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial cited “ a big increase in borrowings from securities firms which came at a time when the turmoil on Wall Street hit an apex and money market funds came under pressure , so they went to the window to make sure their funds remained stable . ”
Lending in the " other credit extensions " category to insurer American International Group AIG.N and possibly others was $ 44.57 billion as of September 24 , compared with $ 28.0 billion as of September 17 .
“ It is stunning how much you see the Fed extending credit all over the place , ” Feroli said .
“ Every facility got used to a large degree , the ABCP facility , the AIG loan , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the good old discount window , ” he said .
“ Everywhere you see huge amounts of reserves being put into the system , ” Feroli said .
LAST RESORT
The data showing the huge reliance of financial institutions on the U.S. central bank came on a day of other extremes within the funding markets for banks and companies .
Key measures of U.S. dollar funding strains hit record levels as nervous market participants awaited developments from Washington on a $ 700 billion U.S. financial bailout plan .
The inter - bank premium for borrowing three - month dollars over anticipated official policy rates , or Overnight Index Swaps , known as the Libor / OIS spread , blew out to 200 basis points , while the cost of borrowing euros and sterling also jumped .
That dollar Libor / OIS spread was around 164 basis points on Wednesday , and around 80 basis points at the start of September .
Yet late in the New York day , market participants ’ hopes of an imminent passage of the $ 700 billion government bank bailout dragged some gauges of risk aversion including interest rate swap spreads , back from the brink .
The U.S. commercial paper market also shrank dramatically , marking the biggest weekly contraction in a year , Fed data showed on Thursday , as the escalating global credit crisis shook investors ’ confidence in all but the safest instruments issued by the U.S. government .
For the week ended September 24 , the size of the U.S. commercial paper market , a vital source of short - term funding for daily operations at many companies , shrank by $ 61.0 billion to $ 1.702 trillion , the lowest level since early 2006 Federal Reserve data showed .
“ The declines add to the urgency for fixes to the credit crisis , ” wrote Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist with Miller , Tabak & Co. in New York in an email note .
The closely - watched TED spread , meanwhile , was last indicated around 430 basis points on Reuters screens , edging back up toward the near 500 basis points struck last week , the widest in over a quarter of a century .
The three - month sterling Libor / OIS spread , meanwhile , widened to almost 160 basis points , more than doubling since the start of the month .
These spreads are seen as a key indicator of financial market stress and risk aversion , reflecting the true cost of funding for banks and financial instututions .
Some 60 percent of corporate lending is tied to London interbank offered rates ( Libor ) , according to Credit Suisse .

A noun , a verb , and ‘ prisoner of war ’
The initial response from the McCain campaign on the senator ’s confusion about how many homes he owns was pretty weak .
Put it this way , it talked about arugula and Hawaii .
A couple of hours later , though , the McCain gang went with the one response that applies to every question .
The McCain campaign is road - testing a new argument in responding to Obama ’s criticism of his number - of - houses gaffe , an approach the McCain camp has never tried before :
The houses gaffe does n’t matter because … he was a P.O.W.!
“ This is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years — in prison , ” spokesman Brian Rogers told the Washington Post .
I see .
When the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell , a close Bush ally , publicly questioned McCain ’s marital infidelities , the McCain campaign responded by highlighting McCain ’s background as a prisoner of war .
When Dems attacked McCain ’s healthcare plan in May , McCain responded by noting his background as a prisoner of war .
Asked by a local reporter about the first thing that comes to his mind when he thinks of Pittsburgh , McCain responded by talking about his background as a prisoner of war .
Accused of possibly having heard the questions in advance of Rick Warren ’s recent candidate forum , the McCain campaign responded by highlighting McCain ’s background as a prisoner of war .
There seems to be a pattern here .
To be sure , McCain no doubt endured horrific conditions during the war , and it ’s obvious that McCain ’s detention as a young man in Vietnam helped shape his life .
Given this , it ’s not unreasonable that he ’d want voters to know about his experience .
But that ’s not a license to force the “ P.O.W. card ” into every unrelated question .
And all of this , of course , dovetails with the McCain campaign running multiple television ads talking about McCain ’s background as a prisoner of war , literally including interrogation footage in the commercial .
This hard - sell would n’t be quite so odd if McCain did n’t go around saying that he ’s reluctant to talk about his Vietnam experiences .
We read a lot about kids not being as good in science as we were back in the day .
And we read a lot about women being missing from science too .
You would n't know it by these outstanding young scientists in this year 's EU contest for Young Scientists , which was held in Copenhagen , Denmark and rewarded contestants aged 14 - 19 who shared a € 46,500 prize pot .
The contestants represented 39 countries across Europe - as well as special guests Brazil , Canada , China , Mexico , New Zealand and the USA - and they presented 87 winning projects from national competitions covering a wide range of scientific disciplines ; from engineering and earth sciences to biology , mathematics , chemistry , physics , medicine , computer and social sciences .
The standard of entries was consistently high and several past participants have achieved major scientific breakthroughs or set up businesses to market the ideas developed for the Contest .
" The EU Contest for Young Scientists is about supporting the rising stars of tomorrow 's European science . ” says European Science and Research Commissioner Janez Potocnik .
It shows that Europe is a real reservoir of talents which is crucial at a time of global competition for knowledge .
It also makes young people enjoy the experience of working together , beyond national borders , in the spirit of the European Research Area we strive to build .
Magdalena Bojarska from Poland - “ Hamiltonian cycles in generalized Halin graphs ”
Three projects received first prizes of € 7,000 each shared by Magdalena Bojarska from Poland for “ Hamiltonian cycles in generalized Halin graphs ” , Martin Tkác from Slovakia for “ Tilting of bulk materials based on gravitation principle in cargo railway transport ” and Elisabeth Muller from the United Kingdom for " From Microcosm to Magma Oceans : A Lunar Meteorite Perspective " .
Other prize winners came from Czech Republic , Germany , Ireland , Belarus , France and Latvia .
For this 20th anniversary of the EUCYS , the European Commission decided to award a Prize for International Cooperation , for the best project from a Third Country ( 1 ) team .
In doing so , the Commission underlined the importance of international scientific cooperation in research .
The prize , worth € 5,000 , was won by Pippa Grierson from New Zealand for " Fighting Facial Eczema " .
The European Union Contest for Young Scientists is part of the EU's Science in Society programme .
Its aim is to encourage young people to pursue their interest in science and embark on scientific careers .
This year the winners were announced at Copenhagen 's superb 19 th century Circus Building , in the presence of the EU Commissioner for Research , Janez Potocnik , HRH Prince Joachim , Princess Marie and the Danish Minister for Science and Technology , Helge Sander .

WHILE campaigning in public for a speedy withdrawal of US troops from Iraq , Sen . Barack Obama has tried in private to persuade Iraqi leaders to delay an agreement on a draw - down of the American military presence .
According to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari , Obama made his demand for delay a key theme of his discussions with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad in July .
“ He asked why we were not prepared to delay an agreement until after the US elections and the formation of a new administration in Washington , ” Zebari said in an interview .
Obama insisted that Congress should be involved in negotiations on the status of US troops – and that it was in the interests of both sides not to have an agreement negotiated by the Bush administration in its “ state of weakness and political confusion . ”
“ However , as an Iraqi , I prefer to have a security agreement that regulates the activities of foreign troops , rather than keeping the matter open . ” Zebari says .
Though Obama claims the US presence is “ illegal , ” he suddenly remembered that Americans troops were in Iraq within the legal framework of a UN mandate .
His advice was that , rather than reach an accord with the “ weakened Bush administration , ” Iraq should seek an extension of the UN mandate .
While in Iraq , Obama also tried to persuade the US commanders , including Gen. David Petraeus , to suggest a “ realistic withdrawal date . ”
They declined .
Obama has made many contradictory statements with regard to Iraq .
His latest position is that US combat troops should be out by 2010 .
Yet his effort to delay an agreement would make that withdrawal deadline impossible to meet .
Supposing he wins , Obama ’s administration would n’t be fully operational before February – and naming a new ambassador to Baghdad and forming a new negotiation team might take longer still .
By then , Iraq will be in the throes of its own campaign season .
Judging by the past two elections , forming a new coalition government may then take three months .
So the Iraqi negotiating team might not be in place until next June .
Then , judging by how long the current talks have taken , restarting the process from scratch would leave the two sides needing at least six months to come up with a draft accord .
That puts us at May 2010 for when the draft might be submitted to the Iraqi parliament – which might well need another six months to pass it into law .
Thus , the 2010 deadline fixed by Obama is a meaningless concept , thrown in as a sop to his anti-war base .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and the Bush administration have a more flexible timetable in mind .
According to Zebari , the envisaged time span is two or three years – departure in 2011 or 2012 .
That would let Iraq hold its next general election , the third since liberation , and resolve a number of domestic political issues .
Even then , the dates mentioned are only “ notional , ” making the timing and the cadence of withdrawal conditional on realities on the ground as appreciated by both sides .
Iraqi leaders are divided over the US election .
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani ( whose party is a member of the Socialist International ) sees Obama as “ a man of the Left ” – who , once elected , might change his opposition to Iraq ’s liberation .
Indeed , say Talabani ’s advisers , a President Obama might be tempted to appropriate the victory that America has already won in Iraq by claiming that his intervention transformed failure into success .
Maliki ’s advisers have persuaded him that Obama will win – but the prime minister worries about the senator ’s “ political debt to the anti-war lobby ” – which is determined to transform Iraq into a disaster to prove that toppling Saddam Hussein was “ the biggest strategic blunder in US history . ”
Other prominent Iraqi leaders , such as Vice President Adel Abdul - Mahdi and Kurdish regional President Massoud Barzani , believe that Sen. John McCain would show “ a more realistic approach to Iraqi issues . ”
Obama has given Iraqis the impression that he does n’t want Iraq to appear anything like a success , let alone a victory , for America .
The reason ?
He fears that the perception of US victory there might revive the Bush Doctrine of “ pre-emptive ” war – that is , removing a threat before it strikes at America .
Despite some usual equivocations on the subject , Obama rejects pre-emption as a legitimate form of self - defense .
To be credible , his foreign - policy philosophy requires Iraq to be seen as a failure , a disaster , a quagmire , a pig with lipstick or any of the other apocalyptic adjectives used by the American defeat industry in the past five years .
Yet Iraq is doing much better than its friends hoped and its enemies feared .
The UN mandate will be extended in December , and we may yet get an agreement on the status of forces before President Bush leaves the White House in January .

When Jon Stewart inaugurated his fake news anchor on The Daily Show eight years ago , his goal was to send up the hyperbolic and manufactured controversy of US Cable News and , if possible , be even more outrageous .
Now , in a wonderful through - the - looking - glass moment , he has supplanted the subjects of his mockery in the country 's current affairs consciousness , and finds himself crowned the bemused voice of reason in an insane world .
The underground comic has become such a cultural touchstone that The New York Times asked this week whether he has become " the most trusted man in America " .
For anyone who has missed the influential anchor , then his take on the way mainstream media peddles false rumours about Barack Obama is instructive .
He calls it " Baracknophobia " and shows clips of blow - dried anchors and experts repeating widely - believed but baseless rumours – that the Democrat is actually a secret Muslim , a plagiarist , a misogynist etc .
The purveyor of fake news lacerates the networks ' talking heads as they blame the internet for rumour mongering about Obama .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The highlight is a straight - faced Mr Stewart saying : " Oh , this is interesting .
SomeguyI'veneverheardof.com is reporting presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama has lady parts .
Obviously scurrilous and unfounded , we 'll examine it tonight in our special , ' Barack Obama 's Vagina : The October Surprise In His Pants ' . "
On the Russia / Georgia conflict
The latest sign of how far the show and its host have come from their edgy early days will come at the Democratic Convention in Denver , where he and his reporters are fully accredited .
When asked last year by the Pew Research Centre to name the journalist they most admired , Americans placed the fake news anchor Mr Stewart at number four on the list .
He was tied with such luminaries as Tom Brokaw of NBC , Dan Rather , then of CBS , and Anderson Cooper of CNN .
The Daily Show and the equally funny and successful Colbert Report shows are broadcast more than 23 times a week , " from Comedy Central 's World News Headquarters in New York " .
The side - street studio on Manhattan 's West Side is not only the undisputed locus of fake news , but it is increasingly the epicentre of real news – administered with a wrapping of college humour .
The whispered advice of a State Department spokesman to a foreign correspondent trying to make sense of American politics was very simple : tune into The Daily Show .
" I watch the reruns every morning at 10.30 , " she said , " it 's the only way to find out what 's really going on . "
On the presidential election
The Daily Show is also a top priority for ambitious politicians and was described by Newsweek as " the coolest pit stop on television " for presidential candidates , world leaders and ex-presidents .
While mainstream news gave an even - handed report on the legacy of the Blair - Bush years after Tony Blair 's farewell visit to Washington last year , The Daily Show tore Mr Blair to ribbons .
One of the programme 's signature techniques – of using video montages showing politicians contradicting themselves – is now a staple technique of mainstream news shows .

Nor is The Daily Show afraid of tackling what it calls " super depressing " stories , such as President George Bush 's decision to approve the use of torture after the September 11 attacks and the unprecedented concentration of executive power by the White House .
Interviews with serious authors such as Seymour Hersh have helped focus attention on potentially illegal acts by the Bush administration and win a wider audience for their work .
Mr Stewart 's frequent outbursts of " Are you insane ? ! " seems to capture the post - M* A * S*H , post - Catch - 22 sensibilities of a country that waged a war in Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
Now , with the most promising candidate in generations running for president , Mr Stewart asks whether the country may be about to reject him at the ballot box because of rumours that he is Muslim .
Interview with Democratic senator Chuck Schumer
The purpose of The Daily Show is to entertain , not inform , Mr Stewart insists , and he likens his job to " throwing spitballs " from the back of the room .
But he and the high - powered writers who work with him like nothing better than tackling the big issues of the day – in ways that straight news programs cannot .
" Hopefully , the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill , " Mr Stewart , 45 , told The New York Times .
" In some respects , the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most ... potential energy , so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion , the most interest .
I do n't mean for the audience .
I mean for us . "
The Daily Show 's success comes from blending the informality and attitude of bloggers with the hard - nosed research and expertise of the best investigative reporters to reveal a new news medium .
Like bloggers , a key to his show 's success is the authenticity that comes from in - depth reporting , combined with stating the blindingly obvious .
Every day begins with a morning meeting where material culled from 15 video recorders , as well as newspapers , magazines and websites , is pored over .
The meeting , Mr Stewart says , " would be very unpleasant for most people to watch : it 's really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset , and the rest of the day is spent trying to ... repress that through whatever creative devices we can find " .
Josh Lieb , one of the executive producers of the show , describes the process as looking for stories that " make us angry in a whole new way " .
Interview with John McCain
By 3 pm a script has been prepared and Mr Stewart 's rehearsals begin .
After an hour of rewrites , taping the show starts at 6 pm .
The fake news anchor may be the antidote to fake news , which has a habit of showing up in American newspapers .
After all , the US government had an initiative in 2005 to plant " positive news " in Iraqi newspapers to sway public opinion about the war .
The Bush administration has worked closely with big business to keep it flowing .
According to Professor Robert Love , of Columbia Journalism School : " They have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming , stem - cell research , evolution , and other matters . "
For all his fakery , Mr Stewart may be pointing the way to the future of news : bluntness and informality fused with ruthless editing and a funny bone which helps to ensure that stories he wants to cover are watched .

48 - year - old lymph node biopsy reveals the history of the deadly virus .
These paraffin - embedded tissue blocks from Kinshasa date from around 1960 , and hold fragments of the HIV genome .
Dirk Teuwen
A biopsy taken from an African woman nearly 50 years ago contains traces of the HIV genome , researchers have found .
Analysis of sequences from the newly discovered sample suggests that the virus has been plaguing humans for almost a century .
Although AIDS was not recognized until the 1980s , HIV was infecting humans well before then .
Researchers hope that by studying the origin and evolution of HIV , they can learn more about how the virus made the leap from chimpanzees to humans , and work out how best to design a vaccine to fight it .
In 1998 , researchers reported the isolation of HIV - 1 sequences from a blood sample taken in 1959 from a Bantu male living in Léopoldville1 — now Kinshasa , the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Analysis of that sample and others suggested that HIV - 1 originates from sometime between 1915 and 19412 .
Now , researchers report in Nature that they have uncovered another historic sample , collected in 1960 from a woman who also lived in Léopoldville3 .
“ It 's as if you had a nice pearl necklace of DNA and RNA and protein and you clumped it together , drenched it in glue and then dried it out . ”
Michael Worobey
University of Arizona in Tucson
It took evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona in Tucson and his colleagues eight years of searching for suitable tissue collections originating in Africa before they tracked down the 1960 lymph node biopsy at the University of Kinshasa .
Drenched in glue
The samples had all been treated with harsh chemicals , embedded in paraffin wax and left at room temperature for decades .
The acidic chemicals had broken the genome up into small fragments .
Formalin , a chemical used to prepare samples for microscopy , had crosslinked nucleic acids with protein .
" It 's as if you had a nice pearl necklace of DNA and RNA and protein and you clumped it together , drenched it in glue and then dried it out , " says Worobey .
The team worked out a combination of methods that would allow them to sequence DNA and RNA from the samples ; another lab at Northwestern University in Chicago , Illinois , confirmed the results , also finding traces of the HIV - 1 genome in the lymph node biopsy .
This photo shows Kinshasa around 1885 , shortly after its founding .
The growth of Kinshasa and other cities in the region may have been crucial to the emergence of HIV / AIDS .
Royal Museum for Central Africa
Using a database of HIV - 1 sequences and an estimate of the rate at which these sequences change over time , the researchers modelled when HIV - 1 first surfaced .
Their results showed that the most likely date for HIV 's emergence was about 1908 , when Léopoldville was emerging as a centre for trade .
Although that date will not surprise most HIV researchers , the new data should help persuade those who were unconvinced by the 1959 sample , says Beatrice Hahn , an HIV researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
The sequences of the 1959 and 1960 samples - the earliest that have ever been found - show a difference of about 12 % .
" This shows very clearly that there was tremendous variation even then , " says Simon Wain - Hobson , a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris .
A virus ready for its close - up
However , it may never be possible to pinpoint exactly how HIV crossed from chimpanzees into humans , Hahn cautions .
She and her collaborators previously tracked the likely source of HIV - 1 to chimpanzees living in southeast Cameroon4 , hundreds of kilometres from Kinshasa , and it is tempting to hypothesize that trade routes contributed to the virus 's infiltration of the city .
But even by 1960 , HIV - 1 had infected only a few thousand Africans .
It is unlikely that it will be possible to track down samples from the very earliest victims , Hahn notes .
Meanwhile , Worobey plans to continue his search through old tissue collections in the hope of finding additional samples .
In time , he says , it may even be possible to reconstruct the historic HIV viruses for further study .
Collecting information about old strains of HIV — even those that disappeared over time — can help researchers learn how successful strains broke through , says Wain - Hobson .
" For every star in Hollywood there are fifty starlets , " he says .
" We would love to know what it was that caused this strain to move out of starlet phase and to the big time . "
OK EVERYONE LISTEN UP I WAS THERE .
I WAS THERE :
At the protest march on the RNC in Saint Paul , MN today 9-2-08 : FULL REPORTIt all began with a concert on the Minnesota Capital lawn in Saint Paul .
The concert began at 3 pm and went until around 7 pm .
It hosted a fine line up of anti-war music acts like Dead Presidents , Michael Franti , Anti-Flag and more .
As well as a number of fine speakers including Iraq Veterans for Peace .
During the entire event the capital lawn which was the venue for this concert was surrounded by color coded teams of fully equipped riot police .
Snipers and spotters were at the tops of nearby buildings .
Helicopters circled overhead .
This concert began around 3 pm and went until about 6 pm .
During the afternoon rumor grew that Rage Against The Machine ( Rage , or RATM ) , a rock group who is an outspoken opponent of Bush administration policies , was going to play at the end of the days events .
The crowd at the state capital swelled to number over 5,000 in anticipation for Rage Against The Machine to play .
Rage Against The Machine began to do sound - check when a cadre of MN State Troopers mingled behind stage .
The crowd booed and became restless chanting " let them play , let them play " and " if you dont let them rage , we will " It was during this time that I came shoulder to shoulder with a Provocateur .
He came seemingly drunkenly stumbling into the tight crowd of people near me and almost knocking over a number of people .
But it was feigned drunkeness as he quickly straightened up and looked around sharply almost shocked that his escapade did not incite some kind of negative reaction which he could use to start a fight and give the riot cops reason to swarm the crowd .
He looked around shocked that no one got mad .... he said : " I really am surrounded by a bunch of pussy hippies " .
He had on clean new creased black pants and a clean new grey sweatshirt .
He had a military haircut and brand new shoes .
I knew he was a Police or Government Hired Provocateur !
These are the worst kind of Police in my opinion ; the ones who start trouble .
I would have confronted him , I wanted too , but he would have started fighting me which was what he wanted and the riot cops would have swarmed the crowd and we would not have been able to march on the RNC and the Excel Energy Center .
Crowd attention was drawn to the side of the stage as a flurry of activity erupted .
It was Rage front man : Zack de la Rocha .
He came out with a loud speaker and told everyone to sit down .
The entire crowd near the man sat and listened and the first hush of the day came upon the crowd .
He told the crowd that the power for the stage had been cut - off because they ( RATM ) didnt have an event permit .
Threatened with arrest which would have prevented them from playing to a SOLD OUT crowd tomorrow night , Sept. 3rd , at the Target Center in Minneapolis for a rally for Ron Paul .
They instead used vocals and fan interaction and sang two of Rage Against The Machines most inspiring songs over the microphone to the enthusiasm of the energetic crowd .
At the end of a chorus of " Fu % $ You I wont do what you tell me " the massive crowd turned their sights on the excel center and surged forward .
The huge crowd which is being spun in MSM news to have been only 500 people when it truly must have been in the 4000 - 6000 person range .
The streets were packed building across street to other building for over 4 blocks of shoulder to shoulder protestors .
The march went into downtown Saint Paul… even led by police cars in an orderly fashion along the “ designated ” parade route .
Spectators many of whom were RNC delegates and RNC personnel watched from rooftop patios and hotel rooms as the marches chanted so loudly it echoed against the buildings downtown .
Chants commonly heard were “ Whos streets ?
Our streets ! ” and “ stop the war , help the poor !
” The march followed the parade route to the fenced - in dead - end ' pen ' which was a block away from the rear of the Excel Energy Center Stadium where the RNC is being held .
The crowd mingled and became restless as darkness fell .
A funny moment I saw came when a riot cop fumbled his mace and dropped it and it rolled away from him to the sound of 1000 people laughing at his fumble .
Rumor spread that if you wanted out , now was the time and sure enough it was apparent that the riot cops were putting their masks on .
The crowd moved out of the fenced in “ pen ” and back down towards the corner of St Peter and 7th where historic Mickey ’s Diner is located .
It was here in the turn of the parade route that a police sergeant used his megaphone to tell everyone to clear the area and that is was an unlawful assembly .
More police came out and formed a double line in a perfect phalanx of riot cops with bike cops behind and mobile horse cops on the move .
The order to disperse seemed only to encourage the crowd to disobey the police .
About half the marchers remained and after a tense standoff flashbang grenades were used along with tear gas and rubber bullets .
The explosions and smoke sent the huge crowd into a stampede .
It is miracle that no one was trampled to death although it is possible that we have not yet heard of the injuries from last night 's protest .
More news will come in the morning for sure .
At the time of the explosions of flashbangs I was about a block or two away heading to my ride .
I heard the bangs and turned around to see smoke filling downtown Saint Paul and masses of people running .
It was truly surreal .
About 10 minutes later as I was walking to my car I came upon a mini van of riot police just waiting with their side door open .
One of them said to me and a friend : “ why do n’t you throw some rocks or something , we ’ve been here all day and have n’t got a chance to get in it "
Then they all chuckled .
It is this mentality which , in my opinion , borders on rampant criminality .
The shear size of this 4 - day army of enforcers required agencies from across MN and the USA to recruit volunteers .
VOLUNTEERS !?
No I dont mean these are unpaid volunteers .
I mean these are paid mercenaries who WANT to put down protesters !
So we get a bunch of trigger happy police who have come here just to get some action .
A short time ago Barack Obama held a rally at the very SAME venue : the Excel Center .
It was there that he accepted his nomination for President by the Democratic Party .
That rally packed the arena and overflowed with 10,000s of supporters outside to watch on TV monitors .
During THAT rally there were only a handful of traffic cops to control pedestrian crossings and the thousands outside the arena were not there to protest like tonight at the RNC , those thousands outside Obama 's rally were n support of what was going on inside the Excel Center .
THE CONTRAST ...RNC and a Republican Focused event at the Excel Energy Center : Thousands of riot cops , FBI , snipers , provocateurs , teargas , flashbangs , fences , and angry loud protesters .
A Democratic event at the Excel Center : A handful of traffic cops required to manage the huge overflow crowd of supporters .
You see this is why we must have a Democrat in office .
A people 's candidate who does n’t need to hide behind a mercenary army of trigger happy stormtroopers .
The city of Saint Paul is a police state tonight .
I am on scene and I will report back the events of the 3rd and 4th as well .
Good night and good luck .
This is the most up to date source of live info from people on site in Minneapolis and Saint Paul which details police movements and protest info .

GOP pollster says voters will shift to Obama over economy David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican pollster Frank Luntz says voters who had been shifting toward John McCain will begin shifting back toward Barack Obama over the next two days .
Luntz , who claimed credit for branding the " Contract With America " in 1994 and shifting debate over global warming to " climate change , " has done polling and focus groups for the Fox News Channel this election cycle .
He appeared on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning to discuss a recent focus group he did with Michigan voters .
The economic crisis that has gripped the country over the last few weeks is beginning to sink in with voters , who are craving " solutions " from the candidates , Luntz said .
" They 've now personalized it to themselves , " he told Fox 's Brian Kilmeade .
" It 's not , ' What 're you going to do about unemployment ? '
It 's , ' What 're you going to do to protect my job ...
What 're you giong to do to lower my gas prices ?
That 's a significant change . "
Kilmead noted that polls had been trending toward McCain , who benefited from an extended post - convention bounce , but Luntz noted that no extensive polling had been done since the Wall Street meltdown that 's dominated headlines this week .
" I'm watching the polling and what 's going to happen over the next 48 hours because I think you might see once again another shift , " he said , noting that economic worries were infecting all sectors of the electorate .
" I think -- having now lived this for 15 years in the mindset of the voters -- that it 's going to trigger an even greater degree of change . "

Consider that the Greenspan Fed maintained a
1.75 % Fed fund for 33 months ( December 2001 to September 2004 ) ,
a 1.25 % for 21 months ( November 2002 to August 2004 ) , and
lastly , a 1 % Fed funds rate for 12 + months , ( June 2003 to June
2004 ) .

But no , I do n’t side with Austrian Business Cycle
Theory in citing loose monetary policy as the main factor in the artificial boom which preceded the crash .
I view the boom as having been fueled by new global wealth , most of all in Asia , and the liquification of that wealth through credit and the desire for additional risk .
Note that if an increase in real wealth fuels the investment boom , consumption can be robust or even go up at the same time as the rise in investment .
Now , in the boom preceding the current bust , was American consumption robust ?
Sure .
If the investment boom had been driven mainly by monetary factors , investment would have gone up and consumption would have gone down , as explained here .
( Try a rebuttal here . )
Loose monetary policy did contribute to the bubble .
In that sense I would defend a modified Austrian theory .
But other reasons also suggest that monetary policy was not the main driver .
Money has a much bigger effect on short - term rates than long - term rates .
Even long - term real rates have only mixed predictive power over real economic activity , including investment .
The Austrians have never developed much of a theory of bubbles .
Ideally you would have a good bubble theory , with Austrian - like monetary factors stirring up the bubble even more .
But you ca n’t get away with pinning so much of the blame on the government , as modern Austrians are wont to do .
" Bubbliness " is a private sector imperfection and relabeling it as " government distorting price signals through monetary policy " does n’t much change that .
Pop some champagne !
The Appeals Court decision [ PDF ] is in on Bilski : I 'm still reading it , but on first quick reading , one thing is clear : it 's a win !
Eligible patent matter just got smaller .
Here 's a snip from the opening :
We affirm the decision of the Board because we conclude that Applicants ' claims are not directed to patent - eligible subject matter , and in doing so , we clarify the standards applicable in determining whether a claimed method constitutes a statutory " process " under § 101 .
This was an appeal against a rejection of a business methods patent , and the appeals court has now agreed with the rejection .
At issue was whether an abstract idea could be eligible for patent protection .
The court says no .
Buh - bye business methods patents !
[ Most of them . ]
I want to thank Red Hat most particularly for its wonderful amicus brief that it filed in this case , for representing the community 's interests and getting certain issues on the court 's radar .
However , the court in footnote 23 does not go as far as one might have hoped , at least not in this case :
Therefore , although invited to do so by several amici , we decline to adopt a broad exclusion over software or any other such category of subject matter beyond the exclusion of claims drawn to fundamental principles set forth by the Supreme Court .
See , e.g. , Br. of Amicus Curiae End Software Patents ; Br. of Amicus Curiae Red Hat , Inc. at 4 - 7 .
We also note that the process claim at issue in this appeal is not , in any event , a software claim .
Thus , the facts here would be largely unhelpful in illuminating the distinction between those software claims that are patent - eligible and those that are not not .
And which is which ?
They just say that they do n't know what the words " technological arts " and " technology " mean , as they are " both ambiguous and ever - changing " .
So they " continue to rely on the machine - or - transformation test as articulated by the Supreme Court . "
You 'll find all that discussed on page 25 .
For now , this court is saying there has to be a machine in the process , not just ideas in your head .
They leave to future cases refinements on software patents .
No doubt there will be some .
Here 's the paragraph on that :
Nevertheless , we agree that future developments in technology and the sciences may present difficult challenges to the machine - or - transformation test , just as the widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has begun to challenge it in the past decade .
Thus , we recognize that the Supreme Court may ultimately decide to alter or perhaps even set aside this test to accommodate emerging technologies .
And we certainly do not rule out the possibility that this court may in the future refine or augment the test or how it is applied .
At present , however , and certainly for the present case , we see no need for such a departure and reaffirm that the machine - or - transformation test , properly applied , is the governing test for determining patent eligibility of a process under § 101 .
There were numerous amici briefs filed , of course , and you can find most of them here on PatentlyO , and many thanks are due .
You can see how many amici briefs there were in the opening , where it lists them all , 4 pages ' worth .
Some were on the side of business methods patents , of course .
My , it 's been a bad month for hedge funds .
The 132 - page PDF includes a concurring opinion , beginning on page 37 of the PDF , and three dissents , either believing the court is going too far , the dissent by Justice Newman beginning on page 57 and one by Justice Rader beginning on page 123 , or thinking it did n't go far enough , by Justice Mayer beginning on page 98 .
You 'll particularly enjoy the dissent by Judge Mayer .
Here 's one taste :
The patent system is intended to protect and promote advances in science and technology , not ideas about how to structure commercial transactions ....
Affording patent protection to business methods lacks constitutional and statutory support , serves to hinder rather than promote innovation and usurps that which rightfully belongs in the public domain ....
State Street has launched a legal tsunami .... Patents granted in the wake of State Street have ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly absurd .
He cites a few .
Here 's my personal favorite : a method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using video displays .
A close second is the patent granted for method of selling expert advice .
The concurring opinion ends like this :
In short , the history of § 101 fully supports the majority 's holding that Bilski 's claim does not recite patentable subject matter .
Our decision does not reflect " legislative " work , but rather careful and respectful adherence to the Congressional purpose .
That 's on page 56 of the PDF .
Here 's the Wall St.Journal : But in today 's ruling , the court largely disavowed the highly controversial 1998 decision , State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group .
That case had granted protection to a system for managing mutual fund accounts .
The State Street decision was widely cheered by the financial - services and software industries , among others .
But ever since its issuance , the State Street case has been a lightning rod among patent practitioners , with detractors largely arguing that it led to a glut of weak patents .
" This is a pretty clear disavowal of State Street , " said Daniel Crowe , a patent litigator at Bryan Cave LLP in St. Louis who was not involved in the case .
" It 's a ruling against the financial services industry . "
Mr. Crowe said he did not know what would happen to the business - method patents validated within the last 10 years .
" That 's definitely an open question . "
So , the fact that the court did not 100 percent disavow all software patents does n't mean it did n't just trim them plenty .
It did .
Here 's how , from a later Wall St. Journal article : Randy Lipsitz , a patent specialist at Kramer Levin in New York says the ruling is likely to hit certain industries , namely insurance , banking , accounting and software , particularly hard .
 You re going to see fewer applications from these industries ,  he says .
And what about the likelihood of the case rising to the Supremes ?
The experts seem torn .
Lipsitz says that given the cases importance  he calls the case one of the most significant ever to be decided by the Federal Circuit  and the High Courts recent fondness for patent cases , he suspects it will go up .
But Bradley Wright , a partner at Banner & Witcoff in Washington , thinks the Federal Circuit has tailored the decision to avoid reversal from above , and therefore any need for the Supremes to take it .
 The Federal Circuit went out of its way to mention Supreme Court precedent ,  he says .
 Id be surprised if cert is granted on this . 
Ah !
Fewer patent applications from the software industry .
That has a lovely ring .
And what about earlier patents granted , and patents threats based upon them ?
Ah !
The analysis begins .
Others are noticing details I missed on first reading , namely that there may be ways to still get some business methods patents , according to this article in BusinessWeek : Kappos said IBM was very pleased  with the courts decision .
 It doesnt spell the complete demise of business - method patents ,  he says ,  But without question it points to a major downsizing . 
In a conference call to discuss the ruling , Accenture representatives acknowledged that the court had not embraced the broad view of patentability that Accenture had pushed for , but emphasized that there was still room to protect business strategies .
While rulings over the years have used various tests to determine if a process qualifies for patenting , the Federal Circuit said the sole analysis should be the machine - or - transformation  test  which requires showing that the claimed invention is either tied to a particular machine or that it transforms an article ( such as a substance or data ) .
At the same time , the majority opinion , joined by 9 of the 12 justices ruling in the case  acknowledged that  the widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet had begun to challenge the usefulness of such a test .
The justices invited the U.S. Supreme Court to develop a new test for determining the kinds of inventions that should be eligible for patent protection , one that might better accommodate emerging technologies .
But the court dodged what for many is a crucial question :
Whether simply employing a computer itself is enough to earn patent eligibility .
CNET has a reaction from Jason Schultz , who authored one of the amicus briefs : " We 've seen a rise in the number of lawsuits against tech companies in the IT area specifically .
Many are very questionable patents , and the patent office is overwhelmed , " said Jason Schultz , acting director of The Samuelson Law , Technology & Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley .
" It will reduce the number of patent applications which are filed in the IT space -- especially by these questionable entities or companies trying to patent trivial things . "
And here 's VentureBeat :
The ruling clarified what types of patents the court found eligible :  ( 1 ) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus , or ( 2 ) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing . 
Ten years ago , the same court had ruled that a useful , concrete , and tangible result also signified that a concept could be patented .
The result , as researchers later showed , was a 3000 percent increase in the number of business method patents between 1995 and 2001 .
We can reasonable expect that to reverse direction now .
PatentlyO's Take : Here 's PatentlyO on the decision , explaining what might still pass : Some Business Methods and Software Are Still In : Still , the court made clear that business methods and Software will still be patentable  if they meet the machine - or - transformation test .
We rejected [ a categorical ] exclusion in State Street , noting that the so - called " business method exception " was unlawful and that business method claims ( and indeed all process claims ) are " subject to the same legal requirements for patentability as applied to any other process or method . "
We reaffirm this conclusion .
[ A ] lthough invited to do so by several amici , we [ also ] decline to adopt a broad exclusion over software or any other such category of subject matter beyond the exclusion of claims drawn to fundamental principles set forth by the Supreme Court
To be clear , the machine - or - transformation test is not a physicality test  i.e. , a claim can still be patentable even if it does not recite sufficient " physical steps . "
Here , the court spelled out the specific issue in mind : a claimed process where every step may be performed entirely in the human mind .
In that situation , the machine - or - transformation test would lead to unpatentability .
" Of course , a claimed process wherein all of the process steps may be performed entirely in the human mind is obviously not tied to any machine and does not transform any article into a different state or thing .
As a result , it would not be patent - eligible under § 101 . "
On the flip - side , " a claim that recites ' physical steps ' but neither recites a particular machine or apparatus , nor transforms any article into a different state or thing , is not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter . "
He also explains what is a transformation , so take a look if you really want to understand that fully .
But here 's the snip he highlights from the court 's ruling :
As the court noted later in the opinion , the transformed articles must be " physical objects or substances [ or ] representative of physical objects or substances . "
The Bilski claims themselves were not seen as transforming an article : Purported transformations or manipulations simply of public or private legal obligations or relationships , business risks , or other such abstractions cannot meet the test because they are not physical objects or substances , and they are not representative of physical objects or substances .
Applicants ' process at most incorporates only such ineligible transformations .
. . .
As discussed earlier , the process as claimed encompasses the exchange of only options , which are simply legal rights to purchase some commodity at a given price in a given time period .
The claim only refers to " transactions " involving the exchange of these legal rights at a " fixed rate corresponding to a risk position . "
Thus , claim 1 does not involve the transformation of any physical object or substance , or an electronic signal representative of any physical object or substance .
The principle behind the test is to prevent a patentee from obtaining claims that preempt the use of fundamental principles .
He also points out that the decision seems to ignore two rulings by the US PTO Board of Patent Appeals , Ex parte Langemyr [ PDF ] and Ex parte Wasynczuk [ PDF ] , which already held that " A general purpose computer is not a particular machine , and thus innovative software processes are unpatentable if they are tied only to a general purpose computer , " an issue this court seems to view as still to be decided by future cases .
And hopefully that is just what will happen next .
What About Microsoft ?
Gene Quinn is writing [ PJ : Note that as of June 28 , 2010 , that link is dead , and he has blocked Internet Archive , but I saved a local copy , and this is what he wrote . ] that it's his opinion that this ruling means the end of software patents as we know them and that State Street in effect is overturned :
The Federal Circuit has overruled State Street and software patents are no longer available as they have come to be available over the last 10 to 15 years .
If you do not agree with these points then you obviously have not read the decision and I suggest that you read the decision before you tell me that I am wrong .
I have thick skin , but reality is quite important to me .
First , you can point to whatever you want in the opinion where the Court said " we are not overruling State Street , " but that does n't change the reality that the Court has done just that .
You know the old question about a dog's leg , right ?
If I were to tell you to assume that the dog's tail is a leg , how many legs would the dog have ?
The answer is 4 , because regardless of whether you call the tail a leg or not the truth is that the tail is a tail and it is never going to be a leg regardless of your desire to call it one .
So , the Federal Circuit can say all they want that State Street has not been overruled , but the reality is that it has been overruled .
The Federal Circuit just did n't do us the honor of being honest and straight forward with us .
The entire point of Judge Rich 's decision in the State Street case was to recognize that a process can be patent worthy even if there is no physical transformation .
He was 100 % correct and this Court has undercut the decision in its entirety .
When the Court says that clearly strikes at the heart of State Street :
The useful , concrete and tangible result inquiry " is insufficient to determine whether a claim is patent - eligible under § 101 . "
" [ W]e also conclude that the " useful , concrete and tangible result " inquiry is inadequate and reaffirm that the machine - or - transformation test outlined by the Supreme Court is the proper test to apply . "
Footnote 19 : " [ T ] hose portions of our opinions in State Street and AT&T relying solely on a " useful , concrete and tangible result " analysis should no longer be relied on . "
If the " useful , concrete and tangible result " inquiry is insufficient and inadequate to determine the existence of patentable subject matter under 101 then State Street has quite clearly been overruled , evicerated , disregarded or whatever you would like to call it .
For crying out loud the majority even said in footnote 19 that the " useful , concrete and tangible result " inquiry can no longer be relied upon !
What else do they have to say in order to get folks to understand that State Street has been overruled ?
Of course , he 's upset .
He 's a patent lawyer , and so to him this is a " stupid " decision , and he points out that he 's upset because " much of the Microsoft patent portfolio has gone up in smoke " and he does n't see how it can protect its software now .
( What ?
Copyright , trademark , trade secret , faux interoperability , standards capture , and dirty tricks are not enough ?
They worked for Microsoft when it was building its business , prior to State Street . )
As his partner , John White said to him today , " Microsoft does n't make machines . "
He may have forgotten that Microsoft submitted an amicus brief [ PDF ] with Dell asking that patents not be issued unless tied to a computer and resulting in a transformation .
By my reading , Microsoft got what it asked for on that .
Do n't forget that Microsoft also gets sued over stupid patents and has an interest in some rationality to the process .
The court went further than it asked for , in tossing out the useful , concrete and tangible language , and that 's what Quinn is disturbed about , and probably Microsoft is too .
I agree with Quinn for sure on one thing : it 's a good day for Open Source .
Here 's the take by the Practicing Law Institute .
They also see it as meaning that software patents are more or less over .
" In order to protect what was formerly known as patentable software we will have to go back to claiming a machine that provides certain functionality . "
And no doubt they 'll be scrambling to do exactly that .
The dissenting opinion by Mayer also predicts workarounds will result from the decision :
The majority 's proposed " machine - or - transformation test " for patentability will do little to stem the growth of patents on non-technological methods and ideas .
Quite simply , in the context of business method patent applications , the majority 's proposed standard can be too easily circumvented ....
Through clever draftsmanship , nearly every process claim can be rewritten to include a physical transformation .
This is on page 118 of the PDF .
It 's true , and they 'll try , but the patent world has just changed , and that has made all the difference .
Quinn has written a followup also , and here 's one paragraph : I have been asked in the comments to my other posts what patents I thought would be useless now thanks to the Bilski decision .
After doing a quick analysis I was quite surprised .
There are easily thousands of patents that now have claims that are invalid , but many of these patents will remain because they have been written properly and have tied at least certain aspects of the invention to a system or apparatus .
It seems clear to me , however , that the broadest , strongest claims are now lost .
The method and computer code claims , which are now lost , were the truly significant claims providing the most protection .
He provides a short and selective list of patents he believes are now invalid , due to this decision , mainly patents from IBM 's portfolio .
He elaborates on his misery about this ruling making software patents hard to obtain on IP Watchdog also .
Here 's the decision as a quick text version to help you follow along , minus the dissents , which I hope to provide later .
For some reason , it 's the custom to only list the last names or initials of the judges , but Law.com provides some of them in Mike Scarcella 's coverage : Paul Michel , Chief Judge

MICHEL , Chief Judge .
Bernard L. Bilski and Rand A. Warsaw ( collectively , " Applicants " ) appeal from the final decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( " Board " ) sustaining the rejection of all eleven claims of their U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/833,892 ( " 892 application " ) .
See Ex parte Bilski , No. 2002-2257 , 2006 WL 5738364 ( B.P.A.I. Sept. 26 , 2006 ) ( " Board Decision " ) .
Specifically , Applicants argue that the examiner erroneously rejected the claims as not directed to patent - eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 , and that the Board erred in upholding that rejection .
The appeal was originally argued before a panel of the court on October 1 , 2007 .
Prior to disposition by the panel , however , we sua sponte ordered en banc review .
Oral argument before the en banc court was held on May 8 , 2008 .
We affirm the decision of the Board because we conclude that Applicants ' claims are not directed to patent - eligible subject matter , and in doing so , we clarify the standards applicable in determining whether a claimed method constitutes a statutory " process " under § 101 .
I. Applicants filed their patent application on April 10 , 1997 .
The application contains eleven claims , which Applicants argue together here .
Claim 1 reads :
A method for managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider at a fixed price comprising the steps of : ( a ) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages , said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumer ; ( b ) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter - risk position to said consumers ; and ( c ) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions ' 892 application cl.1 .
In essence , the claim is for a method of hedging risk in the field of commodities trading .
For example , coal power plants ( i.e. , the " consumers " ) purchase coal to produce electricity and are averse to the risk of a spike in demand for coal since such a spike would increase the price and their costs .
Conversely , coal mining companies ( i.e. , the " market participants " ) are averse to the risk of a sudden drop in demand for coal since such a drop would reduce their sales and depress prices .
The claimed method envisions an intermediary , the " commodity provider , " that sells coal to 2 the power plants at a fixed price , thus isolating the power plants from the possibility of a spike in demand increasing the price of coal above the fixed price .
The same provider buys coal from mining companies at a second fixed price , thereby isolating the mining companies from the possibility that a drop in demand would lower prices below that fixed price .
And the provider has thus hedged its risk ; if demand and prices skyrocket , it has sold coal at a disadvantageous price but has bought coal at an advantageous price , and vice versa if demand and prices fall .
Importantly , however , the claim is not limited to transactions involving actual commodities , and the application discloses that the recited transactions may simply involve options , i.e. , rights to purchase or sell the commodity at a particular price within a particular timeframe .
See J.A. at 86 - 87 .
The examiner ultimately rejected claims 1 - 11 under 35 U.S.C. § 101 , stating : " [ r ] egarding . . . claims 1 - 11 , the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [ an ] abstract idea and solves a purely mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application , therefore , the invention is not directed to the technological arts . "
See Board Decision , slip op . at 3 .
The examiner noted that Applicants had admitted their claims are not limited to operation on a computer , and he concluded that they were not limited by any specific apparatus .
See id . at 4 .
On appeal , the Board held that the examiner erred to the extent he relied on a " technological arts " test because the case law does not support such a test .
Id. at 41 - 42 .
Further , the Board held that the requirement of a specific apparatus was also erroneous because a claim that does not recite a specific apparatus may still be directed to patent - eligible subject matter " if there is a transformation of physical subject matter from one state to another . "
Id. at 42 .
Elaborating further , the Board stated : 3 " ' mixing ' two elements or compounds to produce a chemical substance or mixture is clearly a statutory transformation although no apparatus is claimed to perform the step and although the step could be performed manually . "
Id .
But the Board concluded that Applicants ' claims do not involve any patent - eligible transformation , holding that transformation of " non-physical financial risks and legal liabilities of the commodity provider , the consumer , and the market participants " is not patent - eligible subject matter .
Id. at 43 .
The Board also held that Applicants ' claims " preempt [ ] any and every possible way of performing the steps of the [ claimed process ] , by human or by any kind of machine or by any combination thereof , " and thus concluded that they only claim an abstract idea ineligible for patent protection .
Id. at 46 - 47 .
Finally , the Board held that Applicants ' process as claimed did not produce a " useful , concrete and tangible result , " and for this reason as well was not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
Id. at 49 - 50 .
Applicants timely appealed to this court under 35 U.S.C. § 141 .
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( A ) .
II .
Whether a claim is drawn to patent - eligible subject matter under § 101 is a threshold inquiry , and any claim of an application failing the requirements of § 101 must be rejected even if it meets all of the other legal requirements of patentability .
In re Comiskey , 499 F.3d 1365 , 1371 ( Fed. Cir. 2007 ) ( quoting Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 4 584 , 593 ( 1978 ) ) ; In re Bergy , 596 F.2d 952 , 960 ( CCPA 1979 ) , vacated as moot sub nom .
Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 444 U.S. 1028 ( 1980 ) .
Whether a claim is drawn to patent - eligible subject matter under § 101 is an issue of law that we review de novo .
Comiskey , 499 F.3d at 1373 ; AT&T Corp. v. Excel Commc'ns , Inc . , 172 F.3d 1352 , 1355 ( Fed. Cir. 1998 ) .
Although claim construction , which we also review de novo , is an important first step in a § 101 analysis , see State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin. Group , 149 F.3d 1368 , 1370 ( Fed. Cir. 1998 ) ( noting that whether a claim is invalid under § 101 " is a matter of both claim construction and statutory construction " ) , there is no claim construction dispute in this appeal .
We review issues of statutory interpretation such as this one de novo as well .
Id . A . As this appeal turns on whether Applicants ' invention as claimed meets the requirements set forth in § 101 , we begin with the words of the statute :
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof , may obtain a patent therefor , subject to the conditions and requirements of this title .
35 U.S.C. § 101 .
The statute thus recites four categories of patent - eligible subject matter : processes , machines , manufactures , and compositions of matter .
It is undisputed that Applicants ' claims are not directed to a machine , manufacture , or composition of matter .
Thus , the issue before us involves what the term " process " in 5 § 101 means , and how to determine whether a given claim -- and Applicants ' claim 1 in particular -- is a " new and useful process . "
As several amici have argued , the term " process " is ordinarily broad in meaning , at least in general lay usage .
In 1952 , at the time Congress amended § 101 to include " process , " the ordinary meaning of the term was : " [ a ] procedure . . . [ a ] series of actions , motions , or operations definitely conducing to an end , whether voluntary or involuntary . "
WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1972 ( 2d ed. 1952 ) .
There can be no dispute that Applicants ' claim would meet this definition of " process . "
But the Supreme Court has held that the meaning of " process " as used in § 101 is narrower than its ordinary meaning .
See Flook , 437 U.S. at 588-89 ( " The holding [ in Benson ] forecloses a purely literal reading of § 101 . " ) .
Specifically , the Court has held that a claim is not a patent - eligible " process " if it claims " laws of nature , natural phenomena , [ or ] abstract ideas . "
Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 , 185 ( 1981 ) ( citing Flook , 437 U.S. at 589 , and Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 , 67 ( 1972 ) ) .
Such 6 fundamental principles are " part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to all men and reserved exclusively to none . "
Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co . , 333 U.S. 127 , 130 ( 1948 ) ; see also Le Roy v. Tatham , 55 U.S. ( 14 How . ) 156 , 175 ( 1852 ) ( " A principle , in the abstract , is a fundamental truth ; an original cause ; a motive ; these cannot be patented , as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right . " ) .
" Phenomena of nature , though just discovered , mental processes , and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable , as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work . "
Benson , 409 U.S. at 67 ; see also Comiskey , 499 F.3d at 1378 - 79 ( holding that " mental processes , " " processes of human thinking , " and " systems that depend for their operation on human intelligence alone " are not patent - eligible subject matter under Benson ) .
The true issue before us then is whether Applicants are seeking to claim a fundamental principle ( such as an abstract idea ) or a mental process .
And the underlying legal question thus presented is what test or set of criteria governs the determination by the Patent and Trademark Office ( " PTO " ) or courts as to whether a claim to a process is patentable under § 101 or , conversely , is drawn to unpatentable subject matter because it claims only a fundamental principle .
The Supreme Court last addressed this issue in 1981 in Diehr , which concerned a patent application seeking to claim a process for producing cured synthetic rubber products .
450 U.S. at 177-79 .
The claimed process took temperature readings during cure and used a mathematical algorithm , the Arrhenius equation , to calculate the time when curing would be complete .
Id .
Noting that a mathematical algorithm alone is 7 unpatentable because mathematical relationships are akin to a law of nature , the Court nevertheless held that the claimed process was patent - eligible subject matter , stating : [ The inventors ] do not seek to patent a mathematical formula .
Instead , they seek patent protection for a process of curing synthetic rubber .
Their process admittedly employs a well - known mathematical equation , but they do not seek to pre-empt the use of that equation .
Rather , they seek only to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process .
Id. at 187 ( emphasis added ) .
The Court declared that while a claim drawn to a fundamental principle is unpatentable , " an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection . "
Id. ( emphasis in original ) ; see also Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am . , 306 U.S. 86 , 94 ( 1939 ) ( " While a scientific truth , or the mathematical expression of it , is not a patentable invention , a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be . " ) .
The Court in Diehr thus drew a distinction between those claims that " seek to pre-empt the use of " a fundamental principle , on the one hand , and claims that seek only to foreclose others from using a particular " application " of that fundamental principle , on the other .
450 U.S. at 187 .
Patents , by definition , grant the power to exclude others from practicing that which the patent claims .
Diehr can be understood to suggest that whether a claim is drawn only to a fundamental principle is essentially an inquiry into the scope of that exclusion ; i.e. , whether the effect of allowing the claim 8 would be to allow the patentee to pre-empt substantially all uses of that fundamental principle .
If so , the claim is not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
In Diehr , the Court held that the claims at issue did not pre-empt all uses of the Arrhenius equation but rather claimed only " a process for curing rubber . . . which incorporates in it a more efficient solution of the equation . "
450 U.S. at 188 .
The process as claimed included several specific steps to control the curing of rubber more precisely : " These include installing rubber in a press , closing the mold , constantly determining the temperature of the mold , constantly recalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of the formula and a digital computer , and automatically opening the press at the proper time . "
Id. at 187 .
Thus , one would still be able to use the Arrhenius equation in any process not involving curing rubber , and more importantly , even in any process to cure rubber that did not include performing " all of the other steps in their claimed process . "
See id . ; see also Tilghman v. Proctor , 102 U.S. 707 , 729 ( 1880 ) ( holding patentable a process of breaking down fat molecules into fatty acids and glycerine in water specifically requiring both high heat and high pressure since other processes , known or as yet unknown , using the reaction of water and fat molecules were not claimed ) .
In contrast to Diehr , the earlier Benson case presented the Court with claims drawn to a process of converting data in binary - coded decimal ( " BCD " ) format to pure binary format via an algorithm programmed onto a digital computer .
Benson , 409 U.S. at 65 .
The Court held the claims to be drawn to unpatentable subject matter :
It is conceded that one may not patent an idea .
But in practical effect that would be the result if the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure binary numerals were patented in this case .
The mathematical formula involved here has no substantial practical application except in connection 9 with a digital computer , which means that if the judgment below is affirmed , the patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself .
Id. at 71 -72 ( emphasis added ) .
Because the algorithm had no uses other than those that would be covered by the claims ( i.e. , any conversion of BCD to pure binary on a digital computer ) , the claims pre-empted all uses of the algorithm and thus they were effectively drawn to the algorithm itself .
See also O'Reilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. ( 15 How . ) 62 , 113 ( 1853 ) ( holding ineligible a claim pre-empting all uses of electromagnetism to print characters at a distance ) .
The question before us then is whether Applicants ' claim recites a fundamental principle and , if so , whether it would pre-empt substantially all uses of that fundamental principle if allowed .
Unfortunately , this inquiry is hardly straightforward .
How does one determine whether a given claim would pre-empt all uses of a fundamental principle ?
Analogizing to the facts of Diehr or Benson is of limited usefulness because the more challenging process claims of the twenty - first century are seldom so clearly limited in scope as the highly specific , plainly corporeal industrial manufacturing process of Diehr ; nor are they typically as broadly claimed or purely abstract and mathematical as the algorithm of Benson .
The Supreme Court , however , has enunciated a definitive test to determine whether a process claim is tailored narrowly enough to encompass only a particular application of a fundamental principle rather than to pre-empt the principle itself .
A claimed process is surely patent - eligible under § 101 if : ( 1 ) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus , or ( 2 ) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing .
See Benson , 409 U.S. at 70 ( " Transformation and reduction of an article ' to a 10 different state or thing ' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines . " ) ;
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 192 ( holding that use of mathematical formula in process " transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing " constitutes patent - eligible subject matter ) ; see also Flook , 437 U.S. at 589 n. 9 ( " An argument can be made [ that the Supreme ] Court has only recognized a process as within the statutory definition when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or operated to change materials to a ' different state or thing ' " ) ;
Cochrane v. Deener , 94 U.S. 780 , 788 ( 1876 ) ( " A process is . . . an act , or a series of acts , performed upon the subject - matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing . " ) .
A claimed process involving a fundamental principle that uses a particular machine or apparatus would not pre-empt uses of the principle that do not also use the specified machine or apparatus in the manner claimed .
And a claimed process that transforms a particular article to a specified different state or thing by applying a fundamental principle would not pre-empt the use of the principle to transform any other article , to transform the same article but in a manner not covered by the claim , or to do anything other than transform the specified article .
The process claimed in Diehr , for example , clearly met both criteria .
The process operated on a computerized rubber curing apparatus and transformed raw , uncured rubber into molded , cured rubber products .
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 184 , 187 .
The claim at issue in Flook , in contrast , was directed to using a particular mathematical formula to calculate an " alarm limit " - - a value that would indicate an abnormal condition during an 11 unspecified chemical reaction .
437 U.S. at 586 .
The Court rejected the claim as drawn to the formula itself because the claim did not include any limitations specifying " how to select the appropriate margin of safety , the weighting factor , or any of the other variables . . . the chemical processes at work , the [ mechanism for ] monitoring of process variables , or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an alarm system . "
See id. at 586 , 595 .
The claim thus was not limited to any particular chemical ( or other ) transformation ; nor was it tied to any specific machine or apparatus for any of its process steps , such as the selection or monitoring of variables or the setting off or adjusting of the alarm .
See id .
A canvas of earlier Supreme Court cases reveals that the results of those decisions were also consistent with the machine - or - transformation test later articulated in Benson and reaffirmed in Diehr .
See Tilghman , 102 U.S. at 729 ( particular process of transforming fats into constituent compounds held patentable ) ; Cochrane , 94 U.S. at 785-88 ( process transforming grain meal into purified flour held patentable ) ; Morse , 56 U.S. ( 15 How . ) at 113 ( process of using electromagnetism to print characters at a distance that was not transformative or tied to any particular apparatus held unpatentable ) .
Interestingly , Benson presents a difficult case under its own test in that the claimed process operated on a machine , a digital computer , but was still held to be 12 ineligible subject matter .
However , in Benson , the limitations tying the process to a computer were not actually limiting because the fundamental principle at issue , a particular algorithm , had no utility other than operating on a digital computer .
Benson , 409 U.S. at 71 - 72 .
Thus , the claim 's tie to a digital computer did not reduce the pre-emptive footprint of the claim since all uses of the algorithm were still covered by the claim .
B. Applicants and several amici have argued that the Supreme Court did not intend the machine - or - transformation test to be the sole test governing § 101 analyses .
As already noted , however , the Court explicitly stated in Benson that " [ t ] ransformation and reduction of an article ' to a different state or thing ' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines . "
409 U.S. at 70 ( emphasis added ) .
And the Court itself later noted in Flook that at least so far it had " only 13 recognized a process as within the statutory definition when it either was tied to a particular apparatus or operated to change materials to a ' different state or thing . ' "
437 U.S. at 589 n.9 .
Finally , the Court in Diehr once again applied the machine - or - transformation test in its most recent decision regarding the patentability of processes under § 101 .
450 U.S. at 184 .
We recognize , however , that the Court was initially equivocal in first putting forward this test in Benson .
As the Applicants and several amici point out , the Court there stated :
It is argued that a process patent must either be tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or materials to a ' different state or thing . '
We do not hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet the requirements of our prior precedents .
Benson , 409 U.S. at 71 .
In Flook , the Court took note that this statement had been made in Benson but merely stated : " As in Benson , we assume that a valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet [ the machine - or - transformation test ] . "
437 U.S. at 589 n. 9 ( emphasis added ) .
And this caveat was not repeated in Diehr when the Court reaffirmed the machine - or - transformation test .
See Diehr , 450 U.S. at 184 ( quoting Benson , 409 U.S. at 70 ) ( " Transformation and reduction of an article ' to a different state or thing ' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines . " ) .
Therefore , we believe our reliance on the Supreme Court 's machine - or - transformation test as the applicable test for § 101 analyses of process claims is sound .
Nevertheless , we agree that future developments in technology and the sciences may present difficult challenges to the machine - or - transformation test , just as the widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has begun to challenge it in 14 the past decade .
Thus , we recognize that the Supreme Court may ultimately decide to alter or perhaps even set aside this test to accommodate emerging technologies .
And we certainly do not rule out the possibility that this court may in the future refine or augment the test or how it is applied .
At present , however , and certainly for the present case , we see no need for such a departure and reaffirm that the machine - or - transformation test , properly applied , is the governing test for determining patent eligibility of a process under § 101 .
C . As a corollary , the Diehr Court also held that mere field - of - use limitations are generally insufficient to render an otherwise ineligible process claim patent - eligible .
See 450 U.S. at 191-92 ( noting that ineligibility under § 101 " cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment " ) .
We recognize that tension may be seen between this consideration and the Court 's overall goal of preventing the wholesale pre-emption of fundamental principles .
Why not permit patentees to avoid overbroad pre-emption by limiting claim scope to particular fields of use ?
This tension is resolved , however , by recalling the purpose behind the Supreme Court 's discussion of pre-emption , namely that pre-emption is merely an indication that a claim seeks to cover a fundamental principle itself rather 15 than only a specific application of that principle .
See id . at 187 ; Benson , 409 U.S. at 71 -72 .
Pre-emption of all uses of a fundamental principle in all fields and pre-emption of all uses of the principle in only one field both indicate that the claim is not limited to a particular application of the principle .
See Diehr , 450 U.S. at 193 n.14 ( " A mathematical formula in the abstract is nonstatutory subject matter regardless of whether the patent is intended to cover all uses of the formula or only limited uses . " ) ( emphasis added ) .
In contrast , a claim that is tied to a particular machine or brings about a particular transformation of a particular article does not pre-empt all uses of a fundamental principle in any field but rather is limited to a particular use , a specific application .
Therefore , it is not drawn to the principle in the abstract .
The Diehr Court also reaffirmed a second corollary to the machine - or - transformation test by stating that " insignificant postsolution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process . "
Id. at 191- 92 ; see also Flook , 437 U.S. at 590 ( " The notion that post - solution activity , no matter how conventional or obvious in itself , can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance . " ) .
The Court in Flook reasoned : A competent draftsman could attach some form of post - solution activity to almost any mathematical formula ; the Pythagorean theorem would not have been patentable , or partially patentable , because a patent application contained a final step indicating that the formula , when solved , could be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques .
437 U.S. at 590 .
Therefore , even if a claim recites a specific machine or a particular transformation of a specific article , the recited machine or transformation must not 16 constitute mere " insignificant postsolution activity . "
D. We discern two other important aspects of the Supreme Court 's § 101 jurisprudence .
First , the Court has held that whether a claimed process is novel or non-obvious is irrelevant to the § 101 analysis .
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 188-91 .
Rather , such considerations are governed by 35 U.S.C. § 102 ( novelty ) and § 103 ( non-obviousness ) .
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 188-91 .
Although § 101 refers to " new and useful " processes , it is overall " a general statement of the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent protection ' subject to the conditions and requirements of this title . ' "
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 189 ( quoting § 101 ) .
As the legislative history of § 101 indicates , Congress did not intend the " new and useful " language of § 101 to constitute an independent requirement of novelty or non-obviousness distinct from the more specific and detailed requirements of §§ 102 and 103 , respectively .
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 190 - 91 .
So here , it is irrelevant to the § 101 analysis whether Applicants ' claimed process is novel or non-obvious .
Second , the Court has made clear that it is inappropriate to determine the patent - eligibility of a claim as a whole based on whether selected limitations constitute patent - 17 eligible subject matter .
Flook , 437 U.S. at 594 ( " Our approach to respondent 's application is , however , not at all inconsistent with the view that a patent claim must be considered as a whole . " ) ;
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 188 ( " It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis . " ) .
After all , even though a fundamental principle itself is not patent - eligible , processes incorporating a fundamental principle may be patent - eligible .
Thus , it is irrelevant that any individual step or limitation of such processes by itself would be unpatentable under § 101 .
See In re Alappat , 33 F.3d 1526 , 1543 -44 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) ( en banc ) ( citing Diehr , 450 U.S. at 187 ) .
III .
In the years following the Supreme Court 's decisions in Benson , Flook , and Diehr , our predecessor court and this court have reviewed numerous cases presenting a wide variety of process claims , some in technology areas unimaginable when those seminal Supreme Court cases were heard .
Looking to these precedents , we find a wealth of detailed guidance and helpful examples on how to determine the patent - eligibility of process claims .
A . Before we turn to our precedents , however , we first address the issue of whether several other purported articulations of § 101 tests are valid and useful .
The first of these is known as the Freeman - Walter - Abele test after the three decisions of our predecessor court that formulated and then refined the test :
In re Freeman , 573 F.2d 1237 ( CCPA 1978 ) ; In re Walter , 618 F.2d 758 ( CCPA 1980 ) ; and In re Abele , 684 F.2d 18 902 ( CCPA 1982 ) .
This test , in its final form , had two steps : ( 1 ) determining whether the claim recites an " algorithm " within the meaning of Benson , then ( 2 ) determining whether that algorithm is " applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps . "
Abele , 684 F.2d at 905-07 .
Some may question the continued viability of this test , arguing that it appears to conflict with the Supreme Court 's proscription against dissecting a claim and evaluating patent - eligibility on the basis of individual limitations .
See Flook , 437 U.S. at 594 ( requiring analysis of claim as a whole in § 101 analysis ) ; see also AT&T , 172 F.3d at 1359 ; State St . , 149 F.3d at 1374 .
In light of the present opinion , we conclude that the Freeman - Walter - Abele test is inadequate .
Indeed , we have already recognized that a claim failing that test may nonetheless be patent - eligible .
See In re Grams , 888 F.2d 835 , 838-39 ( Fed. Cir. 1989 ) .
Rather , the machine - or - transformation test is the applicable test for patent - eligible subject matter .
The second articulation we now revisit is the " useful , concrete , and tangible result " language associated with State Street , although first set forth in Alappat .
State St . , 149 F.3d at 1373 ( " Today , we hold that the transformation of data , representing discrete dollar amounts , by a machine through a series of mathematical calculations into a final share price , constitutes a [ patent - eligible invention ] because it produces ' a useful , concrete and tangible result ' . . . . " ) ;
Alappat , 33 F.3d at 1544 ( " This is not a 19 disembodied mathematical concept which may be characterized as an ' abstract idea , ' but rather a specific machine to produce a useful , concrete , and tangible result . " ) ; see also AT&T , 172 F.3d at 1357 ( " Because the claimed process applies the Boolean principle to produce a useful , concrete , tangible result without pre-empting other uses of the mathematical principle , on its face the claimed process comfortably falls within the scope of § 101 . " ) .
The basis for this language in State Street and Alappat was that the Supreme Court has explained that " certain types of mathematical subject matter , standing alone , represent nothing more than abstract ideas until reduced to some type of practical application . "
Alappat , 33 F.3d at 1543 ; see also State St . , 149 F.3d at 1373 .
To be sure , a process tied to a particular machine , or transforming or reducing a particular article into a different state or thing , will generally produce a " concrete " and " tangible " result as those terms were used in our prior decisions .
But while looking for " a useful , concrete and tangible result " may in many instances provide useful indications of whether a claim is drawn to a fundamental principle or a practical application of such a principle , that inquiry is insufficient to determine whether a claim is patent - eligible under § 101 .
And it was certainly never intended to supplant the Supreme Court 's test .
Therefore , we also conclude that the " useful , concrete and tangible result " inquiry is inadequate and reaffirm that the machine - or - transformation test outlined by the Supreme Court is the proper test to apply .
20
We next turn to the so - called " technological arts test " that some amici urge us to adopt .
We perceive that the contours of such a test , however , would be unclear because the meanings of the terms " technological arts " and " technology " are both ambiguous and ever - changing .
And no such test has ever been explicitly adopted by the Supreme Court , this court , or our predecessor court , as the Board correctly observed here .
Therefore , we decline to do so and continue to rely on the machine - or - transformation test as articulated by the Supreme Court .
We further reject calls for categorical exclusions beyond those for fundamental principles already identified by the Supreme Court .
We rejected just such an exclusion in State Street , noting that the so - called " business method exception " was unlawful and that business method claims ( and indeed all process claims ) are " subject to the same legal requirements for patentability as applied to any other process or method . "
149 F.3d at 1375 - 76 .
We reaffirm this conclusion .
21 Lastly , we address a possible misunderstanding of our decision in Comiskey .
Some may suggest that Comiskey implicitly applied a new § 101 test that bars any claim reciting a mental process that lacks significant " physical steps . "
We did not so hold , nor did we announce any new test at all in Comiskey .
Rather , we simply recognized that the Supreme Court has held that mental processes , like fundamental principles , are excluded by § 101 because " ' [ p ] henomena of nature , though just discovered , mental processes , and abstract intellectual concepts . . . are the basic tools of scientific and technological work . ' "
Comiskey , 499 F.3d at 1377 ( quoting Benson , 409 U.S. at 67 ) ( emphasis added ) .
And we actually applied the machine - or - transformation test to determine whether various claims at issue were drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
Id. at 1379 ( " Comiskey has conceded that these claims do not require a machine , and these claims evidently do not describe a process of manufacture or a process for the alteration of a composition of matter . " ) .
Because those claims failed the machine - or - transformation test , we held that they were drawn solely to a fundamental principle , the mental process of arbitrating a dispute , and were thus not patent - eligible under § 101 .
Id. 22 Further , not only did we not rely on a " physical steps " test in Comiskey , but we have criticized such an approach to the § 101 analysis in earlier decisions .
In AT&T , we rejected a " physical limitations " test and noted that " the mere fact that a claimed invention involves inputting numbers , calculating numbers , outputting numbers , and storing numbers , in and of itself , would not render it nonstatutory subject matter . "
172 F.3d at 1359 ( quoting State St . , 149 F.3d at 1374 ) .
The same reasoning applies when the claim at issue recites fundamental principles other than mathematical algorithms .
Thus , the proper inquiry under § 101 is not whether the process claim recites sufficient " physical steps , " but rather whether the claim meets the machine - or - transformation test .
As a result , even a claim that recites " physical steps " but neither recites a particular machine or apparatus , nor transforms any article into a different state or thing , is not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
Conversely , a claim that purportedly lacks any " physical steps " but is still tied to a machine or achieves an eligible transformation passes muster under § 101 .
B . With these preliminary issues resolved , we now turn to how our case law elaborates on the § 101 analysis set forth by the Supreme Court .
To the extent that some of the reasoning in these decisions relied on considerations or tests , such as " useful , concrete and tangible result , " that are no longer valid as explained above , those aspects of the decisions should no longer be relied on .
Thus , we reexamine the facts of 23 certain cases under the correct test to glean greater guidance as to how to perform the § 101 analysis using the machine - or - transformation test .
The machine - or - transformation test is a two - branched inquiry ; an applicant may show that a process claim satisfies § 101 either by showing that his claim is tied to a particular machine , or by showing that his claim transforms an article .
See Benson , 409 U.S. at 70 .
Certain considerations are applicable to analysis under either branch .
First , as illustrated by Benson and discussed below , the use of a specific machine or transformation of an article must impose meaningful limits on the claim 's scope to impart patent - eligibility .
See Benson , 409 U.S. at 71 -72 .
Second , the involvement of the machine or transformation in the claimed process must not merely be insignificant extra-solution activity .
See Flook , 437 U.S. at 590 .
As to machine implementation , Applicants themselves admit that the language of claim 1 does not limit any process step to any specific machine or apparatus .
See Appellants ' Br. at 11 .
As a result , issues specific to the machine implementation part of the test are not before us today .
We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation , as well as the answers to particular questions , such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine .
We will , however , consider some of our past cases to gain insight into the transformation part of the test .
A claimed process is patent - eligible if it transforms an article into a different state or thing .
This transformation must be central to the purpose of the claimed process .
But the main aspect of the transformation test that requires clarification here is what sorts of things constitute " articles " such that their 24 transformation is sufficient to impart patent - eligibility under § 101 .
It is virtually self - evident that a process for a chemical or physical transformation of physical objects or substances is patent - eligible subject matter .
As the Supreme Court stated in Benson : [ T ]he arts of tanning , dyeing , making waterproof cloth , vulcanizing India rubber , smelting ores . . . are instances , however , where the use of chemical substances or physical acts , such as temperature control , changes articles or materials .
The chemical process or the physical acts which transform the raw material are , however , sufficiently definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds .
409 U.S. at 70 ( quoting Corning v. Burden , 56 U.S. ( 15 How . ) 252 , 267-68 ( 1854 ) ) ; see also Diehr , 450 U.S. at 184 ( process of curing rubber ) ; Tilghman , 102 U.S. at 729 ( process of reducing fats into constituent acids and glycerine ) .
The raw materials of many information - age processes , however , are electronic signals and electronically - manipulated data .
And some so - called business methods , such as that claimed in the present case , involve the manipulation of even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations , organizational relationships , and business risks .
Which , if any , of these processes qualify as a transformation or reduction of an article into a different state or thing constituting patent - eligible subject matter ?
Our case law has taken a measured approach to this question , and we see no reason here to expand the boundaries of what constitutes patent - eligible transformations of articles .
Our predecessor court 's mixed result in Abele illustrates this point .
There , we held unpatentable a broad independent claim reciting a process of graphically displaying variances of data from average values .
Abele , 684 F.2d at 909 .
That claim did not specify any particular type or nature of data ; nor did it specify how or from where the data was obtained or what the data represented .
Id . ; see also In re Meyer , 688 F.2d 25 789 , 792-93 ( CCPA 1982 ) ( process claim involving undefined " complex system " and indeterminate " factors " drawn from unspecified " testing " not patent - eligible ) .
In contrast , we held one of Abele 's dependent claims to be drawn to patent - eligible subject matter where it specified that " said data is X - ray attenuation data produced in a two dimensional field by a computed tomography scanner . "
Abele , 684 F.2d at 908-09 .
This data clearly represented physical and tangible objects , namely the structure of bones , organs , and other body tissues .
Thus , the transformation of that raw data into a particular visual depiction of a physical object on a display was sufficient to render that more narrowly - claimed process patent - eligible .
We further note for clarity that the electronic transformation of the data itself into a visual depiction in Abele was sufficient ; the claim was not required to involve any transformation of the underlying physical object that the data represented .
We believe this is faithful to the concern the Supreme Court articulated as the basis for the machine - or - transformation test , namely the prevention of pre-emption of fundamental principles .
So long as the claimed process is limited to a practical application of a fundamental principle to transform specific data , and the claim is limited to a visual depiction that represents specific physical objects or substances , there is no danger that the scope of the claim would wholly pre-empt all uses of the principle .
This court and our predecessor court have frequently stated that adding a data - gathering step to an algorithm is insufficient to convert that algorithm into a patent - eligible process .
E.g . , Grams , 888 F.2d at 840 ( step of " deriv[ing ] data for the algorithm will not render the claim statutory " ) ; Meyer , 688 F.2d at 794 ( " [ data - gathering ] step [s ] cannot make an otherwise nonstatutory claim statutory " ) .
For example , in Grams we 26 held unpatentable a process of performing a clinical test and , based on the data from that test , determining if an abnormality existed and possible causes of any abnormality .
888 F.2d at 837 , 841 .
We rejected the claim because it was merely an algorithm combined with a data - gathering step .
Id. at 839-41 .
We note that , at least in most cases , gathering data would not constitute a transformation of any article .
A requirement simply that data inputs be gathered -- without specifying how -- is a meaningless limit on a claim to an algorithm because every algorithm inherently requires the gathering of data inputs .
Grams , 888 F.2d at 839-40 .
Further , the inherent step of gathering data can also fairly be characterized as insignificant extra-solution activity .
See Flook , 437 U.S. at 590 .
Similarly ,
In re Schrader presented claims directed to a method of conducting an auction of multiple items in which the winning bids were selected in a manner that maximized the total price of all the items ( rather than to the highest individual bid for each item separately ) .
22 F.3d 290 , 291 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) .
We held the claims to be drawn to unpatentable subject matter , namely a mathematical optimization algorithm .
Id. at 293-94 .
No specific machine or apparatus was recited .
The claimed method did require a step of recording the bids on each item , though no particular manner of recording ( e.g. , on paper , on a computer ) was specified .
Id .
But , relying on Flook , we held that this step constituted insignificant extra-solution activity .
Id. at 294 . IV .
We now turn to the facts of this case .
As outlined above , the operative question before this court is whether Applicants ' claim 1 satisfies the transformation branch of the machine - or - transformation test .
27 We hold that the Applicants ' process as claimed does not transform any article to a different state or thing .
Purported transformations or manipulations simply of public or private legal obligations or relationships , business risks , or other such abstractions cannot meet the test because they are not physical objects or substances , and they are not representative of physical objects or substances .
Applicants ' process at most incorporates only such ineligible transformations .
See Appellants ' Br. at 11 ( " [ The claimed process ] transforms the relationships between the commodity provider , the consumers and market participants . . . . " ) .
As discussed earlier , the process as claimed encompasses the exchange of only options , which are simply legal rights to purchase some commodity at a given price in a given time period .
See J.A. at 86 - 87 .
The claim only refers to " transactions " involving the exchange of these legal rights at a " fixed rate corresponding to a risk position . "
See 892 application cl.1 .
Thus , claim 1 does not involve the transformation of any physical object or substance , or an electronic signal representative of any physical object or substance .
Given its admitted failure to meet the machine implementation part of the test as well , the claim entirely fails the machine - or - transformation test and is not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
Applicants ' arguments are unavailing because they rely on incorrect or insufficient considerations and do not address their claim 's failure to meet the requirements of the Supreme Court 's machine - or - transformation test .
First , they argue that claim 1 produces " useful , concrete and tangible results . "
But as already discussed , this is insufficient to establish patent - eligibility under § 101 .
Applicants also argue that their claimed process does not comprise only " steps that are totally or substantially practiced in the mind but clearly require physical activity which have [ sic ] a tangible 28 result . "
Appellants ' Br. at 9 .
But as previously discussed , the correct analysis is whether the claim meets the machine - or - transformation test , not whether it recites " physical steps . "
Even if it is true that Applicant 's claim " can only be practiced by a series of physical acts " as they argue , see id .
at 9 , its clear failure to satisfy the machine - or - transformation test is fatal .
Thus , while we agree with Applicants that the only limit to patent - eligibility imposed by Congress is that the invention fall within one of the four categories enumerated in § 101 , we must apply the Supreme Court 's test to determine whether a claim to a process is drawn to a statutory " process " within the meaning of § 101 .
Applied here , Applicants ' claim fails that test so it is not drawn to a " process " under § 101 as that term has been interpreted .
On the other hand , while we agree with the PTO that the machine - or - transformation test is the correct test to apply in determining whether a process claim is patent - eligible under § 101 , we do not agree , as discussed earlier , that this amounts to a " technological arts " test .
See Appellee's Br. at 24 - 28 .
Neither the PTO nor the courts may pay short shrift to the machine - or - transformation test by using purported equivalents or shortcuts such as a " technological arts " requirement .
Rather , the machine - or - transformation test is the only applicable test and must be applied , in light of the guidance provided by the Supreme Court and this court , when evaluating the patent - eligibility of process claims .
When we do so here , however , we must conclude , as the PTO did , that Applicants ' claim fails the test .
Applicants ' claim is similar to the claims we held unpatentable under § 101 in Comiskey .
There , the applicant claimed a process for mandatory arbitration of disputes regarding unilateral documents and bilateral " contractual " documents in which 29 arbitration was required by the language of the document , a dispute regarding the document was arbitrated , and a binding decision resulted from the arbitration .
Comiskey , 499 F.3d at 1368 - 69 .
We held the broadest process claims unpatentable under § 101 because " these claims do not require a machine , and these claims evidently do not describe a process of manufacture or a process for the alteration of a composition of matter . "
Id. at 1379 .
We concluded that the claims were instead drawn to the " mental process " of arbitrating disputes , and that claims to such an " application of [ only ] human intelligence to the solution of practical problems " is no more than a claim to a fundamental principle .
Id. at 1377 -79 ( quoting Benson , 409 U.S. at 67 ( " [ M]ental processes , and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable , as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work . " ) ) .
Just as the Comiskey claims as a whole were directed to the mental process of arbitrating a dispute to decide its resolution , the claimed process here as a whole is directed to the mental and mathematical process of identifying transactions that would hedge risk .
The fact that the claim requires the identified transactions actually to be made does no more to alter the character of the claim as a whole than the fact that the claims in Comiskey required a decision to actually be rendered in the arbitration -- i.e. , in neither case do the claims require the use of any particular machine or achieve any eligible transformation .
We have in fact consistently rejected claims like those in the present appeal and in Comiskey .
For example , in Meyer , the applicant sought to patent a method of diagnosing the location of a malfunction in an unspecified multi-component system that assigned a numerical value , a " factor , " to each component and updated that value 30 based on diagnostic tests of each component .
688 F.2d at 792-93 .
The locations of any malfunctions could thus be deduced from reviewing these " factors . "
The diagnostic tests were not identified , and the " factors " were not tied to any particular measurement ; indeed they could be arbitrary .
Id. at 790 .
We held that the claim was effectively drawn only to " a mathematical algorithm representing a mental process , " and we affirmed the PTO 's rejection on § 101 grounds .
Id. at 796 .
No machine was recited in the claim , and the only potential " transformation " was of the disembodied " factors " from one number to another .
Thus , the claim effectively sought to pre-empt the fundamental mental process of diagnosing the location of a malfunction in a system by noticing that the condition of a particular component had changed .
And as discussed earlier , a similar claim was rejected in Grams .
See 888 F.2d at 839-40 ( rejecting claim to process of diagnosing " abnormal condition " in person by identifying and noticing discrepancies in results of unspecified clinical tests of different parts of body ) .
Similarly to the situations in Meyer and Grams , Applicants here seek to claim a non-transformative process that encompasses a purely mental process of performing requisite mathematical calculations without the aid of a computer or any other device , mentally identifying those transactions that the calculations have revealed would hedge each other 's risks , and performing the post - solution step of consummating those transactions .
Therefore , claim 1 would effectively pre-empt any application of the 31 fundamental concept of hedging and mathematical calculations inherent in hedging ( not even limited to any particular mathematical formula ) .
And while Applicants argue that the scope of this pre-emption is limited to hedging as applied in the area of consumable commodities , the Supreme Court 's reasoning has made clear that effective pre-emption of all applications of hedging even just within the area of consumable commodities is impermissible .
See Diehr , 450 U.S. at 191-92 ( holding that field - of - use limitations are insufficient to impart patent - eligibility to otherwise unpatentable claims drawn to fundamental principles ) .
Moreover , while the claimed process contains physical steps ( initiating , identifying ) , it does not involve transforming an article into a different state or thing .
Therefore , Applicants ' claim is not drawn to patent - eligible subject matter under § 101 .
CONCLUSION
Because the applicable test to determine whether a claim is drawn to a patent - eligible process under § 101 is the machine - or - transformation test set forth by the Supreme Court and clarified herein , and Applicants ' claim here plainly fails that test , the decision of the Board is AFFIRMED .
32 1 Although our decision in Comiskey may be misread by some as requiring in every case that the examiner conduct a § 101 analysis before assessing any other issue of patentability , we did not so hold .
As with any other patentability requirement , an examiner may reject a claim solely on the basis of § 101 .
Or , if the examiner deems it appropriate , she may reject the claim on any other ground (s ) without addressing § 101 .
But given that § 101 is a threshold requirement , claims that are clearly drawn to unpatentable subject matter should be identified and rejected on that basis .
Thus , an examiner should generally first satisfy herself that the application 's claims are drawn to patent - eligible subject matter .
2
As a result , we decline to discuss
In re Nuijten because that decision primarily concerned whether a claim to an electronic signal was drawn to a patent - eligible manufacture .
500 F.3d 1346 , 1356 -57 ( Fed. Cir. 2007 ) .
We note that the PTO did not dispute that the process claims in Nuijten were drawn to patent - eligible subject matter under § 101 and allowed those claims .
3 Congress provided a definition of " process " in 35 U.S.C. § 100 ( b ) : " The term ' process ' means process , art or method , and includes a new use of a known process , machine , manufacture , composition of matter , or material . "
However , this provision is unhelpful given that the definition itself uses the term " process . "
4 The Patent Act of 1793 originally used the term " art " rather than " process , " which remained unchanged until Congress enacted the current version of § 101 in 1952 .
But the Supreme Court has held that this change did not alter the scope of patent eligibility over processes because " [ i ] n the language of the patent law , [ a process ] is an art . "
Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 , 182-84 ( 1981 ) ( quoting Cochrane v. Deener , 94 U.S. 780 , 787-88 ( 1877 ) ) ; see also Comiskey , 499 F.3d at 1375 .
5
As used in this opinion , " fundamental principles " means " laws of nature , natural phenomena , and abstract ideas . "
6 Mathematical algorithms have , in other cases , been identified instead as abstract ideas rather than laws of nature .
See , e.g. , State St. , 149 F.3d at 1373 .
Whether either or both views are correct is immaterial since both laws of nature and abstract ideas are unpatentable under § 101 .
Diehr , 450 U.S. at 185 . 7
While the Court did not give explicit definitions of terms such as " tied to , " " transforms , " or " article , " a careful analysis of its opinions and the subsequent jurisprudence of this court applying those decisions , discussed infra , informs our understanding of the Court 's machine - or - transformation test .
8
To the extent it may be argued that Flook did not explicitly follow the machine - or - transformation test first articulated in Benson , we note that the more recent decision in Diehr reaffirmed the machine - or - transformation test .
See Diehr , 450 U.S. at 191-92 .
Moreover , the Diehr Court explained that Flook " presented a similar situation " to Benson and considered it consistent with the holdings of Diehr and Benson .
Diehr at 186-87 , 189 , 191-92 .
We thus follow the Diehr Court 's understanding of Flook .
9
We acknowledge that the Supreme Court in Benson stated that the claims at issue " were not limited . . . to any particular apparatus or machinery . "
409 U.S. at 64 .
However , the Court immediately thereafter stated : " [ The claims ] purported to cover any use of the claimed method in a general - purpose digital computer of any type . "
Id .
And , as discussed herein , the Court relied for its holding on its understanding that the claimed process pre-empted all uses of the recited algorithm because its only possible use was on a digital computer .
Id. at 71 - 72 .
The Diehr Court , in discussing Benson , relied only on this latter understanding of the Benson claims .
See Diehr , 450 U.S. at 185 - 87 .
We must do the same .
10 See , e.g. , Br. of Amicus Curiae Am. Intellectual Prop. Law Ass'n at 17 - 21 ; Br. of Amicus Curiae Regulatory Datacorp , Inc. at 10 - 15 .
11
We believe that the Supreme Court spoke of the machine - or- transformation test as the " clue " to patent - eligibility because the test is the tool used to determine whether a claim is drawn to a statutory " process " -- the statute does not itself explicitly mention machine implementation or transformation .
We do not consider the word " clue " to indicate that the machine - or - implementation test is optional or merely advisory .
Rather , the Court described it as the clue , not merely " a " clue .
See Benson , 409 U.S. at 70 .
12 The Diehr Court stated : " [ W ] hen a claim containing a mathematical formula implements or applies that formula in a structure or process which , when considered as a whole , is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect ( e.g. , transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing ) , then the claim satisfies the requirements of § 101 . " 450 U.S at 192 ( emphases added ) .
When read together with Benson and Flook , on which the Diehr Court firmly relied , we believe this statement is consistent with the machine - or - transformation test .
But as we noted in AT&T , language such as the use of " e.g. " may indicate the Supreme Court 's recognition that the machine - or - transformation test might require modification in the future .
See AT&T , 172 F.3d at 1358 - 59 .
13
The example of the Pythagorean theorem applied to surveying techniques could also be considered an example of a mere field - of - use limitation .
14 Although the Court spoke of " postsolution " activity , we have recognized that the Court 's reasoning is equally applicable to any insignificant extra-solution activity regardless of where and when it appears in the claimed process .
See In re Schrader , 22 F.3d 290 , 294 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) ( holding a simple recordation step in the middle of the claimed process incapable of imparting patent - eligibility under § 101 ) ; In re Grams , 888 F.2d 835 , 839-40 ( Fed. Cir. 1989 ) ( holding a pre-solution step of gathering data incapable of imparting patent - eligibility under § 101 ) .
15
By the same token , considerations of adequate written description , enablement , best mode , etc. , are also irrelevant to the § 101 analysis because they , too , are governed by other provisions of the Patent Act.
Section 101 does , however , allow for patents only on useful inventions .
Brenner v. Manson , 383 U.S. 519 , 532-35 ( 1966 ) .
16
We note that the PTO , too , has been active in analyzing § 101 law .
See , e.g. , Ex parte Lundgren , 76 USPQ2d 1385 ( B.P.A.I. 2004 ) ; Interim Guidelines for Examination of Patent Applications for Patent Subject Matter Eligibility , Off. Gaz. Pat. & Trademark Office , Nov. 22 , 2005 .
17 Therefore , in Abele , Meyer , Grams , Arrhythmia Research Technology , Inc. v. Corazonix Corp . , 958 F.2d 1053 ( Fed. Cir. 1992 ) , and other decisions , those portions relying solely on the Freeman - Walter - Abele test should no longer be relied on .
18 In State Street , as is often forgotten , we addressed a claim drawn not to a process but to a machine .
149 F.3d at 1371 - 72 ( holding that the means - plus- function elements of the claims on appeal all corresponded to supporting structures disclosed in the written description ) .
19 As a result , those portions of our opinions in State Street and AT&T relying solely on a " useful , concrete and tangible result " analysis should no longer be relied on .
20 See , e.g. , Br. of Amicus Curiae Consumers Union et al. at 6 - 10 ; Br. of Amicus Curiae William Mitchell Coll. of Law Intellectual Prop. Inst. at 14 - 15 . 21 Compare Appellee's Br. at 24-28 ( arguing that patents should be reserved only for " technological " inventions that " involve [ ] the application of science or mathematics , " thereby excluding " non-technological inventions " such as " activities whose ability to achieve their claimed goals depended solely on contract formation " ) , with Br. of Amicus Curiae Regulatory Datacorp , Inc. at 19 - 24 ( arguing that " innovations in business , finance , and other applied economic fields plainly qualify as ' technological ' " since " a fair definition of technological is ' characterized by the practical application of knowledge in a particular field ' " and because modern economics has " a closer affinity to physics and engineering than to liberal arts like English literature " ) .
22 See , e.g. , Br. of Amicus Curiae Fin. Servs. Indus. at 20 ( " [ E]xtending patent protection to pure methods of doing business . . . is contrary to the constitutional and statutory basis for granting patent monopolies . . . . " ) .
23
Therefore , although invited to do so by several amici , we decline to adopt a broad exclusion over software or any other such category of subject matter beyond the exclusion of claims drawn to fundamental principles set forth by the Supreme Court .
See , e.g. , Br. of Amicus Curiae End Software Patents ; Br. of Amicus Curiae Red Hat , Inc. at 4 - 7 .
We also note that the process claim at issue in this appeal is not , in any event , a software claim .
Thus , the facts here would be largely unhelpful in illuminating the distinction between those software claims that are patent - eligible and those that are not not .
24 Our statement in Comiskey that " a claim reciting an algorithm or abstract idea can state statutory subject matter only if , as employed in the process , it is embodied in , operates on , transforms , or otherwise involves another class of statutory subject matter , i.e. , a machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , " 499 F.3d at 1376 , was simply a summarization of the Supreme Court 's machine - or - transformation test and should not be understood as altering that test .
25 Thus , it is simply inapposite to the § 101 analysis whether the process steps performed by software on a computer are sufficiently " physical . "
26
Of course , a claimed process wherein all of the process steps may be performed entirely in the human mind is obviously not tied to any machine and does not transform any article into a different state or thing .
As a result , it would not be patent - eligible under § 101 .
27
We note that several Justices of the Supreme Court , in a dissent to a dismissal of a writ of certiorari , expressed their view that a similar claim in Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories , Inc . was drawn to unpatentable subject matter .
126 S. Ct. 2921 , 2927 - 28 ( 2006 ) ( Breyer , J. , dissenting ; joined by Stevens , J. , and Souter , J. ) .
There , the claimed process only comprised the steps of : ( 1 ) " assaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total homocysteine , " and ( 2 ) " correlating an elevated level of total homocysteine in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or folate . "

We all know things are looking tough economically , and with no easy fixes in sight , many think saving money is " the new black . "
With our love of computers and game consoles and home entertainment systems , geeks ( and GeekDads ) are n't always the thriftiest consumers , but we can all use a few tips on how to save some credits without compromising on our geeky lifestyles .
So here are a few ideas for tightening the belt around your geeky household , with average potential savings for each :
Do n't buy movies on DVD or Blu - Ray .
What 's the point , really ?
Unless you 're going to watch them more than , say , once a year , you lose almost the entire value the minute you drive them off the lot .
The first natural , geeky answer is to rent .
Brick - and - mortar is dead , of course , because any money you would save you spend on the gas and mileage driving back and forth to the store .
No , Netflix is the default these days .
If you , for example , buy one new title a month , you 'd spend between $ 240 and $ 360 a year on movies ( more for Blu - Ray ) .
Netflix will rent you two movies a month for $ 5 , or $ 60 a year .
That 's some handy spare change .
Potential savings : $ 240 a year .
Do n't rent movies .
But what if you already have Netflix , and need to tighten the belt a little deeper ?
The standard 1 movie - at - a - time , unlimited package is $ 10 a month ( $ 11 if you get Blu - Ray ) , so that 's a $ 120 - $ 132 a year sinkhole .
How about starting a DVD - sharing club with your friends and neighbors ?
If everyone chipped in for a copy of Delicious Library ( $ 40 ) ( assuming you or someone you know has a Mac ) and built a database of all the movies everyone already owned , and one person acted as secretary , folks could check movies out to each other .
Potential savings : $ 86 a year ( or more , if the software cost is shared ) .
Free Yourself from Cable / Satellite :
What if the cable / satellite bill is sapping money that could be better spent on comic books and Warhammer figures ( anywhere between $ 40 and $ 100 per mon__ __th ) ?
Now it 's time to get a little geekier , a little more advanved .
Drop your Comcast , cancel your DirectTV , and realize that there 's as much , or more entertainment to be found on the internet .
NBC is putting almost everything it shows on Hulu a day later , and a lot of its back catalog ( sweet ST : TOS , how we love thee ) ( late addition : we note that potential Hulu - competitor , Joost is coming out of beta , as well , so there 's lots of broadcast content available online ) .
CBS just made a deal to do the same on YouTube via their new higher - definition formats .
Freeware apps like Miro ( the former Democracy Player ) make your computer into a Tivo for video podcasts ( as will iTunes , with a little less polish ) .
And , as most geeks have older computer lying around , you could turn one into a media center using one of the various freeware media center apps available ( XBMC , MythTv ) .
Potential savings : $ 840 a year .
Free Yourself from Your Phones : Getting even a little more extreme , what about having no landline ( maybe $ 30 per month ) or cell phone ( $ 30 to $ 80 per month ) at all ?
Consider that , if you 're reading this , you can probably get a Skype In phone number with a $ 10 per month subscription that gets you a phone number anyone can call you with from anywhere , and that you can call anyone with your Skype client from your computer .
There is even word that people can call your Skype In number , and you can answer and talk on an iPod Touch ( $ 229 ) using Fring ( free ) .
You might also be able to use Fring on a cheap cellphone handset with some kind of minimum plan that gets you wifi and save as well .
Potential savings : $ 280 the first year , $ 540 per year after that .
Other Ideas :
Remember to turn off your computers / electronics when you 're not at home .
Shut them off at the wall with a power strip or similar device to save yourself from the power vampire effect .
Potential Savings : $ 100 a year or more .
If you must keep your computer equipment running , why not keep your home office in your sleeping quarters ?
Then the excess heat from the processors will help warm the space , and you can turn the thermostat down .
Potential savings : who knows ; depends upon whether you 've overclocked or not .
Compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere in your house .
Potential savings : $ 100 a year or more , power plus replacement costs .
That 's all just a start , and we 've found more than $ 1,500 a year potential savings !
But I 'm sure there 's even more that can be done , and I hope people reading this post will suggest some more in the comments .
Update : I wanted to pull a few of the very good ideas that have been mentioned in the comments up and into the post .
Thanks for all your input , folks !

Carnegie Mellon 's Robotics Institute and Caterpillar Inc .
To Automate Large Off Highway Haul Trucks PITTSBURGH
—
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University 's Robotics Institute are working with colleagues at Caterpillar Inc. to develop autonomous versions of large haul trucks used in mining operations .
The Robotics Institute will be adapting more than a decade 's worth of its research into self - driving vehicles for use with Caterpillar 's two largest haul trucks , each with payload capacities of 240 tons or more .
This is the first major project resulting from a three - year master agreement for sponsored research signed last year by Carnegie Mellon and Caterpillar , the world 's leading manufacturer of construction , mining and other heavy equipment .
Researchers at the Robotics Institute 's National Robotics Engineering Center ( NREC ) will work closely with Caterpillar 's Pittsburgh Automation Center , which opened in September 2007 .
" We 've assembled a great team of people from across the institute who are excited to play a major role in delivering this groundbreaking capability , " said Tony Stentz , the principal investigator and associate director of the NREC .
" This project is one of many allowing researchers and engineers from the National Robotics Engineering Center and Caterpillar to create innovative solutions for differentiated Cat products and services , with increased speed to market , " said Sam Kherat , manager of the Pittsburgh Automation Center .
The driverless haul truck is part of an autonomous mining haulage system that Caterpillar recently announced it is developing with BHP Billiton Ltd. , a leading global resources company .
Plans call for autonomous trucks to be integrated into some BHP Billiton mine sites by 2010 .
The autonomous technology is designed to provide productivity gains through more consistency in processes .
It is expected that autonomous mining will help minimize environmental impact by both improved efficiency and overall mine safety .
The Carnegie Mellon team will be adapting perception , planning and autonomous software architectures that it originally developed for the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency 's ( DARPA ) UGCV - PerceptOR ( UPI ) autonomous vehicle program and the DARPA Urban Challenge robot race .
Caterpillar , based in Peoria , Ill. , was a major sponsor of the Carnegie Mellon Tartan Racing team that won the $ 2 million Urban Challenge race in Victorville , Calif . , last November .
" This is a perfect example of how Caterpillar 's long - term relationship with Carnegie Mellon can strengthen our position as the industry 's technical leader , " said Gwenne Henricks , vice president of Caterpillar 's Electronics & Connected Worksite Division .

WIKILEAKS STAFF ( Wikileaks )
September 17 , 2008
The internet activist group ' anonymous ' , famed for its exposure of unethical behavior by the Scientology cult , has now gone after the Alaskan govenor and republican Vice - Presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
At around midnight last night some members affiliated with the group gained access to governor Palin 's email account " gov.palin@yahoo.com " and handed over the contents to the government sunshine site Wikileaks.org .
One of the family photos from the account
Governor Palin has come under media criticism in the past week for using private email accounts to avoid Alaskan freedom of information laws .
The contents of the mailbox show this to be true and also hold clues of at least one other Yahoo based mail account held by Palin , " gov.sarah@yahoo.com " .
The zip archive made available by Wikileaks contains screen shots of Palin 's inbox , two example emails , address book and a couple of family photos .
The list of correspondence , together with the account name tends to re-enforce the earlier criticism of Palin 's email use .
The list of emails include an exchange with Alaskan Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell about his campaign for Congress .
Another screenshot shows Palin 's inbox and an e-mail from Amy McCorkell , whom Palin appointed to the Governor 's Advisory Board on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse in 2007 .
The e-mail , a message of support to Palin , tells her not to let negative press get to her and asks Palin to pray for McCorkell , who writes that " I need strength to 1 . keep employment , 2 . not have to choose . "
According to Kim Zetter of Wired Magazine , McCorkell confirmed that she did send the e-mail to Palin .
Subsequently tests by Wikileaks reveal that both Palin's " gov.palin@yahoo.com " and her unrelated " gov.sarah@yahoo.com " account have now been deleted , almost certainly by Palin herself .
According to the Guardian , who has looked at the Wikileaks data , among the emails in Palin 's account were several from addresses belonging to her aides , including a draft letter to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , a discussion of nominations to the state court of appeals , and several bearing " DPS " , the acronym for the Alaska Department of Public Safety .
DPS supervises the Alaska state troopers .
Could the e-mails in question be relevant to the brewing ethics storm over Palin 's push to sack her former brother - in - law from the force ?
The contact list included also holds accounts for other official representative 's private email accounts , including those of Alaska 's Kris Perry and Sharon Leighow .

See
Americans , rich or poor , have consciously or otherwise bought into the master - nation proposition that really bad things do not happen to the USA .
We might suffer setbacks and commit a blunder once in a while , but we are too big , too rich , too smart , too powerful and too blessed to be visited by a national catastrophe .
That the whole goddamn economy could melt right out from under our feet is an unimaginable event , an occurrence out of history when crackly voiced recordings captured President Franklin Roosevelt talking to the Okies .
Such disasters may overtake Argentines or Malaysians or Bulgarians or Russians or even , occasionally , the English , but not the red , white and blue über-nation .
Yet in the space of a year the U.S. has gone from über-nation to under-nation , or at least a nation under water as hundreds of thousands have lost their jobs , been tossed out of their homes and seen the savings of a lifetime decimated .
Americans have seen many of the most respected business institutions revealed as organizations run by confidence men whose cupidity is yoked to their pride and their stupidity in believing that they could run their ruinous games forever .
Bad Money By Kevin Phillips Viking , 256 pages
At this juncture the dimensions of the disaster are not clear .
An honest count would show 10 or 11 percent of the labor force is out of work .
If the numbers continue to climb at the present rate , by this time next year they will begin to match those of the gray days of the New Deal era .
By then we may begin to tell each other that none of this misery had to happen .
There was no end of warnings and no one was more prescient or more persistent in foretelling what lay in store for us than Kevin Phillips .
In the long run up to the vortex , Phillips was one of those who repeatedly warned of what was coming .
No one did it more cogently , more learnedly and more forcefully than he .
In his new book , “ Bad Money , ” Phillips discusses why so few paid attention to a topic so important to their own well - being .
“ Many people today think that today ’s finance is too complicated for ordinary citizens to fathom or handle .
Bubbles aside , other financial terms used by the media — credit derivatives , securitization , and even current account deficit — do not lend themselves to conversations in neighborhood bars or beauty parlors .
Americans are excusing themselves accordingly , ” writes Phillips .
“ Still , if the farmers of more than a century ago could study and understand Sherman Silver Purchase
Act provisions and details of the nationwide currency shrinkage — and many studied and somehow managed — ca n’t we expect as much today ? ”
Answering his own question , Phillips says , “ Alas , probably not , ” and , given that many 21st - century Americans have the power of concentration of a flea with attention deficit disorder , one cannot argue with him .
Had they heeded what he was saying , the disaster engulfing them and much of the world might have been mitigated .
But it is still not too late to learn from Phillips .
“ Bad Money ” is a map describing the economic terrain in which we are struggling to stay upright and slightly solvent .
It is a clearly written treatise demanding no knowledge of Greek letter formulas , one which ought to command the attention and interest of such non-fleas as there may be left among us .
For them this is a useful book because it does not address bailouts and the other hysterical emergency measures which dominate the news , stopgap remedies and economic analgesics though they may be .
Temporary relief from pain not withstanding , Kevin Phillips lays out the actualities which must be dealt with before the throbbing will stop .
He begins by describing a distorted economy whose profits have no material reality other than notations on paper or electronic digits .
That is the bad money from which the book draws its title , sterile money , not so much earned as won by financial manipulations and “ products ” whose names we have just recently learned , to our loss .
Phillips quotes Raymond Dalio of Bridgewater Associates : “ The money that ’s made for manufacturing stuff is a pittance in comparison to the amount of money made from shuffling money around .
Forty - four percent of all corporate profits in the U.S. come from the financial sector compared with only 10 percent from the manufacturing center . ”
Sixty years ago , Phillips writes , about 30 percent of the American gross domestic product was attributable to manufactures and about 10 percent to financial .
The numbers now are approximately reversed .
Until recent times the United States made its living across the globe by selling manufactures and raw material .
In our time , however , under the aegis of the new economy the nation has tried to live by selling nugatory services of a vaguely financial nature to foreigners who have not been buying enough to keep the American economy from going deeper into the red , year upon year .
“ … [ T ] his faith in finance was not new , but old — and it played wayward Pied Piper to prior leading world economic powers , ” Phillips writes .
“ On the edge of decline the Spanish had gloried in their New World gold and silver ; the Dutch , in their investment income and lending to princes and czarinas ; and the British , in their banks , brokers , and global financial network .
In none of these situations , however , could financial services succeed in upholding the national preeminence that had been earlier built by explorers , conquistadores , maritime skills , innovative science and engineering , the first railroads , electrical dynamos , and great iron and steel works .
Invariably , power and greatness passed to new explorers , innovators , and industrialists . ”
He quotes an admonitory passage to the same effect from a 1904 speech to his nation ’s bankers by British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain which might apply to the United States 104 years later : “ Granted that you are the clearinghouse of the world , [ but ] are you entirely beyond anxiety as to the permanence of your great position ? …
Banking is not the creator of our prosperity , but it is the creation of it .
It is not the cause of our wealth , but it is the consequence of our wealth . ”
With the ascendancy of finance comes the maldistribution of capital .
Money is invested in the wrong places .
Gigantic amounts of capital are borrowed for unproductive purpose , for things which have no payback .
“ The debt the United States has been piling on in the last few years has provided only 30 - 40 percent as much stimulus per dollar to the national economy as did the debt added 25 or 40 years ago .
Why ? ” Phillips asks .
“ Because money borrowed in 1970 or 1984 to be spent on factories , new jet fighter aircraft , teachers , or interstate highways had a lot more grassroots impact than money borrowed by 10,000 hedge funds to double the leverage of their various self - serving speculations . ”
Bad Money By Kevin Phillips Viking , 256 pages
Roads , factories , research , productive companies , education are undercapitalized , the money which might have been sent in their direction having been sucked off into the catastrophic frivolities of Wall Street , Greenwich , Conn. , and wasteful finance .
Capital which ought to have been used to lower costs and increase productivity was used to play the destructive games which have left once healthy corporate organizations gasping for breath , too weak to modernize , too depleted to compete and too fragile to prosper .
The distraining of capital to all the wrong places was accompanied by the debt - credit explosion .
As pesky and difficult as contending with public indebtedness , especially the federal deficit , is , Phillips foresaw that it is private - sector debt which is likely to destroy us .
On this he quotes Warren Buffett , another figure who warned that the country was steering toward catastrophe : “ You ca n’t turn a financial toad into a prince by securitizing it .
…
Wall Street started believing its own PR on this — they started holding the stuff themselves , maybe because they could n’t sell it .
It worked wonderfully until it did n’t work at all .
Wall Street is reaping what they ’ve sown . ”
Beyond Wall Street ’s suffering for Wall Street ’s crimes , Phillips describes the American descent into a debt - dependent economy in which the most important activities have been building subdivisions and erecting malls with money borrowed from abroad .
The middle - class masses drive home to the houses they cannot afford and zoom off to overly hypothecated malls , using oil they have no means to pay for , in order to incur additional debt on their credit cards .
The risks of a financial system constructed of toothpicks were plain to Phillips and scores of others outside of it and to none within .
With the assistance of battalions of idiot savants from MIT and Harvard , the much admired math “ quants , ” the investment bankers boasted that they had found a way to ensure that the more borrowed the less the risk .
While Wall Street entertained the fantasy that it had perfected an algorithm which had eliminated risk from the financial equation , ordinary people were finding their lives increasingly uncertain .
The ascent of Wall Street to something approximating total power , however brief that reign may be , has brought with it awareness of the disparities of wealth and income .
Less publicity has been given to how much riskier life has become for America ’s middle class .
Ordinary families face a 1 - in - 5 chance of seeing their incomes drop by half , according to figures compiled before the present “ slowdown ” or “ slump ” or “ weakening ” or recession .
Phillips recalls the work of Harvard ’s Elizabeth Warren , quoting her that “ middle - class families have been threatened on every front . …
Even with two paychecks , family finances are stretched so thin that a very small misstep can leave them in crisis .
As tough as life has become for married couples , single - parent families face even more financial obstacles in trying to carve out middle - class lives on a single paycheck .
And at the same time that families are facing higher costs and increased risks , the old - fashioned rules of credit have been rewritten by powerful corporate interests that see middle - class families as the spoils of political influence . ”
As for the future , Phillips ’ attitude is decidedly saturnine .
Long years of national prosperity and success , he fears , breed political arteriosclerosis , making change next to impossible .
His assessment of the Democrats is anything but hopeful : “ Gone on the Democratic side is the southern and western geography of opposition to northeastern financial elites under the aegis of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson , Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman .
Instead , there is a new democratic politics of new national elites — financial , high - tech and communications . …
For both parties , the bottom line is usually the same : the bottom line .
Fundraising .
Money . ”
“ Bad Money ” was finished before Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination , but the points Phillips makes about the connection between Wall Street and the Democratic Party are still germane .
Robert Rubin , an oft mentioned Obama adviser , was Bill Clinton ’s secretary of the treasury and is an ex-CEO of Goldman Sachs and presently in top management at Citigroup .
Of Rubin and the other Wall Street Democrats , Phillips writes : “ The new profinance Democrats were not the same as the older profinance Republicans .
They were more engaging , less out of the Union League of Philadelphia or 1950s New Yorker cartoons .
Behind the scenes , some might contentedly bailout endangered bondholders , put impoverished nations through the behavioral wringer of the International Monetary Fund , or operate consumer finance units that bilked a lower income clientele .
But in their public personas , most took a different tack .
In deference to their multiple Democratic coalition - mates , they donated to the NAACP ; joined the boards of environmental groups ; embraced technology , education , free trade and globalization ; and worried about the growing international gap between the rich and the poor as well as the gap in the United States .
There was also , as we ’ve seen , another broader enabler : the new popular acceptance of finance . ”
This is not the message of rebirth and hope of the Obama campaign , but Phillips has a long track record and a good one .
He is no man to ignore .

He is the author of numerous books , including “ Hoax : Why Americans Are Suckered by White House Lies ” and “ Capitalist Fools : Tales of American Business From Carnegie to Forbes to the Milken Gang . ”
The following is an excerpt from the Preface to a modern academic text : Introduction to the Hebrew Bible by John J. Collins .
Augsburg Fortress Press , 2004 .
" The introduction is historical - critical in the sense that it emphasizes that the biblical text is the product of a particular time and place and is rooted in the culture of the ancient Near East .
Since much of the Old Testament tells an ostensibly historical story , questions of historical accuracy must be addressed .
In part , this is a matter of correlating the biblical account with evidence derived from archaeology and other historical sources .
But it also leads to a discussion of the genre of the biblical text .
The historical - like appearance of biblical narrative should not be confused with historiography in the modern sense .
Our best guide to the genre of biblical narrative is the corpus of literature from the ancient Near East that has been recovered over the last two - hundred years .
This introduction , however , is not only historical in orientation .
The primary importance of the Old Testament as scripture lies in its ethical implications .
In some cases biblical material is ethically inspiring - the story of liberation from slavery in Egypt , the Ten Commandments , the preaching of the prophets on social justice .
In other cases , however , it is repellent to modern sensibilities .
The command to slaughter the Canaanites is the showcase example , but there are numerous issues relating to slaves , women , homosexuality , and the death penalty that are , at the very least , controversial in a modern context .
In any of these cases , whether congenial to modern sensibilities or not , this introduction tries to use the biblical text as a springboard for rising issues of enduring importance .
The text is not a source of answers on these issues , but rather a source of questions .
Most students initially see the text though a filter of traditional interpretations .
It is important to appreciate how these traditional interpretations arose , but also to ask how far they are grounded in the biblical text and whether other interpretations are possible . " ( pp. ix - x )

This is not the most consequential answer Sarah Palin has given Charlie Gibson so far , but it ’s indicative :
GIBSON : Have you ever met a foreign head of state ?
PALIN : I have not and I think if you go back in history and you ask that question of many vice presidents , they may have the same answer .
If you look back at the 10 vice presidents since 1960 — Johnson , Humphrey , Agnew , Ford , Rockefeller , Mondale , Bush , Quayle , Gore and Cheney — which of those would not have met a head of state before becoming VP ?
Based on their pre-veep resumes , only Agnew jumps out as a possible candidate for Palin - level isolation .
But I ’m curious about this .
Would Palin be the only veep in the last half century to have had no contact with a foreign head of state before taking office ?
I ’ll update this as readers offer new info .
Late Update :
On it already , ABC News ’ Lisa Chinn reports every veep in the last 32 years has met a head of state before taking office .
Japan 's Nikkei falls over 11 percent Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008
Print This Email This TOKYO ( AFP ) - Japan 's headline Nikkei - 225 index fell more than 11 percent Friday in a massive plunge amid a global financial crisis .
The index lost a whopping 1,042.08 points or 11.38 percent to 8,115.41 in the morning trade before trimming losses .
The headline index continued to fall following an overnight sell off on Wall Street .

After Sarah Palin 's traveling press corps protested a decision not to allow a pool reporter into the Governor 's meetings today with world leaders , the campaign relented , and a CNN producer was on hand .
In the room for only 29 seconds with Sarah Palin and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , CNN's Peter Hamby wrote the following pool report , obtained by Politico .
It 's all after the jump
PALIN POOL REPORT #1
Sept. 23 , 2008
New York , NY
KARZAI MEETING
NOTE : CNN producer was the only editorial member allowed in and graciously offered the play - by - play featured below .
Logistics :
Your pooler was blocked by the campaign from attending the Karzai pool spray , along with other wires and print outlets .
The only media representatives were a TV crew , producer and still four photographers .
Several hours of pleas from different outlets were unsuccessful .
Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt gave this statement to the AP , Reuters and your pooler : “ The decision was made for this to be a photo spray with still cameras and video cameras only . ”
The decision was then reversed and your pool will be allowed in for the remaining two meetings .
More on all of this below .
Now for the news :
Gov. Sarah Palin emerged from the Millennium Broadway hotel at 11:35 am EST in a beige SUV headed for the InterContinental at 111 E. 48th St. Senior policy advisers Randy Scheunemann and Steve Biegun were outside the hotel waiting for her .
Palin was wearing all black .
No sign of Todd or the kids ( your pooler did not see them , but has not confirmed they were not there ) .
Your pooler then ran into the hotel lobby and was restrained from boarding the crowded gold elevator , despite her shouting on behalf of the pool .
The group of cameras returned via another elevator just a few moments later .
When asked for an on - the - record statement , Schmitt offered up the above explanation .
*** From CNN ’s Peter Hamby , who was the only editorial representative allowed in :
The press pool ( still and TV cameras only , plus this producer ) entered into Karzai ’s sizeable suite at the Intercontinental shortly after noon .
One handler , who did not appear to be with the campaign but rather with Karzais ’ entourage , repeatedly said “ No writers , ” and he tried to keep this pooler from entering the room when he saw my notebook .
However , Chris Edwards , Palin ’s deputy chief of staff , allowed me to pass .
Palin was seated in a large chair a few feet from Karzai , with a table in between them .
From the view of the pool cameras , Palin sat on the left , and Karzai to the right .
Seated slightly behind Palin were foreign policy advisers Steve Biegun and Randy Scheunemann , who are accompanying the governor in her motorcade today .
As the pool entered , the Afghan president appeared to be telling Palin about his young son , who was born in January 2007 .
Palin , her legs crossed and at one point patting her heart , was leaning in eagerly and smiling .
Karzai , wearing his traditional clothes but without his trademark karakul hat , was also grinning while discussing the child .
His remarks were unintelligible as the noise from the clicking cameras drowned them out .
This was the only exchange that was heard :
“ What is his name ? , ” Palin asked .
“ Mirwais , ” Karzai responded .
“ Mirwais , which means , ‘ The Light of the House . ’ ”
“ Oh nice , ” Palin responded .
“ He is the only one we have , ” remarked Karzai .
At this point , the pool was hustled out the room and down to the hotel lobby .
Pool was in the room for a grand total of 29 seconds .***
Other notes :
Wallace informed your pooler after the spray that the AP , Reuters and your pooler will be allowed in the photo spray before the Uribe and Kissinger meetings .
Schmitt then returned to the van and said there had been a “ mix up , a miscommunication among staff ” and confirmed that we would be allowed in .
Note : there will be a * background * pen-and - pad briefing after the meetings with Biegun at 3:15 pm at the Millennium hotel .
No word yet on whether it is pooled or open press .

A man by the name of Stefan Nystrom invented a way to generate energy from ocean waves that he claims would cost 5 % of what coal energy does .
He set up a proto - type in Ghana and , initially , claims to have found many potential investors .
However , suddenly problems started to pop up .
The investors , originally extremely enthusiastic , started to back off .
He was offered bribes in order to quit .
Finally , he began to be harassed by Ghanaian police and mercenaries .
He contacted me in hopes of getting protection .
I told him to come to Japan .
He told me he was not allowed to leave the country .
He said they had taken parts from his prototype .
I said I would see what I could do .
Before I could do anything , yesterday I received a disturbing set of phone calls from a very scared sounding Mr. Nystrom .
" They tried to kill me three times today , " he screamed into the phone .
Then I lost contact with him , and his phone has been switched off .
In his last call , he asked me to make his technology public .
So , here below is a description of his technology .
Would people please pass it on and would as many people , in a tribute to a man who has probably been killed by mercenaries hired by the oil industry , and make sure that prototypes are developed .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – Personal incomes plunged in July while consumer spending slowed significantly as the impact of billions of dollars in government rebate checks began to wane .
The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that personal incomes fell by 0.7 percent in July , the biggest drop in nearly three years and a far larger decline than the 0.1 percent decrease analysts expected .
Consumer spending edged up a modest 0.2 percent , in line with expectations , but far below June ’s 0.6 percent rise .
When the impact of rising prices was factored in , spending actually dropped by 0.4 percent in July , the weakest showing for inflation - adjusted spending in more than four years .
The July performance for incomes and spending reinforced worries that the economy , which posted better - than - expected growth in the spring because of the rebate checks , could stumble in coming months as their impact fades .
Some economists worry that overall economic growth , which rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate from April - June , could come in at less than half that pace in the current quarter , and actually could dip into negative territory in the final three months of this year and the first quarter of 2009 .
Back - to - back declines in the gross domestic product , which measures the value of all goods and services produced within the U.S. and is the best barometer of the country ’s economic health , would meet one rule of thumb for a recession .
A gauge of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve remained elevated in July , rising by 0.6 percent .
Over the past 12 months , this inflation gauge tied to consumer spending was up 4.5 percent , the biggest year - over - year increase in more than 17 years .
The surge reflected the big increases that have occurred this year in food and energy costs .
Excluding food and energy , inflation by this measure was up 0.3 percent in July , and 2.4 percent over the past 12 months , still above the Fed ’s comfort zone .
The central bank is caught in a bind between a sluggish economy and rising inflation pressures .
The 0.7 percent drop in personal incomes followed a 0.1 percent rise in June and a 1.8 percent surge in May .
After - tax incomes dropped by an even bigger 1.1 percent in July , following a 1.9 percent decline in June and a 5.7 percent surge in May .
All the income figures were heavily influenced by the rebate checks .
Democrats , including presidential nominee Barack Obama , are calling for the government to pass a second stimulus package to guard against the economy slumping into a deep recession .
But President Bush , concerned about the impact the stimulus payments will have on the budget deficit , has resisted those calls , insisting that the rebate payments will continue to support the economy in coming months .
The administration is already forecasting that the federal budget deficit for the budget year that begins on Oct. 1 will soar to an all - time high in dollar terms of $ 482 billion .
The report on consumer spending also showed that personal savings totaled 1.2 percent of after - tax incomes in July , down from a rate of 2.5 percent in June .

So ... your shiny MySQL database is no longer running and you want to fix it ?
You 've come to the right place !
I 've assembled a list of 7 ways to fix your MySQL database when a simple restart does n't do the trick , or when you have corrupt tables .
Simple MySQL restart : MySQL database allows you to define a different MySQL storage engine for different tables .
The storage engine is the engine used to store and retrieve data .
Most popular storage engines are MyISAM and InnoDB.
MyISAM tables - will - get corrupted eventually .
This is a fact of life .
Luckily , in most cases , MyISAM table corruption is easy to fix .
To fix a single table , connect to your MySQL database and issue a: To fix everything , go with : A lot of times , MyISAM tables will get corrupt and you wo n't even know about it unless you review the log files .
I highly suggest you add this line to yourconfig file .
It will automatically fix MyISAM tables as soon as they become corrupt :
If this does n't help , there are a few tricks you can try .
This is pretty common .
You restart MySQL and the process immediately dies .
Reviewing the log files will tell you another instance of MySQL may be running .
To stop all instances of MySQL : Now you can restart the database and you will have a single running instanceOnce you have a running InnoDB MySQL database , you should never ever change these lines in your / etc / my.cnf file : InnoDB log file size cannot be changed once it has been established .
If you change it , the database will refuse to start .
I 've seen this happen a few times .
Probably some kind of freakish MyISAM bug .
Easily fixed with :
If the auto_increment count goes haywire on a MyISAM table , you will no longer be able to INSERT new records into that table .
You can typically tell the auto_increment counter is malfunctioning , by seeing an auto_increment of - 1 assigned to the last inserted record .
To fix - find the last valid auto_increment id by issuing something like :
And then update the auto_increment counter for that table Your database is getting hit with more connections than it can handle and now you cannot even connect to the database yourself .
First , stop the database :
If that does n't help you can try " killall mysql " and " killall mysqld " Once the database stopped , edit your / etc / my.cnf file and increase the number of connections .
Do n't go crazy with this number or you 'll bring your entire machine down .
On a dedicated database machine we typically use :
Try restarting the database and see if that helps .
If you 're getting bombarded with queries and you need to be able to connect to the database to make some table changes , set a different port number in your / etc / my.cnf file , start the database , make any changes , then update the port back to normal ( master - port = 3306 ) and restart .
InnoDB tables are my favorite .
Transactional , reliable and unlike MyISAM , InnoDB supports concurrent writes into the same table .
InnoDB 's internal recovery mechanism is pretty good .
If the database crashes , InnoDB will attempt to fix everything by running the log file from the last timestamp .
In most cases it will succeed and the entire process is transparent .
Unfortunately if InnoDB fails to repair itself , the - entire - database will not start .
MySQL will exit with an error message and your entire database will be offline .
You can try to restart the database again and again , but if the repair process fails - the database will refuse to start .
This is one reason why you should always run a master / master setup when using InnoDB - have a redundant master if one fails to start .
Before you go any further , review MySQL log file and confirm the database is not starting due to InnoDB corruption .
There are tricks to update InnoDB 's internal log counter so that it skips the queries causing the crash , but in our experience this is not a good idea .
You lose data consistency and will often break replication .
Once you have corrupt InnoDB tables that are preventing your database from starting , you should follow this five step process : Step 1 : Add this line to your / etc / my.cnf configuration file : Step 2 : Restart MySQL .
Your database will now start , but with innodb_force_recovery , all INSERTs and UPDATEs will be ignored .
Step 3 : Dump all tablesStep 4 : Shutdown database and delete the data directory .
Run mysql_install_db to create MySQL default tablesStep 5 : Remove the innodb_force_recovery line from your / etc / my.cnf file and restart the database .
( It should start normally now ) Step 6 : Restore everything from your backup

The Iraqi defense minister 's top military adviser , General Mohan al - Furayji , in beige camo , inspects an M1A1 Abrams tank .
Iraq is considering buying 140 of them in a deal that could be worth as much as $ 2.16 billion .
BESMAYA COMBAT TRAINING CENTER , Iraq 
The Iraqi general grabbed the hull of America 's No. 1 battle tank and gave it a shake .
" It 's very hot , " said Gen . Mohan al - Furayji , the Iraqi defense minister 's top military adviser .
" I 'm afraid my soldiers wo n't be able to operate behind these tanks . "
His concerns threatened to derail an arms deal worth as much $ 2.16 billion .
That alarmed Brig .
Gen. Charles Luckey , who , on this sweltering day in the desert , was a salesman of sorts .
You could even say he is the U.S. military 's senior used - tank salesman .
Luckey is the U.S. officer in charge of foreign military sales to Iraq .
It 's his job to move the merchandise .
" For as little as $ 300 you can get a blast deflector to deal with the heat , " Luckey said .
" I might even throw them in for free for you , " he added , sweetening the deal .
Iraq is fast becoming one of the United States ' top customers for military sales .
Since January 2007 , Iraq has spent $ 3.1 billion on U.S. weapons .
That number looks likely to grow exponentially as Iraq uses its vast unspent reserves of petrodollars to develop its army into a force capable of defending its borders against hostile neighbors .
In the past two months alone , the Pentagon has alerted Congress of a possible $ 8.7 billion worth of additional military sales to Iraq , for everything from lightweight attack helicopters to armored ambulances to binoculars .
Here in the Iraqi desert 35 miles east of Baghdad , the latest deal was going down .
Iraq 's Ministry of Defense is aiming to upgrade its tank fleet , which is composed largely of run-down Soviet tanks from the 1970s .
It is considering buying 140 of the United States ' most advanced tanks , at approximately $ 4 million to $ 5 million per tank , plus hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of support equipment to go along with the tanks .
Feting one of its biggest customers , the U.S. arranged for a tank platoon to put on a demonstration of the vehicles ' capabilities last Sunday for senior Iraqi generals .
With the generals watching from a tower , a pair of M - 1 Abrams tanks shot forward from their " hide " position a kilometer away and tore toward the watchtower at 45 mph , kicking up plumes of dust in their wake .
They buzzed either side of the tower , then let their mighty guns roar with deafening booms , sending a half - dozen high - explosive 120 mm rounds downrange toward an imaginary enemy .
When the tanks pulled to a stop , the generals came down for a closer inspection .
" The American tanks are very modern and capable , but we still do n't know if this tank is in the best interests of the Iraqi army , " said al - Furayji , like a shopper in a Baghdad bazaar feigning a lack of interest to get a better price .
The delegation of U.S. and Iraqi generals , now playing salesmen and customers , climbed atop the tank .
Al - Furayji and his aides peered down the hatch into the tank 's nerve center , where the crew of four operates .
Traveling 45 mph , carrying 17 rounds of 120 mm ammunition that can hit a dime in the dead of night at 3,000 meters thanks to a laser range - finder and thermal - imaging night sights , the M1A1 Abrams tank is " the most battle proven tank in the world , " Lt. Col .
Tim Renshaw said .
The Iraqi officers on hand included some of the Iraqi army 's most senior commanders of armored forces .
They 've experienced this tank 's lethal capabilities firsthand .
In the 1991 Gulf War , their older Russian tanks were blinded by the thick black smoke that billowed from Kuwait 's oil wells after Saddam Hussein ordered them set ablaze .
The American tank 's superior thermal imaging system allowed them to see perfectly and easily crush their enemy .
For Luckey , it makes an effective sales pitch .
" That 's why you guys got your ( butts ) kicked , " he told the Iraqi generals , before they flew back to Baghdad to consult with their bosses on the sale 's pros and cons .

Rumors of a Zune phone have floated around forever , but we 've always thought it would make more sense for Microsoft to start by simply making a Zune player for Windows Mobile -- a plan Steve Ballmer casually confirmed today in an interview with CIO Magazine .
Sure , Ballmer 's hinted at Zune on WinMo in the past , but those were just hints -- not like today 's pronouncement that " the Zune software will also be ported to and be more important not just with the hardware but on the PC , on Windows Mobile devices , etc . "
That 's a pretty solid declaration of things to come , if you ask us -- too bad he did n't give a time frame .
Now , about that 360 integration .

REDMOND , Wash . 
In a windowless room on Microsoft ’s campus here , T. J. Campana , a cybercrime investigator , connects an unprotected computer running an early version of Windows XP to the Internet .
In about 30 seconds the computer is “ owned . ”
An automated program lurking on the Internet has remotely taken over the PC and turned it into a “ zombie . ”
That computer and other zombie machines are then assembled into systems called “ botnets ”  home and business PCs that are hooked together into a vast chain of cyber-robots that do the bidding of automated programs to send the majority of e-mail spam , to illegally seek financial information and to install malicious software on still more PCs .
Botnets remain an Internet scourge .
Active zombie networks created by a growing criminal underground peaked last month at more than half a million computers , according to shadowserver.org , an organization that tracks botnets .
Even though security experts have diminished the botnets to about 300,000 computers , that is still twice the number detected a year ago .
The actual numbers may be far larger ; Microsoft investigators , who say they are tracking about 1,000 botnets at any given time , say the largest network still controls several million PCs .
The boats are carrying 40 activists , 200 hearing aids and 5,000 balloons
Two boats carrying members of a US - based pro-Palestinian group have arrived in the Gaza Strip , despite an Israeli blockade of the territory .
Israel earlier said they would be let in , saying they would not be given the chance to have a " provocation at sea " .
The boats left the port of Larnaca in Cyprus on Friday morning .
The Free Gaza protest group said about 40 activists from 14 countries were on board the boats to highlight the plight of Palestinians in Gaza .
Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in June 2007 when the militant group Hamas took control of the territory by force .
Since then , Israel has allowed in little more than basic humanitarian aid as a means of isolating Hamas and persuading militant groups to stop firing rockets into Israel .
The closure of Gaza 's borders by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities has also meant that very few Gazans have been able to leave .
' No provocation ' Before Free Gaza 's boats set sail on Friday , the Israeli foreign ministry had said they wanted the activists to steer clear of the Gazan coastline , which it said was " the subject of an [ Israeli Navy ] advisory notice " that warns off foreign vessels from the " designated maritime zone " .
But on Saturday , an Israeli spokesman said they would be allowed in .
" They wanted provocation at sea , but they wo n't get it , " foreign ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron told the AFP news agency .
" We know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through . "
Truce barely eases Gaza embargo Guide : Gaza under blockade
The two vessels - named Liberty and Free Gaza - are carrying 200 hearing aids for children and 5,000 balloons .
" No matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for Palestinians , " organiser Paul Larudee told the AFP news agency .
" We want people to see the Palestinian problem as one of human rights , not feeding them rice , " he added .
The activists on board the boats include Lauren Booth , sister - in - law of UK former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is now an international Middle East peace envoy .
Also on board is left - wing Greek MP Tasos Kourakis .
Israel withdrew its settlers from Gaza in 2005 , but it still controls its coast , airspace and borders , and , until a ceasefire with Hamas was agreed in June , carried out regular military operations in the territory .
However , correspondents say the truce has not improved the situation for Gaza 's population , except to reduce the number of Israeli incursions and the number of rockets fired by Palestinian militants .

Suleiman 's visit assures progress in badly strained bilateral ties since 2005 Lebanon and Syria have agreed to resume work on formally demarcating their common border as part of efforts to repair years of strained relations .
However , Syria said the work on borders would not cover one of the most contentious areas , the Israeli - occupied Shebaa Farms , until Israel withdrew .
Lebanon 's President Michel Suleiman is currently in Damascus for talks with his counterpart Bashar al - Assad .
They also confirmed the setting up of diplomatic ties for the first time .
If the Syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria , and respect its sovereignty in other ways , then this will have proved to be a very good step
Condoleezza Rice
US Secretary of State
Looking to future
The leaders also agreed to make further efforts to discover what happened to hundreds of Lebanese people who disappeared during the civil war .
Some Lebanese groups accuse Syria of holding them as detainees .
Bi-lateral treaties , which some Lebanese believe are too favourable to Syria , will also be reviewed .
Assad to Beirut
The outcome of the negotiations was announced at news conference by the two foreign ministers , Syria 's Walid Muallem and Lebanon 's Fawzi Salukh .
Other items agreed between the two sides included tackling corruption , economic co-operation and commitment to Arab initiatives in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
In addition , President Assad accepted an invitation to visit Lebanon at a date to be decided soon , the foreign ministers said .
Lebanon and Syria have had badly strained relations since the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister , Rafik Hariri , in 2005 .
Many Lebanese blame Syria for the killing , but it has repeatedly and adamantly denied involvement .
Syria kept a large military and intelligence presence in Lebanon after the civil war ended in 1990 , but it was forced to withdraw after the Hariri assassination because of massive public pressure in Lebanon with strong international support .
Settling relations with Syria is a top priority for the new government in Lebanon .
The US cautiously welcomed developments saying the opening of embassies was " one of the steps that has long been required " .
" Now , if the Syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria , and respect its sovereignty in other ways , then this will have proved to be a very good step , " US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said .

Many car dealers have fleet departments where you can get an extra discount on your new vehicle .
To find the best deal , call different dealerships in your area and ask to speak to their fleet managers .
Then , ask them for quotes for the car you ’re interested in .
Dealers will usually charge you the invoice price of the car plus their own seller fee .
For example , they might quote you “ $ 400 over the invoice price . ”
Once you ’ve got a few quotes , make an appointment with the dealer who offered you the best price .
If you 're buying the car for personal use , you 'll probably have to pay the dealer fee .
If you ’re buying it for business , they should automatically waive the fee , but if they do n’t , ask them to waive it .

Mr Zardari 's remarks mark a radical break with the past
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari says India has never been a threat to Pakistan , and that militants in Indian - administered Kashmir are terrorists .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , he also seemed to acknowledge that his government has given consent to US air strikes in Pakistan .
The unorthodox views run counter to those held by Pakistan 's military , which views India as a threat .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars but have made recent peace moves .
Deep suspicions
Pakistan 's powerful military has long - defined India as an existential threat , and in the past it has given covert backing to the militants in Kashmir .
The two regional rivals did take part in a faltering peace process under the former president , General Pervez Musharraf .
But suspicions always ran deep , and relations have soured recently .
Mr Zardari 's comments thus mark a radical break with the past .
The Wall Street Journal also reports that Mr Zardari acknowledged that the US was firing missiles at militant targets inside Pakistan with his government 's consent .
" We have an understanding , in the sense that we 're going after an enemy together , " it quotes him as saying .
But the Pakistani army is adamant that coalition forces do not have permission for such cross - border raids .
These incursions have stoked enormous anger in Pakistan - and Mr Zardari 's comments may do the same .
A drop to the orange tier , for “ moderate ” coronavirus risk , would have meant more businesses could have reopened or expanded their capacity .
In a prospective study of over 1800 interviewed young Finnish twins , early - onset depressive disorders at age 14 significantly predicted daily smoking , smokeless tobacco use , frequent illicit drug use , frequent alcohol use and recurrent intoxication three years later , even among those adolescents who were not users at baseline .
Analysis of twins discordant for early - onset depressive disorders confirm predictive associations of early - onset depressive disorders with smokeless tobacco use and frequent drinking at age 17½ , in within - family replications with co-twins matched on half or all their segregating genes , and on their family structure , socio- economic status , and household environment .
" The findings of this large population - based study emphasize the importance of early - onset depressive disorders in developmental trajectories of substance use " , says researcher Elina Hakola , University of Helsinki , Finland .
Analyses that control for shared genetic and familial background factors suggest that influences other than family environments , for example , the influence of peers or dispositional personality traits on health - adversing behaviors in adolescence may also be of importance in this association .
The results have important implications for educational purposes in treatment and prevention programs in adolescent health care .
EXCLUSIVE :
John Hofmeister , the former president of Shell Oil Co. and one of the most influential voices in the oil industry , called for short - term gasoline rationing by introducing odd - even purchases based on an automobile ’s license plate and by limiting the amount of gasoline drivers can purchase .
The United States will be in “ a world of hurt ” for the next four to six weeks as the oil industry recovers from the damage from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , said Mr. Hofmeister , who recently founded a new company , Citizens for Affordable Energy .
The areas where rationing will be needed include the Southeast and extend northward toward Denver , the upper Midwest and Washington , D.C. , Mr. Hofmeister said in a newsmaker interview Monday morning with editors and reporters of The Washington Times .
Hurricane Ike idled Texas refineries by knocking out their power after Gustav shut down Louisiana refineries for the same reason .
Mr. Hofmeister witnessed gas lines while traveling through Tennessee on Friday as consumers rushed to fill their tanks in anticipation of Ike ’s damage .
The market is jacking up prices because of a fear of scarcity , he explained .

“ The supply system in America is not designed for everybody to ‘ top - off ’ their tanks , ” Mr. Hofmeister said .
He praised the decision to release 300,000 barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , and said further releases will be needed in the weeks ahead .
Regarding the overall economy , Mr. Hofmeister said it is “ quite weak for middle - and low - income folks because of the drain on their disposable income ” resulting from soaring energy , food and health - care costs .
“ America is suffering a lot more than is being reported , ” said Mr. Hofmeister , who is also chairman of the National Urban League .
The economic slowdown may not be affecting the well - to - do , but it is “ really nailing middle - and low - income people . ”

The Republicans may have mistaken their adversary for just another Democrat sleeping under a shade tree and looking like a mark .
Not .
In real terms , that assumption might prove as costly to them as Robert E. Lee underestimating Ulysses S. Grant .
This man is a brawler but a quiet one .
He may use a scalpel instead if a broad sword but the jugular does n't know the difference
This past Friday , Obama made a decision that either he had conceived himself or recognized the importance of with the sudden kind of clarity necessary for superior leadership .
Bob Bauer , the foremost legal representative of the campaign , fired off a letter to the Department of Justice asserting that all of the recent hissing and howling about ACORN by Republicans in many places , and John McCain specifically in the final presidential debate , should be taken off of life support .
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey was advised to put Nora Dannehy , special prosecutor , in a position to investigate the possibility of collusion between the Republican Party and the Justice Department .
This could clear away all of the claims of voter fraud that might result in gumming things up with unnecessary investigation .
If this Obama brings this off , we will have witnessed an exceptionally shrewd part of a grand strategic vision .
The particular intelligence of this strong move by the Obama campaign is that it comes before the election and is timed so perfectly that the Attorney General is put in a very hot position .
The Supreme Court has just squashed a Republican attempt to pollute the waters with claims of vote fraud in Ohio ; it upended a lower court order to challenge the registration of 200,000 voters .
If that was n't enough sand in the Republican vaseline , the concerted baying at the moon of ACORN has been met by repudiation of the Republican governor of Florida .
All of this tightens Michael Mukasey 's hat band .
He may well have to move quickly and in the way requested by Bauer .
One of the reasons that Alberto Gonzales left Washington is that the former Attorney General removed nine federal prosecutors from their jobs for not following the game plan laid out by the White House , which was to lead the troops in charges of voter fraud .
The order that Gonzales made clear but not explicit was easy to interpret :
Play ball or put your backside in the U - Haul .
Mukasey was given the big task of proving that the Justice Department is more than a partisan GOP tool .
No small job , given the man he replaced .
That weight should work in Obama 's favor , because if Mukasey does not take the request seriously and make decisive moves he will be seen , true or not , as but another of the clay - footed statues faithfully waiting to be put in the White House slingshot and used to create a concussion .
On the surface , the Alberto Gonzales affair should validate some of the tenets Republicans use against affirmative action .
After all , Gonzales showed to all that diversity is no automatic solution to the recurring problems of governmental corruption , troubles against which we must always remain vigilant .
If the charges against former HUD Secretary Alfonso Jackson are true , that he abused his office by favoring friends and cronies , then what we will have learned from all of this is that George W. Bush may have friends across ethnic lines but too many of them prove no more than the old blues fact of what Jorge Luis Borges called " universal infamy . "
In such a national mood of so much reasonable distrust of almost everything , Obama 's decision has a particular brightness to it because it rivals the ability of the Republicans to achieve victory through the psychological manipulation .
If this campaign 's commander in chief brings it off , it will probably have been as important to what seems his inevitable victory as any slogans or promises .
We will have witnessed an exceptionally shrewd part of a grand strategic vision .
That is just what Robert E. Lee got from Grant , a fighter who was thinking of ways to get beyond the thunder of battle : about how all of those strands of combat could be knitted into a noose of victory .
AWK is a very powerful programming language that we can use on the command - line for advanced text processing .
I ’d like to provide a guide so you can get started using it .
I ’ll be covering the basics of AWK ( named after Alfred Aho , Peter Weinberger , and Brian Kernighan ) and provide some useful examples .
Tutorial
To best introduce awk I ’d like to start with a practical example .
Most of the applications for awk that I ’ve dealt with involve formatting some output or data into something cleaner and more usable .
This is certainly not the limit of awk , it is a full fledged language with all the power and responsibility to go with it .
Awk operates on one “ record ” at a time , which is each line by default .
Each “ field ” in a record is separated by a space ( by default ) or another defined separator ( using the - F option ) .
We ’re going to print the file names , line - numbers , and function names of all duplicate functions so they ’re super easy to find and remove .
Suppose we have some output from grep with file names and line numbers using a command like this ( pulled from my grep tutorial ) :
# Prints javascript functions like this - < file >:< line-num >:< line - content > grep - EnH " ^ \s * function \w + " * .js | sort
That ’s all good and well , but this does n’t quite give us what we want in a clear manner , it prints all functions and information in a kinda cludgy fashion .
We can clean this up with a bit of awk .
First let ’s learn a basic awk command :
awk '/' ^ $ '/ { print " blank line " }' myfile
This snippet will print “ blank line ” for line that matches the regex : ^$ ( a blank line ) .
The pattern ( between the two slashes , inclusive ) is optional and we ’ll see in the next example :
awk ' BEGIN { print " Hello , awk ! " } { print $ 2 , $ 1 } END { print " Goodbye , awk ! " } ' myfile
How this reads is : Before processing ( BEGIN ) , print “ Hello , awk ! ” and then print the second field ( $ 2 ) and then the first ( $ 1 ) for each line of myfile , then after processing ( END ) print “ Goodbye , awk ! ” .
The BEGIN and END clauses are optional .
As explained above , a field is a sequence of non-whitespace characters .
So if a line contained “ foo bar other stuff ” , awk would print “ bar foo ” .
One more thing before continuing : awk scripts can get ugly so it is useful to know you can read a file for awk commands :
# My awk file : foo. awk BEGIN { print " Hello , awk ! " } { print $ 2 , $ 1 #
This is an awk comment } END { print " Goodbye , awk ! " } # Invoke foo.awk awk -f foo.awk myfile
OK , let ’s add some power to that old grep command .
We can use the -F option to specify our delimiter so let ’s add to our grep command like so :
grep - Eoni " ^ \s * function \w + " * .js | awk - F ' :' '{ print $ 3 , " " , $ 1 , $ 2} ' | sort
Now we have a sorted list of function names followed by their filename and line number by spaces .
We needed to print $ 3 first so that we could easily sort by the function name and look for duplicates , but we ’re not going to do that manually … oh noooooo way .
Let ’s make it a bit prettier and uniq - ify our list of functions by function :
# New part of our command awk ' {print $ 3 , " line " , $ 4, $ 2} ' | uniq -f 3 - D # Full command grep - Eoni " ^ \s * function \w + " * .js | awk - F ' :' '{ print $ 3 , " " , $ 1 , $ 2} ' | sort | awk '{print $ 3 , " line " , $ 4, $ 2} ' | uniq -f 3 -D
Here we pipe our last command back into awk printing line and then use uniq on the 3rd field ( - f 3 ) showing only the duplicates ( - D ) .
Other awk examples
# Backup all JavaScript files with a . bak extension -- replace ' bash ' with your shell ls * .js | awk '{print " cp " $ 0 " " $ 0 " . bak " } ' | bash # Print the number of lines that contain " function " awk ' / ' function '/ {i = i + 1} END { print i} ' myfile.js
Conclusion
AWK is admittedly a ten ton gorilla of a tool , so there is no way I could cover everything that it can do in one post .
If there is enough demand I can write about some of the more advanced features like conditionals , variables , and formatting .

Crony Capitalism :
One of the many outrageous elements of the bailout is that as far as I can tell , all those Wall Street guys who paid themselves millions of dollars in bonuses for pushing this garbage paper back and forth are going to be able to keep all that money and their houses in the Hamptons .
I have no problem with people making money , but only if they are going to have to eat the downside risk too .
And I 'm including the 30 year old millionaires in this too , not just the kingpins ( many who sucked their money out before the bubble burst ) .
Its been remarked by many others , but what is going on looks like the kind of thing you 'd see in Russia or some other crony capitalist country .
I understand that this is about preventing a liquidity crisis like that one that helped to cause and deepend the Great Depression , when bank failures resulted in drying up the very investment capital needed to reverse the economic slide .
If there is a logic to this , I assume it is something like that .
But it'd be nice if they 'd find some way to make the bankers eat some of this loss .
One question I 've been trying to figure out is what exactly the government is going to do with this paper .
As I understand it , this has all come to a head because of the changes in accounting rules over the past few years which forces a more frequent updating of the valuation of assets .
So in the past , the investment banks would have just held this paper on their balance sheets for an extended period of time until some of it got back into the money or was offset by other assets .
Now , however , as I understand it , the day of reckoning occurs with greater immediacy , creating the crisis .
Functionally then , as I understand it , the government is going to essentially perform this function of holding the paper until some of it gets back into the money or rotates off the balance sheet .
Here 's what I 'm wondering though that I have n't been able to figure out ( pointers appreciated for cogent discussions of this ) .
Is there anything in the bailout proposal to prevent the following scenario .
Investment bank sells its mortgages to the government .
Government holds the mortgages until the emergency abates .
Original sellers form a syndicate to buy back the paper that has value at a cheap price and then turns a profit off that .
In other words , is there anything in the bailout that stops the bankers from making money both coming and going here -- by getting the government to buy all the garbage now and then buying - back anything with upside value later ?
Who other than these same guys are going to be in a position to buy this stuff later ?
I 'm genuinely asking here -- I have n't seen any discussion about this .
It would be pretty gross if there is some way that they can make more money off this on the back end , but now that we know the way these guys operate my guess is that they are already figuring out how to turn this to their eventual advantage .
If not this loophole , are there other obvious loopholes ?
There is an old saying about the need to " save capitalism from the capitalists " and the close relationships between these big money operations like Wall Street and Fannie Mae on one hand , and the government on the other , is really quite revolting .
It is infuriating that the when things are going good they jet around in their private planes but when things turn south they can get the government to bail them out on our nickle .
Seriously , how about trying to find some way of making them throw a few million or billion into the pot for saving their hides ?
Hard - Wired Behaviors
If you can't teach your old dog a new trick , it may be because their genetics and brain physiology are working against you .
The behavior of dogs , like that of all animals , is shaped in part by instinct that is essentially hard - wired into the animal .
Over time , this unlearned behavior has been honed by human choice via selective breeding to create the variety of dogs we have today .
For example , herding dogs are hard - wired to control the movement of the animals ; they 'll intimidate , stare , stalk , bark , and nip to do so .
Hunting breeds such as pointers and setters instinctively track game and freeze to point it out , while retrievers bring wounded or dead animals to their owners ( whether they want it or not ) .
Hounds are far more independent , and will take off on their own in pursuit of prey , using scent or sight ( or both ) .
Terriers are famously aggressive , driven to kill animals like rats and other vermin , which they 'll furiously dig to catch .
Although many of the most popular American Kennel Club dog breeds no longer work for a living , they still show signs of these ingrained behaviors .
The Pea Speaker system is bound to be costly , incurring damages from being tossed around , but that ’s what designer Lu Le wants – a playful way to share music .
Each pod holds 7 wireless bluetooth speakers .
Only one possesses the one ring to rule them all because it controls global volume .
Each sphere is powered by a lithium ion rechargeable via induction when placed in the pod .
The system does n’t do surround sound since it ca n’t separate channels , but it ’s a good way to fill a large area with a mixed stereo track .
Snazzy !

Researchers have discovered an unusual molecule that is essential to the atmosphere 's ability to break down pollutants , especially the compounds that cause acid rain .
It 's the unusual chemistry facilitated by this molecule , however , that will attract the most attention from scientists .
Somewhat like a human body metabolizing food , the Earth 's atmosphere has the ability to " burn , " or oxidize pollutants , especially nitric oxides emitted from sources such as factories and automobiles .
What does n't get oxidized in the atmosphere falls back to Earth in the form of acid rain .
Scientists at Purdue and Pennsylvania universities have discovered an atmospheric molecule that is essential to the breakdown of pollutants in the atmosphere .
The molecule , which had not been seen before , is unusual because it has two hydrogen bonds .
This image shows the structure of the molecule , with the blue ball being a nitrogen atom , red representing hydrogen atoms , white representing oxygen atoms , and the yellow clouds showing the location of the double hydrogen bonds .

Marsha Lester , the University of Pennsylvania 's Edmund J. Kahn Distinguished Professor , and Joseph Francisco , William E. Moore Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Purdue University , found the molecule , which had puzzled and eluded scientists for more than 40 years .
" The chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear , " Francisco says .
" This gives us important insights into this process .
Without that knowledge we really can't understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere . "
Francisco says the discovery will allow scientists to better model how pollutants react in the atmosphere and to predict potential outcomes .
" This becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as China , India and Brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated , " Francisco says .
" This chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern . "
Lester says the molecule had been theorized by atmospheric chemists for 40 years and that she and Francisco had pursued it for the past several years .
" We 've speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years , and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting , " she says .
What makes the molecule so unusual is its two hydrogen bonds , which are similar to those found in water .
Chemists know that although water is one of the most common substances found on the planet , it has unusual properties .
For example , the solid form - ice - is lighter than the liquid form and floats .
Water also boils at a much higher temperature than would be expected from its chemical structure .
The cause of these strange behaviors are weak hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together .
The new atmospheric molecule has two hydrogen bonds , which allows it to form a six - sided ring structure .
Hydrogen bonds are usually weaker than the normal bonds between atoms in a molecule , which are known as covalent bonds .
In fact , covalent bonds are 20 times stronger than hydrogen bonds .
But in this case , these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry , Francisco says .
Lester says the new molecule exhibits its own unusual properties .
" The reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures , which is the opposite of most chemical reactions , " she says .
" The rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure , and most reactions do n't depend on external pressure .
The molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties . "
Lester says the unusual properties prevented scientists from being able to model the reaction for so long .
" This is not how we explain chemistry to high school students , " she says .
Francisco says that this discovery will be used in areas other than atmospheric chemistry .
" Here 's a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem , but , because the findings are so fundamental , it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds , " he says .
The breakthrough was enabled by laser - based laboratory techniques at the University of Pennsylvania and the supercomputing resources available at Purdue , Francisco says .
The computation was done on an SGI Altix supercomputer operated by the Office of Information Technology at Purdue .
" The key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities , and with the computing resources we have at Purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty , " he says .
" We could n't have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available . "

The police force , with a head count already down by thousands , is not likely to receive a huge influx of cash for hiring or overtime costs if times are rough .
On Aug. 31 , the count was 36,265 police officers , down by about 4,000 from the peak strength in 2000 , a result of tight budgets and recruiting difficulties that stemmed in part from a low starting salary .
Recently , City Hall has asked the department for $ 94 million worth of suggested cuts to its budget — or 2.5 percent of its budget — for the fiscal year ending next June , Mr. Kelly said .
The administration sought $ 192 million more in cuts for the following fiscal year , though it is unclear if those cuts will be carried out .
Still , officials here have enjoyed more than a decade of impressive crime reduction — in good and bad fiscal times — and say that even if sharp increases in crime are tied to bad economic conditions , the police are better outfitted than in years past for addressing them .

I can understand that there could be a relationship .

Commissioner Kelly says he always analyzes crime data in a way that allows the department to alter its strategies once trends emerge .
At a minimum , he makes decisions about how manpower and resources are allocated every six months , when each new class of rookie officers hits the streets .
Mr. Kelly used a program that assigns the newly minted officers to places that were trouble spots around the city during the last downturn , after the Sept. 11 attacks and the resulting municipal belt - tightening the city faced in 2002 and 2003 .
By pinpointing neighborhoods — even stretches of blocks within police precincts — and positioning extra officers there , the department drove crime down 30 percent in some places , anchoring overall annual reductions .
Crime in the city is down so far this year , too .
As of Oct. 5 , the most recent date for which data is available , overall reported crime was down 3.2 percent compared with the same period last year , police statistics show .
The number of murders rose — to 400 this year from 359 by Oct. 5 , 2007 , an 11.4 percent increase — though even the new figure is nearly 9 percent lower than in 2006 .
Mr. Bratton , who in the 1990s was the New York City police commissioner , said that poor economic conditions “ can be an influence on crime rates , ” but not a central cause .
PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
Europe must show that it can respond like the United States in the " trial by fire " of the global financial crisis , International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss - Kahn says .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has denied he wants a European version of the U.S. banking bailout .
European leaders met in Paris , France , on Saturday to discuss their approach to the global financial crisis .
Strauss - Kahn said the financial situation was an unprecedented test for the countries that use Europe 's common currency , The Associated Press reported .
The IMF boss said that the crisis was worrying and that his organization would lower its economic growth forecasts .
Strauus - Khan commented after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss Europe 's response .
Sarkozy also planned to meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Also expected to attend was Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean - Claude Juncker , who heads the Eurogroup , comprising the finance ministers of the 15 countries using the euro .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet were also expected at the summit .
Sarkozy said the economic crisis required a global response , but Brown said that no strong bank should be allowed to fail for lack of solvency .
He also mooted setting up a $ 21 billion European fund to help small businesses through the economic downturn .
Europe has been hit with bankruptcies and stock declines since the crisis unfolded in the United States last month .
Europe has welcomed the approval in the U.S. Congress of a $ 700 billion financial industry bailout .
However , most of the leaders at the summit are against a similar Europe - wide bailout .
Sarkozy has denied that France was backing the creation of a special fund to rescue any crisis - hit European banks , despite the French finance minister floating the idea .
The European Central Bank left its key interest rate unchanged Thursday , but it and the Bank of England are under increasing pressure to cut rates quickly in the face of declining economic activity and an increase in unemployment .

Generic functions vs mixins : a case study
by Michele Simionato
September 3 , 2008
Summary
Just yesterday at work I had a good real - life use case for generic functions which deserved a blog post .
Advertisement
In the last few weeks my collegues and me have been involved in a project which required a command line interface .
We did so by leveraging on the cmd module in the standard Python library , to which we added a network layer using Twisted .
In the end , we had classes interacting with the standard streams stdin , stdout , stderr and classes interacting with nonstandard streams such as Twisted transports .
All the I/O was line oriented and we basically needed three methods :
print_out ( self , text , * args ) to print a line on self .
stdout
to print a line on print_err ( self , text , * args ) to print a line on self .
stderr
to print a line on readln_in( self ) to read a line from self .
stdin
Depending on the type of self , self .
stdout was sys.stdout , a Twisted transport , a log file or a file - like wrapper to a database .
Likewise for self . stderr and self .
stdin .
This is a problem that begs for generic functions .
Unfortunately , nobody in the Python world uses them ( with the exception of P. J. Eby ) so for the moment we are using a suboptimal design involving mixins instead .
I am not really happy with that .
The aim of this blog post is to explain why a mixin solution is inferior to a generic functions solution .
A mixin - oriented solution
In the mixin solution , instead of generic functions one uses plain old methods , stored into a mixin class .
In this specific case let me call the class StdIOMixin : class StdIOMixin ( object ) : " A mixin implementing line - oriented I /O " stdin = sys.stdin stdout = sys.stdout stderr = sys.stderr linesep = os.linesep def print_out ( self , text , * args ) : " Write on self . stdout by flushing " write ( self.stdout , str( text ) + self.linesep , * args ) def print_err ( self , text , * args ) : " Write on self . stderr by flushing " write ( self.stderr , str( text ) + self.linesep , * args ) def readln_in( self ) : " Read a line from self . stdin ( without trailing newline ) or None " line = self.stdin.readline( ) if line : return line [ : - 1 ] # strip trailing newline where write is the following helper function : def write ( stream , text , * args ) : ' Write on a stream by flushing if possible ' if args : # when no args , do not consider ' %' a special char text = text % args stream .
write ( text ) flush = getattr ( stream , ' flush ' , False ) if flush : flush ( ) StdIOMixin is there to be mixed with other classes , providing them with the ability to perform line - oriented I/O .
By default , it works on the standard streams , but if the client class overrides the attributes stdout , stderr , stdin with suitable file - like objects , it can be made to work with Twisted transports , files and databases .
For instance , here is an example where stdout and stderr are overridden as files : class FileIO ( StdIOMixin ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self. stdout = file ( ' out. txt ' , 'w ' ) self .
stderr = file ( ' err.txt ' , 'w ' ) >>> FileIO ( ) .print_out ( ' hello !')
# prints a line on out .
txt
The design works and it looks elegant , but still I say that it is sub-optimal compared to generic functions .
The basic problem of this design is that it adds methods to the client classes and therefore it adds to the learning curve .
Suppose you have four client classes - one managing standard stream , one managing files , one managing Twisted transports and one managing database connections - then you have to add the mixin four times .
If you generate the documentation for your classes , the methods print_out , print_err and readln_in will be documented four times .
And this is not a shortcoming of pydoc : the three methods are effectively cluttering your application in a linear way , proportionally to the number of classes you have .
Moreover , those methods will add to the pollution of your class namespace , with the potential risk on name collisions , especially in large frameworks .
In large frameworks ( i.e. Plone , where a class my have 700 + attributes ) this is a serious problem : for instance , you cannot even use auto - completion , since there are just too many completions .
You must know that I am very sensitive to namespace pollution so I always favor approaches that can avoid it .
Also , suppose you only need the print_out functionality ; the mixin approach naturally would invite you to include the entire StdIOMixin , importing in your class methods you do n't need .
The alternative would be to create three mixin classes StdinMixin , StdoutMixin , StderrMixin , but most of the time you would need all of them ; it seems overkill to complicate so much your inheritance hierarchy for a very simple functionality .
As you may know , I am always looking for solutions avoiding ( multiple ) inheritance and generic functions fit the bill perfectly .
A generic functions solution I am sure most people do not know about it , but Python 2.5 ships with an implementation of generic functions in the standard library , in the pkgutil module ( by P.J. Eby ) .
Currently , the implementation is only used internally in pkgutil and it is completely undocumented ; therefore I never had the courage to use it in production , but it works well .
Even if it is simple , it is able to cover most practical uses of generic functions .
For instance , in our case we need three generic functions : from pkgutil import simplegeneric @simplegeneric def print_out ( self , text , * args ) : if args : text = text % args print >> self.stdout , text @simplegeneric def print_err ( self , text , * args ) : if args : text = text % args print >> self.stderr , text @simplegeneric def readln_in( self ) : " Read a line from self . stdin ( without trailing newline ) " line = self.stdin.readline( ) if line : return line [ : - 1 ] # strip trailing newline
The power of generic functions is that you do n't need to use inheritance : print_out will work on any object with a . stdout attribute even if it does not derive from StdIOMixin .
For instance , if you define the class class FileOut ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self.stdout = file ( ' out. txt ' , 'w ' ) the following will print a message on the file out .
txt : >>> print_out ( FileOut ( ) , ' writing on file ' ) # prints a line on out .
txt Simple , is n't it ?
Extending generic functions
One advantage of methods with respect to ordinary functions is that they can be overridden in subclasses ; however , generic functions can be overridden too - this is why they are also called multimethods .
For instance , you could define a class AddTimeStamp and override print_out to add a time stamp when applied to instances of AddTimeStamp .
Here is how you would do it : class AddTimeStamp ( object ) : stdout = sys.stdout @print_out.register( AddTimeStamp ) # add an implementation to print_out def impl( self , text , * args ) : " Implementation of print_out for AddTimeStamp instances " if args : text = text % args print >> self.stdout , datetime.datetime.now ( ).isoformat( ) , text and here in an example of use : >>> print_out ( AddTimeStamp( ) , ' writing on stdout ' ) 2008-09-02T07:28:46.863932 writing on stdout The syntax @print_out.register( AddTimeStamp ) is not the most beatiful in the world , but its purposes should be clear : we are registering the implementation of print_out to be used for instances of AddTimeStamp .
When print_out is invoked on an instance of AddTimeStamp a time stamp is printed ; otherwise , the default implementation is used .
Notice that since the implementation of simplegeneric is simple , the internal registry of implementations is not exposed and there is no introspection API ; moreover , simplegeneric works for single dispatch only and there is no explicit support for multimethod cooperation ( i.e. call - next - method , for the ones familiar with Common Lisp ) .
Yet , you cannot pretend too much from thirty lines of code ;)
In this example I have named the AddTimeStamp implementation of print_out impl , but you could have used any valid Python identifier , including print_out_AddTimeStamp or _ , if you felt so .
Since the name print_out is explicit in the decorator and since in practice you do not need to access the explicit implementation directly , I have settled for a generic name like impl .
There is no standard convention since nobody uses generic functions in Python ( yet ) .
There were plan to add generic functions to Python 3.0 , but the proposal have been shifted to Python 3.1 , with a syntax yet to define .
Nevertheless , for people who do n't want to wait , pkgutil .
simplegeneric is already there and you can start experimenting with generic functions right now .
Have fun !

CIRCLE -A OR ANARCHY :
This is the symbol of symbols of the move to freedom from accountability and authority : from any and all consequences .
It represents total lack of law and rules .
Whether s/he knows it , it 's wearer broadcasts desire for abolition of ALL law and rules .
Heavy metal and death metal rock bands wear this profoundly .
Let me offer my interpretation of it .
Atop the picture to the left is the Anarchy or Circle - A symbol .
Note the resemblance of the Circle - A to the Greek alphabet letters alpha and omega shown in the lower left corner of the picture .
The alpha is the first letter and the omega is the last .
The Greek alpha has the same in basic design as the capital " A " in the English alphabet .
The Greek omega is very similar to the English capital " O " with " feet " and open at the bottom .
On the bottom right of the picture to the left , I have superimposed the omega character over the alpha character to form what I believe is to be the foundation of the Circle - A or Anarchy symbol .
Before I explain further , recall God 's words in Rev. 1:8 " I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty . "
God IS the Law .
In the Circle - A symbol on top , note the crossmember of the alpha ( or " A " ) character and how it is extended beyond the confines of the circle enclosing the " A . "
Note further that in everyday life we see many signs such as " No smoking , " " No pets , " and " No exit . "
This " No " sign bears an image of the restricted subject ( a cigarette , a dog , or the word " exit " ) with a circle around the image and a diagonal bar crossing the image from the upper left of the circle to the lower right .
In the " No " sign the ends of the diagonal bar remain inside the circle at both ends .
Now , superimpose the " No " sign over the alpha character and turn the bar 45 degrees to the left and raise the bar a bit to hide the crossmember of the alpha character .
The ends of the bar now extend beyond the outsides of the circle .
This might be enough of an explanation that the Circle - A symbol is the alpha character with a " No " sign over it but the " No " sign was not around when the Anarchy symbol arose .
I use the " No " sign initially to present a basic doctrine of the anarchists -- to reject any authority .
Recall that the omega letter is basically a circle with feet , open at the bottom .
The " No " circle converges well with the omega character .
Mentally open the bottom of the " No " sign to make the omega letter .
Flattened pieces cut from the bottom of the " No " sign can be thought of as the " feet " of the omega character .
Now , cover the alpha character with the " No " / omega symbol and you have the Anarchy or Circle - A symbol .
Recall again that God said He is the Alpha and the Omega : the beginning and the ending ; the supreme and final Authority .
The Anarchy / Circle - A symbol represents rejection of His Law and Authority , just as the Anarchy / Circle - A symbol can be thought of as the " No " bar over the Alpha and the Omega : " No " to BOTH the Alpha and the Omega ; " No " to the Word of God ( which IS the Law ) , and to God Himself .
PENTAGRAM / PENTACLE : I have found contradiction surrounding its use , so there will be seeming contradiction herein .
Some claim the pentagram , a five pointed star , is not the same thing as the pentacle , a five - point star enclosed in a circle .
I will not belabor the difference and will address both as essentially one .
The pentagram / pentacle is commonly used in horror flicks and on heavy metal and death metal music album covers and worn by the band members .
The pentagram / pentacle is used in both the one - point - up position and the two - points - up ( inverted ) position .
The one point up pentagram / pentacle is the sign of the Wiccan / Witch , is an ancient symbol for power and protection , and may represent white magic .
If it is inverted with two points pointing upward may indicate black magic ( Second Degree Initiation ) .
Either way , it is not from or of God .
Some use the pentagram / pentacle to symbolize the five points of the human body ; the head , the arms and the legs such as in da Vinci 's Vitruvian Man .
This symbolism is flying through space as we speak on the Voyager with a nude man embossed in gold on the side of the craft with his five extremities extended to the five points of a one - point - up pentagram / pentacle .
The pentagram / pentacle is also used to represent the five elements : spirit , air , earth , fire , and water .
The members of " Church of Satan " wear an inverted pentagram / pentacle with a goathead .
The cover of the satanic bible by Anton LeVey bears an inverted pentagram / pentacle .
Used primarily as a tool in witchcraft for conjuring evil spirits , the pentagram / pentacle is also is used the mean " Morning Star " : a name claimed by Satan ; a name claimed in mockery because it is also one of the names Jesus uses : [ Rev. 22:16 ]
" I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches .
I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star . "
While some believe the circle around the five - point star is symbolic of focusing the power of Satan , I suspect the pentagram / pentacle is also symbolic of the wishes of occultists and satanists to confine the power of the true Morning Star .
HEXAGRAM : The hexagram has uncondemnable meaning to the Jews -- it was adopted by them as the Star of David circa their captivity by the Babylonians .
The hexagram was also used by the Egyptians as an unholy icon long before the Jews claimed it for holy representation .
The hexagram is claimed to be one of the most potent icons for working darkness and magic to call up evil forces for hypnosis and seduction .
The hexagram is also known as the Crest of Solomon .
The hexagram figures prominently in Tarot and is commonly found on the lid of the box for the Tarot deck .
It is also the symbol behind putting a " hex " on someone .
" Evil spirits gather in force at the summons of the person working the ' hex ' . "
The hexagram is believed also to protect from fire , deadly weapons , and dangers while traveling .
Such belief is against God 's command that we trust only in Him for blessings and protection .
ANKH : This symbol represents fertility and lust and is also known as the Key of Life .
As a development of the Tau Cross ( after the Greek letter , Tau " T " : see the Tau Cross below ) , also known as the Egyptian Cross or the Crux Ansata , one application of the ankh represents the genitals of both sexes : the ovoid or yoni ( the Satanic symbol of external female genitals and Shakti , the wife of a deity ) and the cross below it as the male member in mockery of Christ as the giver of eternal life .
Following Christ 's death , the Tau Cross portion of the ankh was a symbol of death and ending , ostensibly because of the similarity of the Tau with the Cross of Christ and the profuse use of the Tau ( and similar ) cross configuration to crucify thieves and other criminals .
The yoni was added atop the Tau Cross to represent life .
In witchcraft , the ankh is used as a symbol for life , love ( maybe lust ) , and reincarnation ( likely in mockery of the Resurrection of Christ in which death was an inherent precursor ) .
While the ankh is a symbol of the belief in a life - death - reincarnation process , it is worn with a star by those into witchcraft who practice and concoct sexual abuse .
SWASTIKA : This all - too - familiar icon is not just representative of Nazi Germany , the Neo - nazi movement nor other ultra-control freaks .
It 's history is vast .
It even appeared on the Boy Scout 's Thanks badge before Hitler 's regime .
In the fourteenth century , it was known as the Fylfot and was said to represent obedience or submission , which fits into Hitler 's use of it although unrighteous .
It also is representative of sun god worship .
Though Hitler had made a covenant with Satan to build the Third Reich ( the third kingdom ) , the swastika was used long before Hitler as a " religious " symbol by Buddhists , Celtics , and Greeks .
The swastika is the Cross bent all out of shape , symbolic of the rejection and abuse of Him and His Sacrifice and Truth .
It is used heavily in contemporary occultism and satanism , likely because of its association with the Holocaust -- massive and most dastardly death at the hands of evil men .
In each contemporary use , it appears to represent , as it did in the fourteenth century , willing obedience or submission , not to righteous authority but rather to dark forces and evil .
666 : As revealed by Revelations in the Holy Bible , this is the number of the Satan -- the beast .
It is also the number of man .
Rev. 13:11
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
Rev. 13:12
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed ( Comment : he who does not die from a fatal wound ) .
Rev. 13:13
And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
Rev. 13:14
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live ( Comment : an injury due to aggression by someone , maybe only a sword figuratively , maybe be a contemporary weapon ) .
Rev. 13:15
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
Rev. 13:16
And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
Rev. 13:17
And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
Rev. 13:18
Here is wisdom .
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .
TAU CROSS : Long ago known as the " Cross of Egypt . "
It is shaped like the letter " T " , often with a circle or ovoid above it symbolizing divinity ( divine life , or life itself ) -- the ankh .
There is a mixture of claims between the ankh and the Tau Cross being the Cross of Egypt since the ankh is a development of the Tau Cross .
The Tau Cross is a symbol of end , or death , probably due to its resemblance to one of the forms of crosses used to crucify criminals in ancient Rome .
Inductees into the Mysteries of Mithras were branded with this symbol on their forehead .
The cult of Mithras was a major competitor of Christianity .
Mithras was the bull - god ( Bull = Ba'al ? ) worshipped in the Roman empire about the time of Christ .
Mithras was hailed by his believers as the " angel of light " and " heavenly light " and is associated with the sun because of its " heavenly " location .
Cue on the use of " light " and " sun " by the Mithrasians .
The Word of God is [ Ps. 119:105 ] " ... a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path . "
Jesus , the Son ( phonetically " sun " ) of God was the fulfiller of the Word ( His Law ) .
In John 8:12 , " Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . "
Use of the Tau Cross by the dark world is more mockery of the Gospel of Jesus and of His power and authority since Jesus died for you and I on a Tau Cross or a variation of it and because of His position as the bringer of Light and Truth .
UNICORN HORN OR LEPRECHAUN STAFF : Brought about by the Druids , this horn was used to castrate animals and humans and to conjure luck and personal gain .
It has a hex on it to protect the bearer from the ' evil eye ' discussed below .
It is also used to invoke protection of personal finances -- more reliance on or solicitation of unholy power .
EVIL EYE or MAL OCCHIO : Found on US currency , this symbol portrays those who claim to be chosen by Satan to control world finances .
We might see this symbol used more frequently as the New World Order and the one - world currency mature .
This icon is to say to the observer that the " eye of Satan " is watching , especially in finances .
It is also connected by some with the spiritual burdens of envy and greed .
" This symbol is one of the most potent in the power of divination ( the King James version of the Holy Bible calls " divination " witchcraft ) . "
Hexes , curses , psychic control and every corruption conceivable are worked through this emblem . "
According to some folk tales , a menstruant 's gaze - the Evil Eye - was able to to cause harm : failing crops , rotting of food , and sickness in babies .
The Evil Eye is also associated with the gaze of a witch to control a victim : a gaze that would appear blank and expressionless but could do harm or kill nonetheless .
Whichever meaning , they are all evil and indicate subservience to or solicitation of an unholy authority
SOUTHERN CROSS : Serious bearers of this object mock the Cross of Christ with it .
Experimenters , dabblers , and maybe those easily influenced by peer pressure -- the wrong kind of peers -- wear it sometimes without knowing they are mocking Christ by wearing it .
Many heavy metal and death metal rock band members and satanists sport this symbol .
Wearing of this hunk of metal might be ( as might be wearing of ANY symbol on this page ) indication of desire to cast off personal accountability to His Law and to flip off the consequences of poor choices and behavior .
SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC :
This is the logo of astrology , bears is a very complex history .
Astrologists believe astrology to be a science and that the soul of an individual is the center of its universe : his / her own god .
Astrologers tend to empirically correlate celestial phenomena with human experiences , thus the " science " of using the stars and planets to predict the future and matters of lust , love and reincarnation .
Sanderson Beck , apparently a noted astrologist states " ... I did astrology in Israel during and after the life of Jesus and John the Baptist whom I followed . " and that " ... The three magi in the gospels who were guided by a star to the birth of Jesus were astrologers . "
This icon of the twelve signs of the zodiac is also the icon of certain satanists and occultists in worship of the false god , Ishtar , the goddess of love / lust .
Spirits of fertility are subject to the power of the zodiac to produce every manner of immoral lust after and for the false gods of procreation .
Practitioners of the zodiac acknowledge their [ false ] god is Satan .
There is so much more that could be told about astrology and the practice of the zodiac , but any way you cut it there is worship and subservience to a false god and the workings of evil .
GOATHEAD : Also known as the god of witches , the Goat of Mendes , Baphomet , and the horned god .
Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God and performed the only pure and sin-free sacrifice for the atonement of man 's sins ; past , present , and future .
The goathead is a dark mockery of Jesus ' role as the Lamb of God .
It is the Satanist 's flip - off at Jesus .
I am particularly enraged at this waste of computer memory .
Jesus died so I wo n't have to and He spent three days in Hell so I wo n't have to .
Evidently , the goathead is the oldest fertility false god in human history and is claimed to have been " ... found on paintings from cavemen . "
Baphomet ( so called after the time of Christ ) actually means Bapho - Mitras : son of Mithras ( see the Tau Cross above ) .
The Goat of Mendez is the god of the witches .
( Mendez is another spelling of Mendes , a city of ancient Egypt where fertility worship - Ba'al worship -- was practiced ) .
Masons admit readily that Baphomet is a pagan fertility god and , more importantly , that Freemasonry may be a fertility cult religion .
At any rate , this mockery of Jesus is a satanic symbol and figures prominently in Satan worship .
' PEACE ' SYMBOL OR BROKEN CROSS : Welcome to the seventies , flower child .
Originally the Cross of Nero ( who falsely blamed the new first - century sect called Christians for burning down Rome ) , this emblem was used profusely by the hippies and freeks ( 1 ) , or more respectfully , the student movement of the seventies and by the anti-Vietnam war activists .
Now it is back by " popular demand . "
Little did the student movement and anti-Vietnam war activists know they were promoting the main doctrine of the church of Satan -- " Do what thou wilt ' is the whole of the law . "
Or maybe they DID know what they were promoting ?
At least some of them likely did .
In the hippie cult / student movement of the seventies , the focus of our culture was ( and mostly still is ) self - this and self - that , with total reliance on the self , never on Jesus except in probably rationalized ( blasphemous ) ways as in the Jesus - freeks who tainted the Authority of Jesus with flippant and insincere hearts .
Some questioned His Wisdom and Will by claiming that His Law applied in some but not all cases .
Some also claimed some of His Glory for the self ( there 's the ' self ' again ) .
See how something seemingly innocent can lead to quiet and invisible embracing of the father of lies and his familiars ?
Envision the Cross of Jesus : a vertically oriented lower case " t " without the serif ( curve ) at the bottom -- an upright beam ( the stipes ) with a cross-arm ( or patibulum ) .
Then invert the Cross then break the patibulum down on both sides .
Now , the Cross is head down , the patibulum broken with both halves pointing downward , all away from God and toward Hell .
Now you have the heart of the peace symbol , or a close variation of the Greek letter , lambda .
How our culture associated the Greek letter lambda as a symbol of peace , I have no idea .
The peace sign has even become known as the " devil 's claw . "
In 1970 , the Earth Day movement used the peace sign with a U.S. flag .
Inductees into satanism may be given a trinket cross for inverting and breaking the patibulum as an initiation ritual symbolic of rejecting Jesus or as having the power to break Him .
The purpose of the circle around the broken cross is not well known .
It may be symbolic of Satan 's lie that he is an eternal god who will reign forever .
While the circle may be only adornment or cosmetic , I suspect it is symbolic of further rejection of Jesus by symbolizing that His power can be confined .
The peace sign may also be symbolic of Satan casting Jesus into the eternal pit , broken and helpless ; an inversion of the True future for Satan .
Jesus has already been there ( for your sake and mine -- for three days ) and has emerged as Champion .
More contemporarily , the Cross of Nero is claimed to be a combination of the semaphore characters " N " and " D " for " Nuclear Disarmament . "
While this may indeed be an adaptation of the Cross of Nero , I more believe the nuclear disarmament people adapted the symbol to suit their needs .
(1) " Freeks " is the familiar spelling of " freaks . "
A colloquial term used by and among the hippie culture .
ABRACADABRA : A somewhat obscure term but still might be an indication of interest in witchcraft , satanism , or the occult , especially when the term is oriented atop itself with one letter removed in progression as shown .
YIN - YANG :
This doo - hickey is representative of all opposing forces , most notably between good and evil , male and female , and light and dark .
The light portion is male .
The dark portion is female .
Also the light portion is good and the dark is evil .
So , you would expect the occult groups to latch onto this emblem to represent their opposition to God 's Truth and especially His Law .
This emblem is used heavily by students and practitioners of the martial arts such as karate and other self - defense disciplines from the far east .
It 's origin is Chinese .
The symbol is also used by some to make a sexual statement of " 69 " which I will not discuss any further .
If you see this symbol , note whether the dark or light is on top .
Worn with the dark on top signifying evil over good or Satan over God is a relatively confident signal of its use to represent evil .
SCARAB BEETLE :
This little bug , a .k.a.
the dung beetle is the one that rolls manure into balls for food for their young .
An amulet of the scarab beetle was associated with sun worship in Egyptian cosmology and in Egyptian history .
From Egypt.com , " The scarab - beetle god Khepera was believed to push the setting sun along the sky in the same manner as the beetle with his ball of dung .
In many artifacts , the scarab is depicted pushing the sun along its course in the sky . "
" Scarab amulets were often placed over the heart of the mummified deceased . "
" The sun god had numerous forms , some of them worshipped as separate gods .
The rising sun was Khepri , shown as a scarab - beetle , the noonday sun was Horus , the hawk god , and the setting sun was Atum , shown as a ram - headed man . "
Ram - headed man , huh .
Sounds a lot like the goatheaded .
So , here is a link between the scarab beetle as an adornment to Satanism .
If not true , then its connection with a " sun god " is a connection with false worship -- anything to take men away from God .
SATANIC OR BROKEN " S " : More of Nazi Germany .
This is the symbol worn by the murderous Secret Service of Nazi Germany .
In Greek mythology , this symbol represents a thunderbolt ( destruction ) from Zeus , another false god .
The broken " s " represents the bearer having power over others .
There is no wonder why Hitler adopted it as a standard for his hitmen -- more evidence of Hitler 's fascination and embracement of Satanism .
Indiana Jones : Raiders of the Lost Ark was not too far off with " Hilter 's a nut on the subject . "
SATANIC CROSS :
The holy Cross with an upside down question mark attached to the bottom .
The question mark is to state to observers that they should question Jesus : his Work , Will , and Way .
Many contemporary rock groups flaunt the satanic cross as well as other satanic notions .
UDJAT OR ALL - SEEING EYE :
As an amulet , variations of the udjat are used for wisdom , protection , good health , prosperity , clairvoyant powers , and protection from the evil eye .
It is often used as a funerary amulet to guard against evil forces and for rebirth in the underworld .
There are other mythological and cultural uses of this symbol .
One is the Eye of Horus ( the falcon god ) or the wadjet , symbolizing the loss of an eye of a god 's son in battle .
Another is as the Eye of Ra ( Egyptian sun god ) or Heru , adorned with the markings of the ever - watching eye of a hawk .
But in satanism , it is as evil as evil can be .
It is the right eye of satan in the role of Big Brother , always watching , always examining and judging , half - closed to make the subject think he is not watching .
While Drs. Haynes and Carlin believe the object below the eye is a tear to symbolize that Satan mourns for those outside his influence , I believe it would better fit as a tear in recognition of his future .
STAR AND CRESCENT : With God mockingly placed as the moon ( the goddess of love , Dianna ) , Satan assumes the role of the star , which is a mockery of Jesus as the ... bright and morning star ... : [ Rev. 22:16 ]
" I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches .
I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star . "
Satan was cast out of heaven because of trying to usurp Jesus -- Satan wanted Jesus ' position ( 2 ) .
Recall Milton : " It is better to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven . "
What a lie !
So , it is no wonder Satan tries to unjustly claim that which Jesus owns , for one , His ownership of being the bright and morning star .
And , of course , if you will note the relative positions of the star and crescent moon in the image -- the star is over the moon .
Drs. Haynes and Carlin share with us that the symbol may be found in both white and witchcraft and satanism .
(2) If you are wondering how Satan could usurp Jesus before
He was even born , let me try to explain .
God is a triune - three personages in one : the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit .
So , when God cast out Satan even before the Garden of Eden was created , Jesus was there .
This is evidenced in John 1:1 ; " In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . "
" The Word " is Jesus -- the author and bringer of the Word ( the Gospel Truth of Salvation through His Blood ) .
So , rewritten to replace " the Word " with Jesus : " In the beginning was Jesus , and Jesus was with God , and Jesus was God . "
The man in Jesus died on the Cross , God in Jesus did not .
An electric no-emission car has made folks gawk and ride Eco-shuttle
The electric no-emission car has made folks park their car and go for a ride

An electric no-emission car has made folks gawk and ride 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It looks like a golf cart on steroids .
Or a golf cart that got mixed up , in a good way , with a limo and a VW bug .
For the past few months , the electric cart owned by REV Houston has made pedestrians and drivers stop , gawk or do double - takes .
Perhaps it 's because the no-emission vehicle — a.k.a. " eco-shuttle " — is so quiet that it sneaks up on you .
REV Houston offers shuttle service in a napkin - sized area around downtown and midtown , bounded by Bagby , Elgin , Interstate 10 and U.S. 59 .
Company co-founder Erik Ibarra , 28 , said he got the idea from the pedicabs hauling folks to and from Astros games .
" I thought it'd be so much more efficient if the guy had , like , a golf cart or something , " Ibarra said .
For passengers , the price is right .
Drivers work for tips only .
And unless city officials shut the operation down due to a licensing dispute , Ibarra expects to turn a profit fairly soon .
On a recent sunny afternoon , Ibarra picked up two women from the Wells Fargo building in the 1000 block of Smith and drove them to the University of Houston - Downtown , where each was taking a class on her lunch hour .
The women sat together in the middle row of the open - air cart , hair flying .
This was Jeanie Robins ' fourth ride in the eco-shuttle .
" Instead of me buying a parking pass at UH , I 'm going to tip these guys , " she explained .
" It 's like my own little valet . "
Fellow passenger Nikki Toca has booked REV Houston twice a week for the next few months to take her to her accounting class and back .
Robins and Toca laughed about their first impressions of the vehicle and its drivers .
" My friends and I are thinking , ' Now this guy is trying to save on gas , ' " Toca said .
The company 's fleet of Global Electric Motorcars , a Chrysler subsidiary , is small .
The 6 - seater sees most of the action , but there 's also a 4 - seater in case they need it .
Each car can travel up to 25 mph on a battery that 's limited to 30 miles and plugs into a regular three - pronged outlet .
It takes 8 hours to charge a completely dead battery , but the company steals time to recharge throughout the day .
When Ibarra and business partner Justin Jones started REV Houston in April , they anticipated a certain clientele .
" We thought the market was going to be mostly baseball games , taking people from their parking spot to the game or between the Toyota Center and parking , " Ibarra said .
" But that 's probably the smallest segment . "
Busiest times are weekdays around lunch and weekend evenings .
Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. , people do n't want to move their cars to go to lunch , said Ibarra .
At the same time , they do n't want to walk from the 1000 block of Louisiana to , say , Kim Son , nearly 2 miles away at 2001 Jefferson .
So they take the shuttle .
Thursdays through Saturdays , from 9 p.m. to the early morning hours , REV Houston is flooded with calls or texts from people going to dinner , ball games , concerts , bars and more .
" We 'll drop someone off at a club , " said Ibarra , " and they 'll say , ' Come back at 2 a .m. to pick me up . ' "
The carts also come equipped with rain covers , which attach to the sides of the vehicles and zip up to the top .
But it 's not a perfect solution , Ibarra admits : " It 's like a greenhouse in there . "
Still , business is good , Ibarra said .
He and Jones financed both of the carts , which cost close to $ 15,000 apiece , and spent less than $ 2,000 on advertising .
They hope to be making a profit by April , the first anniversary of the company launch .
Certainly , working for tips keeps things interesting .
Tips tend to be better at night , when people are relaxed and partying .
During the day , a typical tip is $ 5 a person , said Ibarra , though there are those occasional $ 2 rides .
That 's not the biggest challenge on the horizon , however .
REV Houston does not have a special license to drive the electric carts .
Already , the city has given the company three tickets with numerous citations , including operating a taxi without a license .
The city defines a taxi cab as any automobile or motor - propelled vehicle used for the transport of passengers for hire , explained Blanton Daniels , manager of the city 's transportation division .
Pedicabs do n't qualify as taxis because they are n't motor - propelled , he said , but REV Houston 's electric carts do .
" They 're trying to circumvent the regulation by saying they 're working for gratuities , " said Daniels , adding that he sees no difference between a taxi for hire and a taxi that works for tips .
It 's still money changing hands .
In addition , city guidelines say taxis should be midsized sedans .
" We want to encourage green businesses , but there are larger considerations , including safety and the other companies that are playing by the rules , " said Frank Michel , spokesman for the Houston mayor 's office .
" Just because you 're green does n't mean you do n't have the play by the same rules as everyone else . "
The only way the city could allow the electric carts to operate as taxis is by creating a special ordinance that fits their category of business , Daniels said .
Until then , the city will continue to ticket the electric carts .
Ibarra does n't seem worried .
" We have an attorney and we 're going to court at some point , " he said .
" I just can't believe we qualify as a taxi .
The vehicle only goes 25 miles an hour . "

Lawsuit : Cops beat diabetic man into a coma after mistaking hypoglycemia for drunkenness Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
The wife of 59 - year - old Ernest Griglen , in a coma since June , has filed a federal lawsuit against two Michigan police departments , alleging that officers beat Griglen into a coma .
Pamela Griglen and attorney Arnold Reed , seeking $ 20 million in damages , say that officers from the Allen Park and Dearborn police departments severely beat Mr. Griglen , of Detroit , in the head and face during a June 15 traffic stop , following a chase , after mistaking a hypoglycemic episode for alcohol intoxication .
Police reports say that Griglen was being chased due to a domestic violence complaint , and described him as " combative , " saying that he had fled a traffic stop and resisted arrest .
The Dearborn report indicates the use of pepper spray on Griglen and cites " a black object " on Griglen 's waistband .
A breathalyzer test confirmed that Griglen was not under the influence of alcohol , and officers later found his insulin pump .
" The unnecessary and completely excessive force was something that was not needed , " said Reed .
" Doctors have indicated he will probably never wake up .
What his wife is left with is everyday she sees him and stands over him and talks to him and he can't respond .
No amount of money in the world can compensate her or her family for this type of injustice . "
While the reports say that Griglen 's injuries were " little more than a bloody nose " and a " bump on the forehead , " his wife said he complained of head and leg pain , and said he could n't see , before falling comatose .
Griglen 's blood sugar level was found to be dangerously low according to the hospital 's test , and part of his brain was removed during emergency surgery .
" They did n't beat John Hinckley Jr. after he shot President Reagan , " Reed said , " and they should n't have done it to Mr. Griglen , either . "
No dashboard camera footage is available .
The accompanying video report was broadcast on September 22 , 2008 on WDIV .

Intelligence Test - IQ Test 4
You have to work out what the letters mean .
See No 0 as an example .
It does n't matter if you write the answers in uppercase or lowercase , but the answers must be exactly as expected ( no additional intervals or dashes and the spelling must be correct ) .
There is no time limit for this test .
Answers will automatically be verified as you type 'em .
The economy is in bad shape , as the pundits have coined it , " from Wall Street to Main Street . "
Anyone following the news has some idea of what that may mean for their retirement savings and home loans , but what about the less obvious effects of social and economic hardship ?
The more subtle effects are often quite unexpected — and sometimes counterintuitive .
For example , while money troubles may evoke visions of penniless and desperate Wall Street investors jumping to their deaths during the Great Depression , that is actually a myth .
Loren Coleman , an expert on suicides and author of " The Copycat Effect , " notes that suicides actually decrease during times of social and economic stress : " Historical studies conducted by sociologist Steven Stack and others have discovered a noticeable dip in suicides and related violent events when there is society - wide anguish , for example , in times of massive immediate grieving in periods of wars and economic depressions . "
Though hard times may not drive you to suicide , the stress they create can be dangerous .
The role of stress in health problems , from high blood pressure and heart disease , is well established .
Then there are the secondary effects of stress that trigger unhealthy behaviors such as smoking .
In times of stress , people tend to seek comfort — and comfort foods .
People who are worried about their retirement and paying the bills are even more likely to want hamburgers and a night of relaxing on the couch instead of carrot sticks and hitting the treadmill .
Add to that the disparity between cheap fast food and expensive healthier food , and the troubled economy will hit not only the wallets but the waistlines of many Americans .
In some cases , the stress can be fatal , especially to unborn males .
Research has shown that fewer males are born during times of hardship .
Exactly why is not clear , though one theory suggests that male fetuses tend be weaker than females and therefore are aborted at higher rates .
Basically , the pregnant woman 's body decides to cut its losses and self - abort the less viable male children rather than wasting potentially scarce resources carrying them to term .
Researchers have also found that levels of superstition and magical thinking increase during times of stress and economic uncertainty .
People turn more to astrology and psychics , looking for comfort and reassurance that everything will be okay .
Superstitions also give many people the illusion of control over some part of their lives .
For people in the grip of magical thinking ( which is practically all of us at one time or another ) , lucky numbers or rituals help us to believe that we are overcoming ( or at least gaining an edge over ) the seemingly randomness of an uncertain world .
The U.S. economy will , sooner or later , recover .
But the effects of the economic crisis will be felt for generations , probably in more ways than we can know .

A FRIEND IN FRIED I ’ve been following these Obama - endorsing Republicans with great interest , but there ’s clearly a distinction between surprising GOP support and the more predictable GOP support .
Scott McClellan ?
Not a surprise .
Ken Adelman ?
A surprise .
Colin Powell ?
Not really a surprise .
William Weld ?
A mild surprise .
But Charles
Fried is not only a surprise , he ’s a first of sorts .
Cass Sunstein reports :
Charles Fried , a professor at Harvard Law School , has long been one of the most important conservative thinkers in the United States .
Under President Reagan , he served , with great distinction , as Solicitor General of the United States .
Since then , he has been prominently associated with several Republican leaders and candidates , most recently John McCain , for whom he expressed his enthusiastic support in January .
This week , Fried announced that he has voted for Obama - Biden by absentee ballot .
In his letter to Trevor Potter , the General Counsel to the McCain - Palin campaign , he asked that his name be removed from the several campaign - related committees on which he serves .
In that letter , he said that chief among the reasons for his decision “ is the choice of Sarah Palin at a time of deep national crisis . ”
Fried is not only a respected lawyer and credible voice on judicial issues , he ’s been an advisor to the McCain campaign .
And as of this week , he just could n’t go through with it .
He ’d seen what McCain had become , and he threw his support to Obama .
Are there practical implications of notable Republicans siding with Obama ?
It ’s hard to say without any real data , but I do think it undermines of the McCain campaign ’s central talking points — Obama the “ extremist . ”
I suspect there are probably at least some independents out there wondering , “ If Obama is so far from the mainstream , why do Colin Powell and a bunch of Republicans keep endorsing him ? ”
The New Technology of Repression
In its final months , the Bush administration is pressing ahead with a new generation of spy technology designed to strengthen the U.S. military ’s ability to detect and eliminate suspected insurgents in Iraq and elsewhere based on computer analyses of their movements and activities .

Printer friendly The Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has begun granting contracts to software firms to create algorithms that can be applied to the real - time video feeds from drone aircraft so the data can be sorted and stored on a wide range of human activities , from digging a ditch to climbing into a car to kissing someone .
The contracts represent the latest step in the Bush administration ’s seven - year drive to develop high - tech spying capabilities that can be applied to a variety of situations and locales to detect terrorist or insurgent activities .
The new DARPA project would develop algorithms that would identify specific human activities – both by individuals and by groups – and evaluate if these actions suggested behavior that would justify a military response .
The list of activities that would draw attention to a single person include “ digging , loitering , picking up , throwing , exploding / burning , carrying , shooting , launching , walking , limping , running , kicking , smoking , gesturing , ” according to DARPA ’s contract description .
For person - to - person activities , the project would identify and catalogue cases of “ following , meeting , gathering , moving in a group , dispersing , shaking hands , kissing , exchanging objects , kicking , carrying together . ”
Categories relating to vehicles include getting into or out of a car , opening or closing the trunk , driving , accelerating , turning , stopping , passing and maintaining distances .
According to DARPA ’s description , the research project addresses challenges faced by intelligence analysts in processing and retrieving the vast amounts of visual data created by live video feeds from Predator drones and other aerial surveillance over Iraq and Afghanistan .
By identifying and indexing specific actions , the analysts would be helped in evaluating potential threats and could retrieve video regarding similar behavior .
“ The U.S. military and intelligence communities have an ever increasing need to monitor live video feeds and search large volumes of archived video data for activities of interest due to the rapid growth in development and fielding of motion video systems , ” said the DARPA document , written in March but withheld from the public until September .
Kitware , a software company with offices in New York and North Carolina , won an initial $ 6.7 million contract for what is technically called Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool , or VIRAT .
In a statement about the contract award , Kitware projected that through its proposed system , “ the most high - value intelligence content will be clearly and intuitively presented to the video analyst , resulting in substantial reductions in analyst workload per mission as well as increasing the quality and accuracy of intelligence yield . ”
Anthony Hoogs , Kitware ’s project leader , said , ” This project will really make a difference to the war fighter . ”
To carry out the project , Kitware said it was teaming up with two leading military technology companies , Honeywell and General Dynamics , as well as a number of academic researchers .

Repression Works
Though this DARPA project is not expected to be completed until early next decade , other technological breakthroughs reportedly have helped U.S. forces identify and kill insurgents in Iraq .
In his latest book , The War Within , Bob Woodward writes that highly classified U.S. intelligence tactics allowed for rapid targeting and killing of Iraqi insurgent leaders , representing a more important factor in undermining the insurgency than President George W. Bush ’s much touted troop “ surge . ”
However , Woodward withheld details of these secret techniques so as not to undermine their effectiveness .
Still , there have been previous glimpses of classified U.S. programs that combine high - tech means of identifying insurgents – such as sophisticated biometrics and night - vision - equipped drones – with old - fashioned brutality on the ground , including on - the - spot executions of suspected insurgents .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush ’s Global Dirty War ” and “ Iraq ’s Laboratory of Repression . ” ]
However , the marriage of advanced technology and military repression has raised concerns among some human rights advocates that these techniques could open the door to an Orwellian future in which authoritarian regimes repress popular resistance .
DARPA , with its mandate to push the envelope on the application of technology for military and intelligence purposes , also has been caught up before in controversies about balancing security against liberty .
In 2002 , DARPA came under criticism when it unveiled plans for Total Information Awareness , a project that sought to detect terrorist activities by mining electronic data about virtually everyone on earth , anyone who participated in the modern economy .
The plan was to map out “ transactional data ” collected from every kind of activity – “ financial , education , travel , medical , veterinary , country entry , place / event entry , transportation , housing , critical resources , government , communications , ” according to the DARPA Web site .
The program would then cross-reference this data with the “ biometric signatures of humans , ” data collected on individuals ’ faces , fingerprints , gaits and irises .
To run the sensitive project , the Bush administration selected retired Admiral John Poindexter , who was convicted of five felony counts in the Iran - Contra Affair ( though a conservative - dominated appeals court later reversed the jury verdicts ) .
Public and congressional outrage over this massive data - mining operation supposedly killed the TIA program in 2003 , but the National Journal revealed in February 2006 that the project was ended in name only , kept alive within the secret budget of the National Security Agency .
One TIA component , called the Information Awareness Prototype System , was renamed “ Basketball ” at NSA , but still provided the basic architecture tying together information extraction , analysis and dissemination tools developed under TIA .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration began deploying similar advanced technology to Iraq with the goal of throttling the insurgency that was challenging the U.S. military occupation .
In effect , Iraq was transformed into a test tube for modern techniques of repression , including use of night - vision optics on drone aircraft , heat resonance imaging , and firepower that is both deadly and precise .
The new techniques marked a modernization of tactics used in other counterinsurgencies , such as in Vietnam in the 1960s and in Central America in the 1980s .
In Vietnam , U.S. forces planted sensors along infiltration routes for targeting bombing runs against North Vietnamese troops .
In Guatemala , security forces were equipped with early laptop computers for use in identifying suspected subversives who would be dragged off buses and summarily executed .
Last year , a conservative counterinsurgency expert sent me a video , spliced together by the U.S. military in Iraq , showing how some of the modern techniques worked in Iraq .
The video showed night - vision aerial surveillance of suspected “ terrorists ” as they moved in the dark with what was described as a truck - mounted anti-aircraft gun , the muzzle still warm from firing .
The tiny figures of these “ terrorists ” then walked into a forested area where they were mowed down by miniguns from an AC - 130 .
Their truck also was blown to bits .
Biometrics Besides using Predator drones to monitor the movement of Iraqis from the sky , massive amounts of biometric data have been collected on the country ’s people for use in identifying suspected insurgents .
Explaining the value of this computerized database , Pentagon weapons designer Anh Duong told the Washington Post that it gave valuable information to soldiers on the ground .
" A war fighter needs to know one of three things :
Do I let him go ?
Keep him ?
Or shoot him on the spot ? ”
Duong said .
Though Duong is best known for designing high - explosives used to destroy hardened targets , she also supervised this Joint Expeditionary Forensics Facilities project , known as a “ lab in a box ” for analyzing biometric data , such as iris scans and fingerprints , that have been collected on more than one million Iraqis .
The labs – collapsible , 20 - by - 20 - foot units each with a generator and a satellite link to a biometric data base in West Virginia – let U.S. forces cross-check data in the field against information collected previously that can be used to identify insurgents .
Duong said the next step would be to shrink the lab to the size of a “ backpack ” so soldiers who encounter a suspect “ could find out within minutes ” if he ’s on a terrorist watch list and should be killed .
[ Washington Post , Dec. 1 , 2007 ]
By identifying and indexing a wide range of human activities captured on surveillance videos , the new DARPA project could augment some of these other security projects , already in place or in development .
Regarding the video analysis , however , DARPA specifically prohibited inclusion of biometric algorithms for identifying people by their gaits or other individual features .
However , those elements , which are being developed separately , presumably could be added to the overall technological package at a later date .

The news that naff Eighties crooner Rick Astley is somehow in the running for Best Act Ever at the MTV Europe awards next month is both funny and mysterious .
Why Rick ?
Where has he been all these years ?
Britney , U2 and Green Day are on the shortlist with a man whose last big hit was 17 years ago .
He was a proper star once , though , thanks to producers Stock , Aitken and Waterman : his first single , " Never Gonna Give You Up " got to No1 here and in the States back in 1987 .
Six years later , aged just 27 , Astley retired .
The big quiff and deep voice that did n't fit his boyish face were gone .
Until now .
His comeback is the result of a geeky internet joke : you were sent a picture of a duck on wheels after clicking a false link – to win a free laptop , say .
That was Duckrolling .
Then somebody swapped the duck for a YouTube clip of Astley performing .
Rickrolling , see ?
The randomness made it amusing – an estimated 40 million computer users have now been Rickrolled .
MTV blames the nomination on Rickrolling , but that can't be true : fans had to write his name , not mistakenly click a link .
Rick , now 42 , seems a bit embarrassed , if pleased .
He dropped out of the music business for personal reasons , including disenchantment , a fear of flying and a desire to quit while ahead .
He has settled quietly in Surrey with his partner Lene and their daughter Emilie and reportedly has a boat on the Solent and a musical to work on .
He recently made a return to performing , the highlight of which must have been headlining at the Northampton Balloon Festival .
So will Rick be rolling along to the awards ?
Probably not .
" I 'm really happy with the life I 've got .
I 'll just leave it at that . "

Apple has gotten a significant amount of critical press surrounding its rejection policies in the App Store .
A few high profile rejections have been widely reported and inspired at least one amusing comic .
Apparently , Apple has now started labeling their rejection letters with Non-Disclosure ( NDA ) warnings :
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS MESSAGE IS UNDER NON - DISCLOSURE
Readers should note that Apple 's developer correspondence may have already been covered by the original NDA , but Apple is now making it clear .
In contrast to Apple 's approval process for the App Store , the newly announced Android Market claims an entirely unrestricted free - for - all model .
Early concerns about that model question how inappropriate , spam , or malicious material may be filtered .
It seems that the efforts to prevent issues such as bandwidth abuse have been shifted to the carrier who has implemented caps for the 3G data plans at 1GB per month :
If your total data usage in any billing cycle is more than 1GB , your data throughput for the remainder of that cycle may be reduced to 50 kbps or less .
First Wal - Mart union begins in China thanks to gov't Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday August 3 , 2008
Print This Email This
The first Wal - Mart trade union in China was formed after the company bowed to government demands for organized labor in its stores , The New York Times reported Friday .
Wal - Mart 's reluctance to allow unions , particularly in the United States where they remain banned from stores , has been a point of controversy for many years .
But the government - controlled All - China Federation of Trade Unions fought for the right to create branches in the company 's 60 outlets .
Beth Keck , director of international corporate affairs for Wal - Mart , said she was aware of the reports of Chinese unions forming and said the company hopes to have a " cordial and productive relationship " with the federation .
" We know they have been interested in having a relationship with our company for some time , " Keck said .
" We will , of course , be looking forward to how this will evolve . "
Wal - Mart , the world 's largest retailer , has operations in 15 countries , many of which have at least some employees that are union members .
The United States , Keck said , is the " clear exception . "
The change comes at a time when Wal - Mart is already battling the proposed Employee Free Choice Act -- which might allow unionization of Wal - Marts on this side of the ocean -- by attempting to sway its employees from voting Democratic .
While the company insists it is not telling employees how to vote , some who attended meetings with Wal - Mart human resources managers that delivered the company 's anti-union line scoff at the notion .
" The meeting leader said , ' I am not telling you how to vote , but if the Democrats win , this bill will pass and you wo n't have a vote on whether you want a union , ' " a Wal - Mart customer - service supervisor from Missouri told the paper .
" I am not a stupid person .
They were telling me how to vote , " she said .
Wal - Mart has fought against unions for years and has many systems in place to prevent them from forming .
As soon as Wal - Mart managers see a potential union , they are supposed to call a hotline , prompting a visit from a special team from Wal - Mart headquarters , The Los Angeles Times reported .
Former Wal - Mart manager Jon Lehman told Frontline what he would tell employees regarding unions .
" I used to stand up in front of my workers and lie to them , " he said .
" I used to say the talking points , that the union 's a cult : ' You do n't want to join a union .
It 's a cult .
Why pay someone to speak for you ?
You can speak for yourself . ' "
In a segment below from the documentary " Wal - Mart : The High Cost of Low Prices , " former employees talk about the company 's policies to prevent unionization .
DEMOCRATIC candidate Barak Obama last night claimed he was quoted out of context after describing Governor Sarah Palin as a ' creationist psycho bitch ' .
He dismissed the ' phoney outrage ' of the Republican camp , insisting the remark was not intended to do anything other than draw attention to Governor Palin 's insane beliefs and ugly , bitch - like qualities .
Senator Obama said : " I was simply implying what a stupid , horrible , terrifying freak she is .
I can't help it if people decide to take that literally .
" I was using a metaphor to make the important point that if you want another four years of psychotic , blood thirsty creationists who love sucking the oil industry 's big fat cock , then vote for my opponents . "
He added : " I did then go on to say that if Jesus came down from heaven and told me I would have to fuck either Sarah Palin or a pig , you 'd have to drag me off the pig .
" Now that does n't mean I 'm comparing Governor Palin to a pig .
What I am saying is that if it's a straight choice between Governor Palin and a pig , I 'm fucking the pig .
" If I then went on to say that I 'd rather fuck a dead pig than Governor Palin , that should not be construed in any way as a personal attack . "
Senator Obama refused to apologise to the Governor , insisting it would take too long to translate the words into her ' retarded hillbilly language ' .

[ In Notes and Recollections , Mises revealed that he meant to include this essay — written in 1926 — in the original German edition of Critique of Interventionism ( 1929 ) .
It was left out of that volume through editorial error , but was included in later editions .
An MP3 audio version of this article , read by Dr. Floy Lilley , is available for download . ]
Arthur Travers - Borgstroem , a Finnish writer , published a book entitled Mutualism that deals with ideas of social reform , and culminates in a plea for the nationalization of credit .
A German edition appeared in 1923 .
In 1917 , the author had established a foundation under his name in Berne , Switzerland , whose primary objective was the conferring of prizes for writings on the nationalization of credit .
The panel of judges consisted of Professors Diehl , Weyermann , Milhaud , and Reichesberg , the bankers Milliet , Somary , Kurz , and others .
The judges awarded a prize to a paper submitted by Dr. Robert Deumer , director of the Reichsbank in Berlin .
This paper was published in book form by the Mutualist Association of Finland .
From the background material of the paper we can learn why the author is not concerned with the rationale of credit nationalization , but merely with the details of its realization .
Dr. Deumer is presenting a proposal , elaborated in its insignificant details , on the nationalization of all German institutions of banking and credit , and the establishment of a national credit monopoly .
But his plan can be of no interest to us as no one is contemplating its implementation in the foreseeable future .
And if there ever should be such a movement , conditions may be quite different so that the Deumer proposal will not be applicable .
Therefore , it would not make any sense to discuss its details , such as article I , section 10 , of the " Draft of a Bill Nationalizing Banking and Credit , " which reads ,
" He who engages in any banking and credit transaction after the nationalization will be subject to a fine not exceeding ten million gold marks , or imprisonment up to five years , or both . "
Deumer 's work is of interest to us because of its motives for the nationalization of credit , and its statements on a reform that preserves the superiority of " profit " management over " bureaucratic " management .
These statements reveal an opinion that is shared by a large majority of our contemporaries — yes , that is even accepted without contradiction .
If we should share this Deumer - Travers - Borgstroem - mutualist position we must welcome a nationalization of credit and every other measure leading to socialism .
In fact , we must agree to its realizability and even its urgent necessity .
The public welcomes all proposals designed to limit the sphere of private property and entrepreneurship because it readily accepts the critique of the private - property order by the Socialists of the Chair in Germany , the Solidarists in France , the Fabians in Great Britain , and the Institutionalists in the United States .
If the nationalization proposals have not yet been fully realized we must not search for any opposition in social literature and the political parties .
We must look to the fact that the public realizes that whenever enterprises are nationalized and municipalized or government otherwise interferes with economic life , financial failure and serious disruption of production and transportation follow instead of the desired consequences .
Ideology has not yet taken stock of this failure of reality .
It continues to hold fast to the desirability of public enterprises and the inferiority of private enterprises .
And it continues to find only malice , selfishness , and ignorance in opposition to its proposals , of which every objective observer should approve .
Under such conditions an analysis of Deumer 's reasoning seems to be in order .
1. Private Interest And Public Interest
According to Deumer , banks presently serve private interests .
They serve public interests only inasmuch as these do not conflict with the former .
Banks do not finance those enterprises that are most essential from the national point of view , but only those that promise to yield the highest return .
For instance , they finance " a whiskey distillery or any other enterprise that is superfluous for the economy . "
" From the national point of view , their activity is not only useless , but even harmful . "
" Banks permit enterprises to grow whose products are not in demand ; they stimulate unnecessary consumption , which in turn reduces the people 's purchasing power for goods that are more important culturally and rationally .
Furthermore , their loans waste socially necessary capital , which causes essential production to decline , or at least their costs of credit , and thus their production costs , to rise . "
Obviously , Deumer does not realize that in a market order , capital and labor are distributed over the economy in such a way that , except for the risk premium , capital yields the same return , and similar labor earns the same wage everywhere .
The production of " unnecessary " goods pays no more and no less than that of " essential goods . "
In the final analysis , it is the consumers in the market who determine the employment of capital and labor in the various industries .
When the demand for an item rises its prices will rise and thus the profits , which causes new enterprises to be built and existing enterprises to be expanded .
Consumers decide whether this or that industry will receive more capital .
If they demand more beer , more beer will be brewed .
If they want more classical plays , the theaters will add classics to their repertoire and offer fewer antics , slapstick , and operettas .
The taste of the public , not the producer , decides that The Merry Widow and The Garden of Eden are performed more often than Goethe 's Tasso .
To be sure , Deumer 's taste differs from that of the public .
He is convinced that people should spend their money differently .
Many would agree with him .
But from this difference in taste Deumer draws the conclusion that a socialistic command system should be established through nationalization of credit , so that public consumption can be redirected .
On this we must disagree with Deumer .
Guided by central authority according to central plan , a socialistic economy can be democratic or dictatorial .
A democracy in which the central authority depends on public support through ballots and elections cannot proceed differently from the capitalistic economy .
It will produce and distribute what the public likes , that is , alcohol , tobacco , trash in literature , on the stage , and in the cinema , and fashionable frills .
The capitalistic economy , however , caters as well to the taste of a few consumers .
Goods are produced that are demanded by some consumers , and not by all .
The democratic command economy with its dependence on popular majority need not consider the special wishes of the minority .
It will cater exclusively to the masses .
But even if it is managed by a dictator who , without consideration for the wishes of the public , enforces what he deems best — who clothes , feeds , and houses the people as he sees fit — there is no assurance that he will do what appears proper to " us . "
The critics of the capitalistic order always seem to believe that the socialistic system of their dreams will do precisely what they think correct .
While they may not always count on becoming dictators themselves , they are hoping that the dictator will not act without first seeking their advice .
Thus they arrive at the popular contrast of productivity and profitability .
They call " productive " those economic actions they deem correct .
And because things may be different at times , they reject the capitalistic order , which is guided by profitability and the wishes of consumers , the true masters of markets and production .
They forget that a dictator , too , may act differently from their wishes , and that there is no assurance that he will really try for the " best , " and , even if he should seek it , that he should find the way to the " best . "
" In the final analysis , it is the consumers in the market who determine the employment of capital and labor in the various industries . "
It is an even more serious question whether a dictatorship of the " best " or a committee of the " best " can prevail over the will of the majority .
Will the people , in the long run , tolerate an economic dictatorship that refuses to give them what they want to consume and gives them only what the leaders deem useful ?
Will not the masses succeed in the end in forcing the leaders to pay heed to public wishes and taste and do what the reformers sought to prevent ?
We may agree with Deumer 's subjective judgment that the consumption by our fellow men is often undesirable .
If we believe this , we may attempt to convince them of their errors .
We may inform them of the harm of excessive use of alcohol and tobacco , of the lack of value of certain movies , and of many other things .
He who wants to promote good writings may imitate the example of the Bible Society that makes financial sacrifices in order to sell Bibles at reduced prices and to make them available in hotels and other public places .
If this is yet insufficient , there cannot be any doubt that the will of our fellow men must be subdued .
Economic production according to profitability means production according to the wishes of consumers , whose demand determines goods prices and thus capital yield and entrepreneurial profit .
Whenever economic production according to " national productivity " deviates from the former , it means production that disregards the consumers ' wishes , but pleases the dictator or committee of dictators .
Surely , in a capitalistic order a fraction of national income is spent by the rich on luxuries .
But regardless of the fact that this fraction is very small and does not substantially affect production , the luxury of the well - to - do has dynamic effects that seem to make it one of the most important forces of economic progress .
Every innovation makes its appearance as a " luxury " of the few well - to - do .
After industry has become aware of it , the luxury then becomes a " necessity " for all .
Take , for example , our clothing , the lighting and bathroom facilities , the automobile , and travel facilities .
Economic history demonstrates how the luxury of yesterday has become today 's necessity .
A great deal of what people in the less capitalistic countries consider luxury is a common good in the more capitalistically developed countries .
In Vienna , ownership of a car is a luxury ( not just in the eyes of the tax collector ) ; in the United States , one out of four or five individuals owns one .
The critic of the capitalist order who seeks to improve the conditions of the masses should not point at this luxury consumption as long as he has not disproved the assertion of theorists and the experience of reality that only capitalistic production assures highest possible production .
If a command system produces less than a private - property order it will obviously not be possible to supply the masses with more than they have today .
The poor performance of public enterprises is usually blamed on bureaucratic management .
In order to render state , municipal , and other public operations as successful as private enterprise , they should be organized and directed along commercial lines .
This is why for decades everything has been tried to make such operations more productive through " commercialization . "
The problem became all the more important as state and municipal operations expanded .
But not by a single step has anyone come closer to the solution .
2. Bureaucratic Management or Profit Management of Banking ?
Deumer , too , deems it necessary " to manage the national banking monopoly along commercial lines , " and makes several recommendations on how to achieve this .
They do not differ from many other proposals in recent years or from those which under the circumstances could and have been achieved .
We hear of schools and examinations , of promotion of the " able , " of sufficient pay for employees , and of profit sharing for leading officials .
But Deumer does not see the essence of the problem any more clearly than do any others who seek to make the inevitably unproductive system of public operations more productive .
" A government enterprise can never be ' commercialized ' no matter how many external features of private enterprise are superimposed on it . "
Deumer , in step with prevailing opinion , seems to believe erroneously that the " commercial " is a form of organization that can easily be grafted onto government enterprises in order to debureaucratize them .
That which usually is called " commercial " is the essence of private enterprise aiming at nothing but the greatest possible profitability .
And that which usually is called " bureaucratic " is the essence of government operations aiming at " national " objectives .
A government enterprise can never be " commercialized " no matter how many external features of private enterprise are superimposed on it .
The entrepreneur operates on his own responsibility .
If he does not produce at lowest costs of capital and labor what consumers believe they need most urgently , he suffers losses .
But losses finally lead to a transfer of his wealth — and thus his power of control over means of production — to more capable hands .
In a capitalistic economy , the means of production are always on the way to the most capable manager , that is , to one who is able to use these means most economically to the satisfaction of consumer needs .
A public enterprise , however , is managed by men who do not face the consequences of their success or failure .
The same is said to be true of the leading executives of large private enterprises which therefore are run as " bureaucratically " as state and municipal operations .
But such arguments ignore the basic difference between public and private enterprises .
In a private , profit - seeking enterprise , every department and division is controlled by bookkeeping and accounting aiming at the same profit objective .
Departments and divisions that are unprofitable are reorganized or closed .
Workers and executives who fail in their assigned tasks are removed .
Accounting in dollars and cents controls every part of the business .
Monetary calculation alone shows the way to highest profitability .
The owners — that is , the stockholders of a corporation — issue only one order to the manager who transmits it to the employees : earn profits .
The situation is quite different in the bureaus and courts that administer the affairs of the state .
Their tasks cannot be measured and calculated in a way market prices are calculated , and the order given to subordinates cannot be so easily defined as that of an entrepreneur to his employees .
If the administration is to be uniform and all executive power is not to be delegated to the lowest officials , their actions must be regulated in every detail for every conceivable case .
Thus it becomes the duty of every official to follow these instructions .
Success and failure are of lesser importance than formal observance of the regulation .
This is especially visible in the hiring , treatment , and promotion of personnel , and is called " bureaucratism . "
It is no evil that springs from some failure or shortcoming of the organization or the incompetence of officials ; it is the nature of every enterprise that is not organized for profit .
When state and municipality go beyond the sphere of court and police , bureaucratism becomes a basic problem of social organization .
Even a profit - seeking public enterprise could not be unbureaucratic .
Attempts have been made to eliminate bureaucratism through profit sharing by managers .
But since they could not be expected to bear the eventual losses , they are tempted to become reckless , which then is to be avoided by limiting the manager 's authority through directives from higher officials , boards , committees , and " expert " opinions .
Thus again , more regulation and bureaucratization are created .
But usually public enterprises are expected to strive for more than profitability .
This is why they are owned and operated by government .
Deumer , too , demands of the nationalized banking system that it be guided by national rather than private considerations — that it should invest its funds not where the return is highest , but where they serve the national interest .
We need not analyze other consequences of such credit policies , such as the preservation of uneconomical enterprises .
But let us look at their effects on the management of public enterprises .
When the national credit service or one of its branches submits an unfavorable income statement , it may plead , " To be sure , from the viewpoint of private interest and profitability we were not very successful .
But it must be borne in mind that the loss shown by commercial accounting is offset by public services that are not visible in the accounts .
For instance , dollars and cents cannot express our achievements in the preservation of small and medium enterprises , in the improvements of the material conditions of the ' backbone ' classes of population . "
Under such conditions the profitability of an enterprise loses significance .
If public management is to be audited at all , it must be judged with the yardstick of bureaucratism .
Management must be regimented , and positions must be filled with individuals who are willing to obey the regulations .
No matter how we may search , it is impossible to find a form of organization that could prevent the strictures of bureaucratism in public enterprises .
It wo n't do to observe that many large corporations have become " bureaucratic " in recent decades .
It is a mistake to believe that this is the result of size .
Even the biggest enterprise remains immune to the dangers of bureaucratism as long as it aims exclusively at profitability .
True , if other considerations are forced on it , it loses the essential characteristic of a capitalistic enterprise .
It was the prevailing etatistic and interventionist policies that forced large enterprises to become more and more bureaucratic .
They were forced , for instance , to appoint executives with good connections to the authorities , rather than able businessmen , or to embark upon unprofitable operations in order to please influential politicians , political parties , or government itself .
They were forced to continue operations they wished to abandon , and merge with companies and plants they did not want .
" No matter how we may search , it is impossible to find a form of organization that could prevent the strictures of bureaucratism in public enterprises . "
The mixing of politics and business not only is detrimental to politics , as is frequently observed , but even much more so to business .
Many large enterprises must give thousands of considerations to political matters , which plants the seeds of bureaucratism .
But all this does not justify the proposals to bureaucratize completely and formally all production through the nationalization of credit .
Where would the German economy be today if credit had been nationalized as early as 1890 , or even 1860 ?
Who can be aware of the developments that will be prevented if it is nationalized today ?
3 . The Danger of Overexpansion and Immobilization
What has been said here applies to every attempt at transferring private enterprises , especially the banking system , into the hands of the state , which in its effects would amount to all - around nationalization .
But in addition , it would create credit problems that must not be overlooked .
Deumer seeks to show that the credit monopoly could not be abused for fiscal reasons .
But the dangers of credit nationalization do not lie here ; they lie with the purchasing power of money .
As is well known , demand deposits subject to checks have the same effect on the purchasing power of a monetary unit as bank notes .
Deumer even proposes an issue of " guaranteed certificates " or " clearing house certificates " that are never to be redeemed .
In short , the national bank will be in the position to inflate .
Public opinion always wants " easy money , " that is , low interest rates .
But it is the very function of the note - issuing bank to resist such demands , protecting its own solvency and maintaining the parity of its notes toward foreign notes and gold .
If the bank should be excused from the redemption of its certificates , it would be free to expand its credits in accordance with the politicians ' wishes .
It would be too weak to resist the clamor of credit applicants .
But the banking system is to be nationalized , in Deumer 's words , " to pay heed to the complaints of small industrial enterprises and many commercial firms that they are able to secure the necessary credits only with great difficulties and much sacrifice . "
A few years ago it would have been necessary to elaborate the consequences of credit expansion .
There is no need for such an effort today .
The relationship between credit expansion and rising goods prices and foreign - exchange rates is well known today .
This has been brought out not only by the research of some economists , but also by the American and British experiences and theories with which Germans have become familiar .
It would be superfluous to elaborate further on this .
4. Summation
Deumer 's book clearly reveals that étatisme , socialism , and interventionism have run their course .
Deumer is unable to support his proposals with anything but the old étatist and Marxian arguments which have been refuted a hundred times .
He simply ignores the critique of these arguments .
Nor does he consider the problems that arose from recent socialistic experience .
He still takes his stand on the ground of an ideology that welcomes every nationalization as progress , even though it has been shaken to its foundations in recent years .
Politics , therefore , will ignore Deumer 's book , which may be regrettable from the author 's viewpoint because he invested labor , ingenuity , and expertise in his proposals .
But in the interest of a healthy recovery of the German economy , it is gratifying .

Paulson 's former firm to be among largest beneficiaries of bailout : bank John Byrne
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
It certainly pays to be Treasury Secretary if your former firm is a brokerage house , a new study says .
Goldman Sachs Group -- formerly run by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , and Morgan Stanley , stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries of a $ 700 billion US bailout .
" Its benefits , in its current form , will be largely limited to investment banks and other banks that have aggressively written down the value of their holdings and have already recognized the attendant capital impairment , " Jeffrey Rosenberg , Bank of America 's head of credit strategy research , wrote in a report obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday .
Paulson was the head of Goldman Sach 's investment banking division from 1990 to 1994 .
He later became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman , and left his post to join the Bush Administration .
According to the study , the bailout benefits Paulson 's former firm more because banks have n't had to write down as many troubled mortage assets under accounting rules .
This means that participating in the program would cause them to actually lose capital , as opposed to investment banks , which stand to gain .
Paulson $ 700 billion program is designed to remove " bad assets " from the US financial markets to prevent credit for businesses from drying up , which would send the economy into a further tailspin .
Many businesses rely on credit to fund their daily operations .
Lawmakers are debating the plan today .
" While Goldman and Morgan Stanley , both based in New York , were yesterday granted permission to transform themselves into bank holding companies , the companies so far have operated mostly under investment - bank accounting rules , logging almost $ 21 billion of asset writedowns and credit losses , " Bloomberg News notes .
Goldman made sizable profits in 2007 from the subprime mortgage sector .
It , along with Morgan Stanley , has fared better than investment houses Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns , because it has held a more conservative capital base .
Paulson has admirers : during his Goldman tenure the firm donated 680,000 acres of land in Chile , and he has personally given away $ 100 million of his fortune to charitable groups .
According to estimates conducted by Open Secrets , Paulson is the richest cabinet member of the Bush Administration .

We 've critiqued science fiction movies with bad science , but one project in development is supposed to have immaculate science , thanks to a script treatment by Caltech physics professor Kip S. Thorne .
Interstellar , produced ( and maybe directed ) by Steven Spielberg , will deal with travel through a wormhole into an alternate dimension .
Thorne insists the film wo n't violate any laws of physics , but will it ever actually get made ?
Click through for the latest info .

Interstellar is being written by Jonah Nolan , brother of Batman Begins director Christopher and writer of The Prestige , based on Thorne 's treatment .
( And the L.A . Times reported that Nolan proposed adding a time - travel element to the movie 's wormhole plot . )
I got in touch with Thorne , but other than confirming that Nolan is writing the script he would n't comment about the movie .
But presumably the script would be based on Thorne 's past work , with his former grad student Michael Morris , on wormholes .
Morris and Thorne theorized 20 years ago that an unstable wormhole could be held open using a sphere of " exotic matter , " which has a negative mass .
And then , in another paper , they theorized that you could indeed use a wormhole to travel in time .
( One way this could work would be to accelerate one end of the wormhole to a high velocity relative to the other , and then bringing it back . )
Says the abstract :
It is argued that , if the laws of physics permit an advanced civilization to create and maintain a wormhole in space for interstellar travel , then that wormhole can be converted into a time machine with which causality might be violatable .
Whether wormholes can be created and maintained entails deep , ill - understood issues about cosmic censorship , quantum gravity , and quantum field theory , including the question of whether field theory enforces an averaged version of the weak energy condition .

In other words , it 's theoretically possible , but we do n't have enough data to say for sure .
It sounds as though this would allow Nolan a lot of artistic license in the script for Interstellar , while still allowing Thorne to say the film violates no laws of physics .
The racist skinhead logged on with exciting news :
He ’d just enlisted in the United States Army .
“ Sieg Heil , I will do us proud , ” he wrote .
It was a June 3 post to AryanWear Forum 14 , a neo -Nazi online forum to which “ Sobibor ’s SS , ” who identified himself as a skinhead living in Plantersville , Ala. , had belonged since early 2004 .
( Sobibor was a Nazi death camp in Poland during World War II ) .
About a month after he announced his enlistment , Sobibor ’s SS bragged in another post to Forum 14 that he ’d specifically requested and been assigned to MOS , or Military Occupational Specialty , 98D .
MOS98D soldiers are in high demand right now .
That ’s because they ’re specially trained in disarming Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) like the infamous roadside bombs that are killing and maiming so many U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Presumably , a part of learning how to disarm an IED is learning how to make one .
“ I have my own reasons for wanting this training but in fear of the government tracing me and me loosing [ sic ] my clearance I ca n’t share them here , ” Sobibor ’s SS informed his fellow neo -Nazis .
One of his earlier posts indicated his reasons serve a darker purpose than defending America : “ Once all the Jews are gone the world will start fixing itself . ”
Sobibor ’s SS included enough biographical details in his various posts to Forum 14 over the years , including that he ’s a single father from the small town in southern Alabama , that a military investigator with access to enlistment records for recent months should have little trouble discerning whether the Army is actually teaching a skinhead with genocide on his mind how to be a tactical bomb maker .
But there ’s little reason to expect that will happen .
Two years ago , the Intelligence Report revealed that alarming numbers of neo -Nazi skinheads and other white supremacist extremists were taking advantage of lowered armed services recruiting standards and lax enforcement of anti-extremist military regulations by infiltrating the U.S. armed forces in order to receive combat training and gain access to weapons and explosives .
Forty members of Congress urged then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to launch a full - scale investigation and implement a zero - tolerance policy toward white supremacists in the military .
“ Military extremists present an elevated threat to both their fellow service members and the public , ” U.S. Senator Richard Shelby , an Alabama Republican , wrote in a separate open letter to Rumsfeld .
“ We witnessed with Timothy McVeigh that today ’s racist extremist may become tomorrow ’s domestic terrorist . ”
But neither Rumsfeld nor his successor , Robert Gates , enacted any sort of systemic investigation or crackdown .
Military and Defense Department officials seem to have made no sustained effort to prevent active white supremacists from joining the armed forces , or to weed out those already in uniform .
Furthermore , new evidence is emerging that not only supports the Intelligence Report ’s findings , but also indicates the problem may have worsened since the summer of 2006 , as enlistment rates continued to plummet , and the military accepted an ever - lower quality of soldier in a time of unpopular war .
First of all , a new FBI report ( PDF ) confirms that white supremacist leaders are making a concerted effort to recruit active - duty soldiers and recent combat veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
According to the unclassified FBI Intelligence Assessment , “ White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel Since 9/11 , ” which was released to law enforcement agencies nationwide : “ Sensitive and reliable source reporting indicates supremacist leaders are encouraging followers who lack documented histories of neo -Nazi activity and overt racist insignia such as tattoos to infiltrate the military as ‘ ghost skins , ’ in order to recruit and receive training for the benefit of the extremist movement . ”
The FBI report details more than a dozen investigative findings and criminal cases involving Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as well as active - duty personnel engaging in extremist activity in recent years .
For example , in September 2006 , the leader of the Celtic Knights , a central Texas splinter faction of the Hammerskins , a national racist skinhead organization , planned to obtain firearms and explosives from an active duty Army soldier in Fort Hood , Texas .
That soldier , who served in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 , was a member of the National Alliance , a neo -Nazi group .
“ Looking ahead , current and former military personnel belonging to white supremacist extremist organizations who experience frustration at the inability of these organizations to achieve their goals may choose to found new , more operationally minded and operationally capable groups , ” the report concludes .
“ The military training veterans bring to the movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement ’s fringes . ”
Currently , 46 members of the white supremacist social networking website Newsaxon.com identity themselves as active - duty military personnel .
Six of these individuals are members of “ White Military Men , ” a New Saxon sub - group .
Earlier this year , the founder of White Military Men identified himself in his New Saxon account as “ Lance Corporal Burton ” of the 2nd Battalion Fox Company Pit 2097 , from Florida , according to a master ’s thesis by graduate student Matthew Kennard .
Under his “ About Me ” section , Burton writes : “ Love to shoot my M16A2 service rifle effectively at the Hachies ( Iraqis ) , ” and , “ Love to watch things blow up ( Hachies House ) . ”
As part of his thesis research , Kennard , at the time a student at Columbia University ’s Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism , also monitored claims of active - duty military service earlier this year on the neo - Nazi online forum Blood and Honour , where “ 88Soldier88 ” posted this message on Feb.
18 : “ I am in the ARMY right now .
I work in the Detainee Holding Area [ in Iraq ] . … I am in this until 2013 .
I am in the infantry but want to go to SF [ Special Forces ] .
Hopefully the training will prepare me for what I hope is to come . ”
One of the Blood and Honour members claiming to be an active - duty soldier taking part in combat operations in Iraq identified himself to Kennard as Jacob Berg .
He did not disclose his rank or branch of service .
“ There are actually a lot more ‘ skinheads , ’ ‘ nazis , ’ white supremacists now [ in the military ] than there has been in a long time , ” Berg wrote in an E - mail exchange with Kennard .
“ Us racists are actually getting into the military a lot now because if we do n’t every one who already is [ in the military ] will take pity on killing sand n------.
Yes I have killed women , yes I have killed children and yes I have killed older people .
But the biggest reason I ’m so proud of my kills is because by killing a brown many white people will live to see a new dawn . ”
The Army is currently investigating war crimes allegations leveled against Iraq combat veteran and active - duty Army soldier Kenneth Eastridge , 24 , who is facing trial for the December 2007 murder of a fellow serviceman .
After Eastridge was arrested for that killing , National Public Radio publicized his MySpace page , which showed Eastridge displaying a tattoo of SS lightning bolts , a common neo -Nazi insignia .
Another member of Eastridge ’s company recently told Army investigators that Eastridge used a stolen AK - 47 to fire indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians from his moving Humvee on the streets of Baghdad .
“ The military is to some extent desperate to get people to fight , soldiers who are not fit , mentally and physically sick , but they continue to send them , ” Eastridge ’s attorney told Kennard .
“ Having a tattoo was the least [ Eastridge ’s ] concerns . ”
As part of the research for his thesis , “ The New Nazi Army : How the U.S. military is allowing the far right to join its ranks , ” Kennard used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain from the Army ’s Criminal Investigative Division investigative reports concerning white supremacist activity in 2006 and 2007 .
They show that Army commanders repeatedly terminated investigations of suspected extremist activity in the military despite strong evidence it was occurring .
This evidence was often provided by regional Joint Terrorism Task Forces , which are made up of FBI and state and local law enforcement officials .
For example , one CID report details a 2006 investigation of a suspected member of the Hammerskins , a multi-state racist skinhead gang , who was stationed at Fort Hood , a large Army base in central Texas .
According to the report , there was “ probable cause ” to believe that the soldier “ had participated in a white extremist meeting and also provided a military technical manual 31 - 210 , Improvised Munitions Handbook , to the leader of a white extremist group in order to assist in the planning and execution of future attacks on various targets . ”
The report shows that agents only interviewed the subject once , in November 2006 , before Fort Hood higher - ups called off the investigation that December .
Another report , also from 2006 , covers an investigation of another Fort Hood soldier who was posting messages on Stormfront.org , a major white supremacist website .
One CID investigator expresses his frustration at the muddled process for dealing with extremists .
“ We need to discuss the review process , ” he writes .
“ I ’m not doing my job here .
Needs to get fixed . ”
A third CID report , regarding a 2007 investigation , notes the termination of an investigation of a soldier at Fort Richardson , Alaska , who was reportedly the leader and chief recruiter for the Alaska Front , a white supremacist group .
According to the report , the investigation was halted because the solider was “ mobilized to Camp Shelby , MS in preparation for deployment to Iraq . ”

You might remember the incident , huh ?
About 9:45 pm last night , heading north .
Why would I know the time , well I had to look at my cell phone to keep my eyes from looking over as you pulled his cock through his jeans and into your mouth .
How could we all not notice you ?
You were so ugly and those boobs were so little it was just obvious .
Then the guy you were with looked like Billy Bob Thorton in " Slingblade " .
Except even weirder looking .
Quite a pair .
So thanks for hopping on that very crowded bus , sitting 2 feet from me and making out with the goofy looking guy .
That was odd , but no big deal .
But when I looked over and your head was in his lap I was like -- " Are you fucking kidding me , you are now going to blow him ? " .
I thought it was hilarious that all those Mexican guys sitting right next to you said and did nada .
I almost moved away but could not stop looking over .
I kept thinking that this is going to make a good Craigslist " missed connection " and maybe a " best of " .
The weird part is that the guy was staring at me with this serial killer look the whole time you were servicing him which was a little creepy .
Like the whole fucking thing was n't totally creepy .
So much like a human in " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " I kept scanning around looking to see if anyone else was registering this .
I kept locking eyes with the young punk rock girl across from me .
Her boyfriend was being oblivious but she kept looking at me , rolling her eyes and giggling .
As they reached that climactic moment she was uncontrollably laughing out loud and it really helped me keep my sanity .
To pass the time I texted my sister in real time the blow by blows ( no pun intended ) and listened to my iPod .
Well , thankfully you two freaks got off somewhere near the Tenderloin after he came in your mouth .
When it was over I had to say something and just made eye contact with everyone and said " Did we all see what I think we just saw ? " and everyone laughed out loud .
Learned something new last night .
The 49 is a bit more rocking than the 47 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The pace of new home sales fell to its lowest level in 17 years in August , according to a key government report released Thursday that signaled more dismal news for the housing sector in coming months .
August sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 460,000 , the Census Bureau report showed , down 11.5 % from a revised 520,000 in July .
The reading was well below the consensus forecast of 513,000 , according to economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The rate of sales was down 34.5 % from a year earlier .
Sales were at their lowest pace since January 1991 , when the first Gulf War started , and the economy was near the bottom of a recession and undergoing an oil price shock .
Excluding that month , you 'd have to go all the way back to August 1982 to find a rate of sales so low .
" It 's a stunning decline , but we 're still going to be dealing with a tough market well into 2009 and maybe even 2010 , " said Mike Larson , an analyst with Weiss Research .
" All indicators say we 're heading into a recession , if we 're not already in one . "
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis , the report showed only 39,000 new homes were sold in July , which marks the lowest level for that measure since December 1991 .
" It looks like we 're in an absolute cliff dive , but we 're coming down sharply from a very high level , " Larson said .
The sale pace has fallen 66.9 % from its peak of 1.39 million homes set in July 2005 .
Prices : Sales fell as prices continued to drop .
The median price of a new home sold in August was $ 221,900 , down 5.5 % from $ 234,900 in July and down 6.2 % from $ 236,500 a year earlier .
Prices for new homes on the market were at their lowest level since September 2004 .
This decline probably does n't accurately capture the weakness in prices for new homes , as about three out of four builders have reported having to pay buyers ' closing costs or offer other incentives such as expensive features for free in order to maintain sales .
Inventory : Prices have been driven down by the glut of new homes on the market .
The report showed 166,000 completed new homes available at the end of the month , bringing total inventory - including new homes under construction and not yet started - to 405,000 , the lowest inventory since August 2004 .
Still , the Census Bureau said that the number of homes for sale on the market is equal to a seasonally adjusted 10.9 - month supply , up from a 10.3 - month supply in July .
By contrast , it took the 404,000 homes on the market just 3.7 months to be sold four years ago .
" The good news is supply is falling , it 's just not fast enough , " Larson said .
" The government is doing everything it can to reduce supply by stopping foreclosures , but sales are still falling faster than inventories . "
The report is just the latest sign of trouble in the overall housing market .
On Wednesday , the National Realtors Association reported existing home sales fell more than expected in August , as prices continued to fall and inventory hovered near a record high .
Welcome to Gilead , Governor Palin
If you 've ever read Margaret Atwood 's dystopian novel , " The Handmaid 's Tale , " you will recall the key role that was played by the women assigned to be the " Aunts . "
The story revolves around a futuristic American society in which fundamentalist Christians install a gender - based caste system where each woman is assigned a specific societal function .
It is a commentary on the dangerous erasing of the line between church and state in the contemporary United States .
The merging of religion and government is carried out by a group of older , white male " commanders " whose propaganda demands that citizens be constantly terrorized into submission and obedience .
The resulting regime is Atwood 's vision of the worst - case scenario : an American police - state theocracy where every woman 's identity is reduced to her sexual attributes , and each is assigned to a category based on her physical qualifications .
Subtle references to racist philosophy are mixed into the literalist religious rhetoric .
The attractive young women of reproductive age are the " handmaids " ; the attractive but infertile middle - age women are the " wives " ; the dark - skinned women of any age are domestic servants , and so on .
All women are forbidden from reading or writing .
The country is renamed the Republic of Gilead , a reference to the biblical homeland of the patriarchs .
And the Aunts - who are middle - aged white women of some previous prestige and education - are especially sinister characters .
The primary job of the Aunts is to keep the handmaids ( the childbearers ) subservient .
They go about this by convincing the handmaids that they are powerless and can only contribute to society when they fulfill their God - given responsibility to serve the commanders .
The Aunts ' job , put simply , is to exploit other women by keeping them submissive and telling them that it's for the good of all ( and even more insidiously , that in obeying , the handmaids " empower " themselves . )
What makes the Aunts so remarkable is their collective failure to realize that they are simply being used by the commanders to keep other women in line , and their willingness - glee , even - at doing so is simultaneously sad and terrifying .
So what compels the Aunts to become traitors to both their sex and their country ?
First , they believe that their contribution to the repressive social order is righteous , and second , they 've found that under this rigid system of social control , they have the illusion of a tiny bit of power .
Does any of this sound familiar ?
It should .
Governor and Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin is the Gileadian " Aunt " manifested .
Her sudden emergence onto the American political scene , accompanied by a burst of enthusiasm on the part of many American women , is a surreal example of life imitating art .
Much of Palin 's rhetoric , tactics and personal philosophy seem to be taken directly from the Auntie training manual .
By accepting the position on the GOP ticket despite her astonishing lack of qualifications , Palin signaled that she was prepared to be used - on the basis of her sex alone - in exchange for the promise of status and power .
Refer to Palin's RNC convention speech , which was mostly a fawning homage to McCain 's patriotism and leadership , sprinkled with condescending references to Obama as " our opponent . "
Although the lines were delivered with Palin 's own folksy vernacular and over - enunciation , it was not Palin , but McCain - or more accurately , the GOP elders at whose feet he finds himself on election eve - who wrote the speech and whose voice echoed through the hall that night in St. Paul .
Women who find themselves drawn to Palin because they think she epitomizes the classic " woman who has it all " might want to take a closer look .
Sarah Palin was picked for the ticket solely because of - not despite - the fact that she is female .
By keeping her sequestered from the media , McCain has confirmed he does not have faith in an unscripted Palin 's ability to represent the campaign to the world .
By going along with it , Palin is telling us that she 's perfectly fine with being controlled by her male superiors .
And by portraying herself as the candidate of the empowered woman ( while simultaneously promoting policy that is openly hostile to the interests of working and middle - class American women ) , she reveals the sad truth about how little progress we 've actually made .
Lest we think that Senator McCain is hesitant to keep pushing this stereotype in the face of abysmal performances by Palin in news interviews , the most recent reports reveal that his campaign intends to hype the expected wedding between Palin 's pregnant daughter and her boyfriend , the date of which is apparently being set just prior to the November election - with McCain and Palin sitting in the front row .
Is it possible that Sarah Palin is just blissfully un - self - aware , or is it that she so eager for any illusion of power that she 'll allow herself to be marketed no matter what the cost to the dignity of all women ?
If Palin were truly an empowered woman , she would have refused to allow herself and her daughter to be used in this manner - to assist a party whose rhetoric and imagery promote the ideal woman as deferential to established norms rather than acting as an independent - or critical - thinker .
If her selection was intended to signal to American women that empowerment is possible , why is Palin being kept under lock and key ?
Clearly , this is not an individual whose intelligence or perspective McCain respects , or else he would permit her to speak for herself .
To continue pretending that Palin 's selection was anything other than an attempt to manipulate the voting public on the basis of a straitjacketed view of sexual roles is a dangerous lie that no American of any gender can afford to abide .

Amazingly Creative Japanese Barcodes
What ’s in a barcode ?
More than you might imagine , when idealized through the eyes of some very creative Japanese artists .
You will be amazed at what can be done with a few straight lines and a push to think outside of a very ordinary box .
UPC symbols are ubiquitous and constant reminders that we are a civilization of consumers .
Up until now , there was no distinguishing one from the other .
That ’s all changed since a Japanese company named D - Barcode came up with some very creative and innovative ideas on how to make these uninteresting lines actually enjoyable to look upon .
It is said that barcodes are the bane of the modern graphic designer .
Many distribution people compound the headache by insisting on conspicuous white rectangles , which may or may not fit the context involved .
The changes are little and subtle , and yet at the same time , enormous .
Now picking up a bottle or box at the supermarket may bring a smile to your face , not because of a price reduction but rather form a funny unexpected face or form smiling back at you from the label on the back of the package .
This enhancement of the consumer experience is brilliant on many levels .
But why keep talking ?
Check out these cool barcodes below and judge for yourself !
Happy barcodes !

Stripper Linda Maree Naggs , 39 , of Rosebud West , was accused of sexually assaulting the best man at a stag party .
The court was told that the woman penetrated the man with a vibrator without his will .
The party was held in September on the Mornington Pensinula .
The victim 's brother , whose name was not revealed , said that he saw Ms Naggs naked riding his brother like a horse .
It was then that the female minder of Ms Naggs passed the sex toy .
He mentioned that he saw his brother on all fours with pants pulled down asking Ms Naggs not to put the vibrator in .
Then he saw his brother squint and instantly stand up .
" I do n't think he could see what was going on , I do n't think he knew what was going to happen , " the man said .
The court was told that the man started abusing the stripper , asking her to leave .
Ms Naggs tried to punch the man but missed .
" She was a little bit hysterical ... she thought she was a boxer , " he said .
According to the victim's brother there were no drugs at the party .
He also said that men were loudly cheering during Ms Naggs ' performance , when the stripper started whipping the man next to him in the groin .
He said he had n't heard Ms Naggs ' saying she would call the police or being hit in the head in the bedroom located upstairs .
After the alleged rape the victim told his brother that he was bleeding .
The alleged victim gave evidence to the court for about two hours .
Media and public were not allowed to assist at the hearing .
Magistrate Elizabeth Lambden is still to determine whether the stripper , Ms Naggs , should stand trial .

Quick Start
To use columnizer , just call the columnize ( ) function on your jQuery selection , and that ’s it !
[ code lang= ” javascript ” ]
$ (‘#mydiv’).columnize ( ) ;
$ (‘#myotherdiv’ ) .columnize ( { width : 200 } ) ;
$ (‘# mythirddiv’ ) .columnize ( { columns : 2 } ) ;
[ / code ]
Release Candidate New Features !
Now you can manually specify line breaks for some or all of your columns !
Set the new `manual Breaks` option to true to use only manual breaks without any auto - columnizing ( false by default ) .
Any node that has the CSS class `columnbreak` will act as a column break for that column .
Optionally prefix all of the CSS classes used by Columnizer to avoid conflicts with your other styles .
Use the new `cssClass Prefix` to define the class prefix .
Stable Version New Features
Added jQuery 1.6 support
Fixed an infinite loop in a rare edge case if lastNeverTallest option was set and the content forced the last column to be tallest with dontsplit CSS class
Fixed an IE crash if “ px ” was included in the width option
renamed float option to column
Float since float is a reserved word
accuracy ( optional ) tells columnizer the number of characters to look before splitting between words .
smaller is more accurate for column breaks .
Fixed columnizer removing text nodes if they are immediate children of the columnized node
Removed hard - coded 3 px padding .
Columnizer now exactly estimates column widths instead of slightly underestimating widths and adding padding .
This change may affect your CSS layout .
See comment and explaination here .
Updated sample files
Stable Release Bug Fixes
Columnizer is now backwards compatible with older versions of jQuery
Fixed `lastNeverTallest` sometimes leaving a tall last column
Added a class to nodes that are split between columns .
This helps you style 2nd half of paragraphs to not have leading first line space .
Non-visible text nodes will never end a column .
This helps fix strangeness with dontend nodes still ending a column .
Fixed infinite loop with text that includes double spaces .
Demos
Sample 1 : Simple text only columns .
Text overflows from the top columns to the bottom columns .
Sample 2 : Text , images , and quotes being columnized .
Also shows the use of the “ dontend ” class and lastNeverTallest option .
Sample 3 : Same as # 2 , but forced to 2 columns on top and 4 on bottom instead of dynamic columns Sample 4 : Shows a single column that overflows into another section with 3 columns .
Also shows how javascript event handlers are preserved for content that is columnized .
Sample 5 : Shows fixed width and height columns scrolling horizontally Sample 6 : Uses the target option to prevent the content flicker between page load and columnizing .
Sample 7 : Shows the use of the “ dontend class Sample 10 : Layout a newsletter over multiple 2 column pages .
Check this post for the motivation and explanation .
Documentation
Documentation is available on the Github repository ’s wiki .
Helpful Hints
Any node that has the CSS class “ dontsplit ” wo n’t be split into multiple columns .
This is handy to make sure that tables , etc , are n’t chopped in half if they land at the bottom of a column .
Any node that has the CSS class “ dontend ” will never be put at the end of a column
Any node that has the CSS class “ removeiffirst ” will be removed from the content if it is the first node in a column .
You can specify a rough width your columns , and Columnizer will create as many as will fit in the browser window .
Just use : $ ( ‘selector’).columnize( {width : 400 } ) syntax
You can specify a specific number of columns , and Columnizer will distribute your content between that many columns .
Just use : $ ( ‘selector’).columnize( {columns : 2 } ) syntax
When using the width and height options to scroll horizontally , make sure that the .column CSS class does not specify any padding or margin or border .
See CSS for sample 5 for an example on how to create buffer between columns .

Copy Shell Prompt Output To Linux / UNIX X Clipboard Directly
Q. How do I copy output of command to Linux Gnome clipboard ?
How do I send files directly to X Windows clipboard from a shell prompt ?
How do I insert command line output or files contains into the clipboard ?
A . You can copy command line output to X Windows clipboard directly using xclip command .
You can read from standard input ( keyboard ) , or from one or more files , and makes the data available as an X selection for pasting into any X applications such as gedit , OpenOffice or Firefox / email client .
You can also print current X selection to standard out ( screen or printer ) form a shell prompt .
ADVERTISEMENTS
A note about Linux / UNIX X Server CLIPBOARD
There are totally 3 clipboards maintained by the X server as follows :
PRIMARY : The PRIMARY selection is conventionally used to implement copying and pasting via the middle mouse button .
xclip command use this by default .
So you need to hit middle button to paste data .
: The PRIMARY selection is conventionally used to implement copying and pasting via the middle mouse button .
xclip command use this by default .
So you need to hit middle button to paste data .
SECONDARY : This is less frequently used by X application .
You need to use XA_SECONDARY constant to select this clipboard .
: This is less frequently used by X application .
You need to use XA_SECONDARY constant to select this clipboard .
CLIPBOARD : Same as SECONDARY , use XA_CLIPBOARD constant to select clipboard .
xclip – Linux / UNIX Command line clipboard grabber
You can install xclip using any one of the following method :
Install xclip under Debian / Ubuntu Linux
Type the following command at shell prompt :
$ sudo apt - get install xclip
Install xclip under Red hat / CentOS / RHEL / Fedora Linux
Type the following command at shell prompt ( make sure 3rd party repos are activated ) :
# yum install xclip
How do I use xclip command ?
Copy output of the following command to clipboard :
$ sort -n -k 3 , -k 2 file .
txt | xclip
How do I paste output to GUI applications ?
Just press middle click ( mouse button ) in an X application to paste data .
Task : Insert files contains into the clipboard
Send data. txt contains to the clipboard , enter :
$ cat data . txt | xclips
Task : Paste data from the clipboard
Copy data using CTRL + C or middle mouse button .
Type the following command to paste output :
$ xclip -o
Put the contents of the selection into a file .
$ xclip -o > file.txt
Loop option
The -l ( - loop ) option help to send number of x selection requests ( pastes into X applications ) to wait for before exiting .
For example start xclip and exit only after text has been pasted 10 times .
$ who | xclip - loops 3 - verbose
Task : Select secondary clipboard
$ uptime | xclip - selection XA_SECONDARY
xsel command
xsel is xclip like command which can be used to retrieve and set the X selection ( copy and paste operations ) with few additional options .
Type the following command to install xsel :
$ sudo apt - get install xsel

Her rise to the ticket was the result of very skillful , behind - the - scenes work by the very Beltway elite that she so happily excoriates .
Following the Daily Beast ’s initial report of the final three - way competition that produced McCain ’s vice presidential nominee , The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine bring fresh details .
The 2008 presidential campaign has not been kind to pundits .
The nation ’s best known media masters of the Beltway scene were sure of one thing : John McCain ’s choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was a political masterstroke which would reenergize his campaign and put it on course to a victory in November .
Except that it was n’t .
As the candidates draw closer to the finish line , the Palin pick increasingly looks like McCain ’s most damaging among a series of mistakes .
In a recent joint interview with NBC News ’ Brian Williams , the “ tenseness ” between McCain and Palin was palpable , said NBC political director Chuck Todd , who observed the process first hand .
And during the interview , Palin misfired badly , giving an incomprehensible answer when challenged to explain her opposition to talks with foreign leaders without preconditions .
By the time the final pick fell , Sarah Palin was n’t a household name of course , but she had a large fan club among the conservative establishment in Washington .
She was , it seems , “ their maverick . ”
John McCain no longer seems to be reckoning with a victory celebration on election night , instead announcing his plans to address a small crowd of loyal supporters in Phoenix .
And among his key election advisors , the name of the game is what blogger Andrew Sullivan calls “ precriminations ” - allocating in advance the blame for a coming drubbing at the polls .
In that process , responsibility for the selection of Palin is the real hot potato .
Following in the wake of my report in The Daily Beast last week , The New Yorker ’s Jane Mayer and The New York Times Magazine ’s Robert Draper have each tapped sources inside the McCain campaign for a recounting of the Palin pick .
Mayer ’s story , dubbed “ The Insiders , ” begins with a choice Palin quotation in which she testifies that she is not one of the “ Washington élite . ”
Mayer then documents how Palin ’s rise to the Republican ticket was the result of very skillful , behind - the - scenes work by the very Beltway élite that Palin so happily excoriates .
The Mayer recounting , like mine , launches with that fateful Weekly Standard cruise trip .
The luncheon that Palin hosted for the Standard writers gets a thorough portrait starting with Palin ’s very political grace .
Mayer includes the menu ( halibut cheeks ) and a cameo appearance by Palin ’s daughter Piper .
Significantly , however , we learn that Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes were joined by a third member , Michael Gerson , a former Bush speechwriter and Washington Post columnist .
Gerson has also distinguished himself by stoking the fires for Palin after her nomination was announced .
The luncheon was followed by a field trip , as the feisty governor showed the Standard ’s top writers around a mine site in Berners Bay , 45 miles from Juneau , making the case that environmental regulations were harming the state ’s mining industry .
The Beltway Boys obviously loved what they saw .
A starburst was born .
Gerson called her “ a mix between Annie Oakley and Joan of Arc . ”
Mayer recounts that the Palin launch was not entirely the making of the Weekly Standard , however .
She brings National Review into the mix , noting that their cruise likewise brought a choice catch to the Juneau governor ’s mansion : Rich Lowry , Victor Davis Hanson , Jack Fowler , Robert Bork , John Bolton and Fox News ’ Dick Morris .
By the time the final pick fell , Sarah Palin was n’t a household name of course , but she had a large fan club among the conservative establishment in Washington .
She was , it seems , “ their maverick . ”
Robert Draper echoes the Mayer account with his own glimpse inside the McCain campaign .
He recounts the fateful call being made by Steve Schmidt and Andrew Davis at the end of August : it would be Palin .
Most of Draper ’s account is a very faithful recapitulation of the campaign ’s own talking points explaining why Palin was a “ maverick ” choice .
And how exactly did Palin ’s name get placed into contention ?
A McCain staffer flagged that sentence for me : “ Newt Gingrich and others had spoken of Palin as a rising star . ” A sentence crafted with true New York Times diplomacy .
How awkward it would have been to have been more explicit : “ and others ” of course is shorthand for New York Times columnist Bill Kristol , who had yet to come clean on his own role in the making of Sarah Palin .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne on Thursday said he was “ outraged ” by department workers who had sex , used drugs and took gifts from employees at regulated oil companies , while one senator called for a Bush administration official to resign over the scandal .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The Interior Department ’s inspector general issued a scathing report on Wednesday that found “ a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity ” at the department ’s Minerals Management Service , whose employees handled billions of dollars in oil and natural gas supplies that were turned over by companies as in - kind royalty payments for drilling on federal lands .
“ I am outraged by the immoral behavior , illegal activities , and appalling misconduct of several former and current long - serving career employees in the Minerals Management Service ’s royalty - in - kind program , ” Kempthorne said .
“ We will take swift action to restore the public trust . ”
Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida called for the agency ’s top head , MMS director Randall Luthi , to resign .
In response to the inspector general ’s report , Luthi had said that “ I do not believe Americans have lost financially , ” but admitted “ it is too early to tell ” if government workers gave oil companies financial favors at the expense of taxpayers .
In a letter to Kempthorne on Thursday , Nelson asked for all department employees involved in the scandal to be immediately fired and for the secretary to ask Luthi to submit his resignation .
“ Besides being a sad commentary on the failures of certain public servants , this case shows us how the oil industry can hold sway over government officials , ” Nelson said .
Nelson called for hearings into the scandal by the Senate Commerce Committee , on which he serves .
The House Resources Committee is planning a hearing on the matter next week .
While not responding directly to the senator ’s letter , Kempthorne said : “ We must and we will eliminate any remaining negative elements in the Minerals Management Service . ”
In his report , the inspector general said some MMS workers in the royalty - in - kind program took cocaine and marijuana and had “ illicit sexual encounters . ”
Government workers also got drunk at social events with employees of oil companies doing business with the agency and MMS workers had “ brief sexual relationships ” with industry contacts , the inspector general said .
The oil companies named in the report were Chevron , Shell Oil , Hess Corp and Gary Williams Energy Corp .
So the plot thickens …
Ever since the primary source for the “ Phoenix Affair ” hit the blogosphere , it spread like a rampaging virus ( with the help of the Universe Today and Astroengine.com , ehem ) .
In the early hours of this morning , it was Aviation Week who broke the news that they had been in contact with an unnamed source , leading to the implication that Phoenix had discovered something and the NASA team had set off to Washington for an audience with the President ’s Science Advisor .
Having waited the whole day for a Phoenix / NASA response to this news , I ’ve been frustrated with the lack of weekend activity at Mars HQ .
That is until now .
Right from the robot ’s mouth , Phoenix has disputed the White House claims .
On the Phoenix Twitter feed , the perky little robot exclaimed : “ Reports claiming there was a White House briefing are also untrue and incorrect , ” ( from MarsPhoenix ) .
At least someone at NASA ( even if it was n’t a human … well , it was , but you know what I mean ) has been listening .
So what is going on then ?
Was the source incorrect ?
Are the Phoenix scientists still trying their best to keep the breaking story “ under wraps ” ?
I ’d be very interested to see whether an official statement will be released soon , either from NASA or Aviation Week .
So much intrigue in one day !
Update ( 10 minutes later ) : Having looked through the Twitter feed of MarsPhoenix , I ’ve also noticed the lander is refuting another claim that it had discovered life on the Martian surface ( pictured left ) .
I ’m not sure who is reporting that gem , but it is hopelessly wrong .
If the original AW source is proven to be solid , they were very clear to point out that the upcoming news on this ‘ big discovery ’ did not focus of any proof of life ( past or present ) .
Phoenix simply cannot carry out such tests with the TEGA or MECA .
It seems quaint to have been focusing today on the fact that McCain ’s transition chief was a lobbyist for Freddie Mac when , as Roll Call is now reporting , campaign manager Rick Davis ’ lobbying firm , Davis & Manafort , still has a $ 15,000 per month contract with Freddie Mac .
EVERI ’s highschool monetary literacy course equips students with instruments to deal with their private finances within the true world , from making use of for monetary help to establishing credit score score and investing .
The company would n’t elaborate on how so much debt was excellent or what variety of prospects had signed up for his or her playing cards .
Now you possibly can borrow cash against your automotive as correctly .
It ’s important to be occupied with how you ’ll handle with out your vehicle .
The excellent news is chances are you ’ll preserve the automotive and the money as well .
The loan will be issued in direction of the title of the car .
You ’ll pay all of your pending funds with below - common credit title car loans .
These loans are easily accessible on the internet .
You ’ll get the mortgage in few hours time .
A lifetime of changes .
Only one checking account .

Whoa !
Google Chrome has crashed .
Restart now ?
While Google ’s Chrome team is cheering , Rishi Narang from Evil Fingers is typing and releasing a proof of concept for a denial of service vulnerability that is successfully crashing the Chrome browser with all tabs .
According to Narang ’s advisory :
“ An issue exists in how chrome behaves with undefined - handlers in chrome.dll version 0.2.149.27 .
A crash can result without user interaction .
When a user is made to visit a malicious link , which has an undefined handler followed by a ’ special ’ character , the chrome crashes with a Google Chrome message window “ Whoa !
Google Chrome has crashed .
Restart now ? ” .
It crashes on “ int 3 ″ at 0×01002FF3 as an exception / trap , followed by “ POP EBP ” instruction when pointed out by the EIP register at 0×01002FF4 . ”
Nothing ’s impossible the impossible just takes a little longer .
Also see : Google Chrome vulnerable to carpet - bombing flaw
Whenever a new product is in its introduction stage , it would logically attract a lot of attention from security researchers trying to a make a point that it ’s vulnerable , and that some of the vulnerabilities are pretty trivial .
For instance , yesterday David Maynor from Errata Security pin pointed possibilities for exploitation in Google ’s Chrome , saying that :
“ Google just released Chrome , their own web browser .
We decided to run it through Looking Glass and it does n’t look half bad .
They at least have ASLR enabled on a few of their libraries , no NX though .
Chrome is not as bad as some apps I have seen but that is not saying much . ”
What ’s important though , is whether or not the browser release would also start attracting the attention of cybercriminals .
Being anything but old - fashioned , they too do their homework and take into consideration the market share of a particular browser in order to increase the impact of exploiting it .
Consequently , for the time being the level of exploitability of Google ’s Chrome is right after Opera ’s from the perspective of the malicious attacker taking into consideration Chrome ’s non-existent market share .
Would the level of exploitability change ?
In the fist quarter of 2009 , Google would presumably release stats of the number of people who downloaded Chrome , demonstrating nothing else but the introduction stage of their browser .
The question is , how many of those who downloaded it would actually stick with it , and would companies embrace it if it does gets popular enough , potentially increasing the exploitability level of any upcoming vulnerabilities ?
Considering the fact that according to public statistics of usage share of web browsers , IE6 users are just as many as IE7 ones , converting from Firefox or IE to Google ’s Chrome is not going to happen overnight .

50,000 women abandoning church every year as Buffy the Vampire Slayer turns them on to witchcraft
Christian churches in England have lost at least 50,000 women from their congregations every year since 1989 , says a sociologist .
Dr Kristin Aune , from the University of Derby , said many young women are put off going to church because they link it with traditional values .
She also said television icons such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer , who promote female empowerment , discourage women from attending services .
Kristin Aune ( left ) claims women are abandoning the church because TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer focus on female empowerment ( pictured are actors Anthony Stewart Head and Sarah Michelle Gellar from the series )
Dr Aune added : ' In short , women are abandoning the church .
Because of its focus on female empowerment , young women are attracted by Wicca , popularised by the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
' Young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church . '
Dr Aune believes many women find it difficult to attend church as they juggle their working lives with their families .
She also thinks senior clergy remaining silent about sex is driving women away because they feel the church requires them to deny their sexual desires .
Dr Aune said the numbers of women lost to the church come from the English Church Census , which she used in her research for a new book entitled Women and Religion in the West , of which she is a co-author .
Face Swapping : Automatically Replacing Faces in Photographs
Advances in digital photography have made it possible to capture large collections of high - resolution images and share them on the internet .
While the size and availability of these collections is leading to many exciting new applications , it is also creating new problems .
One of the most important of these problems is privacy .
Online systems such as Google Street View allow users to interactively navigate through panoramic images of public places created using thousands of photographs .
We believe that an attractive solution to the privacy problem is to remove the identities of people in photographs by automatically replacing their faces with ones from a collection of stock images .
Automatic face replacement has other compelling applications as well .
For example , people commonly have large personal collections of photos on their computers .
These collections often contain many photos of the same person (s ) taken with different expressions , and under various poses and lighting conditions .
One can use such collections to create novel images by replacing faces in one image with more appealing faces of the same person from other images .
For group shots , the burst mode available in most cameras can be used to take several images at a time .
With an automatic face replacement approach , one could create a single composite image with , for example , everyone smiling and with both eyes open .
In this project , we present a complete system for automatic face replacement in images .
Our system uses a large library of face images created automatically by downloading images from the internet , extracting faces using face detection software , and aligning each extracted face to a common coordinate system .
This library is constructed off - line , once , and can be efficiently accessed during face replacement .
Our replacement algorithm has three main stages .
First , given an input image , we detect all faces that are present , align them to the coordinate system used by our face library , and select candidate face images from our face library that are similar to the input face in appearance and pose .
Second , we adjust the pose , lighting , and color of the candidate face images to match the appearance of those in the input image , and seamlessly blend in the results .
Third , we rank the blended candidate replacements by computing a match distance over the overlap region .
Our approach requires no 3D model , is fully automatic , and generates highly plausible results across a wide range of skin tones , lighting conditions , and viewpoints .
We show how our approach can be used for a variety of applications including face de-identification and the creation of appealing group photographs from a set of images .

Images Color and Lighting Adjustment :
In this example , we demonstrate the importance of our color and lighting adjustment algorithm .
We replace ( a ) the face in the input photograph with ( b ) the face selected from the library .
Replacement results ( c ) without and ( d ) with recoloring and relighting .
Notice the significantly improved realism in the final result .
Face Replacement Results :
Here , we show several examples of the results obtained using our system .
Each example shows , in order from left to right , the input face image , a candidate face , and the replacement result .
Note the realism of the results , despite differences in pose , lighting and facial appearance .
Each row contains ( from left to right ) the original photograph , a candidate face selected from the library , and the replacement result produced automatically using our algorithm .
The age and gender mismatches in ( c ) and ( d ) could be avoided by enforcing consistency across those attributes ( which our system does not currently do ) .
Face De-Identification :
To preserve privacy in online collections of photos , one can use our system to automatically replace each face in an input image with the top - ranked candidate taken from a collection of stock photographs .
We show the result of automatically replacing the input faces ( top ) with the top - ranked candidate from the face library to obtain the de-identified results ( bottom ) .
No user intervention was used to produce this result .
Face Switching :
As a special case of face de-identification ( or for use as a special effect ) , we can limit the system to use candidates only within the same image , resulting in the switching of faces .
Here , we show the result of switching Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon 's faces ( left ) with each other to obtain the de-identified output ( right ) .
Burst Mode Replacement :
When taking group photographs , it is often difficult to get a " perfect " picture -- where , for example , everyone is smiling , with eyes open , and looking at the camera .
From a set of images taken using the " burst " mode of a camera ( left panel ) , a composite image is created in which everyone is smiling and has their eyes open ( right panel ) .
The candidate faces for each child are constrained by the relative positions of the faces in all images , and thus no face recognition is required .
While in this case the best replacement face for each child was selected manually ( outlined in blue ) , blink and smile detection could be applied to select them automatically .
Limitations :
Here , we show several examples of limitations of our algorithm itself .
Input and replacement candidate faces are shown on the top , replacement results in the middle , and a detailed inset of the problem area on the bottom .
The lack of eyeglasses in ( a ) and the occluding finger in ( b ) cause visual artifacts in the results .
In ( c ) , the extreme pose of the face results in it being blended into the background .
These problems could be solved by dynamically selecting optimal replacement regions .
( d ) shows a relighting failure case , caused by forcing a replacement between images with very different lighting ( skipping our lighting selection step ) .

Yesterday , David and I enjoyed fine lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Urbana , Illinois .
The experience was made even more pleasant because of this " wireless service bell button " at our table .
Note its four buttons : Waiter , Drink , Money ( bill ) , and Chopsticks ( food ) .
Each button produced a different tone , which emanated from a speaker in the kitchen .
When I pressed the drink button , the waiter appeared in seconds holding a pitcher of ice water .
When I pressed the Money button , he came right out with the check .
If Sarah Palin can promise in tonight 's debate that — if elected — she 'll sign legislation requiring all restaurants in the country to install tabletop wireless service bell button systems , she gets my vote .
Looking for new growth engines as it struggles to revive its flagship auction site , eBay Inc. agreed to acquire Bill Me Later Inc. for about $ 945 million and revealed plans to cut 10 % of its work force .
The San Jose , Calif. , company , which plans to cut roughly 1,000 employees and 600 temporary workers , also warned Monday that third - quarter revenue would come in at the low end of its forecast .

WASHINGTON  The Federal Reserve announced a radical new plan on Tuesday to jump - start the engine of the financial system .
The Fed said in a statement that it would begin to buy large amounts of short - term debt in an effort to stimulate the credit markets , which have all but dried up .
Under the program , the Fed said that it would buy the unsecured short - term debt that companies rely on to finance their day - to - day activities .
“ This facility should encourage investors to once again engage in term lending in the commercial paper market , ” the Fed said Tuesday in a statement .
“ An improved commercial paper market will enhance the ability of financial intermediaries to accommodate the credit needs of businesses and households . ”
While the move will put more taxpayer dollars at risk , it underscores the growing sense of urgency felt by policy makers in a climate where lending has virtually dried up .
The Commercial Paper Funding Facility , “ will complement the Federal Reserve ’s existing credit facilities to help provide liquidity to term funding markets , ” the statement said .
Probably the most common adjective that Google and T - Mobile executives used today while showing off their new " G1 " phone : " Open . "
Both companies could n't stop talking about how " open " the phone is -- you 'll be able to add whatever apps you want , use as much of the Internet as you want , mess with the operating system , etc .
Except not really .
T - Mobile is putting the most aggressive bandwidth cap we 've seen in the United States on its " unlimited " Internet access plan for the G1 .
In the fine print on its G1 site : " If your total data usage in any billing cycle is more than 1GB , your data throughput for the remainder of that cycle may be reduced to 50 kbps or less . "
That is :
Use this phone too much and we 're going to cripple it .
That 's because 1 gigabyte is fairly modest amount of data for a smartphone users to consume in a month -- particularly if they 're part of the early adopting , open - fetishisizing crowd that will be clamoring to get their hands on one of these first .
And 50 kilobits per second is roughly 6 kilobytes per second -- about the speed of the dialup modem you probably threw out several years ago .
So if you want to use your phone to stream a bunch of video , download a bunch of music , use some crazy new apps , or whatever -- and go over their cap -- you 're going to get stuck with unacceptably slow speeds .
One gigabyte is about how much it takes to download the equivalent of a few albums , a decent quality movie , and a decent quality TV episode -- not much .
Add to that whatever email , Web browsing , file downloading , app downloading , and whatever else you 'll be doing , and it would n't be far - fetched for the power users that Google is courting to hit that 1 gigabyte cap -- 34 MB a day -- on a regular basis .
( Caveat : Wi - fi use does n't count toward the cap , so use that as much as you can . )
T- Mobile 's rivals -- AT&T , Verizon , and Sprint -- offer a more liberal cap : 5 gigabytes , or five time as much -- after which they 'll either charge you more money or ask you to think about switching wireless providers .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wall Street 's meltdown has put the squeeze on all sorts of lending , and home loans are no exception .
Now , even some very well - qualified home buyers are getting turned down for mortgages .
" A lot of good , well - qualified people are being turned away for no good reason , " said Mark Savitt , president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and a mortgage broker in West Virginia .
" The wheels are coming to a grinding halt . "
Sometimes the rejections seem completely inexplicable .
Long Island , N.Y. - based mortgage broker Bob Moulton had one client with substantial income and assets who planned to put down $ 1.2 million on a house selling for $ 2.2 million .
For this borrower , a mortgage should have been a snap .
But it was n't .
The hitch :
The buyer was a few days late with a single mortgage payment last year when he was away on vacation .
That lowered his credit score to 679 , which is the reason the lender cited when it denied his loan .
" Just a little ding on his credit report , one late payment a year - and - a - half ago , " said Moulton .
" Everything else was fine . "
Higher rates
Another example comes from Savitt .
One of his clients was buying a home for $ 205,000 , putting down 20 % .
The buyer had an excellent credit score in the mid-700s , and the house was appraised at a little higher than the sale price .
The problem here :
The borrower 's debt to income ratio would be at about 45 - slightly higher than what most banks like to see , but by no means excessive .
And his other risk factors were great .
" The bank turned it down over excessive debt ratio , " said Savitt .
" That 's crazy . "
And higher interest rates are making it even harder for borrowers to get a loan .
The 30 - year fixed rate has shot up in the wake of the financial crisis - to 6.09 % , compared with 5.78 % last week - making monthly mortgage payments higher as well .
That 's raising the debt to income ratio for most borrowers , which means more will have their loan applications rejected .
"
It used to be that if most of a borrower 's qualifications were quite strong - income , assets , credit score and the value of the home itself - lenders would use their judgment to make exceptions if one factor was a bit weak .
A lender might accept a less than stellar credit score , for example , if the borrower was making a big down payment , or forgive a modest income if the borrower 's bank account was fat enough .
Not any more , says Alan Rosenbaum , president of New York City mortgage broker GuardHill Finance .
" There are no exceptions today , " said Rosenbaum .
" If an application does not meet each of the guidelines - and those guidelines themselves have gotten more strict - it 's denied . "
That means many more people simply no longer qualify for a mortgage .
A numbers game
" I get as many phone calls as I got two years ago , " said broker George Hanzimanolis , of Bankers First Mortgage in Pennsylvania , " but I bet you 40 % of the people calling in , we can't do anything for , versus 5 % a year ago . "
And Hanzimanolis say it 's gotten worse in the last few weeks .
One recent client who had excellent assets and income wanted to refinance his first and second mortgages .
The house was valued at $ 1.6 million , and he was looking for a $ 1.2 million loan .
That 's an excellent loan - to - value ratio of 75 % ; the banks like it to be no more than 80 % .
But these days many lenders are anticipating that home prices will continue to fall , so they 're automatically discounting every home 's appraised value by 10 % .
That dropped the value of the borrower 's home to $ 1.44 million , which put him over the 80 % loan - to - value ratio .
So the loan was turned down .
Things like that make brokering mortgage loans today a struggle , according to Moulton .
" Nothing is making sense .
Everything is torture right now , " he said .
" We 're getting things done but it takes enormous effort .
You think a deal is vanilla and it turns out to be rocky road . "
John McCain 's campaign - even according to his supporters - is running into trouble .
Most polls have him trailing Barack Obama by significant margins .
Here the Guardian asks top US commentators whether the race is now over or whether he can pull off a remarkable comeback .
Frank Luntz
Republican pollster and consultant
" He has n't lost it , but it is slipping away .
He will need a brilliant debate performance next week or it will be too late .
McCain has realised that he needs to fight .
He has just forgotten who he is fighting for .
It 's not a fight against Obama .
He should be fighting for the hard - working taxpayer and it does n't come across that way .
He is demonstrating the difference in his policy but he should be demonstrating why he is better for hard - working , middle - class taxpayers ...
The way the media works , the way the economy is coming apart , the only chance for McCain is when everybody is watching . "
David Johnson
Republican strategist
Worked on Bob Dole 's campaign in 1996
" If the election were held today , yeah , he 's toast .
John McCain is n't able to make a dent .
People have tuned him out .
That 's also beginning to seep down to your rank - and - file Republicans , and panic is beginning to set in .
He needs to change his message .
John McCain needs to get in front of a camera and say : ' I 'm not as polished and not as charismatic as my opponent , but we 're facing an economic crisis .
We need leadership and this is my plan . '
Like Churchill ... he needs to make America understand that he 's going to roll up his sleeves and he's not going to stop until he 's got victory . "
Elaine Kamarck
White House aide to Bill Clinton and Democratic superdelegate
Kennedy School of Government
" We know historically that when people are concerned about their pocket books they turn to the Democratic party .
It does n't look like this economic crisis is going to go away .
John McCain is fighting an uphill battle , historically .
He made a very good start last night , which nobody paid attention to , which is this proposal on foreclosures .
He 's got two or three weeks to somehow overcome the prejudice among the voters that the Republicans are somehow responsible for this and that they 're not the ones to handle this .
It 's a tall order , because this is not something that comes naturally to him ...
He 's got two options : he can try to change the conversation , which is extremely difficult given the severity of the financial crisis , or he can try to compete on the economic front . "
Stephen Hess

Worked for presidents from Eisenhower to Carter
" If McCain were to win this election I think it would truly be the biggest upset in American political history , and I say that not as a partisan but as a political historian ...
It 's as if Herbert Hoover would have won in 1932 .
I do n't think you can have an economic situation this bad , and not expect to throw out the in party ...
By now much of it is set in concrete as far as the fundamentals . "
Matt Bennett
Co-founder of Third Way , a Democratic thinktank
" I would say that he 's in intensive care but not quite in hospice at the moment .
He 's definitely not finished , we 're just too far out , and this race has lurched too quickly from one side to the other .
But there 's no question that he better turn it around fast .
I do n't know that there 's anything he can do that 's within his control .
The reason he's not finished is not because he could pull something out of his hat , but because there could be [ external ] events that could save his campaign .
He 's just not a skilled enough campaigner and he's in such a tight spot that there 's no magic bullet he could fire .
He needs to hope for something else to save him . "
David Yepsen
Political columnist , The Des Moines Register
" No , he is not finished .
It is still doable for McCain , and there is just under a month to the election ...
But he has got to talk about specific solutions on the economy .
There are also two wild cards in this race .
One is race : how many people can't vote for Obama because of his race .
We know it 's out there , but people do n't like to talk about it and it 's difficult to measure .
The other wild card is voters under 25 , the millennials .
There are huge registration numbers out there .
The challenge will be to produce those young people .
It 's one thing to sign them up .
It 's another to turn them out . "
James Antle
Associate editor of the American Spectator
" John McCain almost did the impossible : for a period after the Republican convention it looked like he might extend his party 's grip on the White House for another four years .
Independent voters liked him , conservatives loved Sarah Palin .
The Democrats seemed utterly unprepared for this strange turn of events .
And then came the financial meltdown .
McCain - to paraphrase Sam Cooke - do n't know much about the economy .
Democrats are made to campaign in times like these .
The only remaining advantage for McCain is that he has kept the race just close enough to benefit from any last - minute blunder by Barack Obama .
McCain has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate .
But his luck looks like it has run out . "
David Gergen
Former White House adviser to Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton
" The issue of race is still rearing its head in this campaign and we do n't know how that it is going to play out .
This has been such a volatile campaign and the issue of race has been so unresolved that I do n't think you can say with any confidence Obama is going to win .
The Obama people are not acting as if they are confident ...
If I were John McCain I would go into a meeting with the best economic minds in the country and determine where the economy is going and where they can go to cope with this crisis , and give a speech on the economy Monday and Tuesday of next week and take that into the next debate . "
Anne Hallum
Political science professor at Stetson University in DeLand , Florida
" I do n't think he 's lost the election , at least from Florida 's standpoint , because it is only three points apart , but favouring Obama .
I have memories of 2000 , when Gore lost by only 537 votes .
He 's in a tough spot , because he 's running against his own party .
But Americans are tired of the negative attacks .
That 's why these first early polls are showing Obama won [ the debate last night ] because McCain was so negative .
It 's standard for the person who 's behind to be negative .
For McCain to turn this around he's got to be positive , stay on point , stay clear with his policy statements ...
The odds are against McCain , except that Obama is counting on 18 - to 24 - year - olds , who are n't reliable . "

In choosing a running mate , every presidential candidate insists that he is seeking above all someone who could serve as president at a moment ’s notice .
Often that assertion is patently preposterous .
With his choice of Joe Biden , Barack Obama can make that assurance with a straight face .
The six - term senator from Delaware is serious , substantive and sophisticated in his understanding of the world .
Political junkies already have generated reams -- and gigabytes -- of commentary about how Biden will or will not complement Obama in his contest with Republican candidate John McCain .
We ’re not so naive as to believe that electoral calculations played no part in this choice .
But Biden passes the “ ready on day one ” test better than most vice presidential candidates .
Think of Dan Quayle , the telegenic but callow Indiana senator plucked from obscurity by George H.W. Bush to shore up the support of conservatives .
Or Geraldine A. Ferraro , the obscure New York congresswoman selected by Walter F. Mondale because he believed a female running mate would energize a listless campaign .
Biden , who sought the 2008 presidential nomination himself , is often caricatured as a self - important blabbermouth .
Like most caricatures , that image has some basis in reality .
But it is the same Biden who , as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1987 , effectively -- and economically -- questioned Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork .
His questioning elucidated Bork ’s extreme views in opposition to a constitutional right to privacy , the cornerstone of Supreme Court decisions upholding the right to contraception and abortion .
Bork ’s nomination was defeated on the Senate floor .
Biden , currently the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , also is well versed in a range of foreign policy issues .
Most recently he has demonstrated a grasp of the intricacies of the political situation in Iraq , although his preferred solution -- a “ soft partition ” of the country into Sunni , Shiite and Kurdish regions -- never gained traction .
In turning to a familiar Washington figure , Obama has opened himself to two criticisms : that he is compensating for his thin resume , much as George W. Bush did with his choice of Dick Cheney , and that the addition of Biden to the ticket undermines Obama ’s argument that wisdom trumps experience .
Obama deserves credit for not allowing these tactical objections to keep him from choosing an impressive partner and president - in - waiting .
Instead of attacking Obama ’s approach to choosing a running mate , McCain should emulate it .

You know what feature the new version of the Knight Industries Two Thousand could use ?
Theft protection .
Apparently on a publicity event almost a week ago in Toronto Canada , someone managed to steal the actual Modified Mustang that is used in the new NBC series Knight Rider .
RGBFilter says
The car was making a stop in Toronto for a publicity stunt in front of Union Station on Front Street .
The car was being unloaded from its transport trailer for a crowd of onlookers .
When its handler turned her back for a moment , a man darts from the median , jumps into the still - running ride , and peels off heading East on Front Street .
In the video , you see the security team member wheel the new KITT off the flatbed truck and then exit the car ( still running ) to return to the truck .
With the door still open , some impulsive car thief ran out and hopped in the car and took off .
According to those in attendance , this was a legitimate theft , and not a publicity stunt .
If it was then they hired nothing but actors for the security team and PR people because moments after the video , the shit hits the fan and everyone is clearly upset .
Its been almost a week and no one has exposed it as publicity , and its not said if it was recovered .

John McCain led an inquiry into lobbyist Jack Abramoff
While exuberant Republicans celebrated a new - found confidence at their convention in Minnesota , back in Washington DC - away from the limelight - there was another drama unfolding from an altogether murkier chapter of the party 's history .
In Courtroom 24a of Washington 's District Courthouse , a tearful , middle - aged man apologised for the political conspiracies he had worked on with some Republican politicians and officials .
Shortly after , Judge Ellen Huvelle sentenced him to four years in prison .
The man is Jack Abramoff , a once - powerful lobbyist with friends in high Republican places .
He was an integral part of the Republican establishment until he was charged with conspiracy , fraud and tax evasion three years ago .
When those charges were revealed , the scandal shook the party faithful to the core and helped ensure the Republicans lost control of Congress in the 2006 elections .
Close friends Abramoff was a larger - than - life figure in Washington politics ; a hard - nosed lobbyist with a taste for big black hats .
In his youth , he was a Reaganite and passionate anti-communist ; he helped raise support for the Nicaraguan Contras before becoming a Hollywood film producer .
After moving into political lobbying , he worked closely with former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , who was later to call him one of his " closest and dearest friends " .
For years he wined and dined many prominent Republicans - and paid for holidays , sports and concert tickets for some of them too .
In return , he was able to help shape legislation on behalf of his clients , Indian tribes who operate casinos on their reservations .
They , for the most part , got what they wanted : laws to tax their operations were quashed and internet gaming regulations were limited .
But they paid more for his services than they expected .
Abramoff steered them towards colleague 's consultancies which charged them over the odds and secretly split their profits with him .
He made tens of millions of dollars but , when news of his illegal activities became public , it fed into a series of other corruption and sex scandals associated with congressional Republicans and there was a huge backlash against the party .
Other convictions
Since an earlier conviction on unrelated fraud charges in November 2006 ( for which he was given a sentence of four years and 10 months ) he has spent some 3,000 hours talking to Justice Department officials , giving them chapter and verse on who he did business with , and how .
So far , his testimony has helped convict 11 people , all connected with the Republican Party .
Among them are President George W Bush 's former Deputy Interior Secretary Steven Griles and former Congressman Bob Ney .
Mr DeLay is among those who have been drawn into the investigation , which is continuing .
Abramoff 's co-operation ensured prosecutors did not ask for the maximum 11 - year sentence for his crimes .
So surely the timing of this courtroom drama in Washington could not have come at a worse time for the party faithful in St Paul ?
Well , not exactly .
There was one senator who read an investigation into Jack Abramoff in the Washington Post and decided it warranted closer scrutiny .
McCain inquiry
In a series of hearings on Capitol Hill , he helped reveal the extent to which the political process had become corrupted , and paved the way for the criminal prosecutions that followed .
That senator was one John McCain .
The liberal blogosphere still charges that Mr McCain tried to limit the political damage from what he uncovered , though most observers ( including the Washington Post reporter who worked on the original investigation ) credit his inquiry with being thorough and even - handed .
" Lobbyist " usually becomes a particularly dirty word in an election year - and this is no exception .
But given that inmate number 27593 - 112 has revealed all too clearly that it takes two to perform his particular kind of political tango , I would not expect John McCain - for the sake of his party - to spend too long talking about how he helped to bring him down .

When it comes to the environment , John McCain only has the interests of Big Oil at heart .
That ’s why he has over 22 Big Oil lobbyists advising him .
That ’s why he favored lifting the moratorium on off - shore drilling — a move that prompted Big Oil to donate over $ 1 million to his campaign .
And thanks to the League of Conservation Voters , we ’ve got the proof !
Watch the video and send it to everyone you know .
The senate will likely be voting next week on these issues .
Please call Senator McCain ’s office in Washington ( 202-224-2235 ) , and tell him to stop siding with Big Oil and start supporting clean energy .
Make everyone aware of McCain ’s deep ties to Big Oil by forwarding this video to five people and telling them to do the same .
Wall Street had a short response to anyone who wanted to borrow money this week : Come back later .
Companies that issue bonds and short - term debt were largely shut out of the credit markets .
But so were cities and counties that rely on short - term notes to pay for routine operations while waiting for tax revenues to arrive , leaving them to search for other financing .
Among the $ 6 billion in new municipal debt issues anticipated at the beginning of the week , only about $ 100 million actually came to the market , and the rest was postponed , said John V. Miller , chief investment officer at Nuveen Asset Management , a municipal bond investment firm .
Despite some slight signs of improvement on Friday , Mr. Miller and others said they were worried that the markets could remain unsettled for some time .
If the dysfunction persists , some municipalities might be caught in a financial vise , imperiling local projects and even making it harder to meet payrolls .
Key borrowing rates slipped modestly on Friday .
Investors said the market was unnerved by news that the government had seized Washington Mutual , the nation ’s largest savings and loan .
Many were also disappointed that policy makers had been unable to reach an agreement on a Treasury Department proposal to buy troubled assets from financial institutions .
In this post , I 'd like to chart the effect the financial crisis has had on each candidate 's standing in the polls .
The following graphs the RCP average from 9/7 to yesterday .
As of this writing , the average of the most recent polls shows McCain at 43.3 % , which means he has suffered a 3.4 - point slide in the last three weeks .
Barack Obama stands at 47.9 % , an increase of 2.7 - points .
For reference , I 've included the key events in the last week in the chart .
You 'll see that McCain lost ground in the wake of the events of 9/14 through 9/16 : Bank of America 's purchase of Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy , and the rescue of AIG .
McCain also suffered after the bailout deal was announced .
Obama saw his biggest increase in the middle of the month ; his numbers have not changed much since the bailout was announced .
Immediately prior to the start of the Democratic National Convention , Obama led in the RCP average 45.5 % to 43.9 % .
In June , he had an average lead of 47.1 % to 42.4 % .
So , from June to the beginning of the conventions , McCain whittled down Obama 's lead from 4.5 points to 1.6 points .
The Republican National Convention put him ahead of Obama , but recent events have wiped that lead away .
Currently , the race stands roughly where it did in June , though McCain is in a slightly better position .
It stands to reason that the financial situation has been a campaign " moment " that has favored Barack Obama .
So far , its effect is similar to him winning the nomination in June or heading to Europe in July .
A additional few points are worth noting .
First , the number of undecided voters has increased in the last three weeks , from a low of 6.3 % of the electorate on 9/8 to 8.8 % last night .
Second , the polls themselves have been very volatile this month .
The Gallup tracking poll had a crazy week last week , and individual pollsters are disagreeing with each other quite a bit .
Much of the disagreement has to do with McCain 's share of the vote .
The standard deviation of McCain 's share in the current RCP average is 2.8 % .
Obama 's is 2.0 % .
[ The standard deviation is the average distance between an individual poll 's result and the average of all polls . ]
By comparison , the final RCP average in 2004 had John Kerry 's standard deviation at 1.7 % and Bush 's at 1.3 % .
This is a sign of volatility in the current race .
Pollsters are finding fairly divergent results .
Third , there is a good subset of the electorate that claims to make up its mind in October or November .
That might be hard for political junkies who have been following every twist and turn for 18 months to believe - but it 's true !
In 1996 , 30 % of respondents claimed to make up their minds a day to a month before the election .
In 2000 , that number was also 30 % .
In 2004 , 21 % of the public made that claim .
These three points indicate that caution is required in projecting the state of the race forward .
There seems to be a lot of uncertainty out there .
Practically speaking , average voters are probably more focused on the economy than on politics .
As noted above , the number of undecideds has ticked back up , there has been a lot of volatility in the September polling , and we know a lot of people will make up their minds next month .
The events of the last 20 days could be the break Obama and his supporters have been waiting for - something that induces the remaining undecideds to abandon the status quo and embrace " Change That Works For You . "
But it might also be the case that this is just another turn on a very windy road - something that , like the trip to Europe , loses much of its effect after it drops from the news .
What really matters is if , when , and how this financial situation resolves itself .
It is fair to say that , on a purely political basis , McCain needs a resolution more than Obama .
His numbers have taken a hit - and , despite his best efforts , he has not successfully gotten in front of this issue .
That 's not to say that he needs this particular bill to pass - the fact that members of Congress in the most competitive districts voted against the bill tells us something .
Rather , McCain needs this issue to become less immediate , less salient .
Nothing else is getting through right now .
McCain needs this to drop off the front page as a first step to recover the ground he has lost in the last 20 days .

OCTOBER 24-- We 're assuming that the accused drunk driver who kicks off this week 's mug shot roundup is a John McCain supporter .
The 19 - year - old perp was arrested Sunday while wearing a t - shirt with a variation on a slogan associated with support of Texas A&M teams ( usually it 's something like ' Beat The Hell Outta Iowa State ' ) .
A few other notes : 1 ) The Floridians on page # 3 , who were arrested a day apart for driving under the influence , appear to have spent some quality time at the Lancome counter ; 2 ) As seen on page # 8 , all sorts of belly tattoos are photographed during the booking process ; and 3 ) Regarding the images on page # 17 , Phillies in six .

Mastio and Lawrence : One debate is enough .
We know who to vote for .
Patrick 's story
On 10 February 2002 , I called my wife Jan by satellite phone from Kabul , where I had been writing about the aftermath of the fall of the Taliban .
As soon as she began to speak I noticed that her voice sounded more anxious than I had ever heard it before , as if she had been stunned by some event , and I instantly felt a sense of dread that some disaster had occurred .
She said that our 20 - year - old son Henry , a student at an art college in Brighton , was in a mental hospital .
He had tried to swim Newhaven estuary fully clothed the previous evening and had been found by fishermen as he left the near - freezing water .
They feared he was suffering from hypothermia and took him to a general hospital in Brighton .
The doctors there , suspecting that he might have been trying to commit suicide , called the police , who ran Henry 's name through their computer .
They found that they had arrested him for a few hours some 10 days earlier , on 28 January .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Passers - by had seen Henry , barefoot and dishevelled , climbing the dangerously high wall of a railway viaduct and reported him as a potential suicide .
He stoutly denied to the police that he was trying to kill himself , claiming that he had climbed the viaduct only to get a better view of Brighton .
Taking into account this earlier incident , the police decided that Henry was a danger to himself and should be sent to a mental hospital .
The National Health one was full , so he was sent to the Priory clinic in Hove as " overflow " .
I told Jan I would rush home .
Kabul was then about the worst city in the world from which to leave quickly in an emergency .
I could not find any flights and decided to drive to Islamabad in Pakistan and get a plane from there .
I explained my plan to my driver , Mohammed , who gulped at the thought of going through the Kabul Gorge to Jalalabad and the Pakistan border because bands of Taliban were still attacking travellers on the road .
I told him my eldest son was very ill and he said that , if such was the case , he would simply drive over anybody who tried to stop us .
In my case , there was probably something expiatory in this mad dash as I wondered what I had been doing talking to Afghan warlords and drug smugglers when my own son was in such trouble .
I reached Peshawar , across the border in Pakistan , safely and took the first plane from Islamabad to Heathrow and went to Brighton the next day .
Henry was very pleased to see me .
He was in a neat room on the third floor of the clinic , in a large villa in Hove .
A nurse came in every 20 minutes to check on him .
Henry seemed baffled and subdued by what had happened .
He downplayed the idea that he had intended to commit suicide , and said he had felt the urge to walk barefoot back to his old home in Canterbury , 70 miles away .
Newhaven estuary had simply been an obstacle to be crossed .
He felt that being held in the Priory was a form of persecution or at best a misunderstanding : the police and doctors were overreacting to his eccentric lifestyle .
Henry always had great intelligence , wit and charm .
From an early age , he showed an intense interest in other people and made friends easily .
He later told me that he felt " shy and inhibited " as a teenager and as a student at King 's School in Canterbury , but I do not think this was really true .
He painted and drew very well and had won at least one valuable prize for his painting .
He had no difficulty in getting the A - levels to enter Brighton art college at the end of 2001 .
I had been proud of Henry 's ability to get on well with my friends , mostly foreign correspondents , though they were far older than he was , but I also worried that Henry was something of a Peter Pan , a boy whose magical charm made it difficult for him to grow up .
I sat on the bed in Henry 's room in the Priory and he lay on the floor .
Sometimes he beat out a rhythm on the bottom of an upturned waste - paper bin and chanted snatches of rap , but mostly he was listless and remote .
He had grudgingly told the doctors at the clinic that he was seeing visions and hearing voices .
This had started earlier in January .
" I tried to climb the bank by the railway station because I thought the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were on the other side , " Henry told me many years later .
" It sounds dotty , but I felt there was another world beyond the railway tracks .
Trees were talking to me like somebody speaking in my head .
Earlier I had asked an old woman with a dog the way to a coffee shop .
She giggled and pointed the wrong way and I truly thought she was a witch . "
Jan and I soon became familiar with the distorted landscape of the strange world in which Henry was now living .
The visions and voices , though the most dramatic part , were infrequent .
He spoke vaguely of religious and mystical forces and was extremely ascetic , adopting a vegan diet and not wearing shoes or underpants .
He was wary of anything mechanical or electronic , such as watches , mobile phones and smoke alarms .
The consultant at the Priory diagnosed Henry as being in the preliminary phase of schizophrenia .
I knew almost nothing about the illness except that it did not mean having a split personality .
I had spent many months in a general hospital in Cork and London when I got polio in an epidemic in 1956 , but I had never been inside a mental hospital in my life .
I knew that schizophrenia was serious , but not about its devastating impact on its victims .
I read up about it with increasing dismay .
I discovered that an American doctor had described schizophrenia as being to mental illness what cancer is to physical ailments .
The average age for the onset of schizophrenia is 18 in men and 25 in women .
There are 250,000 diagnosed cases in Britain , though the true number may be closer to half a million , and 2.2 million in the USA .
In the world , an estimated 51 million people suffer from schizophrenia .
Symptoms do not include violence , though the suicide rate is very high .
The illness can be alleviated and controlled , but not cured , by drugs developed since the 1950s .
Nevertheless , its treatment now is at about the level of the treatment of physical sickness a century ago .
Medications may work , but it is not clear precisely why they do so , or why they are effective for one person though not for another .
The causes of schizophrenia have been the subject of prolonged , rancorous and inconclusive debate among scientists .
People generally develop the illness because they are genetically predisposed to do so ; doctors invariably ask victims if anybody else in their family has been mentally ill .
But it is not genes alone that are responsible for the disorder .
Tests show that if one of a set of wholly identical twins develops schizophrenia , then the other twin has a 50 per cent chance of becoming schizophrenic as well .
But the second twin , although genetically identical to the first , has a 50 per cent chance of not developing the illness .
This must mean that there are other forces at work , such as events in the life of a person at risk , which determine if they will develop schizophrenia or not .
Its onset might be brought on by some personal disaster like the loss of a job , academic failure , the breakdown of a love affair or the death of a relative .
Or it might also , though this is unproven , be the result of taking mind - altering street drugs such as cannabis or skunk .
I only started talking to friends about mental illness after Henry was diagnosed as being schizophrenic , and I was astonished to discover how many of them had close relatives who were mentally ill and about whom they had never spoken to me .
It is as if ailments of the mind , and schizophrenia in particular , still carry a charge of terror greater than any physical illness aside from Aids .
Across the world , fear of madness still strikes as deep as it ever did .
In the Priory , the doctors explained to us that " a third of people diagnosed with schizophrenia recover completely , one - third have further attacks but show improvement , and one - third do not get better " .
In reality , the statistics are more complicated and less comforting than this .
We did everything we could to help Henry .
Jan and I and his younger brother Alex visited him often .
I took a room at the Old Ship Hotel on the seafront in Brighton and walked around the town with Henry most days until he was released about nine weeks later and came home to Canterbury .
The medication had done him good but he clearly saw taking the antipsychotic drugs twice as day as an imposition and began to secretly spit them out .
He , who had been so alert , original and enquiring , sank into gloomy passivity .
At the end of the summer he went back to art college in Brighton , on the advice of a local consultant , but could not cope .
He returned to Canterbury and by early 2003 had been sectioned in a mental hospital there , the first of a succession of hospitals and halfway houses we were to get to know all too well over the next five years .
It is not that Henry became a wholly changed personality .
Most of the time it was possible to have perfectly sane conversations with him , and he remained affectionate , witty and intelligent .
But periodically there were terrifying flights when he would disappear into the Kent countryside , running through brushwood and streams until he was found , often naked , dirty and covered with scratches .
The grim aftermath of one of these disappearances comes across in Jan 's diary entry for 4 February 2004 , when we saw him in the hospital just after he had been found .
" They showed us into his room where he's on the bed , looking terrible , " she wrote .
" He 's scratched all over – especially on his feet , his face too – the scratches very red and sore .
He looks at us with such apparent terror that I wonder if he 's hallucinating .
We sit down with him , Patrick with his arm around H's shoulders , I at his feet .
I touch these gently and he shudders .
He weeps and grimaces silently for about 10 minutes , then gradually calms down . "
I was always frightened that one day Henry , so often soaked to the skin and without food , would not return from his wanderings .
But though he did dangerous things very easily , he retained just enough survival instinct to come back .
When freezing or starving , he would seek help .
At least he has survived , which is not true of so many schizophrenics , and in the last 18 months in a clinic in east London he seems , slowly and painfully , to be getting better .
Henry 's story
The first time I heard the word " schizophrenic " , I was in an art class at King 's School in Canterbury and somebody had done a series of good drawings .
The teacher said they " looked like the drawings of a schizophrenic " .
I had an idea that schizophrenia just meant a split personality .
I heard the word again after I swam the estuary at Newhaven and I heard it used in hospital .
Some sailors took me there saying I had got hypothermia .
The doctor told me it was common for people of my age to have mental illness .
But I did n't think of it as an illness but as an awakening , a spiritual awakening .
I had started that morning from my art college opposite the market near the Levels on the London road in Brighton , walking barefoot along the edge of the sea .
I went east towards my home in Canterbury .
I felt that brambles , trees and wild animals were all urging me on .
It was as if they were looking at me and I could feel what they thought .
Once I went to a little spring and washed myself .
I walked along the seashore beside a high sea wall holding back the cliffs .
The wall seemed a hundred hundred feet high .
I believed there were prisoners hidden behind it and I sang to them .
Now that I find myself in a mental hospital , I look back on my days in Brighton as the best days of my life .
I liked the beach , the architecture , the college .
I made many friends there and got on well with my housemates , though I am sad that none of them has rung me since I was in hospital .
I was always good at art .
I was highly influenced by an American artist called Jean - Michel Basquiat .
His style was mainly of symbols and signs , and in his paintings I caught a whiff of magic .
At Brighton , my painting had become circular and I was trying to break away from that .
A few weeks later I was in Ireland , where I picked up a book on Jackson Pollock .
It said he was possessed by daemons and when an artist starts drawing circles it is the first sign of madness .
I firmly shut the book because I believed that some ghost in the cottage I was reading it in was trying to tell me I was mad .
I saw myself as a direct descendant of artists from Basquiat to Picasso .
Was it just a dream I had a long time ago or was I really as good as I thought ?
For a kid growing up , the world is a complicated place .
My main strength was art , and it was through art that I understood my world .
After I was rescued from the water in Newhaven , I was transferred to the Priory clinic in Hove .
While I was there I used a metal bin as a drum and I made up a song to go along with the drum beats .
It went : " Through and through and on to Peru / Through every taboo and on to Peru . "
I had been in Peru for my cousin 's wedding the year before .
A drum was also involved in an experience I had a week before I walked to Newhaven .
It was the first time the trees spoke to me .
I wanted to make a drum for my brother Alex because he was coming to Brighton .
I went to a shop to get materials for it , and I walked about picking up pieces of wood .
There were seagulls going south and crows flying away from me .
I kept walking .
I felt I was going on a mission .
You know fire hydrants are yellow and have an " H " on them ?
I thought the " H " stood for Henry .
I was beside a tree near a railway track in Preston Park when its roots started moving and it spoke to me as if somebody was speaking in my head .
It said I could rap .
It said I was the best of rappers .
About this time , I had a vision .
It was on the beach in Brighton .
I saw two birds fly across each other , and where they crossed I saw a golden Buddha .
When I was arrested for walking barefoot by the police and they asked me : " Have you seen things ? " , I neglected to tell them this .
The police were good to me , though I thought it was a bit much to be arrested just for having bare feet .
The worst hospital I was in was in Canterbury .
It was violent ; someone punched me .
You were n't allowed to go to your room during the day because two people had hanged themselves just before I came .
I ran away 18 times .
I got out in different ways .
I would run through the door if it opened for a second , or I climbed the fence .
Once I swam in Westbere Lake but I started to get cramps and turned back .
I saw a telephone box and called the police .
On another occasion , it was snowing and I got frostbite .
I warmed up my feet too rapidly and it was very painful .
It was while at art college in Brighton that I changed .
I gave up smoking cannabis and started going barefoot .
I took a lot of marijuana between the ages of 14 and 19 .
I was quite shy and inhibited .
My teenage years would have been different without marijuana .
Was it more than others ?
Not really .
Why did we smoke so much ?
Maybe it was because of the music scene .
My generation smoked more dope than the one before .
I was taking a lot of hash .
It would have been better if I had n't but about half the people I knew in Canterbury were smoking dope .
I took skunk but not often .
It tastes different and not very nice .
Most of my family and friends believe that my being sectioned was because of what I did then .
Do I have schizophrenia ?
I do n't know .
My mother , father and the dreaded psychiatrist definitely believe I am schizophrenic .
They have grounds for their belief , such as my being found naked and talking to trees in the woods .
Yet , I think I just see the world differently from other people , and maybe if psychiatrists understood this I would n't be in hospital .
When people hear about a psychotic episode they probably relate the word " psycho " to someone with violent tendencies .
I would not describe myself as a violent person .
I really feel the strain of being in hospital .
Being locked up for so long in a small world really dampens your spirits .
You feel forgotten .
Schizophrenia : the facts
* About 1 per cent of the population are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lives
* Schizophrenia affects men and women equally .
It is a highly complex condition that is still not fully understood .
During a psychotic episode , patients may be completely unable to separate reality from fantasy and may see the world in a highly distorted way .
* Some patients may have only one psychotic episode .
Others may have many episodes during a lifetime , but lead relatively normal lives between episodes .
* Those with chronic schizo - phrenia may need long - term treatment , usually involving drugs , to control their symptoms .
* Some patients experience hallucinations ; the most common is hearing voices .
They may be anxious and confused , or wide awake and alert , and may hold false or irrational beliefs .
* They are no more prone to be violent than the general population and typically prefer to withdraw and be left alone .
Mentally ill people are much more likely to harm themselves than others .
* There is no single cause for schizophrenia .
It is thought that some people have a genetic vulnerability and that environmental factors may then trigger the illness .
* Treatment with antipsychotic drugs is effective and though modern ones have fewer side - effects , many patients dislike them .
* The demand for talking treatments exceeds the supply .
* The outlook for patients has improved over the past 25 years , and many patients can lead independent , satisfying lives .

Google recently released its Protocol Buffers as open source .
About a year ago , Facebook released a similar product called Thrift .
I ’ve been comparing them ; here ’s what I ’ve found :
Thrift Protocol Buffers Backers Facebook , Apache ( accepted for incubation ) Google Bindings C++ , Java , Python , PHP , XSD , Ruby , C# , Perl , Objective C , Erlang , Smalltalk , OCaml , and Haskell C++ , Java , Python
( Perl , Ruby , and C# under discussion ) Output Formats Binary , JSON Binary Primitive Types bool

byte sequence “ repeated ” properties act like lists Enumerations Yes Yes Constants Yes No Composite Type struct message Exception Type Yes No Documentation So-so Good License Apache BSD - style Compiler Language C++ C++ RPC Interfaces Yes Yes RPC Implementation Yes No Composite Type Extensions No Yes
Overall , I think Thrift wins on features and Protocol Buffers win on
documentation .
Implementation - wise , they ’re quite similar .
Both use
integer tags to identify fields , so you can add and remove fields
without breaking existing code .
Protocol Buffers support
variable - width encoding of integers , which saves a few bytes .
( Thrift
has an experimental output format with variable - width ints . )
The major difference is that Thrift provides a full client / server RPC
implementation , whereas Protocol Buffers only generate stubs to use in
your own RPC system .
Update July 12 , 2008 : I have n’t tested for speed , but from a cursory examination it seems that , at the binary level , Thrift and Protocol Buffers are very similar .
I think Thrift will develop a more coherent community now that it ’s under Apache incubation .
It just moved to a new web site and mailing list , and the issue tracker is active .
- video encodings still in process -

Image by ghewgill via FlickrAfter a career spanning 3 decades in the funny pages spread across a trio of different series , Opus the existentialist penguin will shortly be no more .
Creator Berkeley Breathed recently announced that the final strip of his Sunday - only comic Opus would run on November 2 , 2008 , and that it would mark the end of both the comic and its title character .
Opus , originally conceived as a one - shot gag in the award - winning and frequently political Bloom County , went on to become a core player in the series .
He also appeared in the follow - up comic Outland before starring in his own strip .
Along the way he ’s been a world traveler , a heavy metal tuba player , a contender for vice president , and , perhaps most importantly , an everyman philosopher .
Opus also made his way into a number of Breathed ’s children ’s books , including the superb Goodnight Opus .
Sadly , while the author ’s departure from the realm of syndicated comics is due to his desire to focus on children ’s literature , Opus , it appears , will not be coming along for the ride .
" I 'll be leaving Opus in a way that it should be very clear that this time there 's no going back home , " says Breathed .
Being that the current plot sees our hero confined to an animal shelter – after receiving some end - of - the - line advice from the late Elvis Presley – we can only assume the worst for the lovable penguin .
But , at the same time , we can also hold out hope that Breathed will give Opus a suitable sendoff .
Comics ' preeminent penguin deserves no less .
Even if he does look more like a puffin .

Why you should use a BSD style license for your Open Source Project Bruce Montague < brucem@alumni.cse.ucsc.edu >
Revision : 53942 FreeBSD is a registered trademark of the FreeBSD Foundation .
Intel , Celeron , Centrino , Core , EtherExpress , i386 , i486 , Itanium , Pentium , and Xeon are trademarks or registered trademarks of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and other countries .
Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks .
Where those designations appear in this document , and the FreeBSD Project was aware of the trademark claim , the designations have been followed by the “ ™ ” or the “ ® ” symbol .
Last modified on 2020 - 03-01 12:23:40 by carlavilla .
1. Introduction
This document makes a case for using a BSD style license for software and data ; specifically it recommends using a BSD style license in place of the GPL .
It can also be read as a BSD versus GPL Open Source License introduction and summary .
2. Very Brief Open Source History Long before the term “ Open Source ” was used , software was developed by loose associations of programmers and freely exchanged .
Starting in the early 1950's , organizations such as SHARE and DECUS developed much of the software that computer hardware companies bundled with their hardware offerings .
At that time computer companies were in the hardware business ; anything that reduced software cost and made more programs available made the hardware companies more competitive .
This model changed in the 1960's .
In 1965 ADR developed the first licensed software product independent of a hardware company .
ADR was competing against a free IBM package originally developed by IBM customers .
ADR patented their software in 1968 .
To stop sharing of their program , they provided it under an equipment lease in which payment was spread over the lifetime of the product .
ADR thus retained ownership and could control resale and reuse .
In 1969 the US Department of Justice charged IBM with destroying businesses by bundling free software with IBM hardware .
As a result of this suit , IBM unbundled its software ; that is , software became independent products separate from hardware .
In 1968 Informatics introduced the first commercial killer - app and rapidly established the concept of the software product , the software company , and very high rates of return .
Informatics developed the perpetual license which is now standard throughout the computer industry , wherein ownership is never transferred to the customer .
3. Unix from a BSD Licensing Perspective AT&T , who owned the original Unix implementation , was a publicly regulated monopoly tied up in anti-trust court ; it was legally unable to sell a product into the software market .
It was , however , able to provide it to academic institutions for the price of media .
Universities rapidly adopted Unix after an OS conference publicized its availability .
It was extremely helpful that Unix ran on the PDP - 11 , a very affordable 16 - bit computer , and was coded in a high - level language that was demonstrably good for systems programming .
The DEC PDP - 11 had , in effect , an open hardware interface designed to make it easy for customers to write their own OS , which was common .
As DEC founder Ken Olsen famously proclaimed , “ software comes from heaven when you have good hardware ” .
Unix author Ken Thompson returned to his alma mater , University of California Berkeley ( UCB ) , in 1975 and taught the kernel line - by - line .
This ultimately resulted in an evolving system known as BSD ( Berkeley Standard Distribution ) .
UCB converted Unix to 32 - bits , added virtual memory , and implemented the version of the TCP / IP stack upon which the Internet was essentially built .
UCB made BSD available for the cost of media , under what became known as “ the BSD license ” .
A customer purchased Unix from AT&T and then ordered a BSD tape from UCB .
In the mid-1980s a government anti-trust case against AT&T ended with the break - up of AT&T .
AT&T still owned Unix and was now able to sell it .
AT&T embarked on an aggressive licensing effort and most commercial Unixes of the day became AT&T - derived .
In the early 1990 's AT&T sued UCB over license violations related to BSD .
UCB discovered that AT&T had incorporated , without acknowledgment or payment , many improvements due to BSD into AT&T 's products , and a lengthy court case , primarily between AT&T and UCB , ensued .
During this period some UCB programmers embarked on a project to rewrite any AT&T code associated with BSD .
This project resulted in a system called BSD 4.4 - lite ( lite because it was not a complete system ; it lacked 6 key AT&T files ) .
A lengthy series of articles published slightly later in Dr. Dobbs magazine described a BSD - derived 386 PC version of Unix , with BSD - licensed replacement files for the 6 missing 4.4 lite files .
This system , named 386BSD , was due to ex-UCB programmer William Jolitz .
It became the original basis of all the PC BSDs in use today .
In the mid 1990s , Novell purchased AT&T 's Unix rights and a ( then secret ) agreement was reached to terminate the lawsuit .
UCB soon terminated its support for BSD .
4 . The Current State of FreeBSD and BSD Licenses
The so - called new BSD license applied to FreeBSD within the last few years is effectively a statement that you can do anything with the program or its source , but you do not have any warranty and none of the authors has any liability ( basically , you cannot sue anybody ) .
This new BSD license is intended to encourage product commercialization .
Any BSD code can be sold or included in proprietary products without any restrictions on the availability of your code or your future behavior .
Do not confuse the new BSD license with “ public domain ” .
While an item in the public domain is also free for all to use , it has no owner .
5 . The origins of the GPL While the future of Unix had been so muddled in the late 1980s and early 1990s , the GPL , another development with important licensing considerations , reached fruition .
Richard Stallman , the developer of Emacs , was a member of the staff at MIT when his lab switched from home - grown to proprietary systems .
Stallman became upset when he found that he could not legally add minor improvements to the system .
( Many of Stallman 's co-workers had left to form two companies based on software developed at MIT and licensed by MIT ; there appears to have been disagreement over access to the source code for this software ) .
Stallman devised an alternative to the commercial software license and called it the GPL , or " GNU Public License " .
He also started a non-profit foundation , the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , which intended to develop an entire operating system , including all associated software , that would not be subject to proprietary licensing .
This system was called GNU , for " GNU is Not Unix " .
The GPL was designed to be the antithesis of the standard proprietary license .
To this end , any modifications that were made to a GPL program were required to be given back to the GPL community ( by requiring that the source of the program be available to the user ) and any program that used or linked to GPL code was required to be under the GPL .
The GPL was intended to keep software from becoming proprietary .
As the last paragraph of the GPL states : “ This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs . ” [ 1 ]
The GPL is a complex license so here are some rules of thumb when using the GPL : you can charge as much as you want for distributing , supporting , or documenting the software , but you cannot sell the software itself .
the rule - of - thumb states that if GPL source is required for a program to compile , the program must be under the GPL .
Linking statically to a GPL library requires a program to be under the GPL .
the GPL requires that any patents associated with GPLed software must be licensed for everyone 's free use .
simply aggregating software together , as when multiple programs are put on one disk , does not count as including GPLed programs in non-GPLed programs .
output of a program does not count as a derivative work .
This enables the gcc compiler to be used in commercial environments without legal problems .
since the Linux kernel is under the GPL , any code statically linked with the Linux kernel must be GPLed .
This requirement can be circumvented by dynamically linking loadable kernel modules .
This permits companies to distribute binary drivers , but often has the disadvantage that they will only work for particular versions of the Linux kernel .
Due in part to its complexity , in many parts of the world today the legalities of the GPL are being ignored in regard to Linux and related software .
The long - term ramifications of this are unclear .
6 . The origins of Linux and the LGPL While the commercial Unix wars raged , the Linux kernel was developed as a PC Unix clone .
Linus Torvalds credits the existence of the GNU C compiler and the associated GNU tools for the existence of Linux .
He put the Linux kernel under the GPL .
Remember that the GPL requires anything that statically links to any code under the GPL also be placed under the GPL .
The source for this code must thus be made available to the user of the program .
Dynamic linking , however , is not considered a violation of the GPL .
Pressure to put proprietary applications on Linux became overwhelming .
Such applications often must link with system libraries .
This resulted in a modified version of the GPL called the LGPL ( " Library " , since renamed to " Lesser " , GPL ) .
The LGPL allows proprietary code to be linked to the GNU C library , glibc .
You do not have to release the source code which has been dynamically linked to an LGPLed library .
If you statically link an application with glibc , such as is often required in embedded systems , you cannot keep your application proprietary , that is , the source must be released .
Both the GPL and LGPL require any modifications to the code directly under the license to be released .
7. Open Source licenses and the Orphaning Problem One of the serious problems associated with proprietary software is known as “ orphaning ” .
This occurs when a single business failure or change in a product strategy causes a huge pyramid of dependent systems and companies to fail for reasons beyond their control .
Decades of experience have shown that the momentary size or success of a software supplier is no guarantee that their software will remain available , as current market conditions and strategies can change rapidly .
The GPL attempts to prevent orphaning by severing the link to proprietary intellectual property .
A BSD license gives a small company the equivalent of software - in - escrow without any legal complications or costs .
If a BSD - licensed program becomes orphaned , a company can simply take over , in a proprietary manner , the program on which they are dependent .
An even better situation occurs when a BSD code - base is maintained by a small informal consortium , since the development process is not dependent on the survival of a single company or product line .
The survivability of the development team when they are mentally in the zone is much more important than simple physical availability of the source code .
8 . What a license cannot do No license can guarantee future software availability .
Although a copyright holder can traditionally change the terms of a copyright at anytime , the presumption in the BSD community is that such an attempt simply causes the source to fork .
The GPL explicitly disallows revoking the license .
It has occurred , however , that a company ( Mattel ) purchased a GPL copyright ( cphack ) , revoked the entire copyright , went to court , and prevailed [ 2 ] .
That is , they legally revoked the entire distribution and all derivative works based on the copyright .
Whether this could happen with a larger and more dispersed distribution is an open question ; there is also some confusion regarding whether the software was really under the GPL .
In another example , Red Hat purchased Cygnus , an engineering company that had taken over development of the FSF compiler tools .
Cygnus was able to do so because they had developed a business model in which they sold support for GNU software .
This enabled them to employ some 50 engineers and drive the direction of the programs by contributing the preponderance of modifications .
As Donald Rosenberg states " projects using licenses like the GPL ... live under constant threat of having someone take over the project by producing a better version of the code and doing it faster than the original owners . " [ 3 ]
9. GPL Advantages and Disadvantages A common reason to use the GPL is when modifying or extending the gcc compiler .
This is particularly apt when working with one - off specialty CPUs in environments where all software costs are likely to be considered overhead , with minimal expectations that others will use the resulting compiler .
The GPL is also attractive to small companies selling CDs in an environment where " buy - low , sell - high " may still give the end - user a very inexpensive product .
It is also attractive to companies that expect to survive by providing various forms of technical support , including documentation , for the GPLed intellectual property world .
A less publicized and unintended use of the GPL is that it is very favorable to large companies that want to undercut software companies .
In other words , the GPL is well suited for use as a marketing weapon , potentially reducing overall economic benefit and contributing to monopolistic behavior .
The GPL can present a real problem for those wishing to commercialize and profit from software .
For example , the GPL adds to the difficulty a graduate student will have in directly forming a company to commercialize his research results , or the difficulty a student will have in joining a company on the assumption that a promising research project will be commercialized .
For those who must work with statically - linked implementations of multiple software standards , the GPL is often a poor license , because it precludes using proprietary implementations of the standards .
The GPL thus minimizes the number of programs that can be built using a GPLed standard .
The GPL was intended to not provide a mechanism to develop a standard on which one engineers proprietary products .
( This does not apply to Linux applications because they do not statically link , rather they use a trap - based API . )
The GPL attempts to make programmers contribute to an evolving suite of programs , then to compete in the distribution and support of this suite .
This situation is unrealistic for many required core system standards , which may be applied in widely varying environments which require commercial customization or integration with legacy standards under existing ( non - GPL ) licenses .
Real - time systems are often statically linked , so the GPL and LGPL are definitely considered potential problems by many embedded systems companies .
The GPL is an attempt to keep efforts , regardless of demand , at the research and development stages .
This maximizes the benefits to researchers and developers , at an unknown cost to those who would benefit from wider distribution .
The GPL was designed to keep research results from transitioning to proprietary products .
This step is often assumed to be the last step in the traditional technology transfer pipeline and it is usually difficult enough under the best of circumstances ; the GPL was intended to make it impossible .
10 . BSD Advantages A BSD style license is a good choice for long duration research or other projects that need a development environment that : has near zero cost
will evolve over a long period of time
permits anyone to retain the option of commercializing final results with minimal legal issues .
This final consideration may often be the dominant one , as it was when the Apache project decided upon its license : “ This type of license is ideal for promoting the use of a reference body of code that implements a protocol for common service .
This is another reason why we choose it for the Apache group - many of us wanted to see HTTP survive and become a true multiparty standard , and would not have minded in the slightest if Microsoft or Netscape choose to incorporate our HTTP engine or any other component of our code into their products , if it helped further the goal of keeping HTTP common ...
All this means that , strategically speaking , the project needs to maintain sufficient momentum , and that participants realize greater value by contributing their code to the project , even code that would have had value if kept proprietary . ”
Developers tend to find the BSD license attractive as it keeps legal issues out of the way and lets them do whatever they want with the code .
In contrast , those who expect primarily to use a system rather than program it , or expect others to evolve the code , or who do not expect to make a living from their work associated with the system ( such as government employees ) , find the GPL attractive , because it forces code developed by others to be given to them and keeps their employer from retaining copyright and thus potentially " burying " or orphaning the software .
If you want to force your competitors to help you , the GPL is attractive .
A BSD license is not simply a gift .
The question “ why should we help our competitors or let them steal our work ? ” comes up often in relation to a BSD license .
Under a BSD license , if one company came to dominate a product niche that others considered strategic , the other companies can , with minimal effort , form a mini-consortium aimed at reestablishing parity by contributing to a competitive BSD variant that increases market competition and fairness .
This permits each company to believe that it will be able to profit from some advantage it can provide , while also contributing to economic flexibility and efficiency .
The more rapidly and easily the cooperating members can do this , the more successful they will be .
A BSD license is essentially a minimally complicated license that enables such behavior .
A key effect of the GPL , making a complete and competitive Open Source system widely available at cost of media , is a reasonable goal .
A BSD style license , in conjunction with ad - hoc - consortiums of individuals , can achieve this goal without destroying the economic assumptions built around the deployment - end of the technology transfer pipeline .
11 . Specific Recommendations for using a BSD license
The BSD license is preferable for transferring research results in a way that will widely be deployed and most benefit an economy .
As such , research funding agencies , such as the NSF , ONR and DARPA , should encourage in the earliest phases of funded research projects , the adoption of BSD style licenses for software , data , results , and open hardware .
They should also encourage formation of standards based around implemented Open Source systems and ongoing Open Source projects .
Government policy should minimize the costs and difficulties in moving from research to deployment .
When possible , grants should require results to be available under a commercialization friendly BSD style license .
In many cases , the long - term results of a BSD style license more accurately reflect the goals proclaimed in the research charter of universities than what occurs when results are copyrighted or patented and subject to proprietary university licensing .
Anecdotal evidence exists that universities are financially better rewarded in the long run by releasing research results and then appealing to donations from commercially successful alumni .
Companies have long recognized that the creation of de facto standards is a key marketing technique .
The BSD license serves this role well , if a company really has a unique advantage in evolving the system .
The license is legally attractive to the widest audience while the company 's expertise ensures their control .
There are times when the GPL may be the appropriate vehicle for an attempt to create such a standard , especially when attempting to undermine or co-opt others .
The GPL , however , penalizes the evolution of that standard , because it promotes a suite rather than a commercially applicable standard .
Use of such a suite constantly raises commercialization and legal issues .
It may not be possible to mix standards when some are under the GPL and others are not .
A true technical standard should not mandate exclusion of other standards for non-technical reasons .
Companies interested in promoting an evolving standard , which can become the core of other companies ' commercial products , should be wary of the GPL .
Regardless of the license used , the resulting software will usually devolve to whoever actually makes the majority of the engineering changes and most understands the state of the system .
The GPL simply adds more legal friction to the result .
Large companies , in which Open Source code is developed , should be aware that programmers appreciate Open Source because it leaves the software available to the employee when they change employers .
Some companies encourage this behavior as an employment perk , especially when the software involved is not directly strategic .
It is , in effect , a front - loaded retirement benefit with potential lost opportunity costs but no direct costs .
Encouraging employees to work for peer acclaim outside the company is a cheap portable benefit a company can sometimes provide with near zero downside .
Small companies with software projects vulnerable to orphaning should attempt to use the BSD license when possible .
Companies of all sizes should consider forming such Open Source projects when it is to their mutual advantage to maintain the minimal legal and organization overheads associated with a true BSD - style Open Source project .
Non-profits should participate in Open Source projects when possible .
To minimize software engineering problems , such as mixing code under different licenses , BSD - style licenses should be encouraged .
Being leery of the GPL should particularly be the case with non-profits that interact with the developing world .
In some locales where application of law becomes a costly exercise , the simplicity of the new BSD license , as compared to the GPL , may be of considerable advantage .
12 . Conclusion
In contrast to the GPL , which is designed to prevent the proprietary commercialization of Open Source code , the BSD license places minimal restrictions on future behavior .
This allows BSD code to remain Open Source or become integrated into commercial solutions , as a project 's or company 's needs change .
In other words , the BSD license does not become a legal time - bomb at any point in the development process .
In addition , since the BSD license does not come with the legal complexity of the GPL or LGPL licenses , it allows developers and companies to spend their time creating and promoting good code rather than worrying if that code violates licensing .
" The picture is not what we thought before ; there is a new direction , a new possibility , " said Meng Jin , one of the paper 's authors and a paleontologist at the museum .
The announcement raises questions about a long - held evolutionary theory that assumes mammals during the dinosaur era were small because it was the only size that allowed them to survive amid the dangerous world of predatory dinosaurs .
Scientists have long thought mammals did not begin a true growth spurt until after dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago .
The discovery raises the possibility that mammals influenced the dinosaurs ' evolution , not just the other way around .
" We 've had a very simplified view where mammals are prey and dinosaurs are predators , " said Anne Weil , a paleontologist at Duke University , North Carolina , who wrote an accompanying article in the magazine .
So unexpected was the finding , that the scientists did not realise something was in the animal 's stomach until they examined it under a microscope almost two years after discovering the specimen .
Even then they assumed it was the remains of an embryo , a partially formed baby mammal that was killed with its mother probably under mountains of volcanic ash .
More research revealed it was a juvenile Psittacosaurus dinosaur 12.7 centimetres long , with the potential to grow to nearly two metres .
Scientists do not know how old the dinosaur was when it died , although it had apparently used its teeth .
The mammals lived during the Mesozoic era from about 280 million to about 65 million years ago , largely known as the age of the dinosaurs .
The mammal that swallowed the dinosaur is called Repenomamus robustus , and its sharp teeth suggest it was a particularly nasty character .
Scientists say it probably tore the juvenile dinosaur apart and gulped it down in chunks .
Related to that animal is the far bigger Repenomamus giganticus found nearby , a squat , toothy animal .
Probably weighing about 14 kilograms , it may have been able to stand its ground against at least some of the dinosaurs of the period .
The findings mean there may have been even bigger creatures that nursed their young during this period .
The Boston Globe
“ I think it 's coming ” says securities lawyer Jacob Zamansky , principal at Zamansky & Associates , predicting the “ outcry for culprits and scapegoats ” will be met .
Zamansky , Coffee and others say the government is now busy investigating likely wrongdoing that took place at dozens of firms and that it is just a matter of time before it yields results .
But crisis management is taking precedence .
“ The government and the private sector are focused on bailing out the ship right now , and rightly so , " says former SEC enforcement official Marvin G. Pickholz , now a partner at the New York law firm Duane Morris .
“ I think most resources are being channeled toward solving the current crisis , ” adds Harvey Pitt , who chaired the SEC during the government ’s crackdown on accounting fraud at the beginning of the decade .
" I think it will be months before any prosecutions occur , if at all . "
Investigations of this kind also take time .
In the previous scandal , it took about two years from the time of the alleged wrongdoing to the first big indictments .
WorldCom , for instance , was cooking the books in late 2000 .
Its CFO Scott Sullivan was n't indicted in August 2002 .
For Investors
Pickholz adds that election year considerations may also be slowing down the process .
US attorneys — who are political appointees — may be unwilling or reluctant to open a case without knowing who ’ll be the next president and whether they ’ll still be in their jobs .
Recent developments , however , show momentum is building .
The government recently issued subpoenas to a dozen executives at Lehman Brothers , which CNBC learned , included CEO Richard Fuld , two CFOS and a COO .
As CNBC first reported Sept. 24 , multiple federal investigations at Lehman and at least 25 other firms are focusing primarily on asset values — that is , whether companies like Lehman were properly valuing things like mortgage - backed securities on their books , as well as the securities they sold to the public .
Thanks for the memories .
Today we ’re officially closing a chapter on Australian music and media history .
As one of the oldest Australian new media companies , we have ridden the waves of change in media , technology and social over the past 18 years , and we know that the only constant part of these worlds is change .
Evolution has always been in our DNA .
And so today we ’re announcing the inthemix will be rebranded as Music Junkee .
Inthemix started at the turn of the millennium , and it did n’t take long for that tiny website to start the ball rolling on a journey that would lead it to become one of the leading forces for electronic music in the world .
It continued to evolve into a company called Sound Alliance that would launch titles like FasterLouder , Same Same , and , over a decade later , Junkee and Punkee along with our parent company , Junkee Media .
But times change .
Last year we rebranded FasterLouder to Music Junkee because we knew that the days of choosing just one genre were over , and the results have been amazingly encouraging .
Music Junkee has grown into a unique voice in Australian music media and published many great pieces of content , like ‘ If Taylor Swift Wants To Address Her Bad Reputation , She Should Start By Condemning Donald Trump ’ , ‘ How NLV Records Became One Of The Most Important Labels In Australia ’ , and ‘ A Loving Look Back At The Madness That Was Short Stack ’ .
It ’s no small irony that inthemix is now the legal age of the scene that it ’s been covering for the past 18 years .
Over those years inthemix has charted the undulating rise of electronic music , festivals , DJs , nightclubs and the entire culture that it spawned .
We ’ve documented the full history of inthemix in a long - form oral feature that celebrates the people , posts , and pride of place that it has in Australia ’s music scene .
Please take the time to remember all the good times here .
This change does not mean that we are giving up on electronic music .
In fact , we ’re pretty damn excited about where dance music is going , and we will continue to document the rise of seminal events like the Electronic Music Conference in Sydney , and the resurgence of music festivals in Australia .
What is changing is the way that we cover it .
Dance music is now closely intertwined with popular music and culture , and so we ’ll be covering the most interesting areas where music and culture collide .
It will be a fresh take on a scene that we ’ve loved and nurtured for almost two decades .
The editor that will be leading this new direction is Jules LeFevre .
Jules has been working on Music Junkee since its launch ( and FasterLouder and inthemix before that ) and is fast establishing herself as one of the best music writers and editors in the country .
Music is a huge part of Junkee ’s heritage and will always be a massive part of who we are .
The only thing we are certain about the future is that we are going to continue to evolve .
Thank you to every person who has been a part of the inthemix story from the very beginning to now .
It ’s been an amazing ride and the people , connections , history , stories and legends will not be forgotten .
Thank you for the memories .
— inthemix

Did you buy DRM music from Wal * Mart instead of downloading MP3s for free from the P2P networks ?
Well , they 're repaying your honesty by taking away your music .
Unless you go through a bunch of hoops ( that you may never find out about , if you 've changed email addresses or if you 're not a very technical person ) , your music will no longer be playable after October 9th .
But do n't worry , this will never ever happen to all those other DRM companies — unlike little fly - by - night mom-and - pop operations like Wal * Mart , the DRM companies are rock - ribbed veterans of commerce and industry , sure to be here for a thousand years .
So go on buying your Audible books , your iTunes DRM songs , your Zune media , your EA games …
None of these companies will ever disappear , nor will the third - party DRM suppliers they use .
They are as solid and permanent as Commodore , Atari , the Soviet Union , the American credit system and the Roman Empire .
Boy , the entertainment industry sure makes a good case for ripping them off , huh ?
Buy your media and risk having it confiscated by a DRM - server shutdown .
Take it for free and keep it forever .

We hope you are enjoying the increased music quality / bitrate and the improved usability of Walmart 's MP3 music downloads .
We began offering MP3s in August 2007 and have offered only DRM ( digital rights management ) - free MP3s since February 2008 .
As the final stage of our transition to a full DRM - free MP3 download store , Walmart will be shutting down our digital rights management system that supports protected songs and albums purchased from our site .
If you have purchased protected WMA music files from our site prior to Feb 2008 , we strongly recommend that you back up your songs by burning them to a recordable audio CD .
By backing up your songs , you will be able to access them from any personal computer .
This change does not impact songs or albums purchased after Feb 2008 , as those are DRM - free .
Beginning October 9 , we will no longer be able to assist with digital rights management issues for protected WMA files purchased from Walmart.com .
If you do not back up your files before this date , you will no longer be able to transfer your songs to other computers or access your songs after changing or reinstalling your operating system or in the event of a system crash .
Your music and video collections will still play on the originally authorized computer .
Thank you for using Walmart.com for music downloads .
We are working hard to make our store better than ever and easier to use .

Researchers from Boston University 's Slone Epidemiology Center have found that approximately one in ten U.S. children uses one or more cough and cold medications during a given week .
These findings appear in the August issue of the journal Pediatrics .
Pediatric cough and cold medications are widely marketed in the U.S. but surprisingly little is known about just how often they are used in children .
This information is especially important in light of recent revelations that cough and cold medications are responsible for serious adverse events and even deaths among children .
To define the frequency and patterns of use , the researchers analyzed data between 1999 and 2006 from the Slone Survey , a national telephone survey of medication use in a representative sample of the U.S. population .
The authors considered all oral medicines that are approved by the FDA to treat children 's coughs and colds .
The researchers found that in a given week , at least one cough and cold medication was used by 10.1 percent of U.S. children .
In terms of active ingredients contained in these medications , exposure was highest to decongestants and antihistamines ( 6.3 percent each ) , followed by anti-cough ingredients ( 4.1 percent ) and expectorants ( 1.5 percent ) .
Exposures to cough and cold medications was highest among 2 - to 5 - year olds and children under 2 years of age .
Among all the products used , 64.2 percent contained more than one active ingredient .
The most commonly used product types were single - ingredient antihistamines , antihistamine / decongestant combinations and antihistamine / decongestant / anti-cough combinations .
The researchers also found the use of cough and cold medications declined from 12.3 percent in 1999 - 2000 to 8.4 percent in 2005 - 2006 .
According to the researchers the especially common use of cough and cold medications among young children is noteworthy .
" Given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children , the fact that one in ten U.S. children is using one of these medications is striking , " said lead author Louis Vernacchio , MD , MSc , an assistant professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine .

Standards , the kernel , and Postfix

Standards like POSIX are meant to make life easier for application developers by providing rules on the semantics of system calls for multiple different platforms .
Sometimes , though , operating system developers decide to change the behavior of their platform — with full knowledge that it breaks compatibility — for various reasons .
This requires application developers to notice the change and take appropriate action ; not doing so can lead to a security hole like the one found in the Postfix mail transfer agent ( MTA ) recently .
The behavior of links , created using the link ( ) system call — on Linux , Solaris , and IRIX — is what tripped up Postfix .
In particular , what happens when a hard link is made to a symbolic link .
Many long - time UNIX hackers do n't realize that you can even do that , nor what to expect if you do .
Postfix relied on a particular , standard - specified behavior that many operating systems , including early versions of Linux , follow .
Links can be a somewhat confusing , or possibly unknown , part of UNIX - like filesystems , so a bit of explanation is in order .
A link created with link ( ) — also known as a hard link — is an alias for a particular file .
It simply gives an additional name by which a particular chunk of bytes on the disk can be referenced .
For example :
link ( " / path/to/foo " , " / link/to/ foo " ) ;
/ link/to/foo
/ path/to/foo
creates a second entry in the filesystem ( called ) which points to the same file as .
The file being linked to must exist and reside on the same filesystem as the link .
Symbolic links , on the other hand , are aliases of a different sort .
A symbolic link creates a new entry ( e.g. inode ) in the filesystem which contains the path of the linked - to file as a string .
There is no requirement that the file exist or be on the same filesystem — the only real requirement is that the path conform to standard pathname rules .
The symlink ( ) system call is used to create them :
symlink ( " / path/to/foo " , " / symlink /to/ foo " ) ;
ln
-s
Both symbolic links and hard links can also be created from the command line using thecommand ( adding aoption for symbolic links ) .
So , when making a hard link to a symbolic link , there are two choices : either follow the symbolic link to its , possibly nonexistent , target and link to that or link to the symbolic link inode itself .
POSIX requires that the symbolic link be fully resolved to an actual existing file , which is the behavior that Postfix relies upon .
The exact sequence of events is lost in the mists of time , but Linux changed to non-standard behavior — at least partially for compatibility with Solaris — in kernel version 1.3.56 ( which was released in January 1996 ) .
Some discussion prior to that change adds an additional reason for it : user space has no way to make a link to a symbolic link without it .
Some saw that as a flaw in the interface and proposed the change .
An application developer that wanted the original behavior would be able to implement it by resolving any symbolic links before making the hard link .
To further complicate things , it appears that the POSIX behavior was restored in the 2.1 development series , only to be changed back in late 1998 .
This change led to the comments currently in fs / namei.c for the function implementing link ( ) :
/* * Hardlinks are often used in delicate situations .
We avoid * security - related surprises by not following symlinks on the * newname .
-- KAB * *
We do n't follow them on the oldname either to be compatible * with linux 2.0 , and to avoid hard - linking to directories * and other special files .
-- ADM */
oldname
newname
Whereis the file being linked to andis the name being created .
For the curious , KAB is Kevin Buhr and ADM is Alan Modra .
Unfortunately , according to Postfix author Wietse Venema , the link ( 2 ) man page did n't change until sometime in 2006 .
This makes it fairly difficult for application developers to learn about the change , especially because they may not follow kernel development closely .
Postfix allows root - owned symbolic links to be used as the target for local mail delivery , specifically to handle things like / dev/null on Solaris , which is a symbolic link .
Because an attacker can make a link to a root - owned symbolic link on vulnerable systems , Postfix can get confused and deliver mail to files that it should n't .
This can lead to privilege escalation ( via executing code as root ) by making a hard link to a symbolic link of an init script ( CVE - 2008 -2936 ) .
As Venema outlines in the Postfix security advisory , the problem can be resolved by requiring that symbolic links used for local delivery reside in a directory that is only writeable by root .
It is not a perfect solution , though : " This change will break legitimate configurations that deliver mail to a symbolic link in a directory with less restrictive permissions . "
There are other workarounds for people who do n't want to use the provided patch to Postfix .
Protecting the mail spool directory is one solution ; Venema provides a script to use to do that .
Some systems can be configured to disallow links to files owned by others , which is another way to avoid the problem .
This issue has given Postfix a bit of a black eye , but that is rather unfair .
The problem was found by a SUSE code inspection , but it has existed in certain kinds of Linux installations of Postfix for a long time .
It could be argued that testing should have found it — there is a simple test for vulnerable systems — but relying on documented behavior that is part of an important standard that Linux is said to support is not completely unreasonable either .
It is likely that the full implications of not supporting the standard were not completely understood until recently .
Linux was still in its infancy when the original change went in .
One would like to think that a change of that type today would be nearly impossible because it breaks the kernel 's user - space interface .
If it were to happen , somehow , the resulting hue and cry would be loud enough that application developers would hear .
But that 's for intentional changes ; a bug introduced into a dark corner of the kernel 's API might go unnoticed for quite some time .
Hopefully , none of those lingers for ten years before being discovered .
Update :
The original article referred to CVE - 2008 - 2937 as also being a consequence of the link issue , which it is not .
It is an unrelated issue that was found during the same code review .

Mr Mohan has been described as ' an angel ' ( Photos : Prashant Ravi )
The catastrophic floods in the east Indian state of Bihar resulted in many deaths and much hardship , but the suffering could have been much worse if it was not for the efforts of some valiant individuals .
Tens of thousands of people have been forced to take shelter in hundreds of crammed relief camps where food and clean water are in short supply .
One such hero was Anand Mohan , who has just graduated from India 's premier engineering institute , the Indian Institute of Technology [ IIT ] and is set to join a multinational mining company in Australia in mid-October .
After graduating from IIT , he planned to return to Sharsha town in Bihar for a week to say good - bye to his parents .
Sharsha was among the five districts hardest - hit in Bihar .
Although efforts were made to provide food and shelter to hundreds of displaced people just behind Sharsha 's railway station , supplies soon ran out .
Rampaging rivers
Homeless , hungry and dispossessed people were left to fend for themselves and many were left with little choice but to migrate to other camps .
For me they are really gods
Flood victim Vijendra Rai When
Anand saw the misery , he could not restrain himself and began collecting donations from friends and local people to help them .
" The first day we managed to buy a biscuit carton and some milk powder packs .
We distributed the stuff among starving children in the camp , " he said .
However soon he got more help as more friends and locals flocked to join him .
Management student Ravi Verma was among them .
Together they named their group as Aastha ( Faith ) Volunteers and started working round the clock to look after those in the relief camp .
The volunteers have received donations from far and wide " Now we do not want to go anywhere else .
Here we 're getting everything from these people .
They 're taking care of us more than the government or other agencies , " said Sanjay Kumar Mukhia from the neighbouring district of Madhepura .
He lost 16 members of his family in floods caused by rampaging rivers .
" My three year 's old son survived only because of milk supplied by these bhaiyas , ( brothers ) , " said another flood victim , Ghuran Ram .
Vijendra Rai's three children were suffering from acute diarrhoea - but they all survived thanks to timely medical help from Aastha volunteers .
" For me they are really gods , " Mr Rai said .
Unmindful of the media presence , Anand Mohan and his friends are drenched in sweat as they carry on working in humid and trying conditions .
" Please write that we 're doing nothing special .
It 's all became possible because of community support , " he said .
" My physics professor HC Verma and some friends at IIT are collecting donations and sending them to us .
I 'm really thankful to them . "
And for young local people , he has become a role model .
Aastha now comprises a team of 15 dedicated volunteers managing over 300 flood victims in two adjacent relief camps .
Other heroes
The floods have created other heroes in Bihar as well - and Amrendra Shukla and Ravi Paswan are among them .
Both are friends , both are disabled and both are casual labourers .
Paswan has one leg blighted by polio .
Yet they saved almost 40 people from drowning in the swirling floodwaters .
When the River Kosi breached the embankment at Kusaha in Nepal the gushing water descended upon Birpur town in Bihar 's Supaul district .
In no time the whole town was under water , with many homes literally washed away .
Hundreds of people sought sanctuary on rooftops to escape the swirling waters .
For four days many people were left stranded .
" Before our eyes little children , women and elderly people were being swept away in the strong currents of the flood water , " Shukla told the BBC .
An idea came to him and Paswan to tie three empty drums together with thick bamboo sticks and then place a wooden bed on top .
They initially took six children on it for 3 km ( 1.8 miles ) in neck - deep water to reach a safer place .
Over three days they evacuated over 40 people - mostly children , women and elderly people .
" Despite being physically challenged they came as angels for local people by saving their life in the terrible floods , " said local official Madan Tiwari .
The two men have shrugged off the acclaim in typically modest fashion .
They say that they just " followed their consciences " without caring for their own lives which " otherwise are of no use for anyone " .

What are these ?
A deal between Yahoo and Google that would see the latter 's ads run on the former 's web sites is receiving increased regulatory attention , both in the US and the EU .
Google is obviously anxious for the opportunity to serve its ads through Yahoo's high - traffic sites , and does n't want to see the deal founder on the shoals of antitrust concerns .
That 's the clear message being sent by a blog post from Google 's Chief Economist , Hal Varian , who took the time to critique a marketing firm 's study that suggested the deal could raise prices for some advertisers .
The study was performed by SearchIgnite , which makes money by managing the search advertising efforts of clients .
The company compared rates for different classes of ads that appeared at Yahoo , contrasting ad rates for what it called " head terms , " which appear above the search results , and " tail terms , " which appear on a right - side column .
Yahoo's auction system currently winds up charging more for head terms than Google , but the situation is reversed for tail terms .
Depending on how and when Yahoo replaces its own ads with those supplied by Google , this dynamic could result in changes in advertising costs .
If Yahoo pursues a pure profit - maximization approach , the report concludes , it could raise keyword prices by up to 22 percent .
Not so , says Varian , who lists a series of complaints with the analysis .
Those prices are set by auction , and if they go up , advertisers are likely to drop out of the auction and limit the pricing pressure .
Yahoo has also stated that it's not looking at the deal as a way of maximizing profits , but rather to get some cash in cases where its own stock of ads do n't fit the search terms well .
Varian also takes issue with how well the head and tail terms are defined , and the metric chosen for comparing pricing .
It 's not in the least bit surprising that a UC Berkeley professor of economics could find issues with a report of this nature ; it consists only six pages of text and provides the perspective of a marketing company that 's heavily involved in the industry it 's analyzing .
The surprise is that Varian 's actually bothering with the study at all , and doing so on one of Google 's corporate blogs .
A quick search using Google News itself reveals that SearchIgnite appears only four times , and only one of these stories is actually relevant to the Yahoo deal .
Meanwhile , checking Varian 's history in the Google Public Policy Blog reveals that this is only the third post he 's made there , even though he has been with the company in one form or another since 2002 .
It 's clear that his analysis here is exceptional in a number of ways .
The obvious explanation for it is a hypersensitivity to anything that puts the advertising deal with Yahoo in a negative light at a time where government regulators are threatening to scuttle it .
Varian himself links to one reason for concern here , a New York Times technology blog post that displays the 22 percent increase figure prominently in its headline .
Although the blog post dates from July and does n't appear to have been indexed by Google News , the Times is a prominent shaper of opinions , and it appears that Google felt it could n't go unanswered .

Choose the Download than on your PC option .

BlackStacks users can use their mouse , keyboards or external touchpads .

The emulator has been translated into 47 languages and it weights around 307 MB .
Over the past several months , I ’ve become increasingly frustrated with VMware Fusion 4 ’s performance with Mountain Lion - dual monitors are a disaster , Unity mode results in loss of focus and ghost images , and lots of other little quirks require me to bend my workflow to VMware rather than it
enhancing my workflow .
Seeing that the latest version of Parallels was included in the last MacUpdate Bundle , I decided to give Parallels a shot .
It takes 15 second on Google to find about two dozen sites showing Parallels 8 to have superior benchmarks to VMware 4 or 5 .
Additionally , with the bundle , I ’d get Parallels for $ 50 instead of the $ 70 crossgrade charge ( although checking http://parallels.com today , the charge is also $ 50 ) , which means the cost would be the same as upgrading VMware Fusion to the current version .
Parallels emphasizes the ease of use of their software and the seamlessness of its operation .
So , I
downloaded the trial version and fired it up .
I converted the Win 7 64 - bit machine ( 40 GB HDD , 2 GB Memory ) that I ’d been using with VMware on my 13 ” 2011 MacBook Pro ( 500 GB 7200 RPM HDD , 8 GB Memory ) .
The wizard converted the machine seamlessly and left the existing VM intact , which is certainly positive .
I ’d elected to run the machine
“ more seamlessly , ” so the machine was created to run in coherence mode .
Here are a handful of things I learned :
Coherence Mode has many of the same problems Unity Mode in VMware 4 does with ghosting , losing focus , etc .
This issue may be tied to the extent to which I rely on spaces ( e.g. Messages , Lync , & Outlook in a space together , LabTech , Connectwise , and IE in another space , Safari along with RDP sessions in another , maybe more ) , but Coherence mode was unusably frustrating to me .
Performance was not noticeably different from VMware for the tasks I was doing .
But , I do n’t typically run anything that needs much horsepower on my virtual machine .
Customization / configuration of the vm in Parallels 8 seemed obtuse to me .
Exercising the same sort of granularity of control and the ease of adjusting settings / sharing / file location
that VMware does so well remains inscrutable to me in Parallels .
Now , I work with vSphere and ESX on a nearly daily basis and have had Fusion on my Mac since the last time I gave up on Parallels ( too long ago to be relevant here ) , so there ’s certainly a familiarity component at play .
Nevertheless , I felt like an Android user moving to iPhone must feel with
Parallels , and that feeling is , for me , a deal - breaker .
A locked - down iPhone enhances my workflow ; a vm that takes tons of effort to tweak results in nothing but headaches .
At least for me , upgrading to VMware Fusion 5 proved a much better move than switching to Parallels .
So , I ’ve upgraded my version of VMware Fusion to 5 and my virtual machine to Windows 8 and am reasonably happy there .
Unity mode still leaves a lot to be desired , but performance is fine and the annoying issues with spaces and multiple displays seem to be resolved .
For those of us in the enterprise world stubborn enough to stay on our Macs , VMware Fusion may be as good as it gets …

The televised vice - presidential debate between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin was the only time the two will meet face - to - face in this campaign .
Here we gather some of the comments they have made in the past that invited ridicule or incredulity among commentators and the public .
Joe Biden Sarah Palin JOE BIDEN
Joe Biden dropped his first White House bid after plagiarising a speech Asked by CBS presenter Katie Couric on 22 September about plans to rescue the US financial system , Mr Biden said : " When the stock market crashed , Franklin D Roosevelt got on the television and did n't just talk about the , you know , princes of greed .
He said , ' Look , here 's what happened ' . "
Observers were quick to point out that the US president at the time of the 1929 stock market crash was Herbert Hoover and that there were no TV sets yet in American homes .
FDR did speak to the nation on radio in a " fireside chat " when he took office in 1933 .
In February 2007 , Mr Biden commented on Mr Obama - at that point a rival for the Democratic nomination - saying : " I mean , you got the first mainstream African - American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy , I mean , that 's a storybook , man . "
Responding to a voter who disliked Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire last month , Mr Biden said : " Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice - president of the United States of America ...
She 's easily qualified to be vice - president of the United States of America and , quite frankly , it might have been a better pick than me , but she is first - rate . "
of the United States of America ...
She 's easily qualified to be vice - president of the United States of America and , quite frankly , it might have been a better pick than me , but she is first - rate . "
In 2006 , Mr Biden faced criticism over a video clip of him saying : " You can not go to a 7 - Eleven or a Dunkin ' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent .
I 'm not joking . "
His office later said he admired the growing Indian - American community in the state of Delaware and was talking about how new families were benefiting the local economy by taking over small businesses .

His office later said he admired the growing Indian - American community in the state of Delaware and was talking about how new families were benefiting the local economy by taking over small businesses .
Arguably his most famous blunder came during Mr Biden 's first run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1987 , when he plagiarised without attribution a speech UK Labour leader Neil Kinnock had given a few months earlier .
He lost credibility and his campaign imploded .
SARAH PALIN Sarah Palin 's performance in TV interviews has been criticised Asked repeatedly in a TV interview by CBS 's Katie Couric to give examples of John McCain supporting financial regulation , Mrs Palin eventually said : " I 'll try to find some and bring them to you . "
. "
In the same CBS interview , Mrs Palin was asked how Alaska 's proximity to Russia boosted her foreign policy credentials .
She replied : " We have trade missions back and forth , we do .
It 's very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia .
As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America , where do they go ?
It 's Alaska .
It 's just right over the border .
It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there , they are right next to our state . "
It 's just right over the border .
It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there , they are right next to our state . "
When asked why she was not more accessible to reporters , amid complaints from the media that the McCain campaign was keeping her under wraps , Mrs Palin said : " I am so happy to talk to reporters .
My life is an open book , happy to do it and very happy for more opportunities to do so . "
.
My life is an open book , happy to do it and very happy for more opportunities to do so . "
Before she became the vice - president nominee , when asked in an interview for CNBC in July about that possibility Mrs Palin said : " As for that VP talk all the time , I 'll tell you , I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day ? "
? " Speaking to graduating students at her former Wasilla Assembly of God Church in June , Mrs Palin suggested a natural gas pipeline project had divine backing .
" I can do my part in doing things like working really , really hard to get a natural gas pipeline , about a $ 30 bn project that 's going to create a lot of jobs for Alaskans and we 'll have a lot of energy flowing through here .
And pray about that also .
I think God 's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas pipeline built , so pray for that . "

Rove projects that Obama would get at least 273 electoral votes if the election were today .
Obama clinches on Rove map
With 30 days until Nov. 4 , Karl Rove projects that Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) would get at least 273 electoral votes – three more than are needed to win – if the presidential election were held today .
But Rove warns that this race is “ susceptible to rapid changes , ” so no definite prediction is possible .
Advertisement
The remarkable forecast from the architect of the last two nationwide political victories underscores the straits that have rapidly enveloped Sen.
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) as the banking and credit crisis spread .
Rove writes on Rove.com : “ 39 new state polls released in the first three days of October have given Barack Obama his first lead over the magic number of 270 since mid-July .
Minnesota ( 10 EV ) and New Hampshire ( 4 EV ) both moved from toss - up to Obama , giving him 273 electoral votes to McCain ’s 163 , with 102 votes remaining as a toss - up .
“ If the election were held today , Obama would win every state John Kerry won in 2004 , while adding New Mexico ( 5 EV ) , Iowa ( 7 EV ) , and Colorado ( 9 EV ) to his coalition .
Remember , though , that these state polls are a lagging indicator and most do not include any surveying done after the vice - presidential debate on Thursday night . ”
Rove cautioned on “ Fox News Sunday ” : “ Remember , the campaign ebbs and flows .
What we 're seeing here is a result of the focus of the American people , voters , on the economic problems that have dominated the news the last several weeks .
What 's happened then is a shift to Obama .
“ Just remember , 17 days ago in the electoral college , McCain led 227 to 216 .
Fifteen days ago , on the eve of the news on the bailout , he led 216 - 215 .
This race is susceptible to rapid changes and we 're likely to see , in the remaining four weeks , more changes . ”
On “ Meet the Press ” on Sunday , NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd said Obama is still one state away from solidifying the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House .
Colorado , Virginia or Florida would put it away for Obama if the election were held today , Todd said .
“ Even if it ’s Nevada [ making the total ] 269 , it sends it to the House , where Democrats have an advantage , ” Todd said .
“ As it stands today , John McCain would have to run the table .
Now , good news for him :
They ’re all states that voted Republican four years ago .
“ However , he ’s behind right now a little bit in Ohio .
There ’s a dispute of who ’s ahead or who ’s behind in Florida but it feel as if Obama ’s a little bit ahead in Florida .
Obama ’s a little bit ahead in Colorado .
And it ’s a dead even race in Virginia .
Dead even in Nevada .
And even Missouri , which we almost put in tossup this week , is getting very close , where McCain just has a very narrow lead . ”
Todd said a landslide could be 364 electoral votes – “ the high - water mark . ”
In 1980 , Ronald Reagan got 489 .
In 1988 , George H.W. Bush got 426 .
“ The McCain folks now have to hold everything … to keep this thing competitive , ” Todd said .
Mike Murphy , a Republican strategist who was the architect of McCain ’s 2000 campaign said on “ Meet the Press ” : “ It ’s McCain ’s barn that ’s on fire . …
Thirty days out , I think McCain can win .
But the fact is , [ if the ] election were held today , he ’d lose .
And I think he ’s on a losing path .
“ I think the McCain campaign has to look in the mirror now and decide , do we need to change up the strategy ?
They ’ve been running the grinding campaign on Obama .
There ’s a lot of good things to attack Obama about – people have a lot of doubts about Obama .
But they ’ve got to fix McCain .
McCain has to connect with voters on the economy .
He ’s got to get ticket - splitters .
Get out of base Republican issues and get people who are worried about the economy and health care over .
Or in this anti-Republican environment , this trend line is very , very bad . ”
Appearing with Murphy , Democratic consultant Paul Begala , who helped mastermind Bill Clinton ’s 1992 win , said he had talked to the Obama high command .
“ They ’re flooding the zone , ” Begala said .
“ They ’re going into places where Democrats used to never dare go .
Indiana !
I cannot believe we ’re sitting here 30 days before an election , talking about Indiana , a potential tossup state .
Or North Carolina and Virginia .
“ Barack Obama would be the first non-Southerner from my party to carry a Southern state since JFK – before I was born , before Barack was born .
This is an incredible map . ”
* Illustration : Stephen Doyle * Driving down a New Jersey highway three years ago , Tom Vanderbilt decided to stop being a goody - goody .
He fought the urge to merge at the first indication that his lane was ending and rode it right to the pinch point , wedging his way in front of a furious driver at the last second .
Racked with moral misgivings , he eventually looked into the science of merging and discovered salvation in high math , which proves he made the right choice — and not just for his own time - saving benefit , but for humankind ( or at least commuter - kind — the seemingly selfish strategy keeps traffic moving faster for all ) .
" It does n't have to be an ethics problem , " Vanderbilt says .
" It 's really a system - optimization issue . "
That 's when he decided to write Traffic : Why We Drive the Way We Do ( And What It Says About Us ) .
As part of his research , Vanderbilt set up Google Alerts to notify him about traffic - related news .
" Half were about road traffic , and half were about Internet traffic , " he says .
Unfortunately , drivers have a major disadvantage relative to data packets flowing across the Web : Humans think too much .
Packets go where they 're told rather than relying on the scraps of incomplete intelligence and " superstition , " as Vanderbilt calls it , that humans use when choosing how to get from point A to point B .
Drivers make shortsighted decisions based on limited information — a combination of what they can see and traffic reports that , even at their most sophisticated , are an average of 3.7 minutes old .
At 60 mph , that 's a 4 - mile blind spot .
" The fundamental problem , " Vanderbilt says , " is that you 've got drivers who make user - optimal rather than system - optimal decisions " — a classic case of Nash equilibrium , in which each participant , based on what they believe to be others ' strategies , sees no benefit in changing their own .
Those who seek a more efficient traffic solution use not only network topology and queuing theory but psychology and game theory , too .
A typical puzzle : Waiting for an on -ramp metering light — a mild and remarkably effective congestion - control measure — has been proven to rankle drivers more than merging directly into a traffic jam .
" What bothers people is that they can see traffic flowing smoothly , " Vanderbilt says .
" So they think , ' Why should I wait ? '
They tend not to accept that the traffic is flowing smoothly precisely because of the metering light . "
What about faster , better traffic info ?
One new technology , Dash Navigation 's GPS - based social networking system , may be a step toward dynamic traffic routing , but only for those who have Dash 's device , and maybe only temporarily .
Suppose Dash were to become the hit its backers — including VC firms Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers — hope it will .
As soon as drivers have all the information about which routes are congested , they 'll divert to others that are clear .
But if enough people do this at roughly the same time , the clear routes become jammed .
Vanderbilt laments this as the inevitable " death of the shortcut . "

Oceans are ' too noisy ' for whales
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Noise from oil exploration is implicated in the plight of gray whales near Sakhalin
Levels of noise in the world 's oceans are causing serious problems for whales , dolphins and other marine mammals , a report warns .
The International Fund for Animal Welfare ( Ifaw ) says undersea noise blocks animals ' communication and disrupts feeding .
Naval sonar has been implicated in the mass deaths of some cetaceans .
In some regions , the level of ocean noise is doubling each decade , and Ifaw says protective measures are failing .
" Humanity is literally drowning out marine mammals , " said Robbie Marsland , UK director of Ifaw .
" While nobody knows the precise consequences for specific animals , unless the international community takes preventive measures we are likely to discover only too late the terrible damage we 're causing . "
In its global assessment of cetacean species , released last month , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) concluded that ocean noise posed a significant threat .
Across the spectrum
Whales and dolphins use sound in ways that are clearly important to their survival , though not completely understood .
Baleen whales , such as blue and humpback whales , produce low frequency calls that can travel thousands of kilometres through water .
Dolphins and toothed whales generate higher frequency clicks used to locate prey .
Noise generated by ships ' engines and propellers , and by seismic airguns used in oil and gas exploration , produce a range of frequencies that can interfere with both these groups of species , Ifaw concludes .
Its report - Ocean Noise : Turn it down - cites research showing that the effective range of blue whales ' calls is only about one - tenth of what it was before the era of engine - driven commercial shipping .
Movements of large ships on the open ocean are largely unrestricted
It also notes that high - energy military sonar systems have driven the mass strandings and deaths of beaked whales .
The sonar is thought to disrupt the animals ' diving behaviour so much that they suffer a condition rather like " the bends " which human divers can contract if they surface too quickly .
Pressure from conservation groups has led to restrictions on the use of sonar by the US Navy .
In some places , companies involved in oil and gas exploration limit their use of seismic airguns .
But Ifaw argues these restrictions are not enough .
The use of high - energy sonar and seismic airguns should be completely prohibited in sensitive areas , it says .
National legislation , such as the UK's Marine Bill , should comprehensively restrict the exposure of cetaceans to noise .
The UK branch of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) has sounded alarm bells recently over oil and gas exploration in the Moray Firth , home to a small population of bottlenose dolphins .
The Ifaw report is not the first to raise the threat posed by ocean noise , and it will not be the last .
The problem is that most of the activities causing the problem - commercial shipping , mineral extraction - are part and parcel of the modern , interconnected economy .
A further obstacle to legislation is that much of the noise is generated on the high seas , which are largely unregulated .
Richard .

Sadly not .
What the überbox did contain was 16 smaller boxes " which in turn [ each ] contained ( wrapped in foam so they would n't get broken ) exactly two sheets of A4 paper " :
Yup , so that 's 17 boxes in total to protect 32 pages .

Bush Still Fights House Subpoenas
The Bush administration still is resisting a congressional subpoena seeking testimony from former White House counsel Harriet Miers on the firing of nine federal prosecutors in 2006 , taking the unprecedented executive privilege battle to the U.S. Court of Appeals .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly A three - judge appeals court panel – two Republican judges and one Democrat – granted the White House a stay of a lower - court order that would have required Miers to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday .
The judges set deadlines this week for submitting arguments in the case .
The administration 's continued resistance to permitting the testimony – even in the face of a July 31 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge John Bates , who called the White House position “ entirely unsupported by existing case law ” – shows how President George W. Bush can thwart congressional oversight with delaying tactics .
A parallel situation is developing in Alaska where Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , and her top aides are refusing to cooperate with an independent counsel investigation into allegations that Palin abused her authority in firing the public safety commissioner .
Palin ’s strategy of forcing the state legislature into a subpoena fight follows in the footsteps of the Bush administration resisting congressional oversight investigations into the so - called “ prosecutor - gate ” and other scandals .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Palin ’s Trooper - gate Cover-up . ” ]
The Bush administration won at least a temporary victory on Friday with the appeals court ’s decision to grant the stay .
“ The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the motion for stay , ” the three - judge panel wrote in its decision .
But the three - judge panel cautioned that the temporary stay “ should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion . ”
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Miers and White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten last year , but they were instructed by President Bush to ignore the subpoenas .
Bush claimed that Miers and Bolten were immune from congressional subpoenas , protected by the theory of executive privilege .
The House voted to hold the two officials in contempt of Congress , the first time in 25 years a full chamber of Congress has voted on a contempt - of - Congress citation .
Documents released by the Justice Department last year show that Miers was briefed by department officials about the decision to purge the nine U.S. Attorneys who were deemed insufficiently loyal to Bush and that she was aware of a planned cover story to explain the dismissals .
Judge Bates , a Bush appointee , ruled that the White House ’s legal argument of blanket executive privilege lacked legal precedent and that Miers must comply with the congressional subpoena and invoke executive privilege only on a question - by - question basis .
“ The Executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context , ” Bates wrote in a 93 - page opinion that was seen as a rebuke to the White House .
" In fact , there is Supreme Court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity , ” Bates wrote .
After Bates ’s ruling , White House Counsel Fred Fielding sent a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers requesting a meeting to negotiate possible parameters for the testimony of Miers and Bolten .
However , House counsel Irv Nathan said negotiations with the White House have been " completely useless . "
" We have not found willing partners on the other side of the table , " Nathan said .
" We 're being dunced around here . "
Unable to get Bates to issue a stay of his order , the Justice Department turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Washington , D.C. , Circuit , which is dominated by conservative Republican appointees .
A three - judge panel of the Appeals Court then granted the stay , although putting consideration of arguments on a fast track .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers had scheduled a hearing with Miers on Thursday .

Once Upon a Time ...
There was a place called Shireland .
Nestled 60 miles northwest of Chicago , this theme park was n't there long and its philosophies clashed dramatically with your typical theme park .
But even though it did n't last long , a lot of people still remember it .
Just as much as Shireland owns a special place in the hearts of many people , it is a place fraught with trials , tribulations and enigma .
From its unique persona to its unusual owner , to the fact that most of the buildings still stand today ( even though its doors have been closed since 1991 ) , people still wonder who owns it , why it was built and why it is still there .
This site will try to answer some of those questions .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Companies receiving public money under a U.S. government financial rescue program must use it for lending or they will be violating the law , the powerful chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Friday .
“ Any use of the these funds for any purpose other than lending -- for bonuses , for severance pay , for dividends , for acquisitions of other institutions , etc. -- is a violation of the terms of the act , ” Rep. Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat , said in a statement .
Frank was referring to a $ 700 billion financial rescue law passed by Congress earlier this month .
The Treasury Department plans to use $ 250 billion of that amount to inject capital into financial institutions to unfreeze credit markets and restore lending .
A growing number of Democratic lawmakers have demanded more restrictions on banks receiving government money .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson must make it “ absolutely clear ” to a participating bank that the federal government will insist on compliance , Frank said .
Frank later told CNBC television on Friday that if banks do not honor the “ principle ” of using the funds to increase lending , Congress could fail to authorize the final $ 350 billion of the rescue plan .
The Treasury Department had no immediate comment .
Addressing lawmakers ’ questions last week , Neel Kashkari , the Treasury ’s interim manager for the rescue program , said the final purchase agreements between the Treasury and individual banks will have specific language on lending .
But he did not rule out the possibility of the capital injections being partly used to encourage acquisitions , saying that if a stronger bank acquires a weaker bank that has not been in a position to lend , the community is better served .
“ We want our banks to lend , ” Kashkari said during the Senate Banking Committee hearing last week .
“ But we also did n’t want to be in a position of micromanaging on this . ”
NO STRINGS ATTACHED
A “ no strings attached ” policy by the government would be smart , because it allows banks to operate in areas they have the most expertise , one banking analyst said .
“ I just do n’t think the public gets it , and certainly Congress does n’t get it , ” said Anton Schutz , president of money managers Mendon Capital Advisors Corp in Rochester , New York .
For example , a bank that receives $ 25 billion through the bailout program could buy $ 250 billion in asset - backed securities from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , Schutz said .
“ That lending may not be direct , it may be in purchasing securities , but that ’s helping to unfreeze the market , ” he said .
“ You got to let those companies do what is economically sound . ”
Under the Treasury Department program , the first $ 125 billion went to nine large U.S. banks , and the remaining $ 125 billion will be injected into community and regional banks .
In exchange for fresh capital , banks must give preferred shares to the government .
The program also includes some restrictions on executive compensation and forbids banks from raising dividends and or making stock repurchases .
In recent days , some lawmakers have pressed the Treasury Department to attach more conditions , including a ban on all dividends and restrictions on the type of lending allowed .
Such conditions could be imposed through administrative guidelines and bank regulators could restrict banks ’ activities if they do n’t follow them .
A group of Democratic senators , including Charles Schumer of New York , last week asked the Treasury Department to issue guidelines on the type and amount of lending that participating banks must execute , and the level of oversight needed for their executives ’ compensation .
The Bank of New York Mellon BK.N said it is abiding by the government 's conditions .
“ We are using the $ 3 billion ( injection ) to provide liquidity to the credit markets , ” spokesman Kevin Heine said .
“ Our clients are primarily institutions , and we provide short - term funding to them .
We will not use the $ 3 billion to pay dividends or bonuses . ”
PNC Financial PNC.N said last week that it would buy National City Corp NCC.N , the ailing Cleveland lender , with help from a $ 7.7 billion government capital infusion .
Other recipients of federal capital have remained silent on how they will use the money .
Goldman Sachs GS.N , which received $ 10 billion from the government , declined to disclose its plans for the capital .
Bank of America BAC.N , JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and Merrill Lynch MER.N declined to comment .
A White House spokesman said on Friday that banks receiving capital injections should not use that money “ to increase dividends or pay dividends . ”
One day earlier , a Bush administration official criticized calls to ban any dividend payments by participating banks .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said such a move would discourage participation in the capital program , jeopardizing its chance to unfreeze credit markets , or would send investors fleeing to other companies that could still pay dividends , thus making the banks even weaker .
Expect a lot more of this kind of news .
Star Tribune : Hedge fund manager Whitebox Advisors wo n't let customers cash out , according to a national publication that follows the lightly regulated industry that manages money for affluent individuals and institutions .
The Minneapolis firm , which runs about $ 4 billion in investor assets through several funds and strategies , is drafting a letter to investors that explains recent investment losses and constraints and the terms under which investors may redeem some of their money , according to the Oct. 22 edition of Hedge Fund Alert .
The publication , which circulates among investment managers , said Goldman Sachs put Whitebox in a box earlier this month by requiring that the firm double the amount of collateral it puts up against margin loans used to trade convertible bonds .
That puts Whitebox in a temporary squeeze because it must put up more of its own capital and devalued holdings against its margin accounts , which are trading accounts that use borrowed money in part to invest .
...[ Whitebox 's CEO ] delivered double - digit returns for clients in related funds last year .
Hedge Fund Alert said two of Whitebox 's flagship funds are in negative territory so far this year .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - Several companies tried to climb aboard the Securities and Exchange Commission 's short selling lifeboat on Friday .
Some of them may succeed .
Under pressure from Wall Street executives , the SEC temporarily banned short selling of roughly 800 financial - services stocks on Friday to try to halt a market meltdown .
See full story .
Companies omitted include General Electric Co. GE , - 1.29 % , American Express AXP , - 1.08 % , Capital One COF , - 1.23 % , and CIT Group CIT , - 3.03 % , which all have huge financial - services businesses .
For GE , financial services make up about 45 % of its overall business .
A person familiar with the situation said the company has talked to the SEC about possibly being included on the list .
American Express , one of the largest credit card companies , said it was just beginning to look into the possibility of being added .
CIT Group , a leading commercial lender in the U.S. , " made a formal request to be added to the list , " spokesman Curtis Ritter said in an email to MarketWatch .
A Capital One spokesman did n't return a phone message left seeking comment on Friday afternoon .
Guaranty Financial Group Inc. ( Ticker : GFG ) said Friday that it should be added to the list too .
Guaranty said it is the second largest publicly - traded financial institution holding company headquartered in Texas and one of the 50 largest publicly - traded financial institution holding companies based in the U.S. ranked by asset size .
The SEC said it 's willing to consider adding " comparable financial companies as appropriate . "
" The Commission 's order identifies banks , insurance companies and securities firms representing financial institutions whose securities are subject to sudden and excessive price fluctuation that threaten fair and orderly markets , " the regulator said in a statement that was emailed to MarketWatch .
" The Commission used the standard industrial classification codes to identify these institutions . "
Complex analysis is one of the most rich and amazing areas of mathematics , for the complex numbers possess geometric properties that intertwine with their analytic properties in surprising and beautiful ways .
This is hardly a place to discuss the subject in detail , so I will focus on Rouché ’s Theorem , with an entertaining application .
Rouché ’s Theorem
If is an open disc in , and and are complex - valued differentiable functions defined in some neighborhood of , and if on the boundary of , then and have the same number of zeros inside , up to multiplicity .
By “ multiplicity ” here we mean the following : is a zero of multiplicity 1 of if but , and a zero of multiplicity two if but , etc .
The Wikipedia article on this theorem has an interesting informal summary : “ If a person were to walk a dog on a leash around and around a tree , and the length of the leash is less than the radius of the tree , then the person and the dog go around the tree an equal number of times . ”
A little bit of an oversimplification perhaps , but an alluring hint at the deep geometric principles at work in this theorem .
An application :
Proposition : For any , the polynomial is irreducible .
Proof : Let , and let .
Choose to be sufficiently close to that .
Then , when , we have , so and satisfy the conditions of Rouché ’s Theorem , and have the same number of zeros inside the circle around the origin of radius .
Letting , we find that and have the same number of roots inside the circle of radius .
But has exactly one root inside this circle , so , hence must have exactly one root with .
Now , suppose that were a root of with .
Then , so .
So lies on a circle around of radius , as well as on the circle around the origin of radius , so .
Since , has no roots on the unit circle .
Now we are done !
For if over the integers , then the constant terms of and must be .
But these constant terms are the product of some subset of the roots of .
If is a root of , since it is the only root of absolute value less than or equal to one , it follows that must have every single other root of as a root , and the factorization must be trivial .
For anyone interested in studying this subject in greater detail , I highly recommend Functions of One Complex Variable by John B. Conway .

Brad :
It 's probably a good time to launch a preemptive strike against the Rovian propaganda that is sure to come where " Exit Polling " reliability is concerned .
As you 've seen me post here in the past , the only way they can effectively steal the election is to precondition the public to disbelieve exit poll results .
I 'm sure Rove 's got the " Swiftboating Of Exit Polling " set to launch in the popular media in the next couple months , and it seems that predicting their move in advance , and taking steps to make them look stupid when they do it , is better than simply responding ( on the defense ) when they do .
Here 's a flashback :
EXIT POLLS DON’T LIE – GET EDUCATED – ALERT THE MEDIA !
Rove has telegraphed his punch , and now it ’s up to all of us to call BULLSHIT on his BULLSHIT .
Speaking on a recent NPR interview , Rove stated that he actually sees upward of 36 different polls – many of which predict a GOP victory in the coming elections .
He ’s simply lying .
He ’s lying to create a mindset of doubt – in order to better enable the theft of the election through means other than the ballot box .
The GOP has effectively hijacked America .
Bush did not win the election in 2004 .
Exit polls do n’t lie… but Rove does .
Revisit the exit polling data from 2004 and share it with others :
http://en.wikipedia.org/...ontroversy%2C_exit_polls
Call it to the attention of the media .
Let the media know that we WILL NOT TOLERATE another stolen election , nor will we tolerate their complicity in disparaging the validity of Exit Polling as a valuable check against election fraud .
CNN ’s Jeff Greenfield was interviewed about the forthcoming elections , and his parting comment at the end of the segment was what would have appeared to be an off - handed disparaging remark about the reliability of Exit Polls .
Greenfield was / is shilling for Rove – and this was a TALKING POINT ordered up by Rove .
“ Exit Polling ” had not been part of the prior discussion , but was something that he slipped in at the end of the segment – as if ordered to do so .
DON ’T LET THEM SWIFTBOAT “ EXIT POLLING ”
Learn about the company Rove has hired to conduct and report fraudulent exit poll results – which will stand in sharp contrast to all other exit polls :
The GOP has employed a firm called Penn , Schoen , & Berland to skew exit poll results in the past in order to achieve their own political ends .
They are on Rove ’s payroll :

Nasa scientists last night confirmed that there is water on Mars .
The space agency 's Phoenix lander has identified ice in a soil sample analysed by its on - board laboratory .
Previous orbiting missions had beamed data such as the view of the planet 's surface , above .
Others indicated there was ice on the red planet - but Phoenix 's discovery is the first direct evidence .
" I can now say I 'm the first mission to Mars to touch and then taste the water , " came the message from Phoenix 's Twitter feed yesterday .
Nasa has extended the mission until September 30 , adding five weeks to the scheduled 90 days of operations on the surface .
" Phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good , so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on Mars , " said Michael Meyer , chief scientist for the Mars exploration programme at Nasa HQ in Washington .
The soil sample was scraped out of the roughly five - centimetre deep " Snow White " trench on Wednesday .
Two previous attempts to deliver fresh material to the lander 's on - board oven failed when the soil became stuck in the scoop .
This time the scientists exposed most of the material in the sample to the air for two days , so some water vapourised , thus making the soil easier to handle .
The find fulfils one of the Phoenix lander 's two main objectives - to " study the history of water in the Martian arctic " .
The other is to study the potential for life in the ice - soil boundary .
In 2006 , Nasa scientists , using images from the orbiter , Mars Global Surveyor , found evidence of water flowing fleetingly on the surface .
They compared images of the side of a crater taken in 2001 and 2005 .
The second showed gullies apparently caused by water bursting out of the crater wall .

Wait .... Wait Wait ....
Is it just me or did he say that companies only care about making money and then that they were willing to lose money to support " evil " ?
also ... " brainwashing sessions " ?
I 'm sure the employees would be insulted that you think so little of their intelligence .
" alienating " a customer base ?
Would you be saying this if they were teaching they were doing anything you actually AGREE with , Matt ?
What about the customer base they would be alienating if they took on an ANTI - GAY perspective ?
I 'm sure you would n't be standing up for those alienated customers .
Reality and truth on your side ?

" Clearly , the job of the next president is to rebuild the American dream and to restore American leadership in the world , " President Clinton said Wednesday night .

" And here 's what I have to say about that .
Everything I learned in my eight years as president , and in the work I have done since in America and across the globe , has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job . "
The ex-president had been one of the most vocal critics of Obama during the protracted primary season .
Republicans have used the Clintons ' earlier criticism of Obama 's experience in their attacks on the Democratic presidential nominee .
Going into the convention , there were still a lot of questions about whether the Clintons were ready to embrace Obama following the bruising primary battle .
Clinton seemed to change that narrative as he declared his support for Obama .
David Gergen , a CNN senior political analyst who worked in the Clinton administration , said the speech was " the most effective and the most important speech Bill Clinton has delivered since he left the White House . "

Continuing criticism leveled by Clinton and other speakers this week , Biden took to the stage and delivered an assault on Republican policies .
" As we gather here tonight , our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history .
The Bush - McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole , with very few friends to help us climb out , " he said .
Biden rattled off a list of McCain 's positions on issues ranging from taxes to alternative energy , repeatedly saying : " That 's not change -- that 's more of the same . "

Corporal Tomos Stringer was out of uniform when tried to book a room A soldier home on leave after being injured in Afghanistan was refused a room by a hotel when he showed his military ID card at reception .
Corporal Tomos Stringer , 23 , from Gwynedd , was visiting a wounded colleague in Surrey when he was turned away from the Metro Hotel in Woking .
He spent the night in his car after being told it was management policy not to accept military personnel .
The hotel has apologised , describing the incident as " a mistake " .
Cpl Stringer , of 13 Air Assault Support Regiment , The Royal Logistic Corps , has since returned to Afghanistan but his mother , Gaynor Stringer , said he remains angry at the incident .
She said her son broke his wrist after jumping out of his wagon in Afghanistan .
He was treated at a field hospital but was brought back to have it re-set and was on four weeks recovery leave when he decided to visit his friend in June .

Mrs Stringer , who lives at Pentrefelin , near Criccieth , said : " I can't believe this has happened to one of our soldiers in his own country .
He just did n't know how to react .
" We 've been to America and their military get treated like heroes over there .
" I think it 's terrible they [ UK service personnel ] can't even wear their uniform with pride . "
Defence Minister Derek Twigg said : " This case is especially egregious given that the individual concerned was on injury leave from Afghanistan and visiting an injured colleague .
The 23 - year - old had broken his wrist jumping from his army wagon " The government and , it is fair to say , the vast majority of people in this country , hold the professionalism , courage and contribution made by all those who serve , and have served in the armed forces in very high regard .
" I am delighted that the armed forces generally enjoy immense respect and gratitude on the part of the nation and that contrary sentiments are rare , though evidently they exist . "
Caernarfon MP
Hywel Williams said he intended to take the matter further when he had a reply to his letter to the hotel .
He said : " I was astonished when I heard the story from Mrs Stringer .
I can't see why any hotel would want to refuse accommodation to a serving member of the armed forces anyway .
" Tomos was not in his uniform , he was a traveller like anyone else . "
The Metro Hotel is owned by a company called American Amusements Ltd , also based in Woking .
It apologised , describing the incident as " a mistake " ,

Misuse of antibiotics is the leading cause of emerging antimicrobial resistance — a public health crisis in the making .
Inappropriate prescribing practices by health care providers contributes greatly to this problem , but now there is evidence that everyday cleaning and hand - washing may also contribute to the growing trend of antimicrobial resistance .
Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics or antimicrobial products when they develop a way to keep the antibiotic from working .
Bacteria are constantly evolving and , in the presence of inadequate or inappropriate antibiotics , they develop mechanisms to overcome the killing power of the antibiotic .
The ever - increasing presence of resistant bacteria makes protecting the remaining effective antibiotics a public health priority .
Recently , the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy reported that the use of antibacterial consumer and household products might contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance .
Many surface disinfectants contain quaternary ammonium compounds , such as benzalkonium chloride ( BAC ) , as biocides .
The study examined 238 households that used either antibacterial or non-antibacterial cleaning products .
After one year of use , bacteria was isolated from the hands of the household members and tested for susceptibility to several biocides and antibiotics .
The household bacteria did not show significant differences in susceptibility to BAC .
However , bacteria that did show decreased susceptibility to BAC also showed decreased susceptibility to triclosan ( a biocide in many personal hygiene products ) , as well as several antibiotics .
This cross-resistance with antibiotics that are used clinically may prove significant as we explore ways to combat antimicrobial resistance .
While this study reports potential risks associated with common antibacterial products , several studies have explored their benefits .
Surprisingly , no additional health benefit is seen with biocide - containing soaps and cleaners when compared to traditional non-antibacterial products .
Antibacterial consumer health - care products , including soaps and oral products , as well as plastics and textiles , provide no additional protection against common infectious bacteria than traditional hand - hygiene with non-antibacterial soap .
Data is needed to assess whether biocides in consumer products are beneficial to groups at high risk for infections , such as individuals with compromised immune systems .
Many factors contribute to antibiotic resistance , but this new information must be balanced with the need to protect our population from potentially serious infectious diseases .
Hand hygiene alone is the most effective way to reduce the spread of infections .
However , monitoring antimicrobial products and appropriate prescribing practices are paramount in the fight against antibiotic resistance .

KAZAKHSTAN -ONOMICS …. Felix Salmon on our brave new world :
The “ shadow banking system ” is now so big and so global that for all we know a series of bad decisions by a mid-level technocrat in Kazakhstan could precipitate cataclysm across America and the world .
That ’s true , but only if the financial system is fundamentally unbalanced to begin with — and it ’s the job of governments and central banks to regulate the financial system to keep that from happening .
They do n’t regulate in order to produce the results they want , or to prevent people from making money , but to keep the financial system within at least the very broad boundaries of basic stability .
Alternatively , you can let the unfettered market have its way and then clean up the messes afterward .
This is pretty orthodox Republican thinking , shared by Hoover in 1930 , Reagan and Bush during the S&L crisis , and now Alan Greenspan and George Bush during the housing bubble .
This ends up hurting lots of little guys , of course , but the irony is that it ends up hurting lots of big guys too .

Lending remains in a deep freeze as the Libor Dollar Rate Jumps to Highest in Year .
The cost of borrowing in dollars for three months in London soared to the highest level this year as coordinated interest - rate reductions worldwide failed to revive lending among banks for any longer than a day .
Attempts by policy makers to restore confidence to money markets are being stymied by almost daily crises among financial institutions .
Iceland 's government took over the nation 's biggest lender today to keep the country 's banking system working .
American International Group Inc. , the insurer taken over by the U.S. government , may need $ 37.8 billion of extra funds , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday .
" To see little or no reaction in the fixings is very disappointing and reinforces the fact that Libor is broken and the transmission mechanism from central banks is n't working , " said Barry Moran , a currency trader in Dublin at Bank of Ireland , the country 's second - biggest bank .
" Things are still very stressed and we do n't know what 's going to fix it . "
The London interbank offered rate , or Libor , for three - month loans rose to 4.75 percent today , the highest level since Dec. 28 .
The Libor - OIS spread , a measure of cash scarcity , widened to a record .
The overnight rate fell to 5.09 percent , still 359 basis points more than the Fed 's 1.5 percent target rate .
Money - market rates rose today in Hong Kong , Singapore and Japan to the highest levels in at least nine months .
Hong Kong 's three - month interbank offered rate jumped to 4.4 percent , a one - year high .
Singapore 's comparable rate for dollar loans increased to 4.51 percent , the highest level since Jan . 8 .
The Libor - OIS spread , the difference between the three - month dollar Libor and the overnight indexed swap rate , climbed 23 basis points to an all - time high of 348 basis points .
The average was 8 basis points in the 12 months to July 31 , 2007 , before the credit squeeze began .
The difference between what banks and the Treasury pay to borrow money for three months , the so - called TED spread , exceeded 400 basis points for a second day .
TED Spread
Initially , the TED spread was the difference between the interest rate for the three month U.S. Treasuries contract and three month Eurodollars contract as represented by the London Inter Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) .
However , since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dropped the T - bill futures , the TED spread is now calculated as the difference between the three month T - bill interest rate and three month LIBOR .
The TED spread is a measure of liquidity and shows the degree to which banks are willing to lend money to one another .
The TED spread can be used as an indicator of credit risk .
This is because U.S. T - bills are considered risk free while the LIBOR rate reflects the credit risk of lending to commercial banks .
As the TED spread increases , the risk of default ( also known as counterparty risk ) is considered to be increasing , and investors will have a preference for safe investments .
ECB Steps Up ' Fight '
The European Central Bank brought forward plans to lend banks unlimited cash and pumped a record $ 100 billion in overnight funds into the financial system after an interest - rate cut failed to soothe tensions in money markets .
The " ECB looks keen to take up the fight , " said Christoph Rieger , a fixed - income strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt .
" After cutting borrowing costs , the last thing central banks want is for market rates to remain steady or , even worse , rise further . "
Commercial banks are refusing to lend to each other after the U.S. housing slump caused the collapse of New York - based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .
That 's pushed market interest rates to records even as the ECB and other central banks injected billions of euros and dollars into the banking system .
Why Should Banks Lend To Each Other ?

As part of the TARP passed by Congress , the Fed is paying interest on reserves .
Fed To Pay Interest On Deposits ; Considers Unsecured Funding
The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that it will begin to pay interest on depository institutions ' required and excess reserve balances .
The interest rate paid on required reserve balances will be the average targeted federal funds rate established by the Federal Open Market Committee over each reserve maintenance period less 10 basis points .
Paying interest on required reserve balances should essentially eliminate the opportunity cost of holding required reserves , promoting efficiency in the banking sector .
The rate paid on excess balances will be set initially as the lowest targeted federal funds rate for each reserve maintenance period less 75 basis points .
Paying interest on excess balances should help to establish a lower bound on the federal funds rate .

The only cure is to eliminate the Fed , abolish fractional reserve lending , and put in place a sound monetary system backed by gold .
The next version of IDA will be released with a bochs debugger plugin , and what is nice about it is that you will be able to use it easily by just downloading bochs executables and telling IDA where to find them .
IDA ’s bochs debugger is a plugin that allows you to use bochs ’ emulation / debugger inside IDA ’s interface and makes your debugging experience easier .
The plugin will come with three of the what we dubbed as “ bochs loaders ” , so here is a brief explanation :
The first loader , disk image loader , is probably the most simple but yet the most powerful one .
It allows you to debug any bochs image of your choice .
For example , you could debug boot sector , 16 bit code , and perhaps debug 32 bit code all in the same debugging session .
We actually use this bochs loader to debug other bochs loaders !
The second , idb loader , is a 32 bit mode loader that allow you to debug anything within the database .
The database will be your input file , thus whatever segments exist in the database , will be loaded and mapped into bochs ’ virtual memory .
The idb loader understands and catches raw cpu exceptions and allows you to specify the startup stack segment ’s size .
Finally comes the pe loader , which is a specialized bochs loader , that will read your PE file and create a virtual environment similar to windows environment , trying to mimic basic demands for a PE file ( import resolution , SEH , api emulation backed by IDC scripts ) .

President Dmitry Medvedev has declared that Russia formally recognises the independence of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Mr Medvedev told the BBC Russia had tried to preserve Georgian unity for 17 years , but that the situation had changed after this month 's violence .
He said Moscow now felt obliged to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as other countries had done with Kosovo .
Georgia said Russia was seeking to " change Europe 's borders by force " .
In a televised address on Monday evening , President Mikhail Saakashvili said the declaration was completely illegal and vowed to begin a " peaceful struggle " to restore Georgia 's territorial integrity .
Russia has made an extraordinary strategic mistake and has badly damaged its place in modern international relations
Mikhail Saakashvili
Georgian President
Foreign reaction in quotes UK urges Russia to ' abide by law ' Q&A : Conflict in Georgia Earlier , the US and France called the Russian move regrettable , while the UK said it categorically rejected it .
Nato said the declaration violated numerous UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself had endorsed .
However the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which have had de facto independence since the early 1990s , thanked Russia .
Fighting between Russia and Georgia began on 7 August after the Georgian military tried to retake South Ossetia by force .
Russian forces subsequently launched a counter - attack and the conflict ended with the ejection of Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia and an EU - brokered ceasefire .
' No easy choice '
In an announcement on Russian state television , President Medvedev said he had signed a decree to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states .
He instructed the Russian foreign ministry to open negotiations on formal diplomatic relations with the two regions and called on other states to follow his country 's example .
Mr Medvedev said he had " taken into account the expression of free will by the Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples " and accused Georgia of failing over many years to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the problem .
Many South Ossetians feel closer to Russia than Georgia " That was no easy choice to make , but it is the sole chance of saving people 's lives , " he added .
The move followed votes in both houses of parliament on Monday , which called on Moscow to recognise the regions ' independence .
In an interview with the BBC at his residency in Sochi , on the border with Abkhazia , Mr Medvedev later said Russia had been obliged to act following a " genocide " started by his Georgian counterpart against separatists in South Ossetia .
The president compared Russia 's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to the West 's recognition of Kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 .
He also denied that Russia had breached the ceasefire agreement with Georgia , saying pursuing the security of the two regions included addressing their status .
" The most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible , because most of them they are Russian citizens , " he said .
" So we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent . "
Mr Medvedev said relations with the West were deteriorating sharply and that a new Cold War could not be excluded , but that Russia did not want one .
" There are no winners in a Cold War , " he said .
Violation Later , Georgia 's President Saakashvili accused Russia of trying to " break the Georgian state , undermine the fundamental values of Georgia and to wipe Georgia from the map " .
" Today 's step by Russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis , neither for Georgia nor for the rest of the world , " he said .
" Russia has made an extraordinary strategic mistake and has badly damaged its place in modern international relations . "
SOUTH OSSETIA & ABKHAZIA South Ossetia Population : About 70,000 ( before recent conflict ) Capital : Tskhinvali President : Eduard Kokoity Abkhazia Population : About 250,000 ( 2003 ) Capital : Sukhumi President : Sergei Bagapsh
Profile : South Ossetia Profile : Abkhazia Mr Saakashvili described the declaration as " the first attempt in Europe after Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union to ... change the borders of Europe by force " .
Western countries , including the US , Germany , the UK and France also condemned Russia 's move .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , speaking from the West Bank city of Ramallah , said the decision was " regrettable " .
" Since the United States is a permanent member of the Security Council this simply will be dead on arrival in the Security Council , " she said .
Late on Monday , the US state department had warned that recognition of the two provinces ' independence would be " a violation of Georgian territorial integrity " and " inconsistent with international law " .
In a statement , it said President George W Bush had called on Russia 's leadership to " meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions " .
In the two breakaway regions , however , Moscow 's move was warmly welcomed .
The leader of South Ossetia 's separatist government , Eduard Kokoity , said he would ask Moscow to set up a military base on his territory .
In the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali there were scenes of jubilation while residents in Abkhazia took to the streets to celebrate the news , firing into the air .
" We feel happy , " said Aida Gabaz , a 38 - year - old lawyer in the Abkhaz capital Sukhumi .
" We all have tears in our eyes .
We feel pride for our people . "
' New understanding ' Earlier on Tuesday , Russia cancelled a visit by Nato 's secretary general , one of a series of measures to suspend co-operation with the military alliance .
In Abkhazia , hundreds danced and embraced near a government building Russia 's ambassador to Nato said the trip would be delayed until relations between the two were clarified .
Dmitry Rogozin said a " new understanding " needed to be reached between Russia and Nato .
The BBC's Humphrey Hawksley , in Moscow , says the recognition is bound to dramatically heighten tensions in Russia 's already fragile relationship with the West .
He says this and a series of other announcements indicate that Russia is preparing itself for a showdown .
Although most of Russia 's forces pulled out of the rest of Georgia last Friday , it is maintaining a presence both within the two rebel regions and in buffer zones imposed round their boundaries .
Port control Some Russian troops also continue to operate near the Black Sea port of Poti , south of Abkhazia , where Russia says it will carry out regular inspections of cargo .
HAVE YOUR SAY Russia is right to recognise South Ossetia and guarantee its security Branco , Bulgaria The US said on Tuesday that its warships would deliver aid to Georgia 's port of Poti , which is under Russian control .
The move could mean US and Russian forces coming face to face .
Earlier , the head of European security organisation , the OSCE , Alexander Stubb , accused Russia of trying to empty South Ossetia of Georgians .
Speaking to the BBC's Europe Today programme , he said : " They are clearly trying to empty southern Ossetia from Georgians , which I do n't think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations " .
At a checkpoint in South Ossetia , the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse said a South Ossetian commander said many Georgian civilians had already left of their own accord , because they were scared of the guns .

Hi everybody , Michael Shorrock , here .
I ’m the Director of Publisher Relations here at SCEA .
I work closely with all of the publishers and developers who create games for all PlayStation platforms .
While SCEA had a ton of great announcements at E3 , I ’m excited to say , we have one more for today , one that I know a lot of you have been asking about :
For the past several months , we have been working closely with Neversoft and Activision , Harmonix and Konami to ensure that PlayStation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility .
For the most part , this means that the titles with musical peripherals will work with the other ’s software .
A few specific examples include : Guitar Hero : World Tour ’s guitars and drums will work with Rock Band 2 and Konami ’s Rock Revolution software .
And yes , you guessed it , Rock Band 2 ’s guitar and drum set will work with Guitar Hero : World Tour and with Rock Revolution .
Conversely , Rock Revolution ’s drum set will work with both Guitar Hero : World Tour and Rock Band 2 .
In addition , Guitar Hero : World Tour and Rock Band 2 will both support the SingStar microphones .
We ’re still working hard to ensure compatibility between the Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles currently on the market , and we hope to have an announcement on that shortly .
Of course each of these great games have their own specific cool features that may not be compatible with the other controllers , but this is our first big step in bringing a level of compatibility to music games that is sure to benefit PlayStation 3 consumers .
Keep an eye out here for more information in the future .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
One of the original and largest money market funds has put a seven - day freeze on investor redemptions after the net asset value of its shares fell below $ 1 , in a rare instance in the fund industry of what is called " breaking the buck . "
Primary Fund RFIXX , managed by New York - based money market fund inventor The Reserve , said late Tuesday that its $ 785 million holding of Lehman Brothers Holdings debt has been valued at zero .
As of 4 p.m. , Eastern , the value of the fund 's share was 97 cents .
The Reserve said that redemption requests received before 3 p.m. will be paid out at $ 1 a share .
The company said Primary Fund will continue to accept new money .
While Primary Fund 's Lehman holding was small compared to the fund 's overall size , the fact that it froze redemptions reflects a surge in redemption requests by investors .
The size and speed of the withdrawals was stunning .
At 3 p.m. on Tuesday , Primary Fund 's assets stood at $ 23 billion , a $ 40 billion hit from the $ 62.6 billion in the fund on Friday , a spokeswoman for The Reserve told MarketWatch late Tuesday .
" Effective today and until further notice , the proceeds of redemptions from The Primary Fund will not be transmitted to the redeeming investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the redemption , " The Reserve said in a prepared statement .
Retail account holders affected
Reserve Primary has both institutional and retail accounts .
" This appears to be the first case where a retail investor will lose money in a money market fund . " said Peter Crane , president of market research firm Crane Data in Westborough , Mass. , though he called the situation " an anomaly . "
Money market funds pride themselves on their liquidity and the safety of their investments .
All money market shares are priced at $ 1 -- a figure so important to the industry that fund companies take losses to keep the share price from dipping below $ 1 , which is known as breaking the buck .
" They did n't just break the buck , they shattered it , " said Don Phillips , managing director at investment research firm Morningstar Inc. MORN , +0.43 % , about The Reserve fund .
This is only the second time that a money market fund 's net asset value has dipped below $ 1 .
In 1994 , Denver - based Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund returned 96 cents on the dollar to investors when bad derivatives investments forced it to liquidate .
Phillips said the fact that The Reserve had to break the buck reflects the seriousness of its troubles .
" People say that if you break the buck on a money market fund you 're saying that you do n't want to be in the money market business anymore . "
Phillips speculated that because The Reserve is solely a money market shop , it did n't have the resources to bail out Primary Fund in the way a diversified mutual - fund giant such as Fidelity Investments , Vanguard Group or Evergreen Investments , which is owned by Wachovia Corp .
WB , - 3.74 % , would be able .
Fidelity , other money fund giants reassure investors
Some of the largest money - market fund providers sought to calm investors in the wake of The Reserve 's announcement .
Fidelity Investments said that its money market funds are sound .
" We can state unequivocally that Fidelity 's money market funds and accounts continue to provide security and safety for our customers ' cash investments , " said Anne Crowley , spokeswoman , in an email response .
She added : " We have been proactive in keeping our money market funds safe and in protecting the $ 1 net asset value , which has always been our number one objective in managing these funds . "
Fidelity 's taxable , general purpose money market funds have no exposure to any Lehman Brothers entity , Crowley said .
The taxable money market funds do have " modest " exposure to two issuers that are subsidiaries of troubled American International Group AIG , - 1.23 % , she noted .
" Fidelity is confident that these holdings will pay full principal at maturity , " she said .
Vanguard Group also issued a statement reaffirming the integrity of its money funds .
" We are confident in the stability of Vanguard 's money market funds , " spokesman John Woerth said in an email .
" Our largest money market fund is Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund VMRXX , VMMXX , , which currently holds more than half of its assets in Treasury and agency securities .
In addition , Prime Money Market Fund and our other money market funds have no exposure to money market instruments issued by securities dealers , including distressed issuers like Lehman and AIG . "
At Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , - 2.35 % , a spokesman also noted that its money market funds are secure .
" None of the Wells Fargo Advantage Money Market Funds hold securities issued by or guaranteed by Lehman Brothers or American International Group .
The value of our money market funds continues to remain stable and the net asset value of the funds remains at $ 1 a share , " he said in an email reply .
A spokesman for brokerage giant Charles Schwab & Co. SCHW , - 1.16 % said the company " does not own any Lehman securities in the Schwab Money Funds . "
On Monday , Wachovia said it would pump money into three Evergreen money market funds .
Evergreen would not disclose how much is being put into the funds .
While money market funds are supposed to be liquid , they are permitted by law to postpone payment of redemptions by up to seven days .
Any further delays would require regulatory approval , however .
The Reserve was founded in 1970 by Bruce Bent , and launched the first money market fund soon after .
As of Friday , the company had $ 127 billion in assets under management , according to a spokeswoman .
The size of the money market fund industry is about $ 3.5 trillion , according to iMoneyNet .
Federated Investors FII , - 1.75 % , which has about $ 270 billion in money market fund assets , declined all comment for this story , including whether the Reserve 's troubles or fears surrounding Lehman debt had affected its own funds .
BlackRock Inc. BLK , - 0.68 % sent a letter to its money market shareholders on Monday telling them that its funds had no Lehman debt .
" We do not have any holdings of Lehman Brothers paper , nor is Lehman a counterparty to any repurchase agreements in our 2a - 7 registered money market funds , " noted Simon Mendelson , managing director in BlackRock 's COO global cash management group .
The credit crisis has put pressure on money market funds , several of which have had to take steps to prop up their funds as the value of their holdings -- which frequently included mortgage - backed securities -- has declined .
According to money Crane Data , 20 fund companies in the past 13 months have had to pour their own money into their funds to prevent them from breaking the buck .
WASHINGTON , Oct 24 ( Reuters ) - Deliberations in the corruption trial of Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens were suspended on Friday so a juror could attend a relative ’s funeral , a setback that is likely to push the verdict even closer to the Nov. 4 elections that will decide the powerful senator ’s future .
Judge Emmet Sullivan dismissed the jury for the weekend and said he would decide on Sunday whether they will convene on Monday or later in the week .
“ Everyone needs a day off every now and then , ” Sullivan told the jury .
Stevens , a Republican who has served in the Senate for 40 years , was a popular figure in Alaska before the trial but now is locked in a tight reelection battle .
The loss of his seat would help Democrats reach a 60 - seat majority in the 100 - seat chamber , enough to overcome potential Republican roadblocks .
Stevens , 84 , is charged with lying on Senate disclosure forms to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars in home renovations and other gifts from the Alaska oil services company VECO Corp .
Stevens ’ lawyers say he and his wife thought they had paid for the renovations .
As one of the Senate ’s most senior members , Stevens has had major influence over how U.S. taxpayer money is spent .
He is the first sitting senator to go on trial in 27 years , since New Jersey Democrat Harrison Williams was convicted for bribery in 1981 .
The delay is not the first setback faced by the jury , which began deliberations on Wednesday .
On Thursday the jury asked Sullivan to remove one of their fellow jurors from the case because she was engaging in “ violent outbursts . ”
Sullivan did not remove the juror , but on Friday told an alternate juror that she might need to join the jury .

As this comic rerun appears in what is getting towards mid-2020 , it 's almost time for President Allosaurus to start thinking about his re-election campaign , and for opposing candidates to put their appendages up .
I wonder if I can be bothered this year ...
So much for Olympic values .
Did the IOC really think they were n’t going to be called out on this one ?
Blaming the local committees is beyond pathetic .
Rights watchdog Amnesty International , whose website is among those barred in China , condemned Internet restrictions during the Games as “ compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the Olympic values . ”
“ This blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the Games would help improve human rights in China , ” Amnesty East Asia researcher Mark Allison said in a statement .
BOCOG spokesman Sun Weide said censorship would not prevent journalists from reporting on the Games , though he acknowledged there would be no access to some websites , such as those of the Falun Gong , which he described as “ an evil fake religion that has been banned by the Chinese government . ”
ABSTRACT
This website aims to present the results of the ongoing research on a cartographic approach to the representation of knowledge in its present configurations .
The aim of the research is to extend the cartographic metaphor beyond visual analogy , and to expose it as a narrative model and tool to intervene in complex , heterogeneous , dynamic realities , just like those of human geography .
The map , in this context , is not only a passive representation of reality but a tool for the production of meaning .
The map is thus a communication device : a mature representation artefact , aware of its own language and its own rhetoric , equipped with it its own tools , languages , techniques and supports .
A model that recovers the narrative abilities of pre-scientific maps and presents itself not as a mere mimetic artefact , but as a poetic and political tool
The map as narration is thus the expression of a communicative purpose .
Just like a text , the map makes selections on reality , distorts events , classifies and clarifies the world in order to selections better tell a particular aspect of a territory , an event , a space .
When used with malice , it can hide , conceal , falsify or diminish a reality through the construction of an ideological discourse , in which the communicative aims are hidden to the user .
In this context , the term ‘ map ’ is a synonym of visual narration of space : a cultural artefact created by an author to describe a space according to an objective .
The map as a tool appears instead as a means that enables the user to reach an otherwise unattainable goal .
It allows not only to do things better , more efficiently , but also to create new realities .
As an instrument , the map expects a user using it to achieve an end , and similarly a designer , who must ensure that the structure of the instrument is as suited as possible for the achievement of the planned tasks .
IMAGES
The images displayed below are screenshots taken from ATLAS , the application that 's being developed to explore the possibilities of the application of a cartographic metapjor to the realms of knowledge .
The concept of atlas in this context does n’t depict as much a list of maps , but rather a system of representations of space , a communication device aimed at representing complex contexts through the use of many partial overlapping narrations : a network of maps , diagrams , texts and peritexts , combined together to describe the space of research in its multifaceted aspects .
If you need / want to use the images in any context , both in print and digital media , please let us know .
VIDEOS
Here 's a small video trailer of the ATLAS interface .
ATLAS is an interface prototype for the exploration of research resources .
ATLAS lets the user list his bio- bibliographic resources in a shared environment and access them through many different maps and representations .
The interface becomes therefore an Atlas of knowledge cartographies , designed to show a complex environment through the overlapping of different images .

Not to be indelicate ( much less needlessly provocative ) , but I wonder when news is reported about the US election in Vietnam , do they refer to GOP Presidential nominee Sen.
John McCain as ( say … ) " a former terrorist bomber during our war with the US , who killed many innocent women and children from his airplane until he crashed in Hanoi and was captured and held by our forces . "
Now , strong political differences with McCain aside , I do not regard him as any sort of a war criminal … but , seriously , what about that statement could you dispute from a Vietnamese point of view ?
And what does the Senator ’s return from war captivity ( and , frankly , growth from a reckless , playboyish " youth " that lasted into nearly his 40s ) to become an often - crusading , generally reform - minded politician say about the old adage about " second acts " in an American public life ?
Which brings me around to Bill Ayers .
John McCain and ( apparently more so ) Sarah Palin want to paint Ayers as a past " terrorist " against the US…AND then , because of some occasional past neighborhood and charitable / organizational board proximity , they are broad - brushing Sen.
Barack Obama as a guy who " palled around " with a domestic terrorist .
Here ’s my first question :
Are n’t some people in those growingly rabid – but limited – McCain - Palin crowds at least wondering why this " domestic terrorist " ( that they likely have never heard of ) is walking around Chicago ’s Hyde Park a free man ?
Hmm – enquiring minds want to know …
Yes , Ayers was a leading member of the 1960s / ’ 70s student radical group , the Weatherman ( often referred to collectively as " the Weathermen " ; later , they became known as the Weather Underground Organization ) .
This group was named after a Bob Dylan lyric ( " You do n’t need a weatherman to know which way the winds blow " ) and sought – very actively and , at times , violently – to bring an end to the Vietnam War .
During this period , Ayers – and his then future - wife Bernardine Dohrn – were believed to have participated in devising and planting bombs as extreme war protests .
Even though evacuation warnings were regularly issued before these explosions – and it is believed that no one was seriously injured during the bombings that Ayers and Dohrn were involved with – federal charges ( with limited evidence ) were issued against both of them .
Yes , yes , you may be saying – so WHY are n’t they ( or even WEREN ’T they ) in prison ?
Because several years later – while both were " underground " after the more violent escapades ( and even deaths ) of some of their one - time associates – federal charges were dropped over former prosecutorial misconduct ( related to the Nixon - era cranking up of the FBI ’s questionable COINTELPRO infiltration and " dirty tricks " program against any leftish , protest , or suspicious groups ) .
In 1980 , after having two children , Ayers and Dohrn resurfaced and turned themselves in ; later , they also took in imprisoned former counterpart Kathy Boudin ’s son and raised him to adulthood .
So …what of Ayers ’ second act ?
Since the early 1980s , he has done the following : Apologized for and tried to analyze and explain his youthful protests and actions ( although he has not completely rejected his past ) ; worked for and obtained multiple advanced degrees in education ; written several books and many articles on education theory and practice ; worked with Mayor Daley ( that noted cuddler of terrorists ) in successfully and historically reforming the city 's public school system ( including co-authoring a grant proposal that brought in millions for public schools ; he received Chicago ’s " Citizen of the Year " award for this work in 1997 ) ; served on the Board of Directors of an anti-poverty , philanthropic foundation ( this was his most durable contact with fellow board member Obama – some 12 times in two years ) ; became a " Distinguished Professor " in education at the University of Illinois at Chicago ; and , perhaps most notably recently , issued a memoir in 2001 , released just before 9/11 , which resulted in interviews with him that came out right after the tragedies .
The resulting articles from those interviews were notable – and , to many , notorious – because Ayers not only talked about regrets , but also expressed the thought that " We did n’t do enough " during the Weather days – meaning ( he later explained ) that he believed they could have worked harder and in different ways to oppose the war …NOT that he thought they should have done more bombings .
Of course , to those that completely opposed him and his prior actions , the expressed regrets were ignored and the musings about what they could have done during that conflicting , complicated time were interpreted as meaning he wished he had caused more damage or hurt people .
And – as for " Ayers & Obama " ?
Yes , they were fellow charity board members , but also relative neighbors ( in a large , broad neighborhood ) … oh , and in 1995 , Ayers hosted a coffee meeting supporting Obama ’s initial political run…and in 2001 , he made a $ 200 contribution to IL State Sen .
Obama ’s re-election fund .
And that ’s it .
So …not only do McCain supporters and current undecided voters have to decide : A ) Does all this mean that Ayers was / is indeed a domestic terrorist ( or , perhaps rather a protesting youth who took things way too far … but now regrets those actions and has dedicated the majority of his adult life to helping and teaching others ) ? ; B ) Is the limited contact he had with Sen. Obama ( almost nothing beyond perhaps passing each other on the street since 2002 ) anything close to " palling around " ? ; and C ) No matter the answers to A ) and B ) – even if the worst possible answers are assumed ( i.e. , yes , Ayers was a late - ‘60s / early - ‘70s terrorist ; and , yes , he and Obama were " pals " ) – what the hell do those questions have anything to do with Sen. Obama and his qualification to become President ?
… Oh , it ’s a matter of appropriateness and choices , you say ?
As if every act some older acquaintance may have committed WHEN YOU WERE ONLY 8 YEARS OLD should determine your complete opinion of them ?
And …as if no maturing , no rehabilitation , no rededication to " better " causes to perhaps balance out youthful mistakes is ever possible ?
Is that what those at - times frothing McCain - Palin crowds are thinking and feeling ?
Well , then – if so , I guess it ’s a good thing that THEIR man did n’t redirect HIS later years in reformist directions that his earlier , more reckless younger self may have never anticipated or thought important .
Oh , wait …ahh , it gets complicated , does n’t it ?
I suppose we could ask the Vietnamese for their opinions – or perhaps we could all just take a breath ( or two ) and attempt to see through mere solipsistic talking points …

UPDATE 2007 - 09 - 24 : Learn how to have sex with a car !
Jubei on MightyJustice has uploaded some fan art of dragons having sex with cars to a subdirectory on his website .
We ’ve re-uploaded them here in case they get taken down .
( Everything lasts forever on the Internet ! )
The webmaster disowns the images .
From BTW_I_DIDNT_MAKE_THESE.txt :
I did n’t create these epic images , I was merely linked them by a friend and I hosted them on this site so that I could show friends .
I ’m into some weird shit , but I definatly do not affiliate with furries or scalies ( whatever the fuck ) .
Again , these images were merely hosted for lulz .
I definatly wished he used spellcheck .
Furries , in case you ’re wondering , are members of a subculture who enjoy anthropomorphizing animal characters .
While much of the fun of dressing up like wolves or ducks or whatever is limited to innocent cosplay ( “ costume roleplaying ” ) , some furries derive intense sexual pleasure from the experience .
The sexuality experienced by furries is referred to as “ yiff , ” as in “ a yiffy fur ” ( a furry who is aroused or sexually active ) or “ yiffy art ” along the lines of the hot dragon / car action linked above .
The word is supposedly derived from the sounds wolves make while mating .
None of this sociological observation excuses the fact that these people are totally fucking weird and deserve our most virulent contempt .
They must be normalized and assimilated post - haste .

The incident was probably caused by a faulty connection between magnets
The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva will be shut off until spring 2009 while engineers probe a magnet failure .
The incident on 19 September caused a tonne of liquid helium to leak out into the experiment 's 27 km - long tunnel .
Officials said the time required to fully investigate the problem precluded a re-start before the lab 's winter maintenance period .
The collider is built to smash protons together at huge speeds , recreating conditions moments after the Big Bang .
Scientists hope it will shed light on fundamental questions in physics .
" Coming immediately after the very successful start of LHC operation on 10 September , this is undoubtedly a psychological blow , " said Robert Aymar , director - general of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) , in a statement .
But he praised the skill and preparation of the teams involved in building the particle accelerator .
High priority A spokesman for Cern told BBC News it was unclear at this stage when the collider could re-start operations after the lab 's regular winter shut - down - which is partly done to save money on electricity during this period of peak demand .
A number of factors could affect when the lab re-opened , including prolonged cold weather .
Problem thought to have been caused by a quench in the connection between two magnets A stretch of cabling called the bus bar was probably affected
The quench may have melted a connection in the bus bar , causing liquid helium to leak " It 's usually around late March or early April that we start re-commissioning the whole accelerator chain .
The LHC being at the end of that chain , " said James Gillies , Cern 's director of communications .
" It will take us a while to get beams injected into the LHC , but I think it 's fair to say this will be the priority for next year 's start - up . "
The accelerator chain prepares the beams of protons to be fired through the machine to make possible the collisions that physicists will use to study the make - up of our Universe .
The problem occurred last weekend , when a failure , known as a quench , caused around 100 of the LHC 's super - cooled magnets to heat up by as much as 100 degrees .
The fire brigade were called out after a tonne of liquid helium leaked into the tunnel , which straddles the French - Swiss border .
Helium spill
The machine has more than 1,200 " dipole " magnets arranged end - to - end in the 27 km - long , ring - shaped tunnel that houses the LHC .
These magnets carry and steer beams of protons which will whizz around the machine at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points around the " ring " , these beams cross paths , smashing together near four massive " detectors " that monitor the collisions for interesting events .
Cern said the most likely cause of the equipment failure was a faulty electrical connection between two of the accelerator 's magnets .
This connection melted during testing of the machine and caused a huge leak of super - cool helium .
This helium is used to chill the magnets to a temperature of 1.9 kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) - which is colder than deep space .
This makes the magnets " superconducting " , allowing them to generate the large magnetic fields required to steer the beams while at the same time consuming relatively little power .
A quench occurs when part of a superconducting magnet heats up and causes superconducting properties to be lost .
Hot spot Cern has procedures in place to deal with quenches before they damage equipment , but in this instance a hot spot in the machine got out of control .
" It does seem that all the systems that are supposed to protect the machine in cases like this worked as far as we can tell .
But obviously something went wrong , " said Mr Gillies .
" The engineers have decided that in order to find out what really happened , they are going to have to go into the machine . "
One of the LHC 's eight sectors will now have to be warmed up so an inspection can be carried out .
Mr Gillies told BBC
News that this was likely to take a week , and that engineers would then have a much better idea of how to fix the fault .
Each particle accelerator is a unique machine , so Cern says that teething troubles were to be expected with such a complex machine at the cutting edge of technology .
" Events occur from time to time that temporarily stop operations , for shorter or longer periods , especially during the early phases , " said Cern physicist Peter Limon .

The Political Betting website is always worth a look and today it has a fascinating piece about the betting on Vince Cable to succeed Alastair Darling as Chancellor .
The Betfair next chancellor market ( something I must say I did n't know existed ) now has him as favourite at 2.15/1 .
The site quotes a piece for The First Post website by their " Westminster Insider " The Mole asking what will happen if the bank rescue fails :
" One answer being put forward in Blairite circles yesterday is that the Prime Minister will dump his ultra-loyal Chancellor Alistair Darling - and bring in Vince Cable as a part of a deal with the Liberal Democrats , " says The Mole .
I have been floating the idea of a national government for two weeks now .
I touched on it in my column about the Labour Party conference :
" If the financial crisis is as serious as many in the government suggest , then extraordinary times require bold solutions .
There is an argument for saying that the Prime Minister should invite David Cameron and Nick Clegg to Downing Street and tell them the time has come for all good men to come to the aid of the country .
A national government would allow Brown to bring in expertise from across the political spectrum .
Just imagine if Vince Cable 's business expertise could be harnessed in the present situation .
An offer of cabinet posts to the Tories and Lib Dems would also serve to completely wrong - foot the opposition .
Such thoughts are fanciful , of course , but they raise some interesting questions about Gordon Brown 's leadership . "
Now I 'm not so sure the idea is fanciful .
Last week I continued in a similar vein : " There should now be no question of reshuffling his loyal Chancellor .
Rather , Alastair Darling should be appointed to head an emergency committee that would include Vince Cable and Ed Balls .
He should also consider bringing in an experienced Conservative .
It might be wise to avoid David Cameron 's mentor Norman Lamont , who presided over the last British economic crisis , but the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke has been prepared to stand on cross-party platforms on Europe and can take some responsibility for digging the country out of a hole last time around . "
I am now increasingly convinced that Brown should make a big gesture and bring the opposition parties into his National Economic Council .

Introduction Although I 've written some recursive - descent ( RD ) parsers by hand , the theory behind them eluded me for some time .
I had a good understanding of the theory behind bottom - up LR parsers , and have used tools ( like Yacc and PLY ) to generate LALR parsers for languages , but I did n't really dig into the books about LL .
This week I 've finally decided to understand what 's going on .
I tried to write a simple RD parser in Python ( previously I 've written RD parsers in C++ and Lisp ) , and ran into a problem which got me thinking hard about LL parsers .
So , I 've opened the Dragon Book , and now I know much more about LL ( 1 ) , LL( k ) , predictive , recursive - descent parsers with and without backtracking , and what 's between them .
This article is a summary of my findings , written for myself to read in a few months when I forget it :-)
Recursive descent parsers From Wikipedia : A recursive descent parser is a top - down parser built from a set of mutually - recursive procedures ( or a non-recursive equivalent ) where each such procedure usually implements one of the production rules of the grammar .
Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes .
RD parsers are the most general form of top - down parsing , and the most popular type of parsers to write by hand .
However , being so general , they have several problems , like requiring backtracking ( which is difficult to code correctly and efficiently ) .
Usually , it is enough to use less general and powerful parsers for all practical needs , like parsing programming languages ( and domain specific languages ) .
This is where LL parsers come in .
LL parsers
An LL parser is a top - down parser for a subset of the context - free grammars .
It parses the input from Left to right , and constructs a Leftmost derivation of the sentence ( hence LL , compared with LR parser ) .
The class of grammars which are parsable in this way is known as the LL grammars .
LL parsers are further classified by the amount of lookup they need .
LL ( 1 ) parsers require 1 character of lookup , LL( k ) require k , and so on .
Usually , LL ( 1 ) is enough for most practical needs .
LL parsers are also called predictive , because it 's possible predict the exact path to take by a certain amount of lookup symbols , without backtracking .
The example This week I tried to construct a RD parser for this simple calculator grammar : < expr > := < term > + < expr > | < term > - < expr > | < term > < term > := < factor > * < term > < factor > / < term > < factor > < factor > := < number > | < id> | ( < expr > ) < number > := \d+ < id > := [ a - zA - Z_ ]\w +
This grammar is LL ( 1 ) and hence parseable by a simple predictive parser with a single token lookahead .
However , I then tried to add the following rule to allow input of commands into an interactive calculator prompt : < command > := < expr > | < id> = < expr >
With this rule added , the grammar is no longer LL ( 1 ) , because looking at the first token I can't say which one of the two options of < command > it is .
In order to be able to differentiate between an assignment and a single expression , I must see the = token , and for this I need to see 2 tokens forward , and not just one .
So , this grammar turns into a LL ( 2 ) .
LL ( 2 ) grammars are much more difficult to code by hand than LL ( 1 ) grammars , and they are also much more difficult to turn into code automatically by parser generators .
This is probably why for most languages LL ( 1 ) suffices .
LL parser generators Unlike LR parsers , for which everyone uses parser generators , LL parsers are commonly written by hand .
It even appears that some of the most popular compilers ( such as GCC ) use hand - written RD parsers to parse whole languages like C .
As with anything , you get maximal flexibility and efficiency when you hand - code something , as you 're not constrained by the limitations of the tools and libraries you 're using .
Indeed , writing a simple predictive parser as a set of mutually recursive routines is simple , and can also be very educational .
If you have a very small parsing task to perform , perhaps you 'll be better off hand - coding a RD parser .
However , automatic tools for generating LL parsers exist .
The most popular are probably ANTLR and Boost .
Spirit .
I have n't tried them , but both are widely used to write complex parsers .
Both have a clear advantage over hand - written parsers - they can generate parsers with any lookup length , guessing the required length from the grammar .
Hand - written parsers , as I mentioned earlier , get much more complex for any k > 1 .
Left recursion
Had my expr rule been written like this : < expr > := < expr > + < term > | < expr > - < term > | < term >
It would have been left recursive , because the non-terminal expr appears as the first ( leftmost ) symbol in its own production .
Since RD parsers work top - down , to recognize < expr > it has to first recognize < expr > , but for that it again has to recognize < expr > and so on , ad infinitum .
This infinite recursion is the reason why RD parsers can't handle left recursion .
Left recursion can also be indirect : < a > := < b > < x > | < c > < b > := < a > <y > | <d>
Here we can have the infinite derivation : < a > -> < b> < x > -> < a > < y > < x > and so on .
Techniques exist to remove left recursion from some grammars .
For more information see this .
The grammar shown in the example above had left - recursion removed from it .
THERE were many reasons why Yuri Nosenko found himself , in June 1962 , sitting in an overstuffed armchair in a fussily furnished CIA flat in Geneva , with a glass of American whiskey in one hand and an American cigarette in the other , offering to sell “ two pieces of information ” .
He suggested several of them himself .
A prostitute had robbed him of his $ 250 spending allowance as a member of the Soviet disarmament delegation , and he desperately needed cash .
He had spent too many nights on the town , and lost the money that way .
Or it was not a matter of money at all ; he simply wanted to get in touch with Americans , because the urge to defect to the West “ was slowly growing in me since my studentship ” .
But Mr Nosenko was no ordinary Russian .
He was a member of the KGB , chief of the First Section of the Seventh Department of the Second Directorate , whose job was “ work against tourists ” .
At that first meeting he declared himself not yet “ psychologically ready ” to defect .
So for the next two years , with $ 25,000 deposited for him in a Western back account , he stayed in the KGB and passed on information .
He had agreed that , on visits to the West , he would meet his contacts at 7.45 pm outside the first cinema listed in the local telephone book two days after sending a telegram signed “ George ” .
And so in February 1964 there he was , with his combed - back hair and broad , soulful face , loitering outside the ABC in Geneva as if waiting for a girl ; but in fact eager , now , to jump .
The Oswald file
Over the previous two years , he had told his CIA contacts in detail how their chief informant , Popov , had been exposed ; how bugs had been planted in the American embassy in Moscow ; how the KGB had tried to recruit Americans and had laid honeytraps for others ; and , most useful of all , how he had reviewed the entire KGB file on Lee Harvey Oswald , President Kennedy 's killer , and knew for a fact that the KGB had never used him because he was “ unstable ” .
This was riveting stuff .
Perhaps , thought the high - ups in counter - intelligence in Langley , it was too good .
It seemed to James Jesus Angleton , the head of CI , that Mr Nosenko was no random defector .
He had been despatched by the KGB to call in question the information given by another source , Anatoly Golitsin , to divert his leads , to clear the Soviet Union of complicity in Kennedy 's murder and ( Angleton 's wild head piling suspicion on suspicion ) to work towards the destruction of the United States .
Mr Nosenko had his odd sides , undoubtedly .
He seemed to have left his wife and daughters without compunction ; they would be “ OK ” , he thought .
He admitted he had made “ stupid blunders ” : drank too much , gone with too many women , invented fables about his life .
He claimed to have twice run away to the front as a boy , itching to fight the Germans .
He said he had graduated from the Moscow State Institute in 1949 , concealing the fact that he had failed the Marxism paper and had to take his finals again .
At his first Geneva interview he gave his KGB rank as lieutenant - colonel , when he had never got past captain .
His father had been Stalin 's minister of shipbuilding for 17 years , commemorated with a bronze plaque in the Kremlin wall .
But the son was feckless , doing indifferently at his posh schools , recruited into the KGB only because Daddy knew General Kobulov and , at a party at the family 's dacha in 1953 , had introduced them .
His inflated KGB career had in fact been predictably modest , almost upended at the start when he showed his operative 's papers and passport to a doctor treating him for gonorrhoea .
That earned him arrest for 15 days .
Between 1955 and 1963 he was shuffled around in various jobs within the Second Directorate .
But his father 's name still helped , earning him the privilege of trips abroad .
While there , he decided he wanted to live in the West .
This simple motivation was not credited when he came to the United States .
Instead , for three years , he was incarcerated and interrogated to make him confess that , first , he was not Nosenko and , second , that he had been sent on purpose .
A small cell was built for him at a CIA facility in Maryland .
The single window was boarded up , and a 60 - watt bulb was kept burning .
Weak tea and porridge were fed to him .
He was not allowed to hear a sound or to read .
When , in desperation , he secreted the instructions for a tube of toothpaste , they were taken away .
When he made a calendar from threads unravelled from his clothes , it was destroyed .
In one week , in 1966 , he was given polygraph tests for 28 ½ hours .
At one point an extra machine was fitted which could , he was told , read his mind .
All this was later found to have contravened the CIA 's founding charter .
But it did not make Mr Nosenko change his story .
America 's spies were as thoroughly divided about him as any KGB agent could have wished .
In 1968 , shamefacedly , the CIA rehabilitated him , awarded him $ 150,000 in compensation and gave him a new name .
He settled somewhere in the South , unbitter and “ well - adjusted ” , married an American and was invited sometimes secretly to Langley to speak , to tumultuous ovations .
And to friends in the agency he gave a new reason for that long - ago June day in Geneva .
“ I was snookered … I was drunk — very drunk . ”
At the initial Yearly charity event ran from Puget Sound Programming Python ( PuPPy ) Past Tuesday , four mythical terminology founders came together to talk about the future and past of speech design .
The event has been organized to raise funding for Computer Science All ( CSforALL ) , a business that intends to create C- S an increasingly essential element of the educational adventure .
One of the panelists have been the founders of a few of their very popular languages :
Guido van Rossum , the founder of Python
James Gosling , the creator , and lead writer behind the Java Programming - language
Anders Hejlsberg , the first writer of Turbo Pascal who ’s also worked to the Evolution of C# along with TypeScript
Larry Wall , the creator of Perl
The Conversation was moderated by Carol Willing , who ’s now a Steering Council member and programmer for Job Jupyter .
She ’s also a part of this Python Steering Council , also a Python Pc Software Foundation Fellow and former Manager .
Key fundamentals of language layout
The very first question pitched at the panelists was , ” Which will be the fundamentals of language design ? ” Guido van Rossum considers :
Designing a programming language is quite much like how JK Rowling writes her novels , the Harry Potter series .
When Asked the way he says JK Rowling is a genius at how a number of details she said in her very first Harry Potter book finished up playing with an essential plot point partly seven and six .
Explaining this pertains to speech design he adds , ” In speech design regularly that is exactly how matters proceed “ .
When designing a speech we begin investing certain details such as the key words you would like to utilize , the design of programming we all desire to follow along , etc. , .
However , whatever we pick on we have been stuck using them and later on , we will need to locate new techniques to make use of those details , like Rowling .
“ The art of designing a speech isalso 1 hand , Picking your primary pair of alternatives so that is you will find lots of possible continuations of this narrative .
The other 50 % the art of speech design is moving straight back to a narrative and inventing creative methods of continuing it in ways you had never looked at , ” he adds .
After James
Gosling was inquired just how Java came to life and what would be the look maxims he abided byhe only said , ” it did not emerge of just like an individual fire job or some thing .
This was from attempting to assemble a model .
” James Gosling and his team were doing work on a job that included understanding that the domain of embedded programs .
Because of thisparticular , they talked to plenty of programmers who assembled applications for embedded platforms to understand exactly how their process works .
This endeavor needed approximately a dozen people it And Gosling was accountable in making matters easier in the programming language perspective .
“ It began as sort to do better C and it got out of hands which the remaining part of the project ended just providing the circumstance “ , he adds .
In the long run , the one thing from this project endured was ” Java ” .
It was fundamentally built to address the difficulties of men and women that live out data centres , those who ’re becoming stained by issues with media , security , and dependability .
Larry Wall Calls himself a” linguist ” as opposed to the usual computer scientist .
He desired to develop a new speech which has been like a pure language .
Explaining via a good illustration , he stated , ” rather than putting people in a university campus and deciding where they move we ’re simply gonna observe where folks desire to walk after which put short cuts in most of those places . ” A simple principle behind creating Perl was going to deliver APIs to all .
It had been aimed to function as both a fantastic text processing speech but additionally a paste language .
Wall further stocks which at the 90s that the Speech was stabilizing , however it did involve any difficulties .
Thus , in the calendar year 2000 , the Perl team ostensibly made a decision to break all and everything developed a completely new group of design fundamentals .
And , founded on these fundamentals Perl was redesigned to Perl 6 .
Several of those axioms were picking the proper defaultoption , conserve your mounts as Unicode does n’t need sufficient mounts , do not reevaluate object orientation etc . .
He adds ,
“ A Fantastic deal of The redesign was supposed to state fine what would be the best peg to hold every thing on ?
Might it be objectoriented ?
Is it some thing inside the lexical extent or at the bigger extent ?
What exactly does the proper peg to hold each bit of advice on of course when we do not possess that peg just how can we make it ? ”
Anders Hejlsberg shares he follows a frequent principle in most of languages he ’s worked and that ’s ” there is just 1 means to execute a specific thing .
” He considers that if your programmer is given using four distinct manners he can wind up choosing the wrong course and comprehend it afterwards from the evolution .
As stated by Hejlsbergthis is the reason why usually programmers wind up creating some thing known as ” simplexity ” so carrying something complex and wrap one wrapper at the it therefore the sophistication goes off .
Like the perspectives of Guido van Rossum , ” he farther Adds that almost any decision that you make when designing a speech you need to live with this .
When designing a speech you have to be somewhat careful about reasoning within exactly what ” not ” to present from the speech .
Many times , folks should come for you along with their hints for upgrades , however you cannot truly alter the character of the programming language .
Though you cannot really alter the fundamental character of a speech , it is possible to absolutely expand it .
You have two options , either keep true to the character of the speech or you also build a fresh one .
The kind procedure of programming languages
Guido Van Rossum , once asked regarding the scanning approach in Python , shared the way it had been if Python was initially introduced .
Formerly , int was n’t aclass that was a tiny conversion functionality .
In the event that you like to convert a string to a integer you certainly can certainly do that with an integrated function .
Down the road , Guido realized this was an error .
“ We needed a whole lot of the purposes and we all realized we had made a blunder , we ’ve given users classes which were distinctive from the integral thing types . ”
That is
At which the Python team made a decision to re invent the whole way of types from Python and also did a whole lot of clean ups .
Consequently , they shifted the role int to a designator for its class int .
Currently , calling the class entails building an example of this class .
James Gosling shared the His attention has been performance and also yet one variable for improving performance may be your type technique .
It ’s actually helpful for such things as construction optimizing compilers and doing beforehand period correctness assessing .
Possessing the sort system also helps in circumstances where you ’re targeting small footprint devices .
“ To perform that sort of compaction that you want every sort of hope it provides you , every last drop of advice and also , the sooner you are aware of it , the better job you perform , ” he adds .
Anders Hejlsberg discusses type approaches as being a tooling feature .
Developers love their IDEs , they have been familiar with matters such as announcement completion , refactoring , and code navigation .
These features are all enabled by the exact understanding of one ’s code and also this exact knowledge is offered by means of a compiler having a sort system .
Hejlsberg considers that adding type s can radically boost the productivity of programmers , and it is a more straightforward thought .
“ We believe that dynamic languages have been Easier to strategy since you have rid of all these type s that has been a bother each of the time .
As it happens you could be productive by the addition of type s in the event that you take action at a non-intrusive fashion of course should you work hard on doing fantastic type inference and therefore on , ” he adds .
Discussing About the kind system in Perl , ” Wall started out by saying Perl 5 and Perl 6 ’d different type techniques .
Back in Perl 5 , every thing has been treated like a series even if it ’s just a number or even a floatingpoint .
The team wished to continue to keep this feature from Perl 6 as a portion of this redesign , however they realized that ” it ’s alright if the user is confounded concerning the interchangeability however it is n’t good in case the computer is still confused about matters . ”
For Perl 6 , both Wall along with his group pictured to Make it a much far better objectoriented in addition to a far better programming language that is functional .
To attain this goal , it ’s necessary to get an extremely solid type system of a solid meta object version under .
Additionally , additionally you will need to choose the slogans such as ” what ’s a thing , what ’s a closed ” very badly .
What creates a programming language maintainable
Guido Van Rossum considers this to earn a programming language maintainable it ’s crucial that you hit the ideal balance between your elastic and disciplined strategy .
While lively typing is very good for smaller apps , large apps call for a much - disciplined strategy .
And , it really is wise if the terminology itself empowers the area as opposed to providing you with the complete freedom of accomplishing everything you desire .
This is the reason Guido is intending to bring an extremely similar tech such as TypeScript into Python .
He adds :
“ TypeScript
Is actually amazingly useful therefore we ’re adding a very similar notion to Python .
We ’re adding it at a slightly different manner because we ’ve got another circumstance ”
Together Side kind system , Re-factoring Engines may also end up being rather beneficial .
It is likely to make it a lot easier to execute large scale refactorings including tens of thousands of lines of code in the same time .
Many times , people do n’t rename techniques as it truly is tough to go past a bit of code and then rename exactly this ideal factor .
If you ’re supplied using a refactoring engine , then you only have to press a few buttons , then key in the brand new name , also it ’ll soon be refactored in maybe only 30 minutes .
The source of this TypeScript endeavor was these Tremendous Java Script codebases .
Because these codebases grew bigger and bigger , it became quite tricky to keep up them .
All these codebases fundamentally became ” write - only code ” shared Anders Hejlsberg .
He adds that is the reason why we want a semantic comprehension of the code , making refactoring substantially easier .
“ This understanding asks a type system to be set up and after you get started adding that you simply add documentation into the code , ” added Hejlsberg .
Wall additionally supports precisely the exact same notion that ” good lexical scoping helps with refactoring ” .
The near future of programming language layout
When asked regarding the potential for programming designing , James Gosling shared a exact underexplored field in programming is currently writing code to get GPUs .
He highlights the point that now , we do n’t need any programming language which works just like a dream with GPUs and even work is must be carried out in that location .
Anders Hejlsberg rightly said that Programming languages usually do n’t proceed with the exact same rate as hardware or the rest of the technologies .
Concerning development , programming languages are somewhat more like maths along with the individual anatomy .
He stated , ” We are programming in languages which were devised 50 decades ago , each one the essentials of operational programming were presumed in excess of 50 years back . ”
However he does think that rather than segregating in to Different categories including objectoriented or programming , today languages are getting to be multi-paradigm .
“ Languages Are getting more multi-paradigm .
I do believe it ’s wrong to share I just enjoy objectoriented programming language , or programming , or even programming language ”
Now ,
It ’s important to be Alert to their newest researches , the brand new thinking , and also the brand new paradigms .
Afterward we must add them within our programming style , however .
See this discussion ran by PuPPy to understand more in more detail .
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 16 - Enums
enum Bool < False True > ; my $ value = $ arbitrary_value but True ; if $ value { say " Yes , it 's true " ; # will be printed } enum Day ( ' Mon ' , ' Tue ' , ' Wed ' , ' Thu ' , ' Fri ' , ' Sat ' , ' Sun ' ) ; if custom_get_date ( ) .
Day == Day :: Sat | Day :: Sun { say " Weekend " ; }
Enums are versatile beasts .
They are low - level classes that consist of an enumeration of constants , typically integers or strings ( but can be arbitrary ) .
These constants can act as subtypes , methods or normal values .
They can be attached to an object with the but operator , which " mixes " the enum into the value :
my $x = $ today but Day : : Tue ;
You can also use the type name of the Enum as a function , and supply the value as an argument :
$x = $ today but Day ( $ weekday ) ;
Afterwards that object has a method with the name of the enum type , here Day :
say $ x. Day ; # 1
The value of first constant is 0 , the next 1 and so on , unless you explicitly provide another value with pair notation :
enum Hackers ( : Larry < Perl > , : Guido < Python > , : Paul < Lisp > ) ;
You can check if a specific value was mixed in by using the versatile smart match operator , or with .does :
if $ today ~~ Day :: Fri { say " Thank Christ it 's Friday " } if $ today.does ( Fri ) { ... }
Note that you can specify the name of the value only ( like Fri ) if that 's unambiguous , if it 's ambiguous you have to provide the full name Day : : Fri .
Enums replace both the " magic " that is involved with tainted variables in Perl 5 and the return " 0 but True " hack ( a special case for which no warning is emitted if used as a number ) .
Plus they give a Bool type .
Enums also provide the power and flexibility of attaching arbitrary meta data for debugging or tracing .

It ’s against this backdrop that Palin ’s public pronouncements , culminating with her debate performance , have been so striking .
The standard take has it that she ’s either speaking utter ignorant gibberish ( as to Couric ) or reciting highly polished , campaign - written sound bites that she ’s memorized ( as at the convention and the debate ) .
But there ’s a steady unnerving undertone to Palin ’s utterances , a consistent message of hubristic self - confidence and hyper-ambition .
She wants to be president , she thinks she can be president , she thinks she will be president .
And perhaps soon .
She often sounds like someone who sees herself as half - a- heartbeat away from the presidency .
Or who is seen that way by her own camp , the hard - right G.O.P. base that never liked McCain anyway and views him as , at best , a White House place holder .
This was first apparent when Palin extolled a “ small town ” vice president as a hero in her convention speech  and cited not one of the many Republican vice presidents who fit that bill but , bizarrely , Harry Truman , a Democrat who succeeded a president who died in office .
A few weeks later came Charlie Gibson ’s question about whether she thought she was “ experienced enough ” and “ ready ” when McCain invited her to join his ticket .
Palin replied that she did n’t “ hesitate ” and did n’t “ even blink ”  a response that seemed jarring for its lack of any human modesty , even false modesty .
In the last of her Couric interview installments on Thursday , Palin was asked which vice president had most impressed her , and after paying tribute to Geraldine Ferraro , she chose “ George Bush Sr . ”
Her criterion : she most admires vice presidents “ who have gone on to the presidency . ”
Hours later , at the debate , she offered a discordant contrast to Biden when asked by Gwen Ifill how they would each govern “ if the worst happened ” and the president died in office .
After Biden spoke of somber continuity , Palin was weirdly flip and chipper , eager to say that as a “ maverick ” she ’d go her own way .
But the debate ’s most telling passage arrived when Biden welled up in recounting his days as a single father after his first wife and one of his children were killed in a car crash .
Palin ’s perky response  she immediately started selling McCain as a “ consummate maverick ” again  was as emotionally disconnected as Michael Dukakis ’s notoriously cerebral answer to the hypothetical 1988 debate question about his wife being “ raped and murdered . ”
If , as some feel , Obama is cool , Palin is ice cold .
She did n’t even acknowledge Biden ’s devastating personal history .

After the debate , Republicans who had been bailing on Palin rushed back to the fold .
They know her relentless ambition is the only hope for saving a ticket headed by a warrior who is out of juice and out of ideas .
So what if she is preposterously unprepared to run the country in the midst of its greatest economic crisis in 70 years ?
She looks and sounds like a winner .
You can understand why they believe that .
She has more testosterone than anyone else at the top of her party .
McCain and his surrogates are forever blaming their travails on others , wailing about supposed sexist and journalistic biases around the clock .
McCain even canceled an interview with Larry King , for heaven ’s sake , in a fit of pique at a CNN anchor , Campbell Brown .
Both candidates say they will increase financing to law enforcement agencies 
Mr. Obama has said he would like to reinstate the COPS grants created by President Bill Clinton but abandoned by President Bush .
Mr. McCain said he would eliminate Justice Department earmarks , calling them “ the broken windows of the federal budget process . ”
“ As it is , funds distributed by the Department of Justice are too often earmarked according to their value to the re-election of members of Congress instead of their value to police , ” Mr. McCain said .
Mr. McCain also favors tougher sentences for illegal immigrants who commit crimes and more federal money to help local agencies detain them .
Both candidates supported the Second Chance Act of 2007 , which provides money for job training and for drug counseling and other re-entry programs .
Mr. Obama has emphasized civil liberties , sensitivity to racial inequality and tough penalties for the most violent felons .
He was a state lawmaker when the Illinois police and prosecutors were under siege .
In 2003 , doubt was cast on the convictions of several Illinois death - row inmates leading to a death - penalty moratorium that is still in effect .
Some critics say Mr. Obama ’s role in the death - penalty moratorium has been exaggerated .
Christine Radogno , a Republican state senator , said that Mr. Obama took credit for work accomplished by Gov. George Ryan , a Republican who imposed the moratorium , pardoned a number of death - row inmates , and established a commission to study capital punishment .
“ To claim that Barack was the impetus for those reforms is an overstatement , ” Ms. Radogno said .
Recent disclosures have revealed that Chicago police officers had tortured suspects into giving false confessions .
Originally considered a dud , an old volcano - in - a - bottle experiment designed to mimic conditions that may have brewed the components of life might have been right on target .
After reanalyzing the results of unpublished research conducted by Stanley Miller in 1953 , chemists realized that his experiment had actually produced a wealth of amino acids — the protein foundation of life .
Miller is famed for the results of experiments on amino acid formation in a jar filled with methane , hydrogen and ammonia — his version of the primordial soup .
However , his estimates of atmospheric composition were eventually considered inaccurate .
The experiment became regarded as a general rather than useful example of how the first organic molecules may have assembled .
But the latest results , derived from samples found in an old box by one of Miller 's former graduate students , come from a device that mimicked volcanic conditions now believed to have existed three billion years ago .
The findings suggest that amino acids could have formed when lightning struck pools of gas on the flanks of volcanoes , and are a fitting coda for the late father of prebiotic chemistry .
" What 's amazing is that he did it , " said study co-author Jeffrey Bada , a Scripps Institute of Oceanography biochemist and Miller 's former student .
" All I did is have access to his extracts . "
Bada stumbled across the original experiment by accident when a colleague of Miller 's mentioned having seen a box of experimental samples in Miller 's office .
Bada , who inherited Miller 's scientific possessions after his death in 2007 , found the box —
literally labeled " 1953 -1954 experiments " — in his own office .
Inside it were samples taken by Miller from a device that spewed a concentrated stream of primordial gases over an electrical spark .
It was a high - powered variation on the steady - steam apparatus that earned him fame — but unlike that device , it appeared to have produced few amino acids , and was unmentioned in his landmark 1953 Science study , " A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions . "
But Miller did n't have access to high - performance liquid chromatography , which lets chemists break down and classify samples with once - unthinkable levels of precision .
And when Bada 's team reanalyzed the disregarded samples , they found no fewer than 22 amino acids , several of which were never seen by Miller in a lifetime of primordial modeling .
Perhaps amino acids first formed when the gases in Miller 's device accumulated around active volcanoes , said Bada .
" Instead of having global synthesis of organic molecules , you had a lot of little localized factories in the form of these volcanic islands , " he said .
" The amino acid precursors formed in a plume and concentrated along tidal shores .
They settled in the water , underwent further reactions there , and as they washed along the shore , became concentrated and underwent further polymerization events , " explained Indiana University biochemist Adam Johnson , a co-author of the study .
" And lightning " — the final catalyst in the equation — " tends to be extremely common with volcanic eruptions . "
Luke Leman , a Scripps Institute biochemist who was not involved in the study , published today in Science , agreed .
" These findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting that areas near volcanoes could have been hotspots of organic chemistry on early Earth , " he said .
Leman continued , " These findings will likely inspire a next generation of prebiotic chemists , much as Miller 's original experimental results have inspired the field for more than fifty years . "
Added Bada , " There 's a lesson here : do n't throw anything away . "

Note : Added Harvard University prebiotic chemist Jack Szostak by email after the article went to press : " I like this work , because it shows that we have to think about local environments where specific classes of molecules can be made .
Some good stuff might get made near ( not in ! ) volcanoes , other good stuff might get made in other environments .
At least this helps get away from the silly old idea that life began in an oceanic primordial soup ( too homogeneous and too dilute for anything interesting to happen ) . "

“ We know that the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until the 20s , and some people will ask , ‘ Why are you trying to improve prefrontal abilities when the biological substrate is not there yet ? ’ ” said Adele Diamond , a professor of developmental cognitive science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
“ I tell them that 2 - year - olds have legs , too , which will not reach full length for 10 years or more  but they can still walk and run and benefit from exercise . ”
Executive function involves three important skills .
The first is the ability to resist distractions or delay gratification to finish a job : to finish the book report before turning on the television .
The second is working memory , the capacity to hold and manipulate multiple numbers or ideas in the mind ,  for example , to do simple addition or subtraction without pencil and paper .
The third is cognitive flexibility , the ability to appreciate another person 's point of view and to adapt when demands change  when recess is canceled , say , and there ’s a pop quiz in math .

Researchers can rate these abilities with some precision by giving young children several straightforward mental tests .
In one , youngsters sit in front of a computer and when a red heart appears on the left side of the screen , they strike a key on the left , and when it appears on the right screen they strike a key on the right .
Most of them do well on this .
But when scientists change the rules , and have the children strike a key on the right when the symbol appears on the left , and vice versa , the test gets harder .
The number of errors they commit , and the time it takes the children to answer , are considered measures of their ability to regulate themselves .
Other similar kinds of tests can track improvements in working memory and intellectual flexibility .
Researchers have designed school - based curriculums intended to improve each of these abilities .
In a study published in 2007 , Dr. Diamond led a team that compared one of these programs  called Tools of the Mind  to a standard literacy curriculum , in several preschools in the Northeast .
The Tools program features a variety of exercises , including a counting activity in which children pair off .
One child counts a given number of objects from a pile and separates them , and then the other child checks the sum .
The “ checker ” has a sheet of paper with a list of numbers , each beside a corresponding number of dots : for example , four dots line up beside the No. 4 .
By placing the objects on the dots , the child can see whether the count was accurate .
This double - checking is intended to force the “ counter ” to be more careful and to stall the other child ’s impulse to grab an object .
More from Obama 's York , Pa. , avail :
They do n't have an agenda to run on .
They have n't offered a single concrete idea so far in two nights about how they would make the lives of middle class Americans better .
They 've spent the entire two nights attacking me or extolling John McCain 's biography , which is fine .
They can use their convention time any way they want , but you can't expect that I 'd be surprised about attacks from Republicans .
And by the way , you know , I 've been called worse on the basketball court .
It 's not that big of a deal .
From the Wall Street Journal :
Republican former Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s endorsement of Sen. Barack Obama is the latest sign that the Republican Party ’s coalition is fracturing amid the stresses of the campaign … .
The endorsement comes after a series of events that have pointed to the fraying of a Republican umbrella that has relied in the past on both moderates and conservatives to bulk up its governing majority .
Late last week , conservative radio talk - show host Michael Smerconish endorsed Sen. Obama , as did conservative columnist Christopher Buckley , the son of National Review founder William F. Buckley .
The Chicago Tribune endorsed Sen .
Obama last week , the first time the paper has endorsed a Democrat in its 161 - year history .
Two Republican senators in the middle of tough re-election fights — Susan Collins of Maine and Norm Coleman of Minnesota — have denounced Sen. McCain ’s automated phone calls attacking Sen. Obama .
“ These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics , ” said Sen .
Collins ’s spokesman , Kevin Kelley .
“ Sen. Collins urges the McCain campaign to stop these calls immediately . ”
…. In the past weeks , strains have developed on all fronts .
Fiscal conservatives , already angered by the growth in government spending and deficits under Mr. Bush , have been incensed by what they see as government intrusion in the markets with the $ 700 billion Wall Street rescue plan .
Sen .
McCain voted for the plan , then angered his party ’s fiscal - conservative wing further by proposing that the government buy $ 300 billion in mortgages on homes facing foreclosure .
The Palin pick was intended in part to assuage social conservatives who have long been leery of Sen. McCain .
While it seems to have succeeded on that score , it may also have driven off moderate Republicans .
“ Whether John wins or loses , the party is going to have to go through a period of introspection , and we ’re going to have to regenerate ourselves , ” said John Weaver , a former top aide to Sen. McCain .
“ The Republican Party is fractured .
It is completely , utterly fractured , ” said Mark Corallo , a conservative Republican political strategist .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
More than a dozen trucks loaded with fruits , spices and other goods Tuesday crossed the line dividing Kashmir as India and Pakistan opened a symbolic trade route in the disputed region for the first time in more than 60 years .
Kashmiris watch as Indian trucks cross into the border town of Chakothi in Pakistani - administered Kashmir .
To cheers and band music , the first trucks rumbled from the Pakistani side across a white bridge to a brightly decorated trade center festooned .
Apple - laden Indian trucks heading the other way were also warmly welcomed .
It is hoped the move will ease tensions in the troubled Himalayan region , which has been a conflict flashpoint between nuclear - armed neighbors India and Pakistan who both lay claims to the territory .
" Today , we have regained our lost market , " said Ghulam Rasool Bhat , president of the Kashmir fruit growers ' association .
Watch more about the historic day »
" We are sending the sweet Kashmir apple as the first consignment .
This is sure to sweeten the relation between the two neighbors .
The beginning of the trade between the two Kashmirs will further improve the relations and lead to a peaceful resolution of the bitter problem , " he said .
The trucks were subjected to thorough security checks before they crossed the bridge , one of the few crossing points in the heavily militarized 742 - kilometer ( 460 - mile ) Line of Control , the de facto frontier that divides the region .
Kashmir has been a major source of dispute between India , and Pakistan since the two countries were partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947 .
Muslim Kashmiris sided with Pakistan to the north , while the Hindu south joined India .
For the past 18 years , Kashmir has been wracked by a bloody separatist campaign .
Authorities say up to 43,000 people have died , but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the death toll at twice that .
Violence had dropped off since the countries began a peace process in 2004 , but it surged after the state government in Indian - controlled Kashmir announced plans in June to donate land for a Hindu shrine .
Muslim protests following the decision prompted a government U - turn that triggered Hindu demonstrations calling for it to be restored .
Subsequent violence left 40 dead and hundreds wounded .
It is hoped Tuesday 's route opening will bolster the peace agreement and combat lingering mistrust between India and Pakistan .
A bilateral cease - fire has been holding in the region for more than four years .
A bus service connecting the divided Kashmir began amid much fanfare in 2005 but struggled under the weight of elaborate security checks and stifling bureaucracy .
" This is a great emotional moment , as it brings to mind my grandfather , who used to drive lorries on this road , " said Muzhar Hussain Naqvi , who drove the leading Pakistani truck .

The usual partisan suspects are pouncing on yours truly for wanting the McCain - Palin campaign to release Palin 's medical records for the past year to rebut for good and all the rumors on the Internets and the very , very strange chronology surrounding the pregnancy and birth of Trig Palin .
It is , apparently , vile , evil and a function of AIDS dementia to wonder what the truth is and ask the McCain campaign to provide it .
So I hope Dean Barnett and John Podhoretz will eviscerate Michael Goldfarb , their former uber - neocon comrade , as well :
In an unguarded moment last night , McCain Report blogger Michael Goldfarb replied to my question of whether there 's any truth to the rumor that Sarah Palin 's Down Syndrome child is actually her daughter 's with the following less - than - confidence - inspiring comment : " Well , I do n't ... think so . "

* editorial note : the events described below took place in 2004
So I sat with about 150 other " technical decision makers " in a very
plush hotel in Holborn while representatives from Microsoft tried their
best to convince me that I should not be considering moving to Linux .
To run the discussion Microsoft had employed a fake - tan horror who had
clearly escaped from daytime TV .
He was by turns chummy and
condescending .
However being a reasonable man I will not hold Microsoft
responsible for his failings .
First up was Phillip Dawson who leads Linux research for
analysts Meta Group .
He quoted heavily from a Meta analysis which shows
that Total Cost of Ownership ( TCO ) for linux and windows is comparable .
This study has been widely reported in IT press but I can't for the
life of me find a link to the original .
He made some interesting points
about where the datacentre is going to be in a few years .
His basic
thrust was that everyone is moving from proprietary Unix with its
expensive platforms to Windows or Linux on x86 platforms and that it
this hardware move , rather than linux versus windows , that will drive
all the cost savings .
Dawson believes that in a few years the only
place we will see proprietary Unix is in very large enterprise
databases .
After a promising start , Dawson then got into the territory of
why Windows makes more sense for enterprises than Linux .
He introduced
what was to become a running theme for seminar , Linux is not free .
It
turns out that the TCO statements made earlier were based on the
licensing costs of SuSE professional and Red Hat Enterprise versus
Windows .
They had refused to consider that people might run a business
on something that they could download free from the Internet .
Later in
the Q and A session Dawson got quite aggravated when people pointed out
to him that many Linux - based businesses run quite happily on free linux
( this was shouted by the scruffy - looking Debian hackers in the back ) .
I
can only assume that businesses that are brave enough to save thousands
of pounds per unit by moving away from expensive hardware platforms are
meant not to care that they can save another couple of hundred pounds
on Microsoft licence fees .
Later in the presentation he said " Don't
compare to the free downloads .
They are not free " .
Precisely what he
meant by this escapes me .
One area the Meta study did n't look at was Linux on the
desktop .
Phil claimed that linux was not ready for the desktop because
it lacked administrative tools .
He was carrying on in a similar vein
when he said " Management tools on Linux are nearly as good as a DOS
prompt " .
Nick Barley , business and Marketing Director for Microsoft UK took to
the stage to baffle us with market - speak .
There was lots of talk about
strategy and leveraging which I did n't follow .
He talked a bit about
Microsoft 's shared - source program and tried his hardest to make it
sound like open - source , mainly by refusing to say Open - source and
talking about shared - source instead .
Continuing in Phillip Dawson's
footsteps he repeated the mantra " Linux is not free " several times .
Although he was at his best when talking about business models amongst
Linux distributors claiming that " Linux is moving to the same model
that Microsoft has been using " .
My absolute favourite part of the talk was when Barley started to extol
the virtues of Windows because everything in it was made by one
manufacturer .
A fair point which would have been well taken had he not
gone on to draw an idiotic analogy .
He asked us to imagine an aeroplane
where different components were made by different companies .
Apparently
he 's never heard of Airbus .
Next up was Nick McGrath head of platform strategy for
Microsoft UK .
The main bulk of his talk was taken up by a demonstration
of a document sharing system based on Microsoft Sharepoint .
Very boring
for those of us running heterogeneous systems that Sharepoint will not
run on .
McGrath was much more technically clued up than Barley , and
seemed to be aware that the audience was not entirely on his side .
He
made mention of the Forrester report
that claimed more vulnerabilities in Linux than Windows .
I saw this
thoroughly debunked by RedHat 's Marc Cox when he was speaking as part
of RedHat 's World Tour so I will not go into further detail .
After a break for coffee Microsoft rolled out some satisfied
customers for us starting with Basil Shall of Grosvenor Group .
For
those of you not familiar with Grosvenor they are a financial group who
use their massive London property holdings to make more money in the
markets .
The most interesting thing that Basil said was that he had had
to write a letter to the head of Microsoft UK before he got decent
service .
Things got progressively less interesting as the morning wore
on .
Paul Hartigan of PharmiWeb told us how great .
Net is .
Anthony
Leaper of Seibel told us how great siebel is and how it runs just fine
on windows .
Colin Bradford of Computacenter did n't really tell us
anything about Microsoft but did do an effective job of plugging
Computacenter 's new testing facility where you can get suppliers to
show you real working systems of their latest and greatest
technologies .
The final part of the show was a Q and A session with the two
Nicks , Philip Dawson and Colin Bradford chaired by the aforemention
daytime TV horror - show .
Eddie Bleasdale of Netproject
asked the most insightful question .
He talked about a customer of his
who had lost data because it was in old Microsoft file formats that
could n't be read by current Microsoft products .
This was slickly dealt
with by McGrath who suggested that he should get the Microsoft people
to talk to him after the show .
Barley added that all the current
Microsoft Office file formats including their XML schema are published
openly .
I 'm not entirely convinced of that but I do n't know enough
about XML to make any definitive statements .
The overall tone of this event makes it fairly clear as to Microsoft 's anti-Linux strategy .
