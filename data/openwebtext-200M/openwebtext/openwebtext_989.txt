" That 's right , I 'm busting myths for two now , " says Kari Byron as she confirms the news about Baby Byron .
This is the first baby for Kari Byron and her husband , Paul Urich .
Kari has been a prominent part of the show , alongside Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara , since she was given a more prominent role starting with its second season .
To celebrate , the 34 - year - old MythBusters star has put together a list of the changes she 's noticed since getting pregnant :
10 . When Grant says " Holy crap , run ! '
I can waddle at best .
9 . My new keen sense of smell is a disadvantage when handling jars of gorilla poo , rotten ballistic gel , or smelly , old socks from fans .
8 . My tummy keeps getting dirty , since I have no sense of how big I am .
7 . I can't tie my own shoes very well , and I wear knee - high work boots .
6 . I made a ' Costanza ' under my desk to I can take naps when no one is looking .
5 . The baby knicks when I am using power tools .
4 . I can't see what I am stepping in .
3 . I am starving all the time !
2. Until it was obvious , everyone thought I was just gaining weight !
1 . If I drop a screwdriver and try to pick it up , sometimes i need help getting back up myself .
' MythBusters ' season seven is set to premiere on April 8 with a two - hour demolition special .
Here are some sexy photos Kari Byron posed for a couple of years ago :
While many professionals may see a corporate relocation as a necessary step in their career path , that does n’t mean it ’s not a major change .
The company you work for you is expecting you to leave your network of friends and family behind and abandon the home you may have known all your life for a strange new city .
While it may be the best opportunity for you , that does n’t mean you should simply accept your move as the cost of doing business and take whatever your boss offers .
Relocation negotiation is a complicated dance , and individuals who go into the process unprepared may walk away with a bad deal .
Relocations are becoming more and more common as companies become global , but even if it ’s a standard process for your company , do n’t expect there to be a plan in place .
You may have to initiate the negotiation yourself , and you should come prepared with terms .
The Cost of Relocating
Relocating can cost a lot of money , particularly if you ’re crossing over state lines , and that ’s one of the key factors when determining the value of a relocation package ; but companies are looking for hard numbers when they enter a negotiation , so come prepared .
Take an inventory of your belongings and get quotes from a commercial moving company so that you can provide your employer with an accurate estimate .
Researching Your New Home
Your employer may think it ’s personally reasonable for you just to pick up and move at the promise of a new job opportunity , but are you sure you ’re ready for the change of environment ?
Finding housing is n’t always easy , and using the justification of searching out a new home or apartment can be a great justification for your employer to fly you out to the city .
It can also be a great means to get your feet wet and explore the local culture .
Terms Within Reasonable Expectations
There are probably at least loose parameters regarding what your employer will offer you for a relocation package , but they would n’t be in a good negotiating position if they were transparent with that information .
Seek out other employees who have received benefit packages , and try to learn more about the terms they took .
This can help you determine how much room you have in negotiating your own deal .
Look at Your Specific Needs
Ultimately when a company decides to pay out a relocation package , it comes down to simple finances .
The specifics are less expensive to your employer than the raw cost of the package .
With that in mind , make a list of the objectives that matter to you and carefully prioritize them .
This could mean the cost of breaking a lease , the need to provide a spouse or partner with assistance finding a new job in their new city , or temporary housing until you can settle on a new rental or mortgage agreement .
Whatever you terms are , determine the very least on which you ’re willing to settle on and make this your line in the sand .
Then , using the expectations you ’ve gleaned from other employees , set your non-mandatory goals as bargaining chips .
From WikiLeaks
June 18 , 2009
Today , Germany 's lower house passed the first Western national internet censorship law .
As every news organization , political newsletter and discussion between friends relocates onto the internet , censorship systems are being rolled out to interpose themselves between every communicator and their audience .
By Claire Ulrich ( translated from the French , Les censeurs du net )
In Internet history , 1994 - 2004 was the era of the pioneers .
2004 -2007 was the era of the merchants .
Now we ’re entering the era of the bullies .
Everywhere in the world , sites are going dark , arrests are increasing , more people are going to prison .
The Web just celebrated its 20th birthday .
Nobody used to take it seriously , but those days are gone .
Nacer ( all first names of Internet users in this article have been changed ) remembers the first computer with Internet access in the national library of Damas , in Syria .
A guard who did n’t speak a word of English came and sat next to you while you were at the computer , to keep an eye on this unfamiliar volatile .
Those were the good old days .
Today , in the comfort of their homes , Syrians surf a censored Web .
However , cybercensorship , and collecting data about Internet users , are not practices limited to dictatorships .
Italy is right up there with Beijing and Shanghai , where cybercafés are required by law to check the IDs of every single client .
In Kazakhstan at the moment , people are strongly advised not to publish the words “ economic crisis ” online .
The president does n’t want them to .
This is quaint compared to the tests going on in Australia to purge the domestic Web of “ pedo- pornographic content . ”
All governments are anxious about the Hydra that is the Internet , but they all act on their concerns according to their culture .
Great Britain is preparing to monitor and archive all electronic communications in the name of the War on Terror .
In France , the battle between the government and Internet users is over the downloading of copyrighted material .
When the dust settles on the legal battlefields , there remains an unequal power relationship : governments and Internet service providers ( ISP ) now have the technological means to detect and block access to sites they find objectionable on a countrywide scale .
When this happens , it ’s called Web “ filtering . ”
ERROR 404 – PAGE NOT FOUND
Web filtering is most often indicated by the “ Page Not Found ” message familiar to all Internet users , free or monitored .
In computer lingo , it ’s called a “ 404 error . ”
The 404 page has always been a problem .
According to a charming tech legend , in the early days of the Web , at CERN in Switzerland , researchers who were sick of continually having to restart a failing server located in office number 404 named the failure - to - connect error after this unlucky office .
Whether the story is true or not , this error page really does have bad karma .
In Oman , in Bahrain , in Dubai , the 404 page works overtime : you are redirected to a message informing you , in English and Arabic , that the site you are looking for is not authorized in the kingdom .
In China , the 404 page does n’t come with an explanation .
There ’s no point ; the sites are censored .
American soldiers in Iraq see it when they try to access YouTube while on base , which is prohibited by the US Army .
They do n’t have that problem in cybercafés in Baghdad .
In Algeria and Egypt , it indicates an actual technical problem .
The Web is n’t filtered there , though it is closely monitored .
You get it in Syria if you try to go to a site that ends in .il , the top - level domain for Israel .
But you ’ll have no trouble getting to a porn site .
And in Tunisia , the 404 page is just fake .
You ’ll get an Internet Explorer or Firefox page informing you that your connection failed .
The only problem is that the Firefox logo displayed when you ’re using Internet Explorer ( or vice versa ) makes it clear that you ’ve landed on a phony page .
In Tunisia , this gave birth to the expression a “ 404 bâchee ” ( canvas - covered ) for the censored pages , a reference to the little canvas - back Peugot pickup truck so popular in Africa .
Tunisian Internet users exclaim in unison , “ And the driver ’s name is Ammar ! ” Ammar , for the first letter of the ATI ( Tunisian Internet Agency ) , an arm of the Tunisian Ministry of the Interior .
FIRST STOP , TUNISIA
On our cruise through Censorland , we must stop over in Tunisia , the first African country to have access to the Internet , that shining gateway to a computerized citizenry and new technologies .
Praised by Bill Gates ( ” I am amazed by Tunisia ” ) , this country is at the forefront of cybercensorship .
Back in 2000 , when the blogosphere was still deserted , the country led the charge by censoring the forum Takriz.org ( ” fed up ” .org ) within its borders .
That same year , its first cyber - dissident , Zouhair Yahyaoui , was arrested in a cybercafé and condemned to 18 months in prison for having published on his site , Tunezine , a survey that asked , “ Is Tunisia a kingdom , a republic , a zoo , a prison ? ”
The 10 - year marriage of the latest cyber - surveillance technologies and a police state has declined into a sad routine – imprisonment of cyber - dissidents and automatic suppression of foreign press sites if even a paragraph is deemed undesirable .
Lofti , a Tunisian who lives in Europe , recalls that he was never able to connect to the site Voila .
fr when he was in the country .
Why ?
Because of the AFP dispatches published on the portal ?
Photos that were too sexy ?
Asking questions is also frowned upon .
Interestingly , the ATI has always , from the beginning , been run by a woman .
Khadija Ghariani , an engineer , Ecole nationale supérieure des telecommunications , Paris , class of ‘ 84 ; Feriel Béji , who has a doctorate in artificial intelligence ; and Lamia Cheffai Sghaier , an electrical engineer , each took turns running the agency .
Among dissidents , they ’re called Ben Ali ’s Angels , a local show with the tagline , “ We ’re here to make you hate the Internet ! ” Tunisia is also a master of cyber - humor .
“ WRITE ‘ JI / AN/G ZE / MIN ’ ”
The other old soldier of cybercensorship is China .
Everyone knows that a Great Firewall shields the eyes of the Chinese from millions of sites .
Accessing Web content freely is just not an option , but the Chinese do n’t complain much ; they ’re used to it .
Writing and conversing online is what they love to do .
It ’s ‘ harmonization ” that aggravates them .
Ever since the Communist Party in China decided to “ construct ” a “ harmonious society ” in 2007 , the Web is not only censored there , it ’s “ harmonized . ”
An automatic filter , an invisible hand , suppresses a word here , a name there , any phrases , comments , blogs , or images that are undesirable .
So they say , “ I ’ve been harmonized . ”
A little lesson learned by e-mail from Edwin , an English - Chinese interpreter who has lived in Wenzhou for a long time : “ Take , for example , the name of the former president Jiang Zemin , the one of Tiananmen fame , which has been meticulously erased from the Chinese Web .
If you write it on a blog or a forum , sometimes it ’s automatically replaced by stars or a blank space , or it could be that you wo n’t even be able to send the message .
It might also be removed after publication .
But you just have to be a little creative .
“ Write ‘ Ji / an /g Ze/ min ’ and you ’re good to go . ”
The censorship robots do n’t understand words with slashes , paraphrases , or the double phonetic meaning of a Chinese character .
What are the notorious forbidden words that they track ?
No one knows but the Party , which chooses them , and the ISPs , which do housework .
Occasionally , a pirated list of prohibited words shows up on the Web .
The latest one contained 1,041 words ( chinadigitaltimes.net/tag/banned - words ) .
These included sex , Tibet , Falun Gong ( a forbidden religious movement ) , Tiananmen , play - boy , fuck , multiple parties , Taiwan independence , police , whore , corruption , torture , public funds , anus , Jesus Christ , riot , insurrection , air disaster , 89 , tyranny , North Korea , scrotum , dictatorship , pigeon , timeshare , penitentiary , Voice of America , bra , Geneva finance , shit .
Even China is starting to have trouble managing its 300 million restless Internet users – the population of the United States – and the flood of their insolent comments , which disturb the general harmony .
Why else would they have hired the “ 50 Cent Gang ” to harmonize opinions on the Web ?
This mysterious group was so named because it is made up of innumerable anonymous workers who are said to be paid a half Yuan ( 0.05 € , the price of a subway ticket ) for every pro-government comment left on forums , chat rooms , and blogs .
Our man in Wenzhou confirms this by e-mail : “ It ’s pretty easy to spot them .
When someone publishes 50 messages in the afternoon of the same day he created a profile , we assume it ’s one of them . ”
Some of these part - timers who lack imagination even give blatant clues , choosing obvious usernames like “ Morning Harmony ” and “ Harmony of the Geranium . ”
THE “ MYANMAR JUNTA OPTION ”
Not all countries have the conviction , or the inexhaustible labor pool that the Chinese censorship industry has .
But there is nonetheless a wide variety of techniques to choose from .
Computer complexities aside , the Web can be compared to a telephone exchange .
To censor it , the easiest thing to do is still to simply pull out the plug connecting the domestic Web to international traffic .
This is the “ Myanmar Junta Option , ” used during the demonstrations in 2007 .
Another method is to throttle the connection speed of individual users .
In Iran , President Ahmadinejad has a blog , but only the government and the clergy have high - speed Internet access .
The average Iranian has to make do with 256k / second , which makes it unlikely that he ’ll be downloading racy films or speeches glorifying atheism , which he could n’t find anyway .
( Just for comparison , a basic ADSL connection in France is 10 times faster . )
Censors can also choose to place the clamp where their domestic Web meets the Worldwide Web , as they do in Saudi Arabia , in order to sift the vice from the virtue at their convenience before allowing content through .
Among the techniques considered outdated today is DNS poisoning , which is practiced in Thailand .
That explains why , in Bangkok , you can pull up a BBC article online and find yourself on the home page of a local government office .
But for your more modern censors , with money to invest , those days are over .
Censorship is selective and flexible , recognizing and suppressing sites or domains with the help of robots that seek out keywords or entire categories of sites .
To do this , of course , you need specialized software .
Tools that behave like parental control software raised to the millionth power , and produce the same result .
And most of these are manufactured in Western countries .
FILTERS “ MADE IN USA ”
In the United States , three serious companies are on the rise , with steadily increasing sales : Secure Computing , Websense and Blue Coat .
Their specialty is the security of business networks and intranets .
According to the OpenNet Initiative , a collaborative research project among Harvard , Toronto , Cambridge , and Oxford Universities that studies cybercensorship , these are the three main providers of filtering tools to governments .
There ’s nothing illegal about selling computer security tools .
The product page of SmartFilter , the leading software product , says “ SmartFilter removes all inappropriate content from the workplace and educational environment , limits your liability , manages bandwidth , and ensures protection against security risks . ”
It ’s thanks to them that office workers ca n’t go to Facebook at work , and that gaming , gambling and pornographic sites ca n’t be accessed by computers in libraries and schools .
But selling these tools to governments of countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia , which we know are n’t too concerned about human rights ?
Secure Computing has always denied these contracts , even going so far as to accuse Iran of “ illegally acquiring ” their software .
Helmi Noman , a Harvard researcher in charge of the Middle East for the OpenNet Initiative , consistently sees the signs of these filtering specialists during the tests that the organization conducts regularly in all the countries of the world .
And if they ’re not the culprits , their partners are .
These tools are also distributed by the biggest names in the computer industry : Microsoft , Sun , Cisco , McAfee , Dell .
Evidently the Emirate of Bahrain has recently done some shopping .
IN BAHRAIN , ONE SIMPLE RULE : WE DON’T TALK ABOUT THE EMIR
In this little Gulf country , described by expatriates as “ pretty cool , ” the rule was short and simple : do n’t talk about the Emir .
Since January , Bahrain has switched into high gear .
Ahmed is a software engineer in Manama , the capital .
He ’s lived through old - school censorship and the new kind too .
He likes taking risks ; one of his pastimes for the last 10 years has been publishing a blog on local news , which regularly causes problems for him .
The worst , in 2005 , ended in 15 days of jail time because he published a photo of the Emir ’s son drinking champagne at the finish line of a Formula 1 race .
At times , his blog has been crudely censored , in a way that was easy to get around .
Since January , and a decree promising to remove from the Web elements that are “ contrary to the culture ” ( pornography , anti-religious material ) , the Web throughout the entire kingdom has been paralyzed .
According to Ahmed , up to 40 % of sites are inaccessible in Bahrain , including advertising , cooking blogs , Google Translate , and technical engineering sites .
It ’s reached the point where foreign companies are complaining because they can’t work .
What happened ?
It ’s a classic scenario , one that Helmi Noman has often seen when a government decides to use these tools .
Overwhelmed by the power of the filtering software that the government has bought and imposed on them , the ISPs make one mistake after another .
However , when it comes to one category of sites in Bahrain , there is no question of an accident on the part of the ISPs or the palace technicians .
Ever since January , all Shiite sites and blogs , though hardly pornographic , have disappeared from the Sunni kingdom .
Ahmed is a Shiite .
He still writes on his blog occasionally , for his foreign readers , and wonders if he ’ll be allowed to leave the country the next time he goes to the airport .
From Doha , in Qatar , where he ’s giving a lecture , Helmi Noman warns about these false - bottomed filtering tools .
“ Western societies are selling ISPs not only filtering software , but also decisions about freedom of expression . ”
The censorship package includes the software plus a database of 20 million sites and updates that can be regularly downloaded , as with antivirus software .
SmartFilter places these sites in 91 categories .
It ’s up to the client to choose the categories he wants to prohibit .
“ When an ISP buys SmartFilter , he is buying 20 million decisions and 91 categories that could be wrong . ”
These “ mistakes ” are fairly common , according to what Helmi Noman has found .
On the day that sites as varied as Orkut ( a social network very popular in India and Brazil ) , Last.fm ( online music ) , LiveJournal ( the most popular blog platform in the former Soviet Union ) , and Twitter ( microblogging ) were labeled “ dating sites ” – for what reason we do n’t know – it was temporarily impossible to access them from different parts of the globe .
In April , 2007 , the video site Dailymotion spent several days in Category V4 ( pornography ) .
Internet users in Oman , Yemen and Tunisia were the ones who felt that : no Dailymotion for them .
The database that feeds the filters can be accessed online ( www.trustedsource.org/urlcheck).
It ’s collaborative .
Anyone – a company , an individual , or the league of virtue of any religion – can flag a site and label it according to his own beliefs , from anywhere in the world , anonymously .
Secure Computing is n’t feeling the recession .
It was just bought by the antivirus giant , McAfee , for 465 million dollars ( around 350 million Euros ) .
The new management is noncommittal in its response to any question about government cyber - surveillance :
“ The governments that are our clients can use all of the categories [ which we provide ] to shape the Internet to suit their cultural needs .
McAfee has no control over , or any say in the way an organization implements its own filtering strategy . ”
To be fair , Europe is doing its share too .
Siemens offers a catalog of solutions for intercepting and monitoring communications .
China is one of their biggest clients .
TALKING BACK WITH TECHNOLOGY
Nobody wants a Web crawling with pedophiles , terrorists and criminals .
But the perfectly democratic example of Australia and its costly offensive against online pedophilia ( budget : 125 million Australian dollars over four years , about 70 million Euros ) got off to an appallingly amateurish start .
In March , during the filtering tests , the ultra-secret blacklist of 2,395 blocked pedophile sites was leaked and ended up on the site for such slip - ups , WikiLeaks .
Fortunately .
The leak revealed that only half of the sites fell into that category .
Some unfortunate errors : the sites of a dentist ’s office , a dog boarding facility , and a travel agency were also on the list .
To create its blacklist , the Australian government – like others – relied on information from the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , a British organization based in Cambridge that has been cataloging sites flagged as pedophile since 1995 .
The IWF is one of 20 such organizations around the world , subsidized mainly by players in the Internet sector .
Little by little , without any oversight , or anything to recommend it but its good intentions , it has become the pedophilia police for the authorities .
In December , an IWF flag resulted in the censorship in Great Britain of the Wikipedia page for Virgin Killer , an album by the German hard rock group , Scorpions .
The cover of this old album , which was never the object of any legal action , shows a nude teenage girl .
The Web has no central government , no universal law , no Red Cross , no seat at the UN .
Every Internet user must deal with the legal whims of his country on his own .
In case of trouble , he might have recourse to a few organizations that defend freedom of expression .
A worthy cause , but a luxury in time of recession .
Once again , the response comes in the form of technology , and it ’s Internet users the world over who come to the rescue .
In Iran , photographer Hamed Saber developed , by himself , a little tool that bypasses the block on the photo site Flickr , which he then made available to the community .
The Berkman Center at Harvard just launched Herdict.org , a site where anyone can flag a site that is inaccessible from a given country , so that they will have real - time data on the Web ’s blind spots .
HUMOR AS A WEAPON
Because they are tech savvy , Edwin in China and Ahmed in the Emirates can read and write whatever they want to , while remaining under the censors ’ radar .
They use “ proxy anonymizers , ” the unattractive name for encryption tools that allow you to discreetly borrow the address of a computer somewhere else in the world just long enough to launch yourself onto the open seas of the uncensored Web .
They are called Ultrareach , Psiphon , TOR , Dynaweb , Anonymizer , and they can all be downloaded .
One of the most popular and activist of these is TOR .
In 2001 , the US Navy released one of its tools for encrypting communications to the public domain .
Robert Dingledine , then a student at MIT , has the long hair and little round glasses of freeware activists .
It was he who decided to adapt the tool to the Web and distribute it for free .
TOR , managed in the United States by a nonprofit organization , has been downloaded millions of times .
“ We do n’t know where they ’re downloading from , we do n’t keep any data .
But we estimate that at any given moment of the day , around the world , between 300,000 and half a million people use one of our connection addresses and encryption to remain anonymous . ”
Encrypting communications on the Web is not illegal anywhere .
But the sites where you can download the “ anonymizers ” are often prohibited .
In Thailand , using a proxy can land you in prison .
The software gets around nonetheless , on USB keys or disks , competing these days with virtual private networks ( VPN ) , encrypted gateways that are used , for example , by multinationals for secure online communication with their foreign branches .
The solution is so simple that Edwin , in Wenzhou concludes , “ If we really wanted to fight cybercensorship , all we ’d have to do is invest a few million dollars in a massive VPN and distribute the links and keywords for free to Internet users .
End of story . ”
A Thai organization , Freedom Against Censorship ( FACT ) , is already doing that on a small scale , to give Thai Internet users a breath of fresh air .
Fifty - thousand sites were shut down during the country ’s various political upheavals , thanks to a legislative Trojan horse : the crime of lèse majesté ( offense ) against King Bhumibol .
This misdeed is no joke ( three to 15 years of prison ) and foreigners can also be prosecuted for it .
An Australian writer and a BBC journalist have had a taste of Thai prisons in the king ’s name .
The free Web has many enemies , but new legions of allies are rising , and giving ministries of information pause .
They are the young people , for whom life without YouTube or Facebook is inconceivable .
The Web 2.0 , that of social networks and photo , video and music sharing , is continually tripping up the censors , whose blunders are much too visible and very unpopular .
On these gargantuan sites , where millions of people , files and links are interconnected , it ’s not easy to isolate a single video , or profile , or conversation .
Had the Turkish government been able to , it would have blocked only one video that was “ insulting ” to the national icon , Ataturk , rather than the entire YouTube site , and thus spared itself the wrath of the under 30s .
In Tunis , when Facebook was completely blocked in September of 2008 , it roused the population for the first time .
It was unheard of ; even the press talked about it .
The last weapon in the Internet users ’ arsenal is humor , and it can be devastating .
Ridicule always kills a policy ’s credibility .
In China , since February , a tough “ antivulgarity ” campaign for a Web without crude language or photos forced ISPs to ask public forgiveness for the “ indecent content ” they had provided and to sanitize thousands of sites and social networks .
It took only a few days to prepare a response .
It came in the form of a little online video of a fluffy alpaca , with an exuberant children ’s chorus singing about the wonders of a mythical Chinese animal , the “ Grass Mud Horse ” ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKx1aenJK08).
In Chinese , “ alpaca ” also means , almost to the tone , “ screw your mother . ”
So does “ grass mud horse . ”
“ He Xie ” ( harmony , and therefore censorship ) is phonetically very close to “ river crab . ”
Here is the alpaca song :
The “ grass mud horse ” ( screw your mother ) lives in the Ma Le desert ( your mother ’s twat ) .
This creature fights the “ river crabs ” ( harmony / censorship ) in order to save the “ prairies ” ( homonym of “ freedom of expression ” ) .
It was a very crude and joyful protest .
But since then , harmony reigns once more , over the living as well as the dead .
Any reference to the children who died in the Sichuan earthquake last year is immediately harmonized .

Sparked by a thread on the CouchDB Users mailing list with promises of beer and internet groupies , I 've started a project to get Bespin running as a CouchApp on CouchDB .
The long - term goal is to allow you to create and edit CouchApps from within Bespin , which is itself a CouchApp .
My first goal was to get Bespin 's UI functioning as a CouchApp .
Except for a few small things , that 's already finished .
Here 's a few screenshots of Bespin running as a CouchApp on my local CouchDB :

Over the next few days I 'll be focusing on porting their filesystem implementation to CouchDB and CouchApp conventions .
If you 'd like to get involved , fork my bespin_couch project and have at it !
Also , if anyone knows how I can make the GitHub repo track upstream changes from Bespin 's Mercurial repo I 'd like to get that setup so I 'm not just working off of a snapshot .
I have n't had time to integrate Disqus with the blog yet so for now if you have any comments please send me a message on GitHub or a reply to @bbrowning on Twitter .
Roving food truck Wafels & Dinges peddles the kind of sugar - crusty Liege wafels and add - on toppings that make for more of a dessert than a breakfast .
But now , though it has n't yet made it to the menu , they 're offering a bacon waffle ( $ 6 ) , available all day but very much in the breakfast spirit : little chunks of bacon embedded in a fluffy Brussels wafel , drowned in maple syrup and shaken with powdered sugar .
The phrase " bacon waffle " is enough to get plenty of hearts pounding in this city , but the real perk is that the bacon waffles are made fresh — bacon stirred into the batter that 's poured into the iron as you watch .
( Other Brussels wafels are always heated up , but sometimes made ahead . )
We 've already noticed that any Wafels & Dinges creation is far , far better when fresh , so a guarantee of a made - to - order waffle is a truly great thing .
( And when there 's bacon , so much the better . )
The Wafels & Dinges truck is usually on the street by 8:00 AM — bad news for the carts selling stale apple fritters , but great news for the rest of us .
And they 've got coffee , too .

The Boss says , " Carol , send an e-mail to the department with my leadership thought of the day . "
Carol says , " What is it ? "
The Boss says , " I 'm busy .
Make up something . "
' That which does n't kill you makes you stronger .
So please slap me in my fat , bald head . '
When I started working in restaurants more than 10 years ago , I was taught to season meat with salt and pepper well before cooking .
Ideally , a whole chicken would be seasoned a full 24 hours before it was roasted , because salting so far ahead of time , I was told , gives the meat more flavor .
I took the practice as gospel , because that ’s what you do in a professional kitchen , especially if it ’s one staffed by talented cooks ( which it was ) who are making good food ( which , in all modesty , we were ) .
When you work in a restaurant , you learn by watching carefully , asking the right questions and following instructions .
That ’s also how you avoid being confronted with the most dreaded question the chef or sous chef could level at you , in front of the rest of the staff : “ What do you think you ’re doing ? ”
So I felt spun around when I worked in another restaurant where the meat was always seasoned with salt and pepper right before cooking .
Salting meat ahead of time , I was now told , dries it out .
Chefs disagree all the time , but rarely about basic technique — and there are few things more basic than sprinkling salt and pepper on steak or short ribs .
But after surveying some notable chefs around the country , I discovered a dispute so divisive it ’s almost ideological .
Not only are there two camps , but each side thinks it is categorically right , and the other , painfully wrong .
On one side you have New York City chefs Tom Colicchio , of Craft and Top Chef fame , and Jean François Bruel of Daniel , both of whom assert that meat should never be seasoned until just before cooking .
( Bruel goes even further with steaks , which he finishes seasoning only after they have been seared or grilled . )
And on the other side you have David Tanis of Chez Panisse in Berkeley , California , and San Francisco ’s Judy Rodgers , whose The Zuni Café Cookbook contains an entire section on the art of salting meat ahead of time .
There ’s no geographic pattern .
Mario Batali of New York City ’s Babbo seasons duck legs for confit the day before .
Suzanne Goin of Los Angeles ’s Lucques does n’t .
I have had knockout meals in the restaurants of all these chefs , and I have never thought that the Berkshire pork at Craft needed more flavor , or that the grilled quail at Chez Panisse was dry .
Chefs at these culinary heights do n’t make such obvious mistakes .
But surely there ’s a correct method , or at least one that ’s more right than the other .
And one that makes more sense for home cooks .
In their search for succulence , chefs often turn to practices like brining ( almost all the meat dishes are brined — soaked for hours in a saltwater solution — at Paul Kahan ’s pork - centric The Publican , in Chicago ) , or sous - vide , which calls for using some fairly expensive equipment to slow - cook food in a low - temperature water bath .
But I wanted to know what was practical and reasonable when making everyday meals at home .
Buying and seasoning a chicken the day before you plan to roast it could n’t be easier .
But the question remained : Is it tastier ?
Before I conducted my own experiments , I decided to consult with scientist Harold McGee , the author of On Food and Cooking and a columnist for the New York Times , where he unravels — and often debunks — assumptions about cooking .
Even though McGee has n’t done controlled tests on the timing of seasoning , he is decidedly in favor of salting meat ahead of time .
( He ’s particularly fond of grinding his own hamburger with seasoned chunks of beef , a recipe from The Zuni Café Cookbook . )
He explained that while a high concentration of salt has a desiccating effect , which is helpful for curing meat , the small amount of salt used to season food has a hydrating effect :
Salt helps the cells hold on to water .
That was the theory I wanted to test .
I bought a sampling of meats , two pieces of different kinds of cuts — one of which I would season 24 hours ahead of time , the other just one hour before cooking .
( Some recipes call for seasoning 48 or even 72 hours in advance ; McGee explained that the further ahead of time the meat is seasoned , the more even the distribution of salt .
But having to prepare a chicken on Sunday in order to roast it on Wednesday is asking a lot . )
I would use the same amount of salt on each piece of meat — three quarters of a teaspoon per pound .
I ’d also weigh the meat both before salting and just before cooking , to see if seasoning ahead of time drew out juices .
( McGee was right : None of the cuts lost water weight from salting . )
And I decided to try a variety of cooking techniques .
I would roast whole chickens and racks of pork , sear dry - aged rib eyes and braise lamb shanks .
I invited over some opinionated friends for this meal of multiple meat courses , all of which we tasted blind — we were a table of good eaters , people who knew their way around a well - marbled steak and a well - timed critique .
But before I started cooking , I realized that I had to prepare myself to be wrong .
If I learned that my training was off the mark , and that all these years I ’d been making one horrible mistake after another by salting meat the day before cooking it , then I had to be willing to change my methods .
The truth ?
I can handle the truth .
And I can easily handle two chickens .
I roasted both for about 45 minutes at 475 degrees , which is in line with what professional kitchens do .
I did n’t add any ingredients to enhance the flavor ( butter , olive oil , spices or herbs ) , just salt and pepper .
The skins of both birds became crispy and golden in the oven , the breasts juicy and delicious .
But the skin of the chicken that was seasoned just before roasting tasted saltier than the meat , and while I ’m not sure I ’d have noticed it on its own , when I sampled it next to the other chicken it seemed clumsy , an amateur effort .
The chicken that had been seasoned the day before was more flavorful , but more than that , it tasted more balanced .
And just as McGee had theorized , it was more succulent .
Next were the dry - aged rib eyes .
I was careful to use good technique , letting the meat come to room temperature before searing it in a cast - iron pan and letting it rest afterward .
Both Tom Colicchio and Suzanne Goin had stressed the importance of these fundamentals .
“ There are so many factors you need to pay attention to , and salt is just one of them , ” Colicchio had said .
When I served the two steaks at a bloody medium - rare , everybody could immediately tell which rib eye was seasoned when .
But there was no consensus on which one was better .
Rob , a chef , said he liked how the salt flavored the fat of the steak that was seasoned the day before , and Christine , my wife , thought it tasted more aged .
But Kerry , who eats out more than anybody I know , leaned toward the brighter flavor of the steak salted right before cooking .
That was also the preference of Mark ( though he might be biased :
His wife is from Argentina , where steaks are seasoned with coarse salt just before grilling ) .
I did n’t feel strongly either way — which was its own judgment .
To me , both steaks were equally juicy and tasty .
As a matter of practicality , picking up a good steak after work and cooking it that night is just fine .
But then I served the two pork racks .
This time , there was a strong consensus :
The one salted just before roasting was clearly moister and more delicious .
The pork seasoned the day before was so dry , it was the most disappointing thing we ate .
And we were just as unanimous when it came to the braised lamb shanks :
The lamb seasoned the day before was exquisite , dramatically better than the other .
If the pork was the evening ’s least inspired dish , this was the most delicious .
It had less to do with a discernible saltiness than the overall composition of flavors .
It tasted richer , fuller , meatier .
Simply put , it tasted more like lamb .
The shanks were as close to a revelation as you ’ll find in an enameled cocotte .
“ I never thought salting ahead would have this profound an effect , ” Rob said .
“ Braising is so forgiving , it ’s low and slow , and there ’s all the flavor from the other ingredients , but this lamb is amazing .
There ’s no comparison . ”
It was a conclusive end to an eye - opening evening .
I had expected to arrive at a hard - and - fast , one - size - fits - all principle , and instead , I arrived at a series of answers weighted by the most practical concern of all :
What ’s worth the effort ?
Some of cooking is art , and some of it is skill , but much of it is logistics , a question of timing and space and making sure you have enough parsnips , say , to feed your guests , but not so many that they crowd the pan and steam instead of roast .
What ’s true at home is also true in a professional kitchen , though we go out to restaurants precisely because they do things we would n’t or could n’t do ourselves .
I could n’t help but think that some chefs do n’t season in advance because it ’s a bother .
But really , it takes no extra effort , just some forethought .
And so I will always season lamb shanks the day before they go into the braise .
I will try to season chickens the day before , but if I do n’t have the chance , I wo n’t sweat it ; and I will season steaks and pork roasts right before searing .
Not only can I handle the truth , I can handle several truths .
Paul Bishop , one of six Clay County Election Board officials arrested in March , may now be cooperating with federal prosecutors
NEW DETAILS : Rush Limbaugh 's ' Hillbilly Heroin ' said used as part of vote - buying scheme | LATE UPDATE : Many new details following today 's guilty plea ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/29/2009 , 11:35 am PT
[ Now updated with a load of new details on the election conspiracy , how it worked , and who the candidates were that allegedly benefited from it , following today 's guilty plea entered in court .
See bottom of article for that new information . ]
A Republican election official , one of six allegedly bi-partisan [ed note : see update below for more on that ]
Clay County , KY , Board of Elections officials arrested last March and charged with a long - term conspiracy to rig elections , buy votes , and manipulate vote - selections on electronic voting machines without the knowledge of voters , has asked to change his plea from not guilty to guilty , according to local news reports ...
The attorney for Paul E. Bishop filed a motion Thursday seeking a hearing for him to plead guilty to one count of racketeering .
That charge alleges that members of the conspiracy used the county Board of Elections as a vehicle to corrupt voting between 2002 and 2007 so they could hold on to power and enrich themselves and others .
According to the indictment [ PDF ] , Bishop was a Republican election judge at precincts in 2002 and 2004 , and hosted meetings at his house where candidates pooled money to be used for buying votes .
The latest report also notes that Bishop , and some of the other conspirators , even employed Rush Limbaugh 's illicit drug of choice , OxyContin , as part of their scheme ...
Bishop 's re-arraignment is thought likely to be an indication that he has decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors .
That could be bad news for the other 7 charged in the scheme , 6 of whom were Board of Elections officials including a Circuit Court Judge , the County Clerk , a School Superintendent , and the county 's Democratic election commissioner .
As we noted when we first reported on this matter in March , the arrests came at a moment when the denialist Baghdad Bobs of the electronic voting industry , and their enablers , facilitators , and apologists in the election official world had been clinging to their last , yet - to - be- fully - destroyed argument in favor of the use of oft - failed , easily - hacked , fully - untransparent electronic voting systems .
The argument in short : though it's now recognized that all e-voting systems on the market are incredibly easy to hack in order to flip elections , nobody has actually yet been caught doing so .
The Clay County arrests , while they involved a fairly low - tech , and incredibly simple , manipulation of actual votes on ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting machines at the polling place after voters had left the booth --- as opposed to direct manipulation of a central vote tabulator machine , as computer scientists , security experts , and election integrity experts had most feared --- quickly pulled the rug out from under one of the " election industry " dead - enders ' last arguments for the continued use of failed , un - democratic , vote - casting and counting equipment which uses private , untested , proprietary , " trade secret " software to unverifiably count votes in secret in our public elections .
The fall of that last rationalization for the use of these systems comes on the heels of one of the previously - discredited rationalizations : we must trust our election officials , they 'd never take advantage of their positions as insiders , with unfettered access to e-voting systems , in order manipulate elections .
( The arrest of Monterey County , CA , 13 - year Registrar of Voters Tony Anchundo , among others , helped shred that myth several years ago . )
An interesting new bit of information in the Lexington Herald - Leader 's coverage of Bishop 's new plea notes that the conspirators are alleged to have used OxyContin --- also known as " Hillbilly Heroin , " the same illegal narcotic which led to the arrest of rightwing drug - addict Rush Limbaugh in 2006 --- to buy votes in the earlier years of their scheme :
Bishop and [ election officer William ]
Stivers also used OxyContin to buy votes at the direction of [ School Superintendent Douglas ]
Adams in 2002 , former Manchester assistant police Chief Todd Roberts told investigators , according to another court document .
A long - term federal narcotics trafficking sting in the County had previously snagged the local mayor and a number of other elected officials prior to the recent arrests in the alleged election - manipulation conspiracy .
In one ( or two ) additional related ironies , Limbaugh himself reportedly had problems voting on the touch - screen used by Palm Beach County , FL , in last year 's primary election in the Sunshine State when his fully - unverifiable Sequoia Edge DRE ( Direct Recording Electronic ) voting machine seemed to have frozen on him , leaving him unaware whether his vote had been counted twice , once , or at all .
Rush 's Palm Beach County , FL , of course , is also the same county where fellow Republican mouthpiece Ann Coulter was found to have committed several voter fraud - related felonies herself .
More recently , she has also been accused of committing voter fraud in the state of Connecticut .
The BRAD BLOG hopes to offer a follow - up report on that ongoing investigation in the near future .
LATE UPDATE : Reports are now coming in following today 's guilty plea by Bishop , including this excellent coverage by the Herald - Leader 's Bill Estep .
Pardon for the long quotage below , but there were a lot of interesting details coming out of today 's plea .
For example , while we 've previously argued that it does n't really matter whether this scam was meant to benefit Republicans or Democrats , and seemed as much about enriching the conspirators as anything else , details from Bishop 's plea seem to point to Republican officials who benefited from it .
Noteworthy new details from Estep 's coverage follows ...
Public officials and candidates in Clay County pooled hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy votes in the 2002 primary election , and bought votes in 2004 for a slate that included a state representative , a former election officer has admitted .
Paul E. Bishop , a former Republican precinct judge , pleaded guilty Friday to helping buy votes .
His plea agreement included new allegations in an investigation that has already shaken the county 's longtime power structure .
For instance , Bishop said that in 2004 , Clay County school Superintendent Douglas C. Adams gave him $ 2,000 to bribe voters .
Bishop said he paid around 100 voters about $ 20 each to vote for a slate of candidates that included state Rep. Tim Couch .
Couch , a Hyden Republican , had defeated Rep. Barbara White Colter in the 2002 GOP primary and was running for re-election in 2004 .
Couch said Friday that he did not ask or tell anyone to buy votes for him and , if it happened , he had no knowledge of it .
But Couch said in an interview that people might have bought votes for him .
" That 's a possibility that they included me on it , " he said of the slate .
" I know there was things that went on over there that I did n't want to be no part of . "
Colter had been part of a group that a drug dealer was asked to buy votes for in May 2002 , according to a court motion filed in an earlier phase of the investigation .
Colter told the Herald - Leader earlier that she heard in 2002 that for a certain price , candidates could join a slate for which votes would be bought , but said she refused .
Couch and Colter have not been charged in the case .
...
Bishop said people involved in the scheme pooled $ 150,000 to $ 250,000 at a meeting in his garage days before the 2002 primary election .
The jailer running for re-election , Charles Marcum , came in with about $ 10,000 in a bread bag and tossed it on the table , Bishop said .
Bishop said others at the meeting included Adams , Thompson , Stivers , Jones and Roy Morgan , a well - known businessman who has been active in county politics .
Marcum and Morgan have not been charged , and neither could be reached for comment Friday .
A woman who answered the phone at Marcum 's house Friday evening said , " That 's ridiculous .
No comment , " when told of Bishop 's allegation .
Adams , who called the 2002 meeting at Bishop 's garage , instructed Bishop how to use some of the cash to buy votes for a slate of candidates that included Marcum and Thompson , who was running for county clerk in the Republican primary against incumbent Jennings B. White , according to the plea agreement .
...
Bishop , a disabled former school - bus driver , faces up to 20 years in prison .
His sentence will probably be much lower than that under advisory guidelines , however .
Bishop 's sentencing is scheduled for October 19th .
The trial for the other 7 conspirators in the case is currently scheduled to begin in September .
UPDATE !
Check out our coverage and video of Susan Boyle at the O2 Center in Dublin ...

Time is running out for Susan Boyle fans in Dublin .
With less than 30 hours to go , organizers are still unsure if Susan Boyle will perform at the O2 Arena in Dublin .
Organizers David Ian Productions said the popular star of Britain 's Got Talent was making her decisions on a " day - to - day " basis .
A spokesperson said : " We are led by her on a daily basis .
We check in with her each morning to see how she 's feeling and she lets us know , through her people , if she 'll be there on the night . "
" We 'll have to check in again on the day and see how she is .
We always have to wait until the morning of the show to get absolute confirmation from her . "
The troubled singer has missed several dates on the tour which showcases all 10 of the Britain 's Got Talent finalists .
Boyle , whose parents came from Donegal , shot to fame after her breathtaking audition on the show back in April .
She dedicated her success on the show to her late mother Bridget who died in 2007 .
Boyle is clearly the main attraction of the show for Irish fans who have been lighting candles in churches in Dublin for her .
In Donegal today , Nancy Sheeran , 54 , said she would boycott the concert if Boyle did not appear .
" The only reason I bought a ticket was to see Susan , " she said .
" She has become such an inspiration for lonely women . "
" She 's come out of absolutely nowhere and blown everyone else off the stage .
" The organizers should make sure she is well enough to perform but if she 's not singing , I 'm not going .
" I 've no interest in seeing a bunch of teenagers with their whole lives ahead of them .
" I want to see this woman who was written off by everyone and then stunned the world . "
Boyle became an international household name after her stunning audition on the Britain 's Got Talent show .
Her clips on YouTube have been watched more than 100 million times and the star now has her own channel .
Jupiter ’s massive size , coupled with Io ’s close orbital distance to the planet , expose the moon to powerful gravitational forces .
These forces constantly deform the moon , generating the heat that powers its volcanism .
Similar , but less powerful , ‘ tidal ’ forces are thought to power geysers of water vapour erupting from Saturn ’s icy moon Enceladus ( Illustration of Jupiter and Io : V Lainey / IMCCE - Paris Observatory )
Hot lava ( left ) glows on one of Io ’s active volcanoes in this image taken by the Galileo spacecraft in 2000 ( Image : Galileo Project / JPL / NASA )
The most volcanically active body in the solar system has just received a death sentence .
Jupiter ’s moon
Io , whose surface erupts with active volcanoes , will one day become dormant , a new study analysing more than 100 years of observations suggests .
Io , which is about the size of Earth ’s moon and is Jupiter ’s closest large satellite , is covered with lava flows and dozens of active volcanoes ( see image ) .

The heat for this activity comes from the fact that the moon travels on an elongated path around Jupiter , and therefore feels the giant planet ’s gravity at different strengths along its orbit .
This varying pull causes its body to deform , producing bulges that move its surface up and down by an estimated 10 metres per orbit .
This generates heat that powers the moon ’s volcanism .
But it will not always be so , according to a new study led by Valéry Lainey of the Paris Observatory in France .
Out of resonance
If Io were Jupiter ’s only satellite , the planet ’s intense gravity would eventually pull the nearby moon into a circular orbit .
The reason it travels on an elliptical path instead is because of special gravitational interactions with its nearest large sister moons , Europa and Ganymede .
For every orbit that Ganymede makes , Europa makes two and Io four – a type of gravitational relationship called a Laplace resonance .
But Lainey and colleagues have found that the moons are , in fact , moving out of their resonance – Europa and Ganymede are gradually drifting away from Jupiter , while Io is moving towards the planet .
The team came to these conclusions after carrying out numerical calculations of Io ’s orbital motion and plugging in observations of Io , Europa and Ganymede taken between 1891 and 2007 .
Speed trade - off
Though different gravitational forces act on Io , with some pulling it towards Jupiter and others pushing it away , the new study suggests the inward forces win out .
Io ’s spin gradually increases at the expense of its orbital speed .
When it is closest to Jupiter , gravitational pulls on Io ’s near side act to make the moon spin faster .
“ Io loses orbital energy , its orbital period decreases , and it moves inward towards Jupiter , ” explains Gerald Schubert of the University of California , Los Angeles , in a commentary accompanying the study .
“ Others have attempted the same calculation in the past , but with poorly constrained – and often contradictory – results , probably owing to approximations made in their orbital dynamical models , ” Schubert writes .
Fading to black
It is not clear exactly when the moons will break free from their resonance .
“ If this occurs on a short timescale , say [ 100 million ] years or less , then we have been lucky to see
Io in its volcanic glory , because dormancy will be the fate of Io when the resonance is broken , ” Schubert writes .
Other moons in the solar system may have already gone through a similar process .
Neptune ’s largest moon , Triton , boasts small geysers – “ like somebody just punched a hole in the surface with a meteorite and released some gases that are trapped there ” , Schubert told New Scientist .
But its volcanism may have been more dramatic if its orbit ever caused it to experience more tidal heating , he says : “ It ’s possible the moon was more active in the past . ”

A preliminary autopsy Thursday did not reveal any identifying information on remains found on the bank of a river , less than 30 miles from the homes of two missing Illinois women .
Partial skeletal remains were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon , Illinois .
The " partial skeletal remains " were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon , Illinois , according to Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil 's office .
A statement issued by O'Neil 's office said a forensic examination was inconclusive as to identity , race or sex of the body parts , which consisted of a rib cage , spinal column and partial left and right femur bones .
A marine cleanup crew , which discovered the remains Wednesday , also found shreds of blue jeans and a small amount of money .
The Illinois State Police Forensic Crime Laboratory is expediting a DNA analysis , which will take at least two weeks , the statement said .
Illinois State Police were on the scene Thursday conducting additional searches , said spokesman Sgt. Tom Burek .
On Sunday , Michelle Williams found a blue barrel in Channahon , Illinois , along the river and called police .
Watch Williams describe her grisly find »
Channahon is 20 miles from Bolingbrook , Illinois , where Stacy Peterson lived with her husband , former police officer Drew Peterson .
The former officer 's stepbrother told police he helped Drew Peterson move a heavy blue barrel shortly after his wife 's disappearance police uncover skeletal remains »
Williams said she did n't initially make any connection regarding the barrel , but she did call police .
" It was n't until yesterday afternoon when the news broke that there had been skeletal remains washing up on shore and that far away from the blue barrel , I had a sick feeling to my stomach when I heard that , " Williams told CNN 's Nancy Grace .
Stacy Peterson disappeared in October 2007 .
Her husband has been named a suspect in her disappearance , but he has maintained his innocence , saying she left him for another man .
Stacy Peterson , 23 when she was last seen , was Drew Peterson 's fourth wife .
This month , Drew Peterson , 55 , was indicted on murder charges in the 2004 death of his third wife , Kathleen Savio , while the two were in the midst of a nasty divorce .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Savio's death was originally deemed an accident , but authorities took a second look at the case after Stacy Peterson 's disappearance .
Channahon is also 15 miles from Plainfield , Illinois , where Lisa Stebic was last seen in April 2007 .
On the day she went missing , she petitioned a court to have her husband , Craig , evicted from their Plainfield home .
Craig Stebic told police he was working in the backyard when his 37 - year - old wife left home about 6 p.m. , taking her cell phone and purse .
Authorities have said they believe that Lisa Stebic was the victim of foul play and have named Craig Stebic a suspect .
CNN 's Kara Devlin contributed to this report .

" Weird Al " may well have been one of the most influential singers on me growing up .
He had silly , funny songs perfect for a 12 year - old boy , and they were all hit rock songs to begin with , so it was win-win .
But with this genius new video " Craigslist , " Weird Al parodies my favorite band of all time , The Doors , but not by spoofing one of their songs .
He delivers the entire Doors ouvre in earnest , accompanied by their famously zealous keyboardist , Ray Manzarek .
He croons about selling old cars like mine on Craigslist

With rapid urban growth , economic development , and a significant increase in vehicles in the past three decades , Beijing , China , suffers from severe air pollution .
The air quality in Beijing is determined by its geography , weather conditions , and anthropogenic ( human - generated ) emissions .
This series of images made from data collected by the Multi -Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MISR ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite shows how changes in emissions and weather conditions during the 2008 Olympic Games affected air pollution over East China , including Beijing .
During the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games ( August 8 to September 17 , 2008 ) , the government strictly controlled emissions : traffic volume was reduced by 40 to 50 percent , and regional power generation and consumption were throttled back .
The dramatic , rapid drop in air pollution was documented by MISR , which measures the density of particles in the atmosphere ( aerosols ) .
In these images , high aerosol concentrations ( poor air quality ) are brown , while low concentrations ( good air quality ) are cream .
During the Olympics , air quality in Beijing improved , but it still fluctuated because weather conditions and geography allow air pollution to either disperse or to become concentrated .
Beijing sits at the northern edge of the North China Plain , which is bounded on the north and west by mountain ranges .
Winds blowing south or east push pollutants out of the city , while north or west - blowing winds cause pollutants to pile up over the city along the mountain front .
Pollution controls went into effect on July 20 , but Beijing experienced heavy particle pollution on July 25 ( top left ) .
MISR recorded high aerosol concentrations ( dark brown ) in the entire Beijing metropolitan area .
Daily fine particle pollution ( PM - 2.5 ) concentrations in downtown Beijing reached 140 micrograms per cubic meter .
( The Clean Air Act limit in the United States is 35 micrograms per cubic meter . )
Emissions combined with weather conditions led to highly polluted air on July 25 .
Temperatures were high in the morning , about 27 degrees Celsius ( 81 degrees Fahrenheit ) , creating conditions in which smog could form .
Light winds from the east and southeast trapped the polluted air mass over the region .
Clouds covered Beijing when MISR observed the city during the Olympic Games , so the instrument was unable to record pollution levels during the games .
By September 2 ( upper right ) , strict air pollution control measures had been fully implemented for three weeks .
Cooler temperatures ( 23 C , or 73 F ) , lower relative humidity ( about 60 % ) , and higher wind speed ( about 8 meters / second , or 18 miles per hour ) from the north in the morning worked with the significantly lower emissions to create a very clean air day .
MISR recorded very low aerosol concentrations over the entire Beijing area .
On the ground , the daily PM 2.5 concentration was 19 micrograms per cubic meter .
On September 4 , the wind blew from the south at approximately 7 meters / second ( 16 miles per hour ) in the morning .
The air pollution control measures were still in effect , but regional pollution transport began to influence the air quality in Beijing .
The MISR aerosol concentrations over Beijing were still low , as shown by the lighter tones of brown in the lower left image , and daily PM 2.5 concentrations on the ground were also relatively low ( 35 micrograms per cubic meter ) .
But aerosol concentrations over the heavily industrialized regions south of Beijing were climbing .
Winds would carry this pollution into the city , affecting Beijing ’s air quality on September 5 and 6 .
By September 20 , anthropogenic emissions began to return to pre-Olympic levels , although some air pollution control measures remained in effect .
The combined effects of cooler air temperature ( 21 C , or 70 F ) , relatively high winds ( 8 meters per second , or 18 miles per hour ) from the north , and increased emissions created a typical day with moderate particle pollution .
MISR observed moderated aerosol concentrations over Beijing , and daily PM2.5 concentrations at the monitoring site were 70 micrograms per cubic meter .

The realm of dress tie knots is dominated by a handful of traditional tie knots .
Check out this rather unique tie knot and be the first on your block to sport it .
If you 're a very sharp - eyed fan of Matrix movie trilogy , you 'll recognize the knot captured below as a rare specimen sported by " The Merovingian . "
The knot itself did n't originate with the movie , and is n't rightfully named " The Merovingian Knot , " but the Ediety Knot .
Still , it 's nearly impossible to find any reference to it independent of the movie , so let 's just keep the Wachowski - an etymology for now .
As Henry notes during his demonstration in the video below , it 'll get big raves from Matrix obsessives , but everyone else will at least admire your fancy " French knot . "
Whether you 're dying to try it out , or think you 'll be sticking with the Windsor knot , tell us your impressions ( or other tie knot recommendations ) in the comments .

Hirb just got two sweet features with the 0.2 release – a pager and a selection menu .
With the pager , you ’ll never have to scroll because irb dumped an ungodly inspect ( ) on you .
With the selection menu , you ’ll have RI taking useful method dumps in no time .
To play with what follows , you ’ll need the latest Hirb :
gem install hirb
Paging With Irb
If you ’re unsure that irb ’s output can be quite horrendous at times :
bash > irb - rubygems >> Gem.source_index # Human sacrifice , dogs and cats living together ... mass hysteria !
Sure , we can turn it off :
>> conf.echo = false >> Gem.source_index >> # Sorry to disappoint you Dr. Venkman
But sometimes we want to see some of the output , we want to explore an API , we want to sift through an object ’s guts and find something useful .
But mostly , we just do n’t want to be crapped on for executing our half - baked crap … I mean code .
Enter the pager :
bash > irb - rubygems - rhirb >> Hirb.enable => nil >> Gem.source_index => #
Just a screenful of output here .
Cheers and hip hoorays ensue .
Is that it ?
That ’s it .
Hirb by default has paging turned on .
You can specify your own pager command or have it detect your system ’s pager i.e. ENV [ ' PAGER ' ] , less or more .
If no system pager is detected it defaults to a very basic ruby pager : you page or you quit .
So you may be wondering , is every irb output paged ?
Hell no .
Hirb is aware of your console ’s width and height and uses that to only page output that exceeds a screenful .
If you ’re a * nixer , Hirb should be able to detect your width and height :
bash > irb - rubygems - rhirb >> Hirb.enable => nil >>
Hirb :: View.width => 208 >>
Hirb :: View.height =>
51 # Sweet , hirb detected my console size .
# I can take advantage of this auto - detection i.e. after changing my console window 's size . >>
Hirb :: View.resize => [ 172 , 45 ]
If autodetection does n’t work , it ’s still pretty easy :
bash > irb - rubygems - rhirb # Let 's determine our width .
#
Use the line that starts wrapping to give you an approximate width . >> 80.step ( 200 , 10 ) { |e| puts e.to_s + " * " * ( e - e.to_s.size ) ; sleep 0.2 } 80******************************************************************************
90**************************************************************************************** #
Let 's do something similar for height .
#
Stop it when two numbers are n't on the same screen anymore # 25.step ( 80 , 5 ) { |e| puts "*
" * ( e - 1 ) + e.to_s ; sleep 1.5 } >>
Hirb.enable :width=>your_width , :height=> your_height => nil #
If you change your console window , just explicitly pass your width and height : >>
Hirb :: View.resize( 120 , 30 )
Improving RI With Menus
RI is pretty handy as far as keystrokes to documentation goes .
But it can be improved .
Before improving it , let ’s look at the selection menu that comes with Hirb :
bash > irb - rubygems - rhirb >> extend Hirb :: Console => main >> menu ( ' a '..'h') .to_a +--------+-------+ | number | value |
+--------+-------+ | 1 | a | | 2 | b | | 3 | c | | 4 | d | | 5 | e | | 6 | f | | 7 | g | | 8 | h | +--------+-------+
8 rows in set Choose : #
Here 's where you type # Typing : 1 - 3,6-7 = > [ " a " , " b " , " c " , " f " , " g " ] # Typing : 1..3,6..7 = > [ " a " , " b " , " c " , " f " , " g " ] # Typing : * => [ " a " , " b " , " c " , " d " , " e " , " f " , " g " , " h " ] # Typing : enter / return => [ ]
As you can see , menu ( ) uses Hirb ’s tables to display the array .
You can select a subset by specifying ranges with - and separating multiple ranges with , .
If you ’re feeling rubyish you can use .. for ranges i.e. 1..3 , 6..7 .
So what ’s the big deal ?
Ruby ’s Array.slice ( ) can do most of this already .
Well , let ’s go back to rdoc ’s ri .
You may or may not be familiar with ri’s interactive mode , ri - i .
Basically it allows you to autocomplete methods as you would in irb .
This ri feature seems to have been started by Daniel Choi .
As part of his patch he had a basic selection menu for resolving multiple matches on a query .
Let ’s see if we can continue where Daniel left off using Hirb ’s menu( ) .
First we need to figure out how to query ri and get back a list of matches .
If you look at the ri command , you see that ri is run by the class RDoc: : RI : : Driver .
So if we create an RDoc: : RI : : Driver object , how can we select a list of matches ?
If you look around , you ’ll figure out select_methods is what we want :
bash > irb - rubygems >> require ' rdoc/ri/driver ' => true => conf.echo = false >> driver = RDoc::RI ::Driver.new ( RDoc::RI::Driver.process_args([' set_trace ' ] ) ) >> matches = driver.select_methods(/set_trace / ) >> conf.echo = true >> matches.class => Array >> matches [ 0 ] => { " visibility " =>" public " , " name " = > " set_trace " , " is_singleton " = > true , " params " = > " ( arg ) " , " block_params " => nil , " aliases " = > [ ] , " full_name " = >" DEBUGGER__::set_trace " , " comment " => nil , " source_path " = >" Ruby 1.8 " } # Let 's pass a specific match back to ri to get it 's documentation >>
RDoc::RI :: Driver.run [ matches [ 0 ] [' full_name ' ] ]
--------------------------------------------------
DEBUGGER__::set_trace DEBUGGER__::set_trace ( arg ) From Ruby 1.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------ [ no description ] => [ " DEBUGGER__::set_trace " ]
Knowing how to extract an ri query result and feed it back to ri , let ’s use a Hirb menu with its block syntax which passes the chosen items to the block :
>> require ' hirb ' ; extend Hirb :: Console => main >> menu( matches , : fields= >[ ' full_name ' ] ) { |e| RDoc::RI ::Driver.run( e.map { |e| e[' full_name ' ] } )
} +--------+-----------------------------------+
| number | full_name | +--------+-----------------------------------+ | 1 | DEBUGGER__::set_trace | | 2 | DEBUGGER__::Context#set_trace | | 3 | DEBUGGER__::Context#set_trace_all | | 4 | Kernel#set_trace_func
| +--------+-----------------------------------+
4 rows in set Choose : 1 - 3 # You type 1 - 3 # Prints the ri documentation for the first 3 methods
All of a sudden we have the choice to see the documentation of any method (s ) !
Simply type a number or a range of numbers .
What if we could apply this to a Ruby class i.e. list a class ’ methods and choose from them ? :
def ri ( original_query , regex = nil ) query = original_query .
to_s ri_driver = RDoc : :RI :: Driver .
new ( RDoc : :RI :: Driver .
process_args ( [ query ] ) ) # if query is a class ri recognizes if ( class_cache = ri_driver .
class_cache [ query ] ) methods = [ ] class_methods = class_cache [ " class_methods " ]. map { | e | e [ " name " ] } instance_methods = class_cache [ " instance_methods " ]. map { | e | e [ " name " ] } if regex class_methods = class_methods .
grep ( / #{ regex } / ) instance_methods = instance_methods . grep ( / #{ regex } / ) end all_methods = class_methods .
each { | e | methods << { : name => " #{ query } .
#{ e } " , : type => : class }} + instance_methods .
each { | e | methods << { : name => " #{ query } .
#{ e } " , : type => : instance }} menu ( methods , : fields =>[ : name , : type ] ) do | chosen | system_ri ( * chosen . map { | e | e [ : name ] } ) end else results = ri_driver .
select_methods ( / #{ query } / ) menu ( results , : fields =>[ ' full_name ' ] , : ask => false ) do | chosen | system_ri ( * chosen . map { | e | e [ ' full_name ' ] } ) end end end def system_ri ( * queries ) :: Hirb : : View .
capture_and_render { RDoc : :RI :: Driver . run ( queries ) } end
I ’ll let you figure out how the above works .
Let ’s just use it :
# Would n't it be nice to page as above >> Hirb.enable => nil >> ri Array +--------+--------------------------+----------+
| number | name | type |
+--------+--------------------------+----------+ | 1 | Array . [ ] | class | | 2 | Array.new | class | | 3 | Array .& | instance | | 4 | Array .* | instance | | 5 | Array .+ | instance | | 6 | Array .- | instance | | 7 | Array .<< | instance | | 8 | Array .<=> | instance | | 9 | Array.== | instance | | 10 | Array . [ ] | instance | # omitting the other 71 rows for brevity Choose : 1 - 10 # Out comes the documentation for the 2 class methods and the first 8 instance methods .
#
If we want to filter a subset of a class , just pass a second argument to be interpreted as a regex .
#
Any methods containing ' to ' >> ri Array , :to +--------+---------------+----------+ | number | name | type |
+--------+---------------+----------+ | 1 | Array.to_a | instance | | 2 | Array.to_ary | instance | | 3 | Array.to_s | instance | | 4 | Array.
to_yaml | instance | +--------+---------------+----------+
Choose :
In the first example above , paging works not only for the menu but also for all the ri output .
If you take a look at the above ri ( ) method , you ’ll see that it wrap ri’s output with a Hirb :: View.capture_and_render block .
As you may have guessed , that method capture ’s ri’s STDOUT and run ’s it through Hirb ’s pager .
If you ’re curious , the actual ri library I use in irb is here .
It covers some more ri edge cases I did n’t go into here .
That library could easily be made into a command if you want .
Update :
To install this code to be run from the commandline or irb as a Boson library :
bash > boson install http://github.com/cldwalker/irbfiles/blob/master/boson/commands/public/ri.rb bash > boson ri Array # ...
Or if you just want to use it in irb without Boson , drop this in your irbrc :
require ' hirb ' Hirb.enable extend Hirb :: Console load " / path/to/ri_library " class << self ; include Ri ; end

Colbert gets congressman to say cocaine , prostitutes ' give him joy ' David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 8 , 2009
Print This Email This
In a reprise of his periodic attempts to get elected officials to confess to illegal activities , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert got a New York congressman to " confess " to enjoying the company of cocaine and prostitutes .
It 's not the first time Colbert has gotten a congressman to " confess . "
In 2007 , Colbert famously needled Rep. Robert Wexler ( Fla - Dem ) into saying cocaine and prostitutes were an enjoyable pasttime .
Colbert joined Rep. Dan Maffei ( NY - Dem ) during his " Better Know a District " segment Tuesday night -- with both the Comedy Central host and the congressman dressed in " evil twin " Star Trek getups .
" Let 's say a few things the good Congressman Maffei would never say , " Colbert quipped .
" Complete this sentence ... I enjoy cocaine because ... "
" I enjoy cocaine because ... " Maffei began .
" This gives me joy , " Colbert interjected .
" It gives me joy ! " Maffei returned .
Later , at Colbert 's prompting , Maffei added , " I enjoy the company of prostitutes for the following reasons : it represses women , it 's generally illegal ... "
" And this gives you joy ? " said Colbert .
" It does , " Maffei replied .
At Huffington Post , Jason Linkins thought that " Maffei 's good humor served him well -- at least better than his beer - shotgunning skills , which proved to be a bit of a failure . "
Maffei told the Syracuse 's Post Standard a few weeks ago , " I proved myself less of a nerd than I thought I was . "
" I need to be a cheerleader for the district , " Maffei said .
" And besides , I think you 're better off getting ( the interview with Colbert ) done , rather than resisting . "

An expert has said that he has serious concerns over how children could use personal location tracking services like Google Latitude .
John Carr , secretary of the UK's Children Charity Coalition for Internet Safety , said that the web body had issues with Google Latitude and personal data , and the way consent is obtained to use it .
Latitude was released by Google in February , and lets users show selected friends their location using their mobile phone .
" Imagine you 're on Facebook or Twitter with your personal profile , and you hook in Latitude or Fire Eagle , or one of these geo-location services , " Carr said .
" You 've got 5,000 friends ?
You have n't got 5,000 friends , you 've got 5,000 people who now know exactly where you are , in real - time , 24/7 , 365 days of the year . "
He said that if an adult who knew what they were getting into chose to do that , it was their own business .
However , he said that many children did n't have the capacity to know about the risks that they were undertaking by using these services .
He went on : " And yet , because these are free and paid for by advertisers , that 's already happening and is happening more .
It will raise all sorts of issues . "
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Detroit ’s top - selling auto brands , Ford and Chevrolet , have almost eliminated a long - criticized gap with Toyota in new car quality , according to a closely watched survey released on Monday .
Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive and President Alan Mulally ( L ) , Executive Chairman Bill Ford ( 2nd L ) , President of the Americas Mark Fields and Group Vice President of Product Development Derrick Kuzak ( R ) pose next to the 2010 Taurus sedan during press days at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan in this January 11 , 2009 file photo .

Luxury brands captured the top three spots , while Chevrolet , Ford and Toyota were in what amounted to a statistical dead heat further down in the rankings , the survey by J.D. Power and Associates found .
“ Have the leading domestic nameplates caught up with Toyota ?
The answer is almost , ” Dave Sargent , vice president for auto research at J.D. Power , said at a briefing in Detroit .
Sargent said the gap is “ as narrow as it has ever been . ”
New vehicles sold by the three U.S. automakers have improved in initial quality by an average of 10 percent compared with 2008 , according to the survey , which records difficulties faced by new car owners in the first 90 days of ownership .
The results underscored the competitive pressure on the industry at a time when U.S. sales have been driven to 30 - year lows and both GM and Chrysler have been forced to rely on federal financing to restructure through bankruptcy .
Overall vehicle quality improved at its fastest rate since 2004 , reflecting improved consumer satisfaction with 2009 model - year vehicles and fewer reported problems .
Toyota Motor Corp 's 7203 .T
Lexus brand took the title for highest quality followed by Porsche .
General Motors Corp's GMGMQ.PK Cadillac was No. 3 in J.D. Power 's Initial Quality Study .
Boosted by a strong reception for its high - end Genesis sedan , Hyundai Motor Co 005380 .KS pushed ahead of both Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267 .
T to become the top - ranked mass - market auto brand and No. 4 overall .
Honda ranked No. 5 , followed by Mercedes - Benz , Toyota , Ford and GM ’s Chevrolet .
“ It is gratifying to see our commitment to quality paying off , ” said Bennie Fowler , Ford group vice president of quality .
“ We ’re now tied with the best of the Japanese automakers . ”
The results of the survey , the most comprehensive benchmark of new car quality , are used heavily in auto industry marketing and are seen as influential in shaping consumer perceptions .
It is also watched as a barometer for resale values and as a proxy for warranty costs .
CLOSING THE GAP
U.S. automakers have spent heavily in recent years in a bid to close the gap with the Japanese automakers led by Toyota and Honda , which have established a reputation for eliminating flaws from engineering and manufacturing .
GM says its warranty claims have dropped 45 percent in the last three years , evidence of the progress it has made under a renewed push to improve quality .
The automaker is routinely spending more on invisible components like engine mounts and dashboard pads to improve the driving experience , said Jamie Hresko , GM ’s quality chief .
“ We ’re moving in the right direction but I would not say we ’re satisfied , ” Hresko said .
“ We still have a perception problem and that ’s not something that will change overnight . ”
On average across the industry , U.S. consumers reported 108 problems per 100 vehicles sold , J.D. Power said .
That was down from 118 problems per 100 vehicles a year earlier .
Among domestic U.S. auto brands , Ford , Chevy and Mercury performed better than the industry average .
By contrast , Chrysler ’s three brands -- Chrysler , Jeep and Dodge -- placed in the bottom 10 brands in terms of reported problems .
Chrysler said its own measures showed it was improving in quality and the J.D.
Power data showed that its brands taken together were gaining ground .
“ While the improvement is encouraging , we have by no means arrived at a resting place , ” Doug Betts , Chrysler ’s senior vice president for quality , said in a statement .
The operating company for Chrysler was sold out of bankruptcy earlier this month .
Operational control of Chrysler has passed to Italy 's Fiat SpA FIA .
MI , which has a 20 percent stake .
BMW ’s MINI was the lowest - ranked brand with 165 reported problems for every 100 cars sold .
Among vehicles , Toyota ’s Yaris was placed top for quality among subcompact cars , Nissan ’s Altima was ranked first among mid-size sedans while Chevrolet Trailblazer , Ford ’s Edge and Toyota ’s 4 Runner tied for the top place among midsize SUVs .
Among full - size pickups , Ford ’s best - selling F - 150 and Toyota ’s Tundra tied for the top rank .

The Washington Times says it has damning new information about the relationship between AIG and Senator Chris Dodd :
As Democrats prepared to take control of Congress after the 2006 elections , a top boss at the insurance giant American International Group Inc. told colleagues that Sen. Christopher J. Dodd was seeking re-election donations and he implored company executives and their spouses to give .
I understand why this provocative , but I 'm not sure why it 's important .
Sure , you can be angry about the influence corporations wield in American elections ( Ralph Nader has made a second career out of it ) .
But that anger should n't apply uniquely to Chris Dodd .
There is nothing illegal about soliciting individual campaign donations .
And , more importantly , there is no evidence that Dodd did anything in exchange for these campaign donations .
Or is there ?
The Washington Times says there is evidence that Dodd helped AIG : " He acknowledged that he slipped a provision into legislation in February that authorized the bonuses , but said the Treasury Department asked him to do it . "
But I can't get myself worked up about this , for three reasons .
First , the provision is question did n't " authorize " the AIG bonuses , and it 's lazy phrasing to say it did .
The provision in question did n't " authorize " anything .
And it certainly did n't apply uniquely to AIG .
The provision just limited the compensation restrictions in the stimulus bill to contracts finalized after February 11 2009 .
( And that date was n't chosen because it was convenient for the fat cats at AIG -- it just happened to be the date that Congress finished its negotiations on the stimulus . )
If there 's evidence that this was inserted to protect AIG , I have n't seen it .
JUNE 12 -- A North Carolina man is facing criminal charges for creating an amusing piece of public art from construction barrels .
Joseph Carnevale , 21 , was nabbed Wednesday after a Raleigh Police Department investigation determined that he was responsible for the work ( seen here ) constructed May 31 on a roadway adjacent to North Carolina State University .
Carnevale , pictured in the mug shot at left , was charged with misdemeanor larceny for allegedly building his orange monster from materials pilfered from a construction site .
According to an arrest warrant , Carnevale ' destroyed three road blocking barrels by cutting and screwing them together to form a statue . '
Police estimated that Carnevale 's artwork caused $ 360 in damages to Hamlett Associates , the North Carolina construction company that owned the barrels .
Carnevale is scheduled for a July 21 court appearance in Wake County .

Chicago Cubs catcher Geovany Soto said he has been informed by the International Baseball Federation that he tested positive for marijuana at the World Baseball Classic .
" While I fully acknowledge my inappropriate behavior , I want to assure my fans and my family that this was an isolated incident , " Soto said in a statement released by the Cubs .
" I do not say this to minimize or deflect from my conduct and I fully understand the ramifications of my actions .
I have and will accept any and all consequences .
" I am fully dedicated to the game of baseball and my teammates , and I apologize for any distraction and embarrassment this may cause them . "
Neither the Cubs nor Major League Baseball will penalize Soto , according to sources contacted by ESPNChicago.com 's Bruce Levine .
MLB does not regularly test for marijuana since it's not considered a performance - enhancing drug , according to a players ' association spokesman interviewed by Levine .
But if MLB has suspicion that a player is involved with a drug like marijuana , it can ask for that player to be tested .
This incident may open Soto to future testing .
And if the result of the MLB test is positive , the league can fine and / or suspend the player .
The Cubs released a statement while playing the Tigers in Detroit .
" Geovany assured the organization this was an isolated incident and a misstep in judgment that will not be repeated , " the statement read .
" Though surprised and disappointed , the club supports Geovany as he takes responsibility for his actions and accepts the consequences . "
After Thursday's 6 - 5 loss to Detroit , Soto told reporters , " I 'd appreciate if this is the last time we talk about it .
It 's embarrassing . "
Soto played for Puerto Rico in the WBC .
Last year , he was voted National League Rookie of the Year after hitting .285 with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs and starting the All - Star Game .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .

For the first half - hour of the meeting , it was hardly surprising to see a potential client fiddling with his iPhone , said Rowland Hobbs , the chief executive of a marketing firm in Manhattan .
At an hour , it seemed a bit much .
And after an hour and a half , Mr. Hobbs and his colleagues wondered what the man could possibly be doing with his phone for the length of a summer blockbuster .
Someone peeked over his shoulder .
“ He was playing a racing game , ” Mr. Hobbs said .
“ He did ask questions , though , peering occasionally over his iPhone . ”
But , Mr. Hobbs added , “ we did n’t say anything .
We still wanted the business . ”

Microsoft has warned users that an as - yet unpatched vulnerability in DirectX is under attack from ne'er - do - wells .
In a Security Bulletin on the company 's website – found via BetaNews – the company warns that a vulnerability in thelibrary which ships with DirectX for the parsing of QuickTime format video files .
A successful attack against the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution .
The flaw affects all versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista – including Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and Windows XP .
Server editions prior to Windows Server 2008 are also vulnerable .
The attack requires that a specially crafted QuickTime media file is opened by the target – so a silent attack that requires no user interaction is not thought to be possible .
That said , once the user has opened a malicious QuickTime file , the vulnerability results in code execution at the same privilege level as the user 's account – most commonly full administrator rights .
So far , Microsoft has not developed a patch to fix this vulnerability .
In a post to the company 's security blog several workarounds are , however , offered .
The easiest workaround is to delete theregistry key , which disables QuickTime parsing viaand prevents the malicious code from executing .
Sadly , this also means that QuickTime playback via DirectShow is disabled – although if you 're using another method to play these files , there are no other ill effects .
Should Microsoft break with tradition and launch an out - of - cycle patch for this vulnerability , or is it non-urgent enough to wait – despite being actively exploited in the wild ?

Intel last week bought for $ 884 million Wind River Systems , a venerable embedded operating system company — yet another of the chip giant ’s recent forays into software .
The reason for this purchase is both simple and grand — to help Intel vertically integrate and to further its Linux ambitions .
Intel ’s ultimate target with this purchase is Microsoft .
It ’s all about kicking Redmond out of the netbook business .
Netbooks are the big hardware success of 2009 and most are powered by Intel Atom processors .
The problem with PC ’s in general and netbooks in particular is that they are n’t very profitable for Intel campared to the good old days .
Microsoft makes more profit from every Windows PC sold than does the PC manufacturer and LOTS more profit than Intel makes despite its massively dominant market share in microprocessors .
And with Netbooks retailing under $ 400 , compared to Microsoft Intel makes hardly any profit at all .
So Microsoft has to die .
This is a huge change for Intel , which has for decades acted as Microsoft ’s bitch , doing pretty much whatever Redmond demanded for fear of being written - out of the next Windows PC hardware spec in favor of AMD or even IBM .
But that was the old Microsoft .
The Microsoft of today is n’t nearly as powerful , whether they yet know it or not .
Netbooks and mobile handsets are the first products from Intel ’s Linux strategy .
But Intel ’s Linux platform — called Moblin — can be extended to the desktop as a direct competitor to Windows 7 if the company finds success in the netbook space .
Microsoft is n’t stupid , so of course there is a huge battle brewing .
Here ’s the problem for Intel : the company lacks key software capabilities despite having more than 5000 software engineers on staff .
This is true especially for system software .
Intel ’s new strategy ( now 3 - 4 years old ) is to be a platform company rather than a processor company .
To become a platform company , Intel needs both silicon and low level software to tie all those pieces together .
Think about Intel ’s Centrino as a platform .
Centrino has : 1 ) a low - power processor ; 2 ) a wireless chip , and ; 3 ) software to manage wifi / wireline connections .
Intel makes more money selling these three parts together as the Centrino brand and less when they sell the individual pieces .
So software to Intel is glue to connect chips together and maximize revenue .
New chips at Intel require more system software ( firmware ) than Intel ever anticipated .
For example : Intel ’s Active Management Technology ( AMT ) requires firmware to wake up chips and apply patches when the computer is sleeping .
This is true for both virtualization and security .
In recent months Intel has stumbled delivering some key platform technologies simply because the firmware was n’t ready .
Now Intel is searching for the next wave of applications for non-PC ( typically embedded ) computing devices — autos , healthcare , gaming to name a few .
All these non-PC based applications will require even more system software capabilities .
Intel ’s efforts with the Atom processor are beginning to pay off .
They have the right process technology to produce Atoms at a low price .
But the market is not paying much for Atom and Intel is at risk of cannibalizing its traditional markets with OEMs designing Atom - based netbooks that consumers buy instead of more profitable notebooks .
In this environment Microsoft is not helping , since Windows makes netbooks more expensive and limits the profitability of both the PC maker and Intel , which is essentially making a netbook - on - chip .
Moblin is Intel ’s answer to Windows – an Open Source Linux entirely funded by Intel .
Moblin is also Intel ’s answer to Google ’s Android operating system .
Since Android is also Open Source and free , Intel might have relied solely on Google to take on Microsoft .
But Intel as a platform company is too strategic to rely on any third party , even Google — hence Moblin .
The Wind River acquisition is Intel ’s $ 884 million acknowledgement both that Moblin is strategic for the company AND that the Linux campaign is n’t going as well as Intel would like .
Wind River , as a major force in embedded software , will quickly move Moblin into a variety of non-PC devices while also giving Intel more of the low - level software expertise that it has so sorely needed .
If it works , we ’ll see Moblin everywhere in 18 - 24 months .
If it works really well , we ’ll see Intel challenging Microsoft on servers and desktops , too .
Intel CEO Paul Otellini is determined not to be anybody ’s bitch .

I ’ve been called a wide variety of names over the past couple of years .
These names have ranged from “ guru ” to “ cheater . ”
Frankly , I do n’t give a damn what people call me .
The bottom line is that I get results with my athletes .
Some people admire this ; others get jealous and choose to ridicule my methods .
Some of my methods are mainstream and other times I have to dig into my bag of “ dirty tricks ” to get the desired result .
Training athletes for the vertical jump test is no exception .
I get more questions each week regarding the vertical jump than any other training topic .
Most athletes seem to be obsessed with their vertical jump .
This is where I come in .
Below you ’ll find some of my favorite coaching “ tricks ” that I guarantee will improve your vertical jump .
These underground techniques have helped over 2 - dozen of my athletes jump over 35 ″ on this popular athletic test .
Some may call these techniques trickery ; others may call them smart coaching .
Call them what you want , they work !
++++++ DIRTY TRICK # 1 +++++++
STATIC STRETCH THE HIP FLEXORS
BEFORE TESTING YOUR VERTICAL JUMP !
This dirty trick works so well it gives me chills !
Well , not really but it ’s damn effective .
Have you ever noticed that the day after you ’ve performed a lot of jumping that your hip flexors were sore ?
I ’ve personally pulled hip flexor muscles while testing my vertical jump .
What I eventually figured out was that the rapid , full body extension that followed the rapid descent into the jump was tearing them up .
After further analysis , one could conclude that if these muscles were getting torn up , that meant that they were probably resisting the height of the jump .
Hopefully we ’re all well aware that static stretching is n’t recommended before any explosive activity .
Static stretching your hip flexors before testing your vertical jump is the exception to the rule !
You see , since the hip flexors are n’t prime movers in jumping and they tend to resist our jump , the goal is to weaken them and put them to “ sleep ” before jumping .
Static stretching accomplishes these goals .
Static stretching your hip flexors will create less friction during your jump .
Less hip flexor friction during your jump equals higher vertical jump heights !
Below is one of my favorite hip flexor stretches , but go ahead and choose your favorite and perform 2 sets of 20 - 30 seconds on each side .
NOTE : The hip flexor stretch pictured below is a great stretch to perform before squatting as well .
It will help you get deeper into your squats as well as prevent getting pulled forward during squatting .
Give it a try !
+++++++ DIRTY TRICK # 2 ++++++
STRENGTHEN YOUR FLEXOR HALLUCIS LONGUS !
The flexor hallucis longus is the least known of all the “ jumping muscles . ”
Do n’t get me wrong , this muscle is n’t going to improve your vertical jump as much as well - developed hamstrings , glutes , and spinal erectors ; but this is an interesting muscle that can make a noticeable improvement in your jumping ability .
The flexor hallucis longus originates on the lower two - thirds of the fibula and inserts on the distal phalanx of the great toe .
It plantar flexes the foot and also flexes the great toe .
These muscle actions are an integral part of the vertical jump as well as sprinting .
Getting this often - overlooked muscle stronger can be that added inch on your vertical jump that you thought was impossible .
The best way to train this muscle in the weight room is by performing single leg calf raises while holding a dumbell .
( See pictures below . )
When performing this exercise , try to keep most of your weight on the big toe of the working leg .
Crunching your toes in your sneakers / shoes while at work or school is another “ economical ” way of strengthening these muscles .
Try 3 - 4 sets of 20 reps .
No one will ever know !
Crunching a towel up in your toes while watching TV or working on the computer is another way to train these muscles without wasting any extra time .
++++++ DIRTY TRICK # 3 ++++++
FOCUS ON RAPIDLY DESCENDING INTO YOUR JUMP !
Most athletes focus so much on the “ jump ” portion of jumping that they forget the importance of the descent of the jump .
Through extensive research and observation , I ’ve found that the speed of the descent is the most important factor in an athlete ’s vertical jump height .
The bottom line is that the faster you can descend , the higher you will jump .
Sir Isaac Newton ’s 3rd Law of Motion supports this statement .
It states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
Knowing this , we can conclude that the faster we can descend into our jump , the faster we can take off .
This translates into an explosive , jaw - dropping jump .
Unfortunately , time and time again , I feel like I can go out to lunch and come back in the amount of time it takes an athlete to descend into his / her jump .
If you want to jump through the roof , you must practice descending rapidly .
In order to perfect the descent , you must set up in the perfect position .
Your vertical jump position should resemble that of an Olympic diver standing on a diving board .
Your arms should be fully extended over your head , eyes looking upward to where you ’ll be jumping , your back should be slightly arched and you should be standing on your toes .
This position puts all of your muscles on stretch and sets you up for an explosive descent .
Remember that an optimally stretched muscle can contract faster / harder .
Start the descent by throwing your arms down to your hips .
As the arms fire downward , your head / neck will flex forward as your trunk and knees flex as well .
In the bottom position , your hands should be slightly behind your hips , trunk flexed slightly forward and your knees bent at about 15 - 20 degrees .
( Do n’t get too caught up with the angle of your knees .
Always remember that the angle of knee flexion is NOT as important as the speed in which you descend . )
You are now ready to take off into a record - setting jump !
++++++ DIRTY TRICK # 4 ++++++
PEAK FOR YOUR VERTICAL JUMP
BY PERFORMING 50 - REP RHYTHM SQUATS !
This is one of the dirtiest , sneakiest , and toughest exercises you ’ll ever perform .
It ’s great for training the elastic component of your muscles along with the Achilles tendon .
I use 50 - rep rhythm squats as a “ peaking ” exercise .
My athletes perform this exercise once a week for 3 weeks before being tested in the vertical jump .
The last “ rhythm - squat ” workout would be completed 4 - 6 days before being tested in the vertical jump .
50 - rep rhythm squats would always be the first exercise of the workout .
After a proper warm - up , you ’ll perform one all - out set of this exercise .
After this exercise is completed , I usually like performing another explosive exercise such as box jumps , push jerks , etc .
This exercise is done by performing 50 quarter - squats as fast as possible .
Do the first 10 reps exploding onto your toes ; then , on reps 11 - 20 keep your feet flat on the way up ; explode onto your toes again while performing reps 21 - 30 ; keep your heels down for reps 31 - 40 , and then finish the final 10 reps by exploding onto your toes again .
It helps to have a partner count out loud so you can perform all 50 reps as fast as possible without breaking momentum .
I also like using a green Jump - Stretch band around the bar ( see pics below ) for two reasons :
First of all , the band helps to accelerate the eccentric portion of the lift .
This will further work the elastic component of your muscles and train your body to rapidly descend .
Secondly , due to the explosive nature of the exercise , the bar has a tendency to bounce up and down on your cervical spine .
This does n’t tickle !
The bands help to hold and stabilize the bar on your neck .
* Reps 1 - 10 , 21-30 & 41-50 .
Athlete explodes onto his toes at the top of the movement .
* Reps 11 - 20 & 31 - 40 .
Athlete keeps his heels down at the top of the movement .
++++++ DIRTY TRICK # 5 ++++++
WEAR TRACK WAFFLES WHEN TESTING YOUR VERTICAL !
Proper shoe wear just might be the most overlooked component of the vertical jump .
DO NOT wear an old pair of running sneakers because you feel that they ’re “ broken in ” and comfortable .
This type of sneaker is the worst thing you can put on your feet when jumping !
These “ comfortable ” sneakers actually dampen the forces that you put into the ground .
This , in turn , lengthens the time that you spend on the ground .
Picture that as you rapidly descend into your jump , the foot collapses slightly and absorbs force .
This dissipation of force can reduce the height of the jump .
I have my athletes wear light sneakers with a rigid sole and maximal arch support .
This type of sneaker supports the first metatarsal , which is crucial to your jumping performance .
I have found that track waffles are the best shoes for vertical jumping .
Waffles are firm and very light .
This allows for a rapid descent and take - off with maximal support .
I also recommend that my athletes purchase waffles that are half a size too small .
This prevents their feet from moving around in the shoe .
Remember that these shoes are n’t meant for comfort ; they ’re meant for a world - class vertical jump !
Hopefully , this combination of training methods and “ tricks ” will have you jumping so high that you can grab a dollar bill off the top of the backboard and make change before descending .
Okay , maybe that ’s a little too ambitious a goal .
Still , using these time - tested methods should have you jumping considerably higher than your current best .
Joe DeFranco has coached over 2 - dozen college and professional athletes who have vertical jumped over 35 ″ .
This is only one of the reasons that Joe is one of the country ’s most highly sought - after performance enhancement specialists .
Professional athletes from all over the country flock to New Jersey to train with Joe .
This is due to his uncanny ability to improve all aspects of athletic performance .
Joe trains countless NFL football players , major league baseball players , Olympic athletes and hundreds of college and high school athletes from all sports .

An American tourist has survived a terrifying night train ride , clinging to its side as it raced along the Australian Outback at high speeds .
Chad Vance , 19 , spent two hours squeezed inside a tiny open stairwell in temperatures close to zero , as the legendary Ghan train reached speeds of up to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) .
He had jumped on the stairs as the train departed Port Augusta , South Australia , and was only rescued when crew heard his cries for help and brought the train to an emergency halt .
During his extreme ride , Vance managed to record his thoughts .

This is serious .
Twitter has a big security problem .
Let 's rephrase that - most aspects of Twitter - user accounts , admin accounts , various personal accounts of important people in the company 's hierarchy , Evan Williams , are ( or at least , have been ) security Swiss cheese .
There have been so many problems over the past couple of months that it 's getting hard to keep track of them .
It 's time to fix it once and for all , because these security issues are a dark shadow looming over the otherwise bright future of this company .
Accounts of several famous Twitter users were hacked or compromised in January , and then later in May and June .
Of course , some of these were compromised through third party services , such as TwitPic ; others could have been attributed to the users ' negligence .
Back in April , we received a tip that several French sites had images from Twitter 's admin panel .
It was a tough call to decide whether these were authentic or not ; our bet was yes , and judging by the latest posting on one of these sites , they were .
This same site ( link omitted on purpose ) now holds images from various personal accounts of Twitter co-founder Evan Williams , including PayPal , Amazon , Gmail and MobileMe .
We will not publish any of these documents .
The word is out , the documents are out there and easy to find , and there are so many of them that it's hard to imagine that Twitter 's security as a whole - the service , the company , the people behind it - has n't been severely compromised in the last couple of months .
Twitter 's laundry - dirty or not - is out there for anyone to see , and we 'll let everyone choose what they want to see for themselves .
But there 's no denying that Twitter has a problem .
If a document that should n't be published gets published every couple of weeks ; if a well - known Twitter account gets hacked every couple of weeks , how will you convince users that their data on this service is safe and secure ?
One thing is certain .
Twitter needs to burn everything security - related down to the ground and build it all anew to make sure this wo n't happen again .
Employees should adopt stricter security practices ; services that do n't offer adequate security should be replaced with better ones ; in short , Twitter needs to seriously rethink its attitude towards security and privacy in all aspects of their work .
* Update :
It has been suggested in the comments that the article implies that Twitter users should fear for the security of their PayPal , Gmail , or other accounts due to Twitter 's security issues .
Although I do not see how you can read that from the article , I feel it 's important to make it absolutely clear : there 's absolutely no reason to believe that being a Twitter user implies a security risk to your other accounts .
The article merely goes on to show that Twitter , both as a company and as a service has had a number of security incidents over the last couple of months , and that they need to improve their overall track record when it comes to security .
ALONGSIDE some of the government 's finest military hardware at a ceremonial parade in Colombo on June 3rd were dozens of disabled soldiers in gleaming wheelchairs .
Sri Lanka has paid a heavy price for its recent rout of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , the defence secretary and brother of the president , has admitted that 6,261 soldiers were killed and 29,551 wounded in three years of fighting .
He revealed , too , that a total of 23,000 troops have died since the first casualties in October 1981 , when the Tigers ' leader , Velupillai Prabhakaran , sprang off a bicycle and shot two soldiers running errands in the northern town of Jaffna .
Prabhakaran and much of the army he built are now dead .
The Tigers have not disclosed their losses but the Sri Lankan army commander , General Sarath Fonseka , says an estimated 22,000 have been killed in the past three years , and 9,000 have surrendered .
The human cost to both sides was particularly heavy during the final three months , as the Tigers were driven into a fast - shrinking pocket of land in the north .
The distinction between Tiger combatants and the civilians they were holding to fend off the onslaught blurred fatally .
Thousands of non-combatants were killed or wounded , mostly in shelling by the army .
It had been ordered to notch up a speedy victory , amid calls from abroad for a truce .
At the United Nations human - rights council in Geneva , Sri Lanka last month shrugged off attempts by Western countries to institute an inquiry into alleged war crimes by both sides .
But it still faces the fury of the Tamil diaspora and the threat of sanctions , such as the withdrawal of trade privileges from the EU .
Confident , however , in the backing of countries such as China and Russia , President Mahinda Rajapaksa can defy what he terms Western “ doublespeak ” .
And on June 3rd he made another big victory speech , his third in two weeks .
He paid glowing tribute to army families , saying some had given up all their children to the armed forces .
In Samadhigama , a poor village 280 km ( 175 miles ) north - east of Colombo , a sobbing 87 - year - old Ukkubandage Sumanawathie knows what he is talking about .
Five grandchildren died in the war .
A sixth is missing in action .
Mrs Sumanawathie lives with her 36 - year - old daughter , Saman Malini .
No celebratory flags fly in her village , as they do in Colombo .
Instead , little white markers cut out of polythene bags are still planted along the narrow rubble lane to the cemetery .
Mrs Malini's teenage son was buried there in an unmarked grave on May 12th .
The army brought his remains in a sealed coffin , with a framed statement calling him a hero .
He had served for less than six months .
Mrs Malini will use her son's death benefits to put a headstone on his grave and complete their half - built brick house .
A local official says most poor bereaved families do the same .
With just 172 households , Samadhigama has 130 soldiers .
Kukulewa , the adjoining village , has 160 from 270 households .
Socially , says the official , enlistment is the “ accepted thing to do ” .
Many villages around Sri Lanka are now coping with such post - conflict difficulties .
Demobilisation , however , is unlikely to be one of them .
Recruitment has in fact increased , ostensibly to get rid of mines and to secure territorial gains .
The defence secretary has promised to keep paying death benefits to army families despite fiscal constraints .
With thousands of such households to support — and at least 5,000 permanently disabled veterans to rehabilitate — the government has appealed for donations .
There are also private initiatives , including one to buy commode toilets for disabled soldiers who can no longer use squatting pans .
But Harsha de Silva , an economist , argues that this piecemeal fund - raising is insufficient .
He urges the government to set up a veteran 's administration .
And there should be savings on arms purchases , he points out , that could be diverted towards caring for some of the war 's many victims .
It is astonishing given all the commentary and news stories about the " sudden " $ 50 billion federal deficit there has not been a single story in the mainstream media that focuses on the principal explanation : the huge tax cuts made by the Liberals and Conservatives since 1995 .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
First it was former finance minister Paul Martin with his $ 100 billion income tax cut over five years starting in 2000 .
Then it was Jim Flaherty in 2007 with $ 60 billion over five years .
Add to that the $ 12 billion lost each year by lowering the GST from seven per cent to five per cent and the $ 50 billion is no mystery .
It was an inevitability whenever the next recession hit .
But what to make of the sudden embrace of deficits by those who built their political careers on fiscal conservatism ?
There is no mystery here , either .
Neo-cons like Jim Flaherty do n't really care about deficits per se -- their ultimate goal is downsizing the social and redistributive role of government .
From that perspective , the $ 50 billion shortfall is a godsend : a useful crisis that will provide the rationale for huge spending cuts .
Without all those tax cuts , it is arguable that there would be no deficit at all .
Not only that , of course , we could have been spending that money on the collective needs of Canadians -- municipal infrastructure , national child care , pharmacare , lowered tuition fees , money for greening the economy , targeted industrial development .
Giving away the store
Between 1984 and 2006 , the federal government voluntarily gave up more than $ 250 billion in revenue through tax cuts , which went disproportionately to the wealthy and large corporations .
But just looking at the tax cuts implemented by the current minister since that time reveals that half the projected deficit was caused by Jim Flaherty himself .
According to a January 2008 study by Marc Lee , a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ( CCPA ) , Flaherty 's 2006 and 2007 tax cuts ( scheduled to be phased in over five years ) would result in a loss of revenue for 2008 - 09 of $ 28.2 billion : $ 5.9 billion in corporate taxes , $ 10.3 billion in personal income taxes and $ 12 billion in GST revenue .
The corporate tax cuts skyrocket to $ 14.8 billion in 2012 - 13 , according to Lee , as the corporate income tax rate falls to 15 per cent , the lowest of the G7 and one of the lowest in the OECD .
Given the severe recession , these numbers would be somewhat lower but it does not alter the fact that the cuts were ill - advised and never accomplished their stated goals .
The ideology held that these cuts would lead to economic growth and massive new corporate investment .
All that was needed for endless growth into the future was for government to " get out of the way . "
The corporate tax cuts produced just what one would expect -- a huge increase in pre- and after tax profits through 2007 but without any comparable increase in new productive investment or productivity .
Canada has been cutting corporate taxes for 10 years to levels now well below those of our main " competitor " -- the US ( where the rate has remained steady through the decade ) -- and yet our international competitiveness has declined .
While the statutory corporate tax rate was being reduced by 11 percentage points since 1999 , the Word Economic Forum reports that our competitiveness declined from fifth place in 1999 to tenth in 2008 - 09 .
Indeed , corporate tax rates seem to have little to do with competitiveness .
Six of the top ten countries are Northern European nations with some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world .
Tax cuts and spending cuts are key elements of the Washington Consensus -- the ideology that has driven the global economy since the 1980s .
This failed ideology was all about reducing the percentage of the economy devoted to public spending .
This was revealed in dramatic fashion by Paul Martin in his 1995 speech on his budget , famous for cutting federal social spending by 40 per cent .
Martin boasted , oddly enough , not about slaying the deficit but about reducing the role of government : " Relative to the size of our economy , program spending will be lower in 1996 – 97 than at any time since 1951 . "
To maintain that lofty accomplishment , Martin rid the country of huge budget surpluses in the late 1990s with his $ 100 billion tax cut .
The price of a civilized society
" Taxes , " said American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes , " are the price we pay for a civilized society . "
Ultimately , when citizens decide questions about taxes , they are choosing between public goods and private goods .
Presumably , the overall goal is one of happiness and if that is the case , a recent study suggests that so - called " tax relief " ( taxes framed as an affliction ) is over - rated .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey showed people in Denmark , Finland and the Netherlands ranked first , second and third , respectively , in the OECD 's rankings of " life satisfaction . "
They are amongst the highest taxed countries in the world .
Canada was eighth -- but one of only five countries to have registered a decline between 2000 and 2006 .
Another study , by economist Hugh MacKenzie of the CCPA , shows that Canadians get a great deal for the taxes they pay .
Every Canadian gets an average of $ 17,000 worth of benefits from their tax - funded public services , which translates to about $ 41,000 for a middle - income family -- or 63 per cent of its yearly income .
Says MacKenzie : " Tax cuts do n't give you money for free .
They introduce a trade off between a private benefit in the form of lower taxes and a reduced public benefit . "
There are only two ways to deal with the extraordinary deficits the country is facing : cuts to social spending or a return to a tax system that pays for the things we want .
Jim Flaherty can hardly wait to use the $ 50 billion " crisis " to start cutting .
Will Canadians stop him ?

Today we have a series of very nice piece of architecture staying abandoned for quite a lot already .
It is from Abkhazia region , the place that was under Russian rule long before communists came to power .
It ’s located on the Black Sea and was so beloved by old Russian upper class that they called it “ Russian Riviera ” .
This place has probably the most picturesque abandons from ex Soviet places .
We had once the old abandoned railway station from there , if you do n’t remember take look here it was very nice looking series too .
Today some shots of the abandoned Prince ’s House , built almost two centuries ago by special Royal order .
That ’s how it looked when prince got it .
It was not very long the prince could enjoy it , the communists took over and nationalized most of the luxury property in Russia .
During Soviet
Era the house was turned in elite summer residence for Moscow higher up men .
That ’s how the placed look when it was conversed to the Hotel “ Seagull ” by the personal order of J. Stalin
So let ’s see what ’s left there today .
The house had a cool sea view .
And nice round windows .
It stays abandoned for already more than 20 years .
What happened is that when Soviet Union collapsed and every state asked for “ as many independence as they could carry with themselves ” this part of Soviet state was left to Georgia , and the war began , now between parts of Georgia to become independent .
During the war many of the villages and towns were abandoned and nice buildings were ruined .
Just look how tall this tree should be to grow from the ground floor up all the way thru the chimney .
And this looks like the prince ’s office .
Good office he had .
And here is another nice looking and totally abandoned building just near .
Local authorities do n’t hurry to reconstruct all this .
There is no need for them to do this and they ca n’t make any practical use of those – like it ’s to far away to make a casino here .
Here prince probably spent his evenings with a cigar and some wine and a book , overlooking the sunset on the see .
Later some ugly wooden huts were built around , probably in Soviet times they used those to store some household stuff .
Lately a new wave of interest for this places appeared among Moscow riches .
The only reason they are not here yet is probably the political unstability around , and the price for tickets to Nice is much cheaper .

Thousands of people are being stopped and searched by the police under their counter - ­terrorism powers – simply to ­provide a racial balance in official statistics , the government 's official anti-terror law watchdog has revealed .
Lord Carlile said in his annual report that he had " ample anecdotal evidence " of it happening , adding that such a practice was " totally wrong " and constituted an invasion of civil liberties .
" I can well understand the concerns of the police that they should be free from allegations of prejudice , " he said .
" But it is not a good use of precious resources if they waste them on self - evidently unmerited searches . "
He said there was little or no evidence that the use of section 44 stop and search powers by the police could prevent an act of terrorism .
" While arrests for other crime have ­followed searches under the section , none of the many thousands of searches has ever resulted in a conviction for a terrorism offence .
Its utility has been questioned publicly and privately by senior Metropolitan police staff with wide experience of terrorism policing , " said Carlile .
He added that such searches were stopping between 8,000 - 10,000 people a month .
Under the Terrorism Act 2000 , the ­" section 44 stops " allow the police to search anyone in a designated area without suspicion that an offence has occurred .
But Carlile is critical of the use of the powers by the Met police , saying that he felt " a sense of frustration " the force did not limit its use of section 44 authorisations to some boroughs or parts of boroughs but used them across its entire area .
" I can not see a justification for the whole of the Greater London area being covered permanently .
The intention of the section was not to place London under permanent special search powers . "
He noted that the damage done to community relations was " undoubtedly considerable " .
Examples of poor use of section 44 abounded .
" I have evidence of cases where the person stopped is so obviously far from any known terrorism profile that , realistically , there is not the slightest ­possibility of him / her being a terrorist , and no other feature to justify the stop . "
He later said that while the police should not discriminate racially , it was equally important that they should not balance the statistics .
" If , for example , 50 blonde women are stopped who fall nowhere near any intelligence - led terrorism profile , it 's a gross invasion of the civil liberties of those 50 blonde women .
" The police are perfectly entitled to stop people who fall within a terrorism profile even if it creates a racial imbalance , as long as it is not racist . "
Former British diplomat Sir Edward Clay told BBC Radio 4's
The World Tonight programme he was subjected to a stop and search five weeks ago while on his way to work at the National School of Government , near Victoria Station in central London .
He said he had found the experience " sinister " and " intimidating " .
He told the programme : " I 'm 63 , I 'm a grey - to - brown - haired white male , I 'm 5ft 10 ins tall , looking extremely conventional . "
The latest police figures show that ­117,278 people were stopped under section 44 in 2007 - 08 , of whom 73,967 were white , 20,768 were Asian and 15,218 black .
The Met has announced a review of how it uses section 44 powers .
The home secretary , Alan Johnson , is to issue fresh guidance to the police , warning that counter - terrorism must not be used to stop people taking photographs of on - duty officers .
Carlile endorses complaints from professional and amateur photographers that counter - terror powers are being used to threaten them with prosecution if they take photographs of officers .
He said the power was only intended to cover images likely to be of use to a terrorist .
The police had to come to terms with the increased scrutiny of their activities by the public , afforded by equipment such as video - enabled mobile phones .
" Police officers who use force or threaten force in this context run the real risk of being prosecuted themselves for possible criminal and disciplinary offences , " he warned .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) said new guidance on stop and search had been issued .
Acpo counter - terror spokesman Assistant Commissioner John Yates said : " Powers to stop and search are an important part of tackling terrorism but should always be used in a proportionate way by well - trained and briefed officers .
Used correctly , stop and search is a powerful tool that can help protect all our communities from terrorism .
" We have been fully engaged with Lord Carlisle 's review and chief officers will study the report carefully .
The threat to London from terrorism is real and these powers are a vital tactic in our counter - terrorism strategy . "

Here 's a dirty little secret that private health insurers , their lobbyists ( like the AMA ) and their various sycophants in congress ( Republican and Democrat alike ) do n't want you to know .
The Cost of Private health Care is Breaking the Back of the Nation .
According to the UN Human Development Index , which tracks the quality and cost of Health Care across the entire World he U.S. is by far the most expensive Health Care system mostly because of the cost of the Private portion of the system .

16 United Kingdom 7 1.1 8.1
As you can see Health Care in the U.S. takes a larger slice of GDP than it does in the Occupied Territories of Palestine and in Lebanon .
So called " Socialized " medical systems from countries such as Canada , France , England and Germany , which we are always told to be afraid of increasing cost and lowering services are all between 30 - 50 % less expensive than our system and all of the - all of them - rank higher in terms of the resulting quality of service as well as life expectancy of their citizens .
( At 77.9 years , the U.S. Ranks 29th , Japan is first at 82.3 )
The U.S. spends nearly TWICE AS MUCH of it's GDP as the U.K. on Health Care
That 's money being Bled out of our corporations and our national productivity , it 's making the U.S. Less competitive and our workers less employable .
The U.S. also ranks in about 30th place , behind France , Canada , Norway and Sweden in Infant Morality .
( Averaging 6 cases of mortality for every 1,000 Live births - Iceland , Norway , Sweden , Japan , Finland , Singapore , Slovenia and the Czech Republic all have half that number with only 3 cases , France and Germany average 4 , Canada and England average 5 ) If we care about " Saving Babies " so much - why can't we keep ours alive even after they 've been born ?
The best version of a " Public Option " in my mind would be to simply allow people to buy into Medicare .
Instead of paying premiums to Blue Cross , they could have their employer pay those premiums - at most likely a far lower pre-tax rate - directly to Medicare to allow themselves early access to that system before they reach the minimum age requirements .
Now Medicare is n't perfect , it still needs to have it 's prescription drug program fixed to allow it to negotiate for the best price from providers , but it 's far FAR cheaper and more efficient that any current private system , and it's exactly that competition that the big Insurers are afraid of .
Therefore we should be sure to give it to them and let the consumers choose .
Even if the Public Option were a " Stalking Horse " for government run Health Care , it would save us Hundreds of Billions compared to what we 're paying Privates insurance Companies now .
While we 're at it , we also need to ban the blocking of coverage for " Pre- Existing Conditions " and stop allowing bonuses to be paid for insurance corporation pencil pushers who deny legitimate claims .
Only a doctor and their patient should be making the decision on what type of treatment is needed .
Lastly , we need to stop making the Emergency Room the very first stop for the uninsured .
Basic preventive Care and screening for common issues should be available to everyone , anywhere , free of cost - because the primary way we 'll save costs as well as improve outcomes is to catch a potential disease early before it becomes Critical .
Even if we do n't provide full coverage to every citizen - we HAVE TO DO THIS - at a bare minimum .
Anything less is a failure .

Hilarious stuff .
The appropriate age for students to begin school is an issue of debate for educators , administrators , and parents .
Parents worry that young children may not be able to compete with older classmates ; schools worry that young students will not be able to meet rigorous academic standards associated with school accountability .
Past literature is inconclusive as to the overall effect of age at school entry .
Some research suggests that younger students have lower average achievement in early elementary school , while others find that students with summer birthdates , who are assumed to be younger at school entry , gain more education on average .
At present , little is known about the impact of age at school entry on education attainment as students transition from high school into college and the labor market .
This study uses data from the National Education Longitudinal Survey to examine long - term effects of age at school entry on both educational and social outcomes , with special attention to those students who enter kindergarten a year later than their peers .
The results of this study suggest that delaying kindergarten does not create any long - term advantages for students .

Here 's a little experiment recommended by a reader -- why not do a " 5 best hate emails of the week " feature once a week ?
So here goes .
Let me know if you like it .
5 - - - - - - - - - - - - -
I just wanted to drop a line to let you know I appreciate your numerous references to the fox news channel and it's broadcasts stars , Bill O. and Glenn B. and others .
It does my heart good to see you fools spend so much time and effort on these true patriots .
Your message is truly sick and diseased with paranoia and jealousy .
Your site has no message except of hate .
You are disgusting .
Here is an idea .
Why do n't you and your comrades join the U.S. Military , perhaps then you might start to understand what patriotism is .
Oh , wait , thats right the Military is for patriots .
Forget it .
Keep up the good fight !
YOU WILL LOSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here 's someone who 1 ) does n't know I did join the military , unlike his true patriots Bill O and Glenn B , and 2 ) does n't know that we already won , last November .
Who wants to break the news to him ?

I heard so much about the idiots that run kos , I had to check in myself and see if it was true .
By golly , it is .
I can see that you idiots are so scared of the REAL AMERICAN PEOPLE , speaking out and confronting you , and your boss Soros , that you have to ridicule them anytime you can .
If you ever sd anything bad about soros , he would shut you down in a minute , and you have to kiss his ass , just as BO , bowed down to saudi royal asses , and now sucking iran / n/ korea ass .
Enjoy , your radical rant , because you will be gone in the next two years .
Enjoy your tripping , because the end is near .
Soros is a poopy head !
Too bad he 'll be shutting us down soon .
Oh well , it was nice while it lasted .
It was great knowing you guys !
But yeah , making out with Saudi princes is cause for concern .
But was n't that that other president ?

Sir , I think you and your readers need to take a step back and look at yourself 's before you accuse anybody of anything .
After reading a few posts on your attack on Glenn Beck story , I think that you and your members are the true haters and are the ones advocating violence .
Simple minded people have to attack the person and you attack the person .
This web site of yours is a venom pit for the simple minded , free ice cream for everybody crowd that makes up most of Obama 's support .
That 's why the country is in big trouble , you can't think for yourself 's and want a nanny to do it all for you .
Like all other liberal media you will fail shortly , hate only works for a short while and now you do n't have Bush to hate you 'll have to turn on your Messiah and that wo n't happen so you 'll just fade away , and the sooner the better for the rest of us that can think for ourselves and can wipe our own asses and do n't expect the government to do it for us .
An average citizen , Doug
He had me at " sir " .

I read your pathetic Oboma ass kissing site and you people are fucking morons .
I saw you on TV and you look like a little smug faggot .
I think all liberals should paint themselves black and find some black ass to have gay sex with .
You people are a disgrace to the white race and to America .
Your bastard president and he is a bastard cuz his white mom was a single whore when she got knocked up with him .
He is a one termer , he lied , he duped , he brainwashed Americans and now they are GETTING it .
You live by your whacked out biased polls , I dont need fucking numbers to see what Americans minus the liberals think of this disgusting person and his dog face bucked teeth wife .
THEY ARE HATED .
I CAN ONLY HOPE HE DROPS FUCKING DEAD .
About 60 percent of my hate mail includes some gay bashing , because nothing says " PATRIOT " more than hating on people , and especially the gays .
And just think if he knew I was Latino !
Boy , that would 've brought out his really bad side !
But since he brought it up , let 's see what America minus the liberals think of our President :
Looks like it 's conservatives that are out on the fringe .
But we already knew that .

I can't wait for the civil unrest to begin .
We will be waiting for you to have our own personal " town hall " with you all .

Here ’s the news , single payer national health insurance will be at the table in the Senate with a witness participating in a hearing this Thursday .

Among twenty snowy mountains ,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird .
II
I was of three minds ,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds .
III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds .
It was a small part of the pantomime .
IV
A man and a woman
Are one .
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one .
V
I do not know which to prefer ,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes ,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after .
VI
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass .
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it , to and fro .
The mood
Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause .
VII
O thin men of Haddam ,
Why do you imagine golden birds ?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet
Of the women about you ?
VIII
I know noble accents
And lucid , inescapable rhythms ;
But I know , too ,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know .
IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight ,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles .
X
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light ,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply .
XI
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach .
Once , a fear pierced him ,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds .
XII
The river is moving .
The blackbird must be flying .
XIII
It was evening all afternoon .
It was snowing
And it was going to snow .
The blackbird sat
In the cedar - limbs .
The iPhone has also attracted an enthusiastic community of independent software makers that have created about 40,000 free or low - cost applications for the devices .
Apple now celebrates that wide range of programs , from flight simulators to spreadsheets , as one of the major differences between the iPhone and competing systems .
Apple ’s goal for next week : to keep the energy , momentum and spotlight focused on the iPhone and away from its rivals , like the new Pre from Palm , a well - reviewed new phone that goes on sale Saturday .
Apple is expected to use its keynote presentation on Monday to demonstrate the new types of programs that can be created on the latest version of the iPhone ’s operating system .
Developers will be able to charge for certain features within their programs ( perhaps a new level within a game ) , and applications will be able to send alerts to users even whey they are not actively running .
Apple has also said it will show an early version of its latest operating system for the Macintosh , dubbed Snow Leopard .
But talking about new software can be dull .
So analysts point to Apple ’s need to surprise its fans , and to its dwindling inventory of iPhones in stores , and predict that Apple will introduce a new iPhone model next week as well .
Its new tricks could include the ability to record video and an internal compass that will add extra intelligence to the device ’s awareness of its location .
“ Apple ’s objective will be to clearly and strongly show why the iPhone platform is the best for developers , and that means there ’s a high probability Apple will announce one or more phones at the conference , ” said Michael Abramsky , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets .
Satisfying its large audience of developers may be Apple ’s most significant challenge .
They want to know they can build profitable businesses even if they focus exclusively on the iPhone , and that Apple will continue to do its part by wooing consumers with compelling new gadgets .

carried a report
February 7 , 2002 .
America lost a little of its greatness that day .
We lost our position as the world ’s leading defender of human rights , as the champion of justice and fairness and the rule of law .
But it is a testament to the continuing greatness of this nation , that I , a lowly Air Force Reserve Major , can stand here before you today , with the world watching , without fear of retribution , retaliation or reprisal , and speak truth to power .
I can call a spade a spade , and I can call torture , torture .
Today , Your Honor , you have an opportunity to restore a bit of America ’s lost luster , to bring back some small measure of the greatness that was lost on Feb 7 , 2002 , to set us back on a path that leads to an America which once again stands at the forefront of the community of nations in the arena of human rights .
Sadly , this military commission has no power to do anything to the enablers of torture such as John Yoo , Jay Bybee , Robert Delahunty , Alberto Gonzales , Douglas Feith , David Addington , William Haynes , Vice President Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , for the jurisdiction of military commissions is strictly and carefully limited to foreign war criminals , not the home - grown variety .
All you can do is to try to send a message , a clear and unmistakable message that the U.S. really does n’t torture , and when we do , we own up to it , and we try to make it right .
I have provided you with legal authority for the proposition that you have the power to dismiss these charges .
I ca n’t stand before you and say that you are legally required to do so .
But I can say that that it is a moral imperative to do so , and I ask that you do so , " - Major David J. R. Frakt , in his closing argument in favor of dismissal of the case against Mohammad Jawad .
Jawad was ordered released from the Gitmo torture compound yesterday after years of abuse , cruelty , sadism and torture authorized by the president of the United States , George W. Bush .
Staggeringly , the Obama administration is resisting his release and threatening a criminal charge .
That 's why we supported Obama , right ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Via dday at Digby : Give them a shrubbery , and they start saying Ekke Ekke Ekke :
Schumer said Finance Republicans had rejected several proposals designed to beef up the suggested nonprofit insurance co-ops .
These included setting up a national structure for the co-ops , $ 10 billion in government seed money , power to negotiate payment rates to medical providers nationwide and creation of a presidentially appointed board of directors .
The essential point here is that Republicans do n’t want any competition for private insurers .
It ’s not about free - market principles — in many cases , insurers are in effect monopolists .
It ’s about protecting the vested interests .
Kent Conrad , on the other hand , seems sincere :
Last week , a group of music and other entertainment industry representatives urged the UK government to consider drafting legislation that would force ISPs to disconnect alleged pirates .
This proposal now faces opposition from an unexpected corner as a coalition of top artists has spoken out against it , saying that disconnecting their fans is the wrong path to take .
In an attempt to have their voices heard , a group of leading musicians have started their own lobby group , the Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) .
The group includes members such as Robbie Williams , Billy Bragg , Radiohead , Iron Maiden and Travis , and aims to correct music labels and lobby groups that claim to act in the best interest of artists .
The most recent intervention by the coalition of artists concerns the call by entertainment industry lobby groups for so called ‘ three - strikes ’ legislation , to disconnect repeat copyright infringers .
Again , the copyright lobby has been acting on its own and without asking for input from the very artists they claim to represent .
“ Not for the first time , we at the Featured Artist Coalition are forced to question whether the record industry is representing the best interests of artists in calling for such measures , ” UK musician Billy Bragg writes in an article for the Guardian , dealing with the topic .
According to Bragg the music industry is trying to blame ISPs for a ‘ problem ’ that is not as easily solved as it would first appear .
“ Never mind that this is a shameful attempt to pass responsibility on to another sector of industry , the question remains whether or not such measures will have the desired effect .
Technology has so far stayed ahead of enforcement .
Any unauthorised filesharers who fear being caught out can simply encrypt their exchanges , ” Bragg writes .
He further claims that it is sometimes hard for fans to find DRM - free music anywhere else than on file - sharing networks .
The demands of music fans have changed with the emergence of the Internet , but the music industry has failed to offer decent alternatives thus far .
“ The Featured Artist Coalition is opposed to copyright infringement , but we recognise that , if technology allows people to access music for free , they will take advantage .
The next generation of music fans may no longer want to pay for music , but they are still hungry to hear it .
The challenge to the industry is to find ways to monetise their behaviour . ”
“ Clearly , some form of P2P subscription service is the way forward , if only because it provides the most convenient way for consumers to access music , ” Bragg argues .
Eventually the labels might have to give up the distribution component that has been at the core of their business for years on end .
This paints an uncertain future for the labels and that might be one of the main reasons why they are so resistant .
Or to put it in Bragg ’s words ;
“ Yet for the major labels , the success of such an initiative would mean the end of their control over the distribution of music .
Is this the real reason why they seem determined to do everything they can to clip the wings of the fledgling digital industry before it can fly ? ”
SALEM --
When the history of the 2009 Legislature is written , it may record that this was the year lawmakers put Oregon in the industrial hemp business .
The Senate voted 27 - 2 Friday to approve a bill that clears the way for hemp to be grown and processed in Oregon if and when the federal government gives growers a green light .
Senate Bill 676 still must pass in the House before the session ends later this month .
But its sponsor , Sen. Floyd Prozanski , says he 's convinced it will pass .
The bill would authorize the production , possession and commerce of industrial hemp and products .
It would put the state Department of Agriculture in charge of regulating growers .
Industrial hemp is a cousin to marijuana .
But it contains just trace amounts of THC , the psycho-active chemical in marijuana .
Hemp seeds are cultivated for food and other products in China , Canada and other countries .
Hemp was grown in the United States until 1970 , when it was redefined by the federal government as marijuana .
Prozanski , a Eugene Democrat , said he first learned about industrial hemp while campaigning in 1994 .
He 's convinced it would be an economic boost for Oregon and has been pushing legislation to promote the industry since 1997 .
Prozanski brought a variety of hemp products to the Senate floor Friday to illustrate his point , including hemp chocolate milk and hemp chips .
He also waved a T - shirt that read : " Industrial hemp is rope .
It 's not dope . "
" Senate Bill 676 will allow farmers to re-establish industrial hemp as an agricultural crop in Oregon , " Prozanski said .
A couple of Republican senators who are also farmers voted in favor of the bill .
Sen. Larry George , R - Sherwood , groused that " this may be the only way we can pay the taxes you all have passed . "
And Sen. Jeff Kruse , R - Roseburg , complained : " This may be the only crop left for me . "
Sen. Jason Atkinson , R - Central Point , had a question for Prozanski :
Do they make a hemp brownie mix ?

This week BBC diary doctor , Tom Coffey , reports on his weekly shift in the emergency department of London 's Charing Cross Hospital .
I 've seen a number of quite seriously ill people , but the one that sticks in my mind is a 29 - year - old woman who came in with alcoholic liver failure .
She was bleeding , she was yellow , she had a swollen belly and she was confused - she 'd been drinking non-stop for 13 years and she 's now facing a liver transplant .
Twenty years ago , when I first started in A&E , the classic alcoholic was a 50 - year - old man who had been drinking down the pub for a number of years .
Now , that has changed - more and more I 'm seeing younger people , especially young women , who 've been drinking for the last 10 years , non-stop , and now they 're getting all the problems of alcohol - they 're bleeding internally , they 're getting liver failure , and they 're getting high blood pressure .
The tragedy of seeing patients with alcoholic liver disease is that it 's so preventable .
These are people coming in , with self - inflicted illness , who are dying in front of my eyes - consuming alcohol as a pleasure , not realising the enormous damage it is doing to them .
I would hope that doctors and the government realise that the biggest drug problem in Britain is n't heroin , it is n't ecstasy , it 's alcohol .
Too many people now , especially young people , are drinking to excess and are slowly killing themselves .

See the circles showing where crowd images have been copied and repeated to add volume to the crowd that did not truly exist .
Of course , the only way the regime thought it could get away with such a blatant maneuver was through the ban on media coverage of all rallies and protests -- a ban being ignored by regular Iranians on the street , but which is severely hampering media estimations of crowd sizes , as well as decent shots of crowd sizes .
When a thuggish government is so desperate that it has to photoshop pictures of its own rallies to give them more credibility vs. the opposition rallies , it 's in some serious trouble .
Here 's hoping the real rallies can effectuate real change in Iran .
The regime has moved from simply thuggish to pathetically so .
Update : Several commenters have reminded me that this would not the first time the Iranian regime has doctored photos for propaganda purposes .
Remember the faked missile launch photos as well .
Potemkin missiles , Potemkin rallies .
Animal Rights Activist Jailed at Secretive Prison Gives First Account of Life Inside â€ œCMUâ€
This morning Andy Stepanian and I were on Democracy Now talking about secretive political prisons called Communications Management Units .
Stepanian is believed to be the first inmate ever released from one of the secretive facilities ; he is one of the SHAC 7 , a group of animal rights activists convicted of “ animal enterprise terrorism ” for running a controversial , and effective , website targeting an animal testing lab called Huntingdon Life Sciences .
I was invited back on the program to talk about my reporting on CMUs , and about the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act .
[ The previous program focused on Daniel McGowan ’s case and the Earth Liberation Front arrests of Operation Backfire . ]
Thanks to Democracy
Now for continuing to focus much - needed attention on these secretive prisons .
The Obama administration needs to reverse the unconstitutional policies of the Bush administration , and provide accountability and transparency .
Secretive political prisons have no place in a democracy .
With the advent of electricity , Kabulis have been buying televisions
By Bilal Sarwary
BBC News , Kabul
All - day electricity has finally arrived in Kabul , bringing with it some of the small comforts that many in the developed world take for granted .
Life at the house of Sayed Abdul Rahim has become , in his words , " easier and more entertaining " .
Mr Rahim 's clothes are now ironed regularly , he is able to enjoy daily hot baths , his children no longer have to squint at their homework by candlelight , and his 10 - year - old son , Ajmal , never misses his favourite Indian soap operas on television .
All of these changes have been brought about by a deal struck earlier this year between the Afghan finance ministry and the government of neighbouring Uzbekistan .
They are tired of war , corruption and problems , so they want to watch television and movies to escape from these problems
Wali , shopkeeper A handful of Kabul 's districts now enjoy 20 hours of electricity every day following a four - year project to build a high - voltage line between the two countries .
Previously the Afghan capital had no more than four or five hours of intermittent diesel - generated power a day .
Officials hope that in the coming years , many more provinces will also get electricity .
But progress comes at a price .
Nearly one third of Rahim 's salary goes on his electricity bill .
" We are very happy that we have electricity all the time but poor families like mine can't afford to pay $ 40 ( £ 12 ) a month .
They need to bring the prices down , " he said .
An official at the finance ministry defended the policy saying that for poor Afghans , electricity cost three cents per kilowatt but for businesses and international organisations it was 20 cents per kilowatt .
Sick of war Shopkeepers throughout central Kabul have reported a big spike in the sale of electrical products .
At Sediq Omar market , known locally as " the electric market " , traders talk about the big rise in television and DVD sales .
Kabul 's night has been transformed " People buy televisions and DVDs every day .
They are tired of war , corruption and problems , so they want to watch television and movies to escape from these problems , " says shopkeeper Wali .
Mohammad Shafiq , 42 , is one of Wali 's customer .
He works for the Afghan army .
Today he has come to buy a television and a DVD player because he too is getting 20 hours of electricity a day .
" I could n't afford a generator in the past so I did n't want to have a television and DVD .
We either argued in the family or listened to radio or went to bed early .
But now we can watch television and movies and have hot baths in the morning , " he says .
And it is not just inside the home that Kabulis can see the difference .
Night drivers no longer rely solely on their sense of direction and the narrow , yellow beams of their headlights to guide them through the city 's labyrinthine streets .
Nowadays the hills surrounding Kabul are speckled with golden orbs from lights inside houses , gleaming like thousands of small fireflies hovering in the night sky .
However , there remains much work to be done .
The Afghan government estimates that only 7 % of the country has access to electricity .
Many
Afghans complain that while most of their political leaders can boast of 24 hours of electricity , the majority of villages and valleys still rely on kerosene lamps and firelight .
Although Afghanistan has several of its own hydroelectric dams , the output of these dams has been hit hard by a series of droughts .
Afghanistan has a number of hydroelectric dams
But officials at the water and energy ministry are optimistic about the coming months , after a winter of heavy snow and a rainy spring .
Some Afghans argue that more rivers should be diverted to feed more hydroelectric dams .
But this is politically sensitive .
In the past , several neighbouring countries - including Pakistan , Iran , and Uzbekistan - that also rely on the water from these rivers have blocked such initiatives .
Despite all this , Afghans like Mr Rahim have had their spirits buoyed .
But the destruction of the past three decades also leaves him wary that such luxuries may not last .
" I wo n't get rid of my Bukhari [ wood - fired stove ] .
We have used it for a long time , and I am not convinced that the electricity will always be able to provide us with heat in the winter .
But we are still very thankful because for many many years we were deprived of it in the past . "

Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Kind of Blue , five chiptune artists reinterpret each song from the legendary jazz masterpiece .
Adobe Systems has shut its North American operations for the week as part of a cost - cutting effort that the company said it will repeat at least once more this year .
The San Jose software company , which makes editing , graphic design and Web development tools , said the shutdowns are part of a larger effort to control costs in the face of a global recession .
Adobe ’s sales have declined for the last two quarters , although it still reported $ 126.1 million in profit on $ 704.7 million in revenue for the quarter that ended May 29 .
Adobe previously shut down for a week in April , and it will close North American operations for another week later in the year .
The three shutdowns are in addition to the company ’s usual practice of closing North American operations for the week between Christmas and New Year ’s Day .
A spokeswoman declined to say how many employees are affected by the shutdowns or how much money the company will save .
Adobe said employees are asked to use paid vacation days during the closures .
Earlier this year , Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said Adobe would also cut spending for travel , marketing and bonuses .
Adobe announced it would lay off about 600 workers in December , although it has since rehired about 260 workers in regions where Garrett said costs are lower .
Adobe now has about 7,400 workers worldwide , including an undisclosed number at its headquarters in downtown San Jose .

In this series I will again approach the issue of energy return on energy invested ( EROEI ) , or net energy .
Rather than a detailed analysis of the EROEI value of specific types of renewable energy technology , however , my goal is to consider systemic implications and the role of uncertainty in the ability of our civilization to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy .
In this first post I will discuss the challenges and potential goals of such a renewable energy transition , noting the criticality of EROEI values to our ability to transition .
Next , I will look more closely at EROEI itself , exploring our inability to produce an accurate , inclusive , and verifiable measurement , and explain why the resulting degree of uncertainty is very significant .
Finally , I will consider the path forward amidst this uncertainty .
To the extent that the global community is concerned with energy scarcity at all , it is my opinion that there is a pervasive faith that , over the coming decades , we will overcome these challenges by gradually transitioning to a renewable - energy economy .
Certainly not everyone shares this vision of the future , but it appears to be both the conclusion of many intelligent commentators within the field , as well as the only politically - viable vision offered by politicians to the masses .
The result is that , while it is acceptable to debate the mechanics of realizing this vision , any attempts to question its general feasibility tend to be swept under the rug .
Let ’s start with what we know , or at least what we are reasonably confident in and that I will assume for the purposes of this series :
We know that fossil fuels wo n’t be producible at present rates forever .
We know that it is possible to generate renewable energy from sources such as the sun , the wind , waves , and geothermal heat .
What I will argue that we do n’t KNOW — despite frequent and occasionally self - serving protestations to the contrary — is whether the EROEI of available renewable energy technology makes replacing our fossil fuel - economy with a renewable - energy economy possible .
The trouble with transition begins with the issue that ( present ) renewable energy sources such as solar and wind require an investment of energy up - front , after which these technologies proceed to return energy over a period of time :
Figure 1 ( up - front costs of energy alternatives )
While this is all quite straightforward , there is at least one important implication that seems to be generally overlooked : at some rate of investment in renewable energy infrastructure , the economic burden of this up - front energy investment will make the program politically impossible .
What do I mean by that ?
If you want to increase the amount of energy derived from renewable sources ( and thereby help to ameliorate energy scarcity ) , you need to first exacerbate that scarcity by using an increasing share of our currently available energy as an up - front investment in these new renewables .
If the EROEI of the renewables towards which we ’re transitioning is sufficiently high , if our timeline for meeting some transition target is sufficiently long , or if the transition target is sufficiently low , then this “ burden ” will be minimized as we will be able to meet our target with a small up - front investment of fossil fuels ( minor exacerbation of scarcity ) and then bootstrap the energy production of the first wave of renewables to finance the energy demands of the remainder of the transition .
However , if some or all of these conditions are not met , then the transition target will not be possible because the level of up - front fossil fuel investment will exacerbate current energy scarcity to a politically unacceptable or economically infeasible degree .
Imagine : if the EROEI is only 2:1 , or if we want to transition all fossil fuels to renewables within 5 years ( via some kind of WWII - style economic mobilization ) , then a huge portion of our current fossil fuel use will need to be diverted to this renewables transition .
The result , due to underlying supply and demand inelasticity , will be massive price spikes , rationing , or other politically and economically devastating events .
Of course , if EROEI is 100:1 on a generating life of 20 years , or if our target is only to maintain current rates of renewables transition , then these problems wo n’t arise .
As I will argue later in this series , EROEI is likely far lower than 100:1 .
And I am working on the assumption that , independently due to peak oil and climate change , a status quo transition rate is unacceptable .
Transition Goal : First , it 's important to recognize that there are a variety of possible transition targets .
Some include : a general transition target ( either total transition to renewables , or transition to some arbitrary % ) , a peak - oil mitigation target , a peak fossil - fuel mitigation target , and a climate change mitigation target , to name a few .
All have differences and similarities .
Clearly , one can define a " target " that is plainly achievable , as can one define a " target " that simply can't be done ( e.g. 100 % transition by tomorrow ) .
As such , the definition of " transition target " represents an easily manipulable variable in any discussion of renewables transition .
If two people or organizations do n't address the same target , they 'll be constantly talking past each other in discussing renewables and the practicality of transition .
While I certainly do n't think that I 'll be able to convince all parties to adopt a unified transition target in this article , I do plan to argue for a threshold target that , in my opinion , represents a minimum rate of transition to keep the " viridian vision " of a renewable future possible : a peak oil mitigation target .
So , it seems clear that a renewable energy transition will need to , at a minimum , replace the decline in oil production post - peak with renewable energy generation .
I 'll elaborate on why I draw this line in the sand below , but in brief the viridian vision ( by which I mean a general continuation of our current neo-liberal , capitalist / market - socialist civilizational structure into the distant future by leveraging technological advances and a transition to a renewable energy base and " green " consumer function ) requires that we maintain generally the same level of present energy consumption into the foreseeable future .
It 's also important to point out the obvious , that there are significant differences between the energy produced by renewable technologies ( that , for our purposes , produce electricity ) and the energy lost by declining oil production .
In general terms , in order to use the electricity produced by renewables to replace oil , there will be an additional energy cost required to transition the energy - consuming infrastructure to utilize electricity rather than oil .
This will increase the overall amount of energy required to affect this transition .
For the time being , I 'll ignore this additional cost ( see my note on conversion efficiency of oil to electricity , below ) .
One key argument in favor of the viridian vision is that we can mitigate peak oil with increases in efficiency and energy conservation .
These arguments generally do n't , however , address how we 're going to meet the energy demands of 1 ) a growing population , and 2 ) a huge third - world population that wants to live at Western standards of energy consumption .
The more optimistic population estimates show the Earth 's population peaking at 8.3 billion , and more pessimistic estimates show population peaks between 9 and 13 billion .
It 's important to point out that many population estimates reason that population will stabilize -- and then decline -- because of the effect of bringing the standard of living of the world 's poor closer to Western standards .
Will the energy pressures presented by population growth and efforts to improve living standards roughly balance out any improvements in efficiency and conservation ?
I think so , but I recognize that this is a significant source of uncertainty .
In fact , I think that this is overly optimistic , and that demographic pressures will more than eat up any energy savings from efficiency and conservation .
Additionally , while the possibility of radical demand destruction due to significant global reduction in our standard of living would also “ solve ” peak oil , such a future is incompatible with the viridian vision that drives current transition efforts and political posturing .
For these reason , I think that we must increase renewable generation capacity at the same rate that oil production declines -- we can't count on efficiency and conservation to make up any of this decline with a sufficient degree of certainty .
If peak - oil mitigation is the target , then how fast must we build out renewable energy , and what is the energy “ burden ” of that project ?
Below I ’ll present an admittedly rough estimate of the numbers :
The world consumes roughly 500 Quads per year ( Quadrillion BTUs ) from all energy sources .
Of this roughly 186 Quads come from oil consumption .
IF you accept a post - peak decline rate of 5 % per year , then that represents a decline of 9.3 Quads per year .
9.3 Quads equates to roughly 102.3 GW - years , or 896,000 GWh .
To round that off , let 's call it 100 GW - years , or 900,000 GW - hours .
That 's how much new renewable generation must be added each year going forward to mitigate peak oil .
That 's the transition target .
How does that compare with current renewable generation rates ?
The current global installed ( nameplate ) solar capacity is about 15 GW , including about 5.5 GW added in 2008 .
That works out to roughly 1 GW - year of solar generation capacity added in 2008 .
At the end of 2008 , global ( nameplate ) wind generation capacity was 121 GW .
That works out to roughly 42 GW - years of total global wind generation annually , of which 35 GW , or about 12 GW - years of wind generation was added in 2008 .
Combining solar and wind , we added about 13 GW - years of renewable generation capacity in 2008 .
That 's a bit over 10 % of the rate at which we 'll need to add new renewable capacity each year just to compensate for a 5 % global oil production decline rate ( not to mention future natural gas decline , coal decline , etc. ) .
There are two take - aways from this : 1 ) the current rate at which we are increasing renewable energy generation is an order of magnitude lower than that necessary to mitigate peak oil , and 2 ) the amount of energy invested in renewable energy projects at present does not pose the kind of energy drain that will be presented by investment sufficient to mitigate peak oil .
On this last point , mitigating a decline of 4.4 million barrels of oil per day ( roughly 5 % of global total liquids production ) each year with new renewable generation capacity will impose a significant up - front energy cost . *
If the energy payback time is 1 year for the mitigating renewable source , and if we must increase current renewable energy investment by 90 % over current levels , then we need to invest the equivalent of an additional 3.96 million barrels of oil each day to facilitate the transition .
That 's like adding another half of China to global demand , and that 1 - year payback time assumes an EROEI of 40:1 on a 40 - year generating life .
If the energy payback time is 2 years ( or a 20:1 EROEI ) then you can add another full China to global demand .
If it 's 10 years ( an EROEI of 4:1 ) , then go ahead and add 5 Chinas .
You can see where this is going -- getting an accurate measure of EROEI , and properly understanding the mechanics of scalability , are critical before we can determine if it 's possible to achieve the peak oil - mitigation target outlined above ...
* I recognize that there is an efficiency loss if one converts oil to electricity .
While some reduction in this figure may be warranted on that ground , we must also consider the additional energy that must be invested to convert our fossil fuel consuming infrastructure into an electricity consuming infrastructure .
The degree to which these opposing forces balance each other out remains unknown .
Carbon considerations :
One of the most powerful arguments in favor of a transition to renewable energy generation is that these systems tend to have very low carbon emissions or be entirely carbon - neutral .
However , what is the carbon cost of the transition itself ?
At least the initial energy burden of a renewables transition will come primarily from fossil fuels , and therefore will be very carbon intensive .
Here , again , EROEI ( and EROEI as a function of generating life ) will be critical — a high EROEI means that a transition can be financed primarily by bootstrapping the clean energy from the initial wave of renewables to build ever more renewables in short order .
A low EROEI may mean that we must emit a huge lump of carbon in order to build out the renewables infrastructure on a timeline fast enough to deal with peak oil , let alone a more rapid transition designed to reduce carbon levels …
Wrapping up this first post , the issues of transition goals and carbon emissions hinge on the “ true ” EROEI of available renewable technology .
We cannot adequately formulate realistic transition goals , nor can we understand the climate implications of those goals ( or the feasibility of climate policies in general ) until we have a firm understanding of EROEI values .
As I will discuss in the next post , our current EROEI calculation methodology is inadequate and we ( should ) have little confidence in our EROEI estimates .
As a result , our energy policy plans at this point are largely an exercise in faith …

Obama Looses the Manhunters Charisma and the Imperial Presidency
By Tom Engelhardt
Let 's face it , even
Bo is photogenic , charismatic .
He 's a camera hound .
And as for Barack , Michelle , Sasha , and Malia -- keep in mind that we 're now in a first name culture -- they all glow on screen .
Before a camera they can do no wrong .
And the president himself , well , if you did n't watch his speech in Cairo , you should have .
The guy 's impressive .
Truly .
He can speak to multiple audiences -- Arabs , Jews , Muslims , Christians , as well as a staggering range of Americans -- and somehow just about everyone comes away hearing something they like , feeling he 's somehow on their side .
And it does n't even feel like pandering .
It feels like thoughtfulness .
It feels like intelligence .
For all I know -- and the test of this is still a long , treacherous way off -- Barack Obama may turn out to be the best pure politician we 've seen since at least Ronald Reagan , if not Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
He seems to have Roosevelt 's same unreadable ability to listen and make you believe he's with you ( no matter what he 's actually going to do ) , which is a skill not to be whistled at .
Right now , he and his people are picking off the last Republican moderates via a little party - switching and some well - crafted appointments , and so driving that party and its conservative base absolutely nuts , if not into extreme southern isolation .
In this sense , his first Supreme Court pick was little short of a political stroke of brilliance , whatever she turns out to do on the bench .
Whether the opposition " wins " ( which they wo n't ) or loses in any attempt to block her nomination , they stand to further alienate a key voting bloc , Hispanics .
Now 9 % of voters , Hispanics went for Obama in the last election by a staggering 35 - point margin .
Next time their heft might even bring solidly red-state Texas closer to in - play status in the two - party system .
In other words , the president has left his opponents in a situation where they can't win for losing .
Mix Roosevelt , Kennedy , and Reagan ...
All this is little short of amazing , particularly if put into even the most modest historical context .
If , in a Star - Trekkian mode -- hand me the " red matter , " Mr. Spock ! -- you could transport yourself back to early 2003 and tell just about any American what 's coming , you might have found yourself institutionalized .
If you had said that the new norm would be a black president with Reagan - like popularity , Kennedy - like charisma , and Roosevelt - like skills in the political arena , leading a majority Democratic Congress in search of universal health care , solutions to global warming , energy conservation , and bullet trains , your listener might , at best , have responded with his or her own joke : " A priest , a rabbi , and a penguin walk into a bar ... "
After all , back then , before two " hurricanes " -- the invasion of Iraq and Katrina -- began the process of turning our American world upside down , the Bush administration seemed to be riding ever higher globally and the Republican Party even higher than that at home .
Back then , the neocons were consumed with imperial dreams of shock - and - awe - style eternal global conquest and domination ( " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran " ) ; and the President 's " brain , " Karl Rove , now exiled to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal , was convinced that he was nailing down a domestic Pax Republicana for generations to come .
And at that moment , who would have denied that things would turn out just that way ?
So do n't let anyone tell you that history does n't have its surprises .
A black guy with the middle name of " Hussein , " a liberal Chicago politician from -- in a phrase Republicans then regularly spit out , as if saying " Democratic " was too much effort -- the " Democrat Party " ?
I do n't think so .
And yet , in mid-June 2009 , less than five months into the Obama presidency , can you even remember that era before the dawn of time when people were wondering what it would be like for an African - American family to inhabit the White House ?
Would American voters allow it ?
Could Americans take it ?
You betcha !
Being President
All that said , let 's not forget reality .
Barack Obama did not win an election to be president of Goodwill Industries , or the YMCA , or the Ford Foundation .
He may be remarkable in many ways , but he is also president of the United States which means that he is head honcho for the globe 's single great garrison state which now , to a significant extent , lives off war and the preparations for future war .
He is today the proprietor of -- to speak only of the region extending from North Africa to the Chinese border that the Bush loyalists used to call " the Greater Middle East " -- American bases , or facilities , or prepositioned military material ( or all of the above ) at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa , in Bahrain , Oman , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Kuwait , Iraq ( and Iraqi Kurdistan ) , Turkey , Afghanistan , Pakistan ( where the U.S. military and the CIA share Pakistani military facilities ) , and a major Air Force facility on the British - controlled Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia .
Some U.S. bases in these countries are microscopic and solitary , but others like Camp Victory or Balad Air Base , both in Iraq , are gigantic installations in a web of embedded bases .
According to an expert on the subject , Chalmers Johnson , the Pentagon 's most recent official count of U.S. " sites " ( i.e. bases ) abroad is 761 , but that does not include " espionage bases , those located in war zones , including Iraq and Afghanistan , and miscellaneous facilities in places considered too sensitive to discuss or which the Pentagon for its own reasons chooses to exclude -- e.g. in Israel , Kosovo , or Jordan . "
In January when he entered the Oval Office , Barack Obama also inherited the largest embassy on Earth , built in Baghdad by the Bush administration to imperial proportions as a regional command center .
It now houses what are politely referred to as 1,000 " diplomats . "
Recent news reports indicate that such a project was n't just an aberration of the Bush era .
Another embassy , just as gigantic , expected to house " a large military and intelligence contingent , " will be constructed by the Obama administration in its new war capital , Islamabad , Pakistan .
Once the usual cost overruns are added in , it may turn out be the first billion - dollar embassy .
Each of these command centers will , assumedly , anchor the American presence in the Greater Middle East .
Barack Obama is also now the commander - in - chief of 11 aircraft carrier strike groups , which regularly patrol the planet 's sea lanes .
He sits atop a U.S. Intelligence Community ( yes , that 's what our intelligence crew like to call themselves ) of at least 16 squabbling , overlapping agencies , heavily Pentagonized , and often at each other 's throats .
They have a cumulative hush - hush budget of perhaps $ 50 billion or more .
( Imagine a power so obsessively consumed by the very idea of " intelligence " that it is willing to support 16 sizeable separate outfits doing such work , and that 's not even counting various smaller offices dedicated to intelligence activities . )
The new president will preside over a country which now ponies up almost half the world 's total military expenditures .
His 2010 estimated Pentagon budget will be marginally higher than the last staggering one from the Bush years at $ 664 billion .
( The real figure , once military funds stowed away in places like the Department of Energy are included , is actually significantly larger . )
He now inhabits a Washington in which deep - thinking consists of a pundit like Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution whining that these bloated sums are , in fact , too little to " maintain " U.S. forces ( a budgetary increase of 7 - 8 % per year for the next decade would , he claims , be just adequate ) ; in which forward - looking means Secretary of Defense Robert Gates reorienting military spending toward preparations for fighting one , two , many Afghanistans ; and in which out - of - the - box , futuristic thinking means letting the blue - skies crew at DARPA ( the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) loose on far - out problems like how to turn " programmable matter " into future Transformer - like weapons of war .
While Obama enthusiasts can take pride in the appointment of some out - of - the - box thinkers in domestic areas , including energy , health , and the science of the environment , in two crucial areas his appointments are pure old - line Washington and have been so from the first post-election transitional moments .
His key economic players and advisors are largely a crew of former Clintonistas , or Clintonista wannabes or protégés like Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner .
They are distinctly inside - the - boxers , some of them responsible for the thinking that , in the 1990s , led directly to this catastrophic economic moment .
As for foreign policy , had the November election results been reversed , Obama 's top team of today could just as easily have been appointed by Senator John McCain .
National Security Advisor James Jones was actually a McCain friend , Gates someone he admired , and Hillary Clinton a figure he could well have picked for a top post after a narrow election victory , had he decided to reach out to the Democrats .
As a group , Obama 's key foreign policy figures and advisors are traditional players in the national security state and pre-Bush - style Washington guardians of American power , thinking globally in familiar ways .
General Manhunter
And let 's be careful not to put all of this in the passive voice either when it comes to the new president .
In both of these areas , he may have felt somewhat unsure of himself and so slotted in the old guard around him as a kind of political protection .
Nonetheless , this has n't just happened to him .
He did n't just inherit the presidency .
He went for it .
And he is n't just sitting atop it .
He 's actively using it .
He 's wielding power .
In foreign policy terms , he 's settling in -- and despite his Cairo speech and various hints of change on subjects like relations with Iran , in largely predictable ways .
He may , for example , have declared a sunshine policy when it comes to transparency in government , but in his war policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan , his imperial avatar is already plunging deep into the dark , distinctly opaque valley of death .
He 's just appointed a general , Stanley A. McChrystal , as his Afghan commander .
From 2003 - 2008 , McChrystal ran a special operations outfit in Iraq ( and then Afghanistan ) so secret that the Pentagon avoided mention of it .
In those years , its operatives were torturing , abusing , and killing Iraqis as part of a systematic targeted assassination program on a large scale .
It was , for those who remember the Vietnam era , a mini-Phoenix program in which possibly hundreds of enemies were assassinated : al - Qaeda - in - Iraq types , but also Sunni insurgents , and Sadrists ( not to speak of others , since informers always settle scores and turn over their own personal enemies as well ) .
Although he's now being touted in the press as the man to bring the real deal in counterinsurgency to Afghanistan ( and " protect " the Afghan population in the bargain ) , his actual field is " counter - terrorism . "
He spoke the right words to Congress during his recent confirmation hearings , but pay no attention .
The team he's now assembling in Washington to lead his operations in Afghanistan ( and someday maybe Pakistan ) tells you what you really need to know .
It 's filled with special operations types .
The expertise of his chosen key lieutenants is , above all , in special ops work .
At the same time , reports Rowan Scarborough at Fox News , an extra 1,000 special operations troops are now being " quietly " dispatched to Afghanistan , bringing the total number there to about 5,000 .
Keep in mind that it's been the special operations forces , with their kick - down - the - door night raids and air strikes , who have been involved in the most notorious incidents of civilian slaughter , which continue to enrage Afghans .
Note , by the way , that while the president is surging into Afghanistan 21,000 troops and advisors ( as well as those special ops forces ) , ever more civilian diplomats and advisors , and ever larger infusions of money , there is now to be a command surge as well .
General McChrystal , according to a recent New York Times article , has " been given carte blanche to handpick a dream team of subordinates , including many Special Operations veterans ... [ He ] is assembling a corps of 400 officers and soldiers who will rotate between the United States and Afghanistan for a minimum of three years .
That kind of commitment to one theater of combat is unknown in the military today outside Special Operations , but reflects an approach being imported by General McChrystal , who spent five years in charge of secret commando teams in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Like the new mega-embassy in Pakistan , this figure -- the Spartans , after all , only needed 300 warriors at Thermopylae -- tells us a great deal about the top - heavy manner in which the planet 's super - garrison state fights its wars .
So , this is now truly Obama 's war , about to be run by his chosen general , a figure from the dark side .
Expect , then , from our sunshine president 's men an ever bloodier secret campaign of so - called counter - terror ( though it 's essence is likely to be terror , pure and simple ) , as befits an imperial power trying to hang on to the Eastern reaches of the Greater Middle East .
The new crew are n't counterinsurgency warriors , but -- a term that has only recently entered our press -- " manhunters . "
And do n't forget , President Obama is now presiding over an expanding war in which " manhunters " engaging in systematic assassination programs will not only be on the ground but , thanks to the CIA 's escalating program of targeted assassination by robot aircraft , in the skies over the Pakistani tribal borderlands .
For those who care to remember , it was into counter - terrorism and an orgy of manhunting , abuse , and killing that the Vietnam era version of " counterinsurgency " dissolved as well .
Into the Charnel House of History
A neologism coined for the expanding Afghan war has recently come into widespread use : Af - Pak ( for Afghanistan - Pakistan Theater of Operations ) .
But the coining of neologisms should n't just be left to those in Washington , so let me suggest one that hints at one possible new world over which our newest president may unexpectedly preside : Ir - Af - Pak .
Let it stand , conveniently , for the Iraq - Iran - Afghanistan - Pakistan Theater of Operations -- a neologism that catches the perilously expansionist and devolutionary possibilities of our moment .
Media organizations in increasingly tight financial straits sense the explosive nature of this expansionist moment and , even as they are fleeing Iraq ( and former bureaus in so many other places ) , like the president , they are doubling down and piling into Afghanistan and Pakistan .
But do n't count Iraq pacified yet .
It remains an uneasy , dangerous , explosive place as , in fact , does the Greater Middle East .
Worse yet , the Af - Pak War may not itself be done expanding .
It could still , for instance , seep into one or more of the Central Asian ' stans , among other places , and already has made it into catastrophic Somalia , while a shaky Yemen could be swept into the grim festivities .
Finally , let 's return to that " dream team " being put together by Obama 's man in Afghanistan .
That team of Spartans , according to the New York Times , is being formed with , minimally , a three - year horizon .
This in itself is striking .
After all , the Afghan War started in November 2001 .
So when the shortest possible Afghan tour of duty of the 400 is over , it will have been going on for more than 10 ½ years -- and no one dares to predict that , three years from now , the war will actually be at an end .
Looked at another way , the figure cited should probably not be one decade , but three .
After all , our Afghan adventure began in 1980 , when , in the jihad against the Soviets , we were supporting some of the very same fundamentalist figures now allied with the Taliban and fighting us in Afghanistan -- just as , once upon a time , we looked positively upon the Taliban ; just as , once , we looked positively upon Saddam Hussein , who was for a while seen as our potential bulwark in the Middle East against the fundamentalist Islamic Republic of Iran .
( Remarkably enough , only Iran has , until this moment , retained its position as our regional enemy over these decades . )
What a record , then , of blood and war , of great power politics and imperial hubris , of support for the heinous ( including various fundamentalist groups and grim , authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes who remain our allies to this day ) .
What a tale of imperial power frittered away and treasure squandered .
Truly , Rudyard Kipling would have been able to do something with this .
As for me , I find myself in awe of these decades of folly .
Thirty years in Afghanistan , it staggers the imagination .
What tricks does that land play with the minds of imperial Great - Gamers ?
Maybe it has something to do with those poppies .
Who knows ?
I 'm no Kipling , but I am aware that this sorry tale has taken up almost half of my lifetime with no end in sight .
In the meantime , our new president has loosed the manhunters .
His manhunters .
This is where charisma disappears into the charnel house of history .
Watch out .

The Palm Springs City Council is expected to give final approval Wednesday night to an ordinance that would allow two medical marijuana dispensaries within certain industrial zones in the city .
If the measure receives final approval , it will go into effect after 30 days , making Palm Springs the first city in Riverside County to officially allow medical marijuana dispensaries .
The City Council on Feb. 18 gave initial approval to the proposed ordinance , which would limit the number of medical marijuana dispensaries to two , and only let them operate in industrial zones .
Douglas Holland , the city 's attorney , has said there are as many as seven illegal dispensaries operating within the city .
He said he is working to file civil complaints against those dispensaries to shut them down until the proposed regulations go into effect .
U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder announced last week that raids by the Drug Enforcement Administration on marijuana dispensaries in states where medical marijuana is legal will be stopped .
Proposition 215 , approved by California voters in 1996 , made it legal to sell marijuana -- on a nonprofit basis -- to people who have a doctor 's prescription .
Since then hundreds of dispensaries have sprung up throughout the state .
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law .
Before the attorney general 's announcement , DEA agents raided many dispensaries throughout Southern California .
Under the proposed ordinance , cooperatives and collectives would not be allowed within 1,000 feet of each other or within 500 feet of schools , public parks , playgrounds , churches , youth centers or residential areas .
The dispensaries would also have to operate within specific industrial zones within Palm Springs .
Other provisions state that the dispensaries must be set up as nonprofit collectives or cooperatives , as recommended in the guidelines issued by California Attorney General Jerry Brown in August .
The oldest alcoholic beverage in the history of mankind is beer .
It was invented more than 6 thousand years ago in middle East .
But tourists do not go to its home in Iraq and Iran to drink beer .
They do n’t go even to Turkey from where , apparently , it came to the territory of Europe .
Czech and Belgium , have become the main European centers of beer production .
If Belgium is famous for huge quantity of all kinds of “ double ” and “ triple ” ale and fruit beer , the Czech Republic have long kept the first for the production and consumption of barley excellent – light and dark .
“ Disyatki ” , “ lejaki ” and “ tmave ” sound familiar for beer - lovers , made pilgrimages to the country for several times , where , after 8 pm meeting local people on the streets of the city can only be accidental .
The entire Czech Republic is sitting on the basement pubs and bars and drink their favorite beverage .
And in a small provincial town of the past this happens after 5 pm .
Czech brewer ’s are the best ones of all the former Soviet countries that has preserved the atmosphere of “ Soviet ” bars , and therefore you do n’t have to rely on the servility of fussy waiters .
“ U FLEC ” or “ Beer Dum ” are widespread tourist sites in Prague , and as every well - known restaurant abroad will serve ( and cheat ) travelers with a hundred - percent quality .
However in order to understand the real taste and culture of Czech beer , you should go to other places .
“ Do Midvidki ” which is located in the old location near the major « Tesco » Brewery is a hotel - pub that remains popular among citizens of Prague but is not too popular with tourists .
Besides the three huge halls and a summer verandah , people will find a small room facilities , where semi - welded served beer is served .
To spill this beer in the glasses , tourists have to wait for 15 - 20 minutes , as this is how long it takes foam to go down .
But it ’s worth it !
Actually there are not a lot of people who get to the secret room .
The famous bar « A black ox » near Loretsk square remains a local pub , despite the proximity to one of the most popular hiking trails in Prague .
Apparently , the reason is the local residents occupy all the tables starting from morning and it is almost impossible break through .
Yes , they will greet foreign visitors and say goodbye , but the parting will be especially loud and happy , when the tourists leave with nothing .
Czechs preserve their secret places .
Still , travelers just need to stay here as in Prague to try unbottled dark « Velikopopovitskogo Roebuck » which can be found in very limited number of bars .
If you can not attached to « A black ox » , you can get to the bar called « A goat » , which is located in Prague - 3 , Jan Zhelivskogo 4 .
This is also purely a local institution , but as tourists come to these edges less resistance to them is not as cohesive .
Between the two streets , rising to the Loreto and Stragovski monasteries , almost at the top you can find a narrow passage .
A few people go there but it is necessary to visit a small bar , the entrance to which is hidden in the wall lane .
Beer here is delicious – but no more than elsewhere in Prague .
Prices here are higher , but this is only because you can see an incredible view of the capital of the Czech Republic .
It does not matter whether one will drink a glass of beer or eat a full meal at one of the tables on the terrace , but you should be here .
There are many bars on the river bank in Český Krumlov , but there is a restaurant on the left of the bridge in the second house .
Here you can find not just another outstanding local beer , but they also prepare beautiful old dishes of Czech kitchen , and serve them in an authentic dish .
In addition , there is a small but representative museums and there are always sits available on the terrace of the River .
It is very difficult escape from tourists in Karlovy Vary .
Still , here is the place where the prices are acceptable , and beer is not going to the usual tourist attractions .
In the heart of Karlovy Vary in the famous hotels you can climb to the mountain on the cable car and appear at the foot lookout tower .
Leap up , glance at the prestigious look and down again .
In Karlstejn , after inspection of the castle you can hurry no more and go down the same path .
At the entrance to the castle right under the pointer « A Dragon » trail begins .
Walk along the road for about 300 meters and you can find another Czech treasure .
« A Dragon » is designed especially for tourists , and is accepted as the best restaurant on the quality of beer and food .
Please always keep in mind that excess use of beer may lead to alcoholism which is quite dangerous condition as it can simply ruin ones life , if you have such problems you need to learn how to help yourself and if necessary to start alcoholism treatment to help yourself to get you life get
* Says no plans to close or sell any of its hotels
* Does not seek DIP financing
* Lists assets of $ 7.1 bln , debt of $ 7.6 bln ( Adds comment on Blackstone , background )
BANGALORE , June 15 ( Reuters ) - Debt - strapped hotel chain Extended Stay Inc [ ESAIN.UL ] filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday , becoming the latest leveraged buyout deal to crater as the U.S. recession culled travel to its chain of 680 hotels .
Extended Stay struggled with a faltering economy and large debt load , following companies such as media group Tribune Co into bankruptcy .
New Jersey - based real estate investment firm Lightstone Group LLC bought Extended Stay from private - equity firm Blackstone Group LP in June last year , shortly before global credit markets began a tightening from which they have yet to recover .
Lightstone borrowed about $ 7.4 billion for the buyout .
Blackstone has no remaining exposure -- either in equity or debt -- to Extended Stay , a source familiar with the situation said .
Extended Stay , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , said it had no plans to close or sell any of its hotels .
The Spartanburg , South Carolina - based firm also said it did not seek any debtor - in - possession financing as it generates “ significant positive cash flow . ”
In documents filed with the court , the company said it was in a liquidity crisis as the recession had a devastating impact on occupancy rates .
Extended Stay said it was “ significantly over - leveraged ” and the projected cash flows could not continue to service its debt , which is in excess of $ 7 billion .
In its filing , Extended Stay listed assets of about $ 7.1 billion and liabilities of about $ 7.6 billion as of December 2008 .
The recession has hit many hotel chains hard because leisure and business customers are traveling less or demanding lower rates .
The company said the contraction of construction and new business development had begun to hurt its revenue stream .
Extended Stay ’s hotels are managed by HVM LLC , an affiliate that employs about 10,000 people at any given time to run the day - to - day operations at the hotels , court filings showed .
Earlier this month , investors who had bought debt that helped finance an $ 8 billion buyout of Extended Stay sued banks that had provided much of the financing , accusing them of scheming to seize the properties and wipe them out .
Extended Stay has roughly 76,000 rooms in some 680 hotels in 44 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces .
The case is In re : Extended Stay Inc , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York , No.09 - 13764 .

* Boxed warnings added to Solvay , Auxilium gels
* Serious side effect reported in young children
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it will require strong warnings to be added to two testosterone replacement gel products after numerous reports of troubling side effects in children who were exposed to the medicines .
Very young children who came into contact with the male hormone gel experienced inappropriate enlargement of the penis or clitoris , premature development of pubic hair , advanced bone age , increased libido , and aggressive behavior , the FDA said .
The so - called “ black box ” warnings will be included on the labels for Solvay ’s AndroGel and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc ’s Testim .
The testosterone replacement therapies come in gel form and are typically administered by rubbing the product on the upper arm or shoulder .
Under the current label , patients are advised to wash their hands after using the product and to cover the treated skin with clothing .
As of December 1 , 2008 , the FDA said it had received reports of eight cases of secondary exposure to testosterone in children ranging in age from nine months to five years , primarily due to direct contact between the treated skin and the child .
Additional reports of potential secondary exposures are under review , the agency said .
In at least one case , a child was hospitalized and underwent surgery due to a delay in recognizing the cause of the symptoms , the FDA said .
The gels are intended for use in men who either no longer produce testosterone or produce it in very low amounts .
“ These drugs are approved for an important medical need , but can have serious , unintended side effects if not used properly , ” Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , said in a statement .
“ We must ensure that the adults using them are well - informed about the precautions needed to protect children from secondary exposure . ”
In most cases , the signs and symptoms regressed when the child no longer was exposed to the product , although the agency said in a few cases , enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age - appropriate size and bone age remained modestly greater than the child ’s chronological age .
The required label changes will provide additional information about the risk of secondary exposure and the steps that should be taken to reduce the risk , the FDA said .
Some 1.4 million prescriptions for AndroGel and 370,000 prescriptions for Testim were filled by U.S. retail pharmacies in 2007 , according to data cited by the FDA .

L ars von Trier 's sex horror film Antichrist won an " anti- prize " at the closing of the Cannes Film Festival last weekend for being " the most misogynistic movie " at the fest .
Right sentiment , wrong movie .
Despite its scenes of graphic mutilation , including one where star Charlotte Gainsbourg lops off her clitoris with a pair of rusty scissors , Antichrist was actually less hostile to women than many other high - profile pictures at Cannes .
The ecumenical jury , a non-official panel of Christian filmmakers and critics who judge films by their spiritual values , awarded the dubious " anti-prize . "
Their unprecedented slapdown was denounced as " a ridiculous decision that borders on a call for censorship " by festival chief Thierry Frémaux , who had the last laugh when the official Cannes jury gave Gainsbourg its Best Actress award .
Frémaux 's outrage is understandable , and would be shared by most filmmakers , critics and movie buffs .
A festival rightly celebrates innovation in form and idea , and it's the proper place to see films that might be at odds with mainstream values .
But change does seem to be occurring at an accelerated pace , as films with explicit sex , violence and degradation become more the norm than the exception , especially regarding the depiction of women .
It 's too easy to dismiss the ecumenical jury as uptight Bible thumpers .
The spiritual seekers were onto something , even if their lances were aimed at the wrong target .
Antichrist is in many respects a conventional " B " horror film about demonic possession .
Gainsbourg 's character is researching the medieval persecution of women as witches ; she falls prey to supernatural dark forces , not mortal male evil .
The fact is that misogyny – hatred of women – was insidious in the official selection at Cannes this year , both in the competition and programs like Un Certain Regard .
It was rare to find a movie where the central female was n't playing a whore , a nut case , a victim or all three , most often as the result of male treachery .
This included Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon , the winner of this year 's Palme d'Or .
Anti-woman animus is most viscerally in evidence in Kinatay , an appalling drama by Filipino director Brillante Mendoza that shows the kidnap , rape , torture , murder and dismemberment of a prostitute in excruciating real time by indifferent males .
None of the gory details are spared ( the title is Tagalog for " slaughter ) , a dedication that controversially won Mendoza the festival 's prize for Best Director .
Enter the Void by Gaspar Noé sets acrobatic standards for female debasement in its risible and raunchy ghost saga .
Paz de la Huerta plays a Tokyo stripper named Linda who is haunted by the spirit of her recently murdered brother , Oscar ( Nathaniel Brown ) , a junkie with incestuous urges .
Linda is used as a sexual plaything by both men and women throughout this nearly three - hour - long slog , which culminates with an act of illicit male penetration viewed from inside the vagina .
Haneke's
The White Ribbon expertly continues the Austrian helmer 's cynical and unsparing view of humanity , but women are especially fraught this time .
The movie is set in a remote German village on the cusp of World War I , a crucible of nascent fascism where the village elders variously commit incest with their daughters , physically and emotionally abuse their spouses and lovers , and generally treat women like chattel .
The hermetic misogyny of The White Ribbon finds a modern parallel in Yorgos Lanthimos 's Dogtooth , the winner of the Un Certain Regard top prize .
It 's a fascinating but harrowing exercise in social engineering in which a sociopath father keeps his wife and children imprisoned within their garden home , shut off from the world and its many temptations .
The only person from the outside who comes to the home is the father 's female co-worker , paid to sexually service the teenage son .
No attention is paid to the hormonal urges of the elder daughter , who is beaten by her father when she begins to question his authority .
Even those filmmakers who normally feature strong and lustful women had trouble finding their feminine side at Cannes this year .
Pedro Almodóvar 's Broken Embraces stars frequent muse Penélope Cruz in various guises as four of the most stereotypical of female characters : secretary , hooker , actress and mistress .
Had Almodóvar worked in a Madonna role for Cruz as well , he'd have covered the misogynistic map ; it 's a far cry from the lustful character Cruz played in his earlier Volver .
But all this hostility toward woman is n't just the work of misguided male filmmakers .
The most anti-woman image at Cannes this year , because it was so gratuitous , is the opening of Isabel Coixet 's Map of the Sounds of Tokyo , a ludicrous time - waster about a morose woman ( Babel 's Rinko Kikuchi ) who works as a fish cutter but moonlights as a hit - woman .
Coixet shows us a group of Japanese businessman sitting around tables , leering and laughing as they eat sushi off the torsos of naked women who lie before them .
This racist and sexist scene adds nothing to the plot and seems to have been filmed for its shock value alone .
It 's not unusual to have films like this at festivals , but it was unusual to have so many of them competing for the Palme .
This is n't the fault of the Cannes selectors , who choose films by directorial reputation more than by subject matter .
But it does suggest that many prominent filmmakers have slipped into a moral abyss where the debasement of women is n't a concern , or worse , is deliberately used to titillate critics and festival programmers , who are mostly male .
When pressed to explain themselves , filmmakers typically claim to be responding to mystical forces and not at all to audience sensibilities .
Mendoza defends the extreme nature of Kinatay by calling it a realistic horror film where " it makes it a different kind of dimension " if the viewer is fully immersed in the carnage .
He told a Cannes press conference that similar murders and mutilations are a fact of life in the Philippines .
" This really exists ; this is not just entertainment . "
Von Trier has been called misogynistic before , most famously by Nicole Kidman , star of his earlier Palme contender Dogville .
He offers a complicated and contradictory defence in his production notes to Antichrist :
" I do n't think women or their sexuality is evil , but it is frightening ...
I provoke myself , too , you know .
My mother was a dyed - in - the - wool women 's libber .
I 'm pretty open about gender equality .
I just do n't think it 'll ever really happen . "
And what about the women themselves ?
Actresses seem strangely complicit about accepting roles that are harrowing at best and dehumanizing at worst .
Maria Isabel Lopez , who plays the tortured and murdered prostitute in Kinatay , is a former model and Miss Philippines winner who knows all about living in a male world .
At the Kinatay press conference , she strongly defended her right to be in the film .
" When I do a movie for Brillante , it does n't matter if I 'm a former Miss Philippines .
I 'm there as a character ...
I 'm old enough to do roles like this , and having a title has nothing to do with this film . "
Gainsbourg was equally acquiescent to her director at the Antichrist presser : " I think I was ready for anything .
...
One simply had to follow the guidance given by Lars . ...
It was quite an experience , very intense .
Not a lot of talking .
Something that I wo n't live again that soon , and I knew that . "
The women on the female - dominated Cannes jury did n't have a problem , either .
For the first time at Cannes , there were more women than men on the Palme panel , five females to four males .
Yet they did n't flinch from honouring films that in many cases presented women in ignoble circumstances .
Which suggests that the situation is n't likely to change anytime soon .
On the contrary , such extreme behaviour is more likely to seep into the mainstream .
Cultural standards this year alone have shifted noticeably .
The mainstream action blockbuster Watchmen had a fully nude male character and the romantic comedy Away We Go , coming soon to a multiplex near you , opens with a scene of cunnilingus that leaves little to the imagination .
In this context , singling out Antichrist for being misogynistic seems not only narrow - minded but also downright unfair .
To the surprise of surely no one , Time Warner said it plans to spin off AOL later this year in a move that will unwind a merger that seemed doomed from the start and foretold the broader reversal of internet company fortunes in the soon - to - follow dot - com bust .
Time Warner said its board had approved the initiative , signaled for months , in a way which would ensure that it would be tax - free to shareholders , which had been a major sticking point .
It plans to purchase the 5 % of the company Google owns before the separation .
The deal still requires regulatory approval .
The tie - up announced on Jan. 10 , 2000 was something of a crescendo in the hot internet market of the 1990's , unveiled with all the throbbing - music stagecraft of the release of a rock band 's tour dates .
There was new media wunderkind Steve Case , uncharacteristically wearing a tie , and old media tycoon Jerry Levin , uncharacteristically sporting an open collar .
If only everyone had seen what was wrong with that picture at the time .
Billed as a " merger of equals " the tie - up was more a tale of the minnow swallowing the shark , with AOL shareholders actually owning 55 % of the new company .
The all - stock deal made Case , who had built up AOL from a few hundred thousand customers to more than 30 million in 6 years or so , seem even more the internet genius .
Case became chairman of the behemoth , and Time Warner 's Levin remained CEO .
AOL Time Warner was instantly the largest media company in the world , with a market cap of $ 350 billion .
Shares in the two companies surged in the immediate afterglow of the news , but when reality set in the value of the company began a steady decline .
While it seemed brilliant on paper the marriage of a major content company — with interests in film , TV , telecommunications and publishing — with the hot internet company of the day simply never worked out .
AOL 's supremacy was based on its dial - up business , which broadband had already begun to erode , and a walled - garden approach online content that was already becoming stale , so the supposed synergies were non-existent .
Then Google came along and ate everyone 's advertising - business lunch on the open web .
But even before the tectonic changes in the industry the handwriting was on the wall : AOL Time Warner reported a $ 99 billion loss in 2002 — at the time , the largest ever by a US company — and in 2003 dropped " AOL " from the corporate name .
In March former Google executive Tim Armstrong signed on to run the AOL division , now clearly with the understanding that he'd get the chance to breathe life into a new , stand - alone company .
Armstrong was an early star Google employee and headed up US ad sales during its frenetic expansion .
As Wired 's Fred Vogelstein put it at the time , Armstrong seems especially well suited to turn AOL around , noting that under a stifling Time Warner tent AOL ceased to be the innovator Google had become .
" But unlike Google , which is an innovation machine , AOL has become a place where good ideas go to die .
You do n’t innovate as an AOL executive anymore , you make grandiose claims about a vision and wait for the next restructuring that frees you from any accountability .
" Fixing this poisonous culture will no doubt be Armstrong ’s first order of business , and if AOL was a stand alone company I ’d think he had a good shot at making it happen . "

They buzz irritably and contaminate food .
So when Barack Obama slapped dead a fly during a news interview , some people would have been looking for tips .
What 's the most effective method ?
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Attempts to swat flies usually end in fluster , breathlessness and frustration .
But for the man described as the most powerful in the world - yes , he can kill a fly with a single blow .
Halting his television interview momentarily as a fly landed on his left hand , President Obama hit it with his right .
" I got the sucker , " he declared , as the corpse fell to the White House carpet .
So what is the best way to swat a fly ?
Here are 10 suggestions .
1 . Do it early in the day , says Max Barclay , an insect expert at the Natural History Museum .
" Because they are cold - blooded , the reactions of insects depend on the temperature of the air .
Early in the morning or in the evening they will be a bit dopey , but in the heat of the day they will be very quick . "
But expect failure .
Barack Obama was probably quite lucky , unless he 's been practising .
" Nine times out of 10 , a human will come off second best .
Flies have a phenomenal barrage of senses , half of which we do n't have . "
2 . Approach from behind , goes one theory , because flies take off backwards .
Anecdotal evidence suggests some people find this a successful method .
But the fact that flies have 360 - degree vision and can jump in any direction makes it improbable .
Flies usually outwit humans 3 .
Aim ahead , rather than at , the fly say researchers in the US , who found that within milliseconds of sensing a threat , flies get their body ready to take off forward , backwards or sideways .
" Given that they are going to be jumping away from the swat , it 's best to aim slightly ahead of it , " says Michael Dickinson , of the California Institute of Technology .
Although how far ahead depends on the speed of the fly .
He 's been studying take - offs for five years , using video that provides 5,400 frames a second of a fly 's precise motion when threatened with a swatting .
4 . The old - fashioned slap , now known as The Barack .
Stay still , keep focused , take aim and attack .
Ideal for a fast hand and if the fly is stationary .
And if the world 's media is in attendance , YouTube fame beckons .
5 . Implements with holes are more effective , says Dr Peter Barnard , director of science at the Royal Entomological Society .
" It 's the air pressure they detect and fly away from .
It 's not so much that they see something coming , but they feel the pressure wave in front of the object . "
This is due to their coating of microscopic hairs , highly sensitive to air movement .
Practising what he preaches , Dr Barnard uses a plastic pistol that fires a holed circular device .
A fly swat gun , if you will .
6 . Use chopsticks , like the Karate Kid .
Under guidance from his instructor Mr Miyagi , teenager Daniel LaRusso demonstrates his speed and hand - eye coordination , and learns an important life lesson at the same time .
Mr Miyagi 's advice - " Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything " - features on T - shirts in homage to the 1984 film .
7 . Put hands either side of the fly , facing each other , so it does n't know where the threat comes from , then clap the air a few inches above it .
Wash hands immediately to remove the contents of the fly 's stomach ( do n't ask ) .
8 . Get a gadget .
At the hi-tech end of the market there 's an electric - powered mesh , a dome complete with pheromone and an insecticide aerosol .
For those on a budget , there are decorative window stickers or pens to coat windows with transparent insecticide , and fly - swats cost as little as £ 2 .
Animal rights organisation PETA , which advocates compassion for flies , says there are humane bug - catching devices available too .
9 . Improvise with a rolled - up newspaper ( bear in mind point five , above ) , or a spray window - cleaner .
10 .
The humane approach - to capture but not kill .
" I like to grab them in my hands , " says Mr Barclay , who 's had plenty of practice .
" When you want them for a collection you do n't want them damaged .
Hit them with the palm of your hand and close your fingers over it . "
And if you 're not an entomologist , release the fly outside .
It will make you feel better .
Below is a selection of your comments .
A hand - pumped air pistol , without a BB or pellet , creates a high velocity wind sheer that will compromise the structural integrity of a fly , without splattering it .
You can then pick it up with a Kleenex or toilet paper , and finish it off ...
Tackdriver , Winsted CT , USA
Buy a border collie and train it .
Jack Sterling , London
If you 've got five minutes spare , then do n't let the fly land and rest .
Eventually it will get exhausted and then you can easily go in for the kill .
Simon Hartley , Dukinfield
My car seems to do a pretty good job of it .
Obviously this is whilst travelling at 60 mph on an open road , not very practical indoors .
Geraint , Cardiff
Buy yourself some pitcher plants , sundews or fly traps .
Great for the kids to learn about and a natural way of getting rid of the flies .
Or , if you want to go the whole hog , buy yourself a Nephilia species spider ( a large Orb - Web Spider ) and allow it to set up a web in your room .
Job done .
Not sure many will opt for the latter though ...
Johanna Turner , Redhill , Surrey Wear flip - flops .
A ready - made fly swat available at all times !
My blue ones did a good job last week , although I had to wipe the window afterwards ( ugh ! ) .
Kate , Oxford , UK Wait ' til the fly settles on a surface ( usually a window ) .
Approach it slowly with an upturned glass ( it must be a glass as its transparent ) .
The fly will not move .
It is then trapped inside the glass .
Slide something flat in between the surface and the rim of the glass and release the fly outside .
Works every time .
Kevin Goult , Birmingham
The best swatter is a thin rubber band .
Cut it so its not a loop , wait for the fly to settle , then ping it with the rubber band .
It 's like a whip .
Stuart Martin , Wolverhampton , UK I always find a slow approach until you see the fly tense ( it'll suddenly jerk its legs ) , I can usually get about 6 - 10 inches away , followed by a fast final slap works best .
Mark Hooton , Guernsey
My cat is awesome at catching flies .
He will be laying down when an unsuspecting fly will buzzes past him , he simply plucks it out the air - admittedly when he lifts his paw up it flies away , but it 's still impressive .
James Embleton , Peterborough I find the easiest way for the lazy among us is to kill the fly while air freshening your house .
It 's not terribly humane but the chemicals within most household cleaners will quickly render any insect ; flies , moths , etc unable to move or fly , then I just put it out of its misery .
All that plus the room in which the killing took place smells much nicer too .
Paul Goldstraw , Canterbury Visiting my brother in Australia , I noticed him using a device like a small toy gun which fired a circular plastic disc a couple of inches in diameter at the fly .
You had to get up fairly close before firing but I guess the idea was that as you were firing a disc it did n't matter too much which direction the fly took off in .
My brother was quite proficient at it .
Helen , Berkshire
Suck them up with a dust - buster and release out the window - everyone 's a winner !
Richard Baker , Preston , England I 've always found that trying to grab them in mid air is a good method that usually works for me .
But , if the fly is stationary , if you move your finger towards it in a large circular motion , getting smaller the closer to the fly you get , spiralling towards the little cretin , it does n't seem to sense the pressure or be above to watch the movement , so once you are within striking distance you can pounce , and there is your trophy , albeit squished and on the end of your finger .
John Wilkes , Gateshead
You missed out the best option of all and it works !
Flies see things through compound eyes and therefore see hundreds of slightly different images at the same time , a bit like holding a crystal up to your eye and seeing many images .
They also see many more frames per second compared to us who see around 25 frames per second .
Therefore they are extremely good at detecting rapid motion .
But this strength is their weakness - they can not see things which move very slowly !
Therefore all you do is stretch out one finger and very , very slowly move the finger towards the fly until you can gently place it on its back and press it against the surface .
You can then slide a piece of paper under it and take it outside to fly away ( albeit probably with a couple of broken legs ) .
I have demonstrated this a number of times at the dinner table in Germany , where flies are attracted to the platters of cold meat and cheese which seem to accompany every meal .
Elliott Young , London
The flick of a tea towel works very well .
The towel creates less air pressure moving towards the fly .
The towel is faster than the movement of the human hand ( which is incredibly slow from the fly 's point of view ) .
The towel has a wider surface area than most objects as it spreads while travelling through the air .
And there is n't the messy impact referred to in the main article .
For a smaller and slower moving fly ( which is still fast for us humans ) the two handed clap motion works best .
Air pressure moves in two directions towards the fly , the shock wave created by the hand clap can stun or kill the fly ( even if you slightly miss ) .
As for the early morning insect , the finger flick is best as the finger moves very fast and you can approach quite close as they do n't move in time .

With $ 45 billion in capital and $ 2.1 trillion in assets , the central bank would not withstand the scrutiny normally afforded other institutions , Grant said in a live interview .
" If the Fed examiners were set upon the Fed 's own documents — unlabeled documents — to pass judgment on the Fed 's capacity to survive the difficulties it faces in credit , it would shut this institution down , " he said .
" The Fed is undercapitalized in a way that Citicorp is undercapitalized . "
Grant said he would support legislation currently making its way through Congress calling for an audit of the Fed .
Moreover , he criticized the way the Fed has managed the financial crisis , saying the central bank 's target rate should not be around zero .
AMMAN , Jordan  Arriving in Jordan on his first trip to the Holy Land as pope , Benedict XVI on Friday expressed his “ deep respect ” for Muslims and his desire for the Roman Catholic Church to play a major role in fostering peace in the Middle East .
Benedict was greeted at the airport by Jordan ’s king , Abdullah II , on the first leg of an eight - day trip to Jordan , Israel and the Palestinian territories on which the pontiff ’s every word and gesture will be scrutinized .
In 2006 , Benedict offended many Muslims with a speech in Regensburg , Germany , in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who said that Islam encouraged violence and brought things “ evil and inhuman . ”
On Friday , Benedict praised Jordan for its commitment to religious liberty and singled out the efforts of the Common Word initiative , a group of Muslim scholars and clerics formed with Jordanian support in response to the Regensburg speech .
I was preparing a character for an upcoming sci- fi campaign , and was considering a little brawling skill .
The min-maxer in me said , “ Forget that crap !
Unless you go super - monk , there ’s no such thing as unarmed combat , and certainly no such thing as nonlethal combat . ”
And sadly , that ’s usually the case .
You do n’t get too many nice fists - only bar fights , people always whip out the high impact weapons .
Which is a shame .
Star Trek , for example , was always all about the unarmed combat ; easily the wide majority over phaser combat .
And unarmed combat ’s great for plots .
People do n’t get killed , so you get prisoners , further interaction , etc .
In fact , in many a movie / TV plot , people have a knock - down - drag - out fistfight and even become friends over the course of it .
Of course , in an RPG everyone assumes any combat will be to the brutal death , and thus moves to deal it out before they take it .
One fix to this is metagame .
The GM can just make it clear what is a “ friendly ” combat and what is n’t .
In a friendly combat , you understand that nonlethal is the way to go , consequences for losing will not be severe , and it may be an opportunity for role - playing and not pure tactical optimization .
Alternately , you can set really strong and realistic reactions to violence in - game .
If there ’s a bar fight , those just punching get off ; those who shivved someone go to jail .
I ran a long term high immersion D&D campaign and had to do that at its beginning .
I clearly set out my vision for the game , but old habits die hard .
Two of the characters start asking around in a bar for information ; one guy tells them to slag off ; next thing you know they chase him out into a field outside town and shoot him with a crossbow .
Luckily he was still alive when the local sheriff showed up .
The sheriff collected everyone and heard them out .
Entertainingly , the PCs ’ story was , “ We thought he had information and he talked back to us and ran off so we shot him ! ”
“ Is that the story you ’re sticking with ? ” “ Yeah , why ? ”
One of the two saw how it was going and voluntarily paid a fine and did restitution .
The other one stuck to his guns , though , and wanted a trial .
You should have seen his face when the mayor sentenced him to three months hard labor in the mines .
Time for a new character !
It sucked , but it made the point and people considered the consequences before they drew steel thereafter .
New Glass Prevents Birds From Colliding with Windows
July 14th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
A new exterior film for glass has been developed which can be seen by birds but not humans .
It could be used to help prevent the needless deaths of billions of birds which collide with windows annually .
Collisions with windows are estimated to be the most common cause of bird death worldwide aside from habitat loss .
The numbers of deaths are staggering , outranking deaths by domestic cat , hunting , vehicular collisions , and wind turbine accidents combined .
Thus , preventing bird - window collisions could be the simplest way to significantly reduce bird fatality around the world .
[ social_buttons ]
As reported by The Wilson Journal of Ornithology , and discovered by researcher Daniel Klem Jr. , the best window covering for the job was an exterior film with evenly spaced ultraviolet UV - reflecting and UV - absorbing patterns .
Aside from preventing bird collisions and being transparent to humans , the new glass covering is also cheap to produce , and due to its UV - reflecting properties it may even help prevent sunburn .
The next step is to make it a permanent coating for sheet glass used in new construction .
But until then , the research also illustrated a number of other easy ways you can help prevent bird collisions without replacing your windows .
You can dim your lights at night , or better yet– cover them up .
There ’s not much to see after the sun goes down anyway , and you ’ll save a lot on your electricity bills by dimming those lights .
There are also a number of landscaping and architectural changes you can make too , such as eliminating trees and shrubs from areas in front of windows , and minimizing ground cover .
Furthermore , birds are more likely to collide with windows during the Fall and Spring , during their seasonal migrations .
“ When this film is available for use it will save billions of bird lives annually after existing windows are retrofitted worldwide , ” said Klem .

[ Meltdown : A Free - Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed , the Economy Tanked , and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse • By Thomas E. Woods Jr. • Regnery 2009 • Xi + 194 pages ]
In these troubled times inflationists take comfort in knowing that the central bank can always add any amount of money it wishes to the nation 's money supply .
Such comfort is short - lived , though , because people are n't going to use it .
They would n't , at least , if government did n't severely impede monetary competition .
And even with monetary freedom legally suppressed , the majority will reject the fiat standard when it becomes too onerous to use . [ 1 ]
As the dollar continues its descent , the prospects for sound money are alive , but much more so are the prospects for a new fiat currency .
The top decision makers in the federal government regard the money machine as their right arm , and they are n't about to cut it off .
Political money , not sound money , provides life - support for their ambitions .
Does the president want to lay a heavy hand on a third - world country that happens to be rich in resources or strategically positioned ?
As long as government can create money at will , funding will not be a problem .
How about a politician who wants to pay off political supporters with lush contracts , bailouts , or a new entitlement ?
Tap the monopoly fiat - paper - money producer whose notes are legal tender , the producer whose leaders are politically appointed , and it 's done .
No need to take more money out of people 's paychecks through direct taxation .
Let the manipulated market forces handle the theft .
The inflation will eventually drive the economy into a crisis , but most experts will blame the market itself , not the manipulators — or worse , they 'll claim the manipulators are an inseparable part of the market .
And the victims will often agree , seeing the crisis as more evidence that the market is indisputably a cesspool of corruption .
Is it any wonder sound money is never a policy consideration , even when elected officials roll up their sleeves and declare everything is on the table ?
Sound Money , the New York Times , and Tom Woods
Tom Woods 's Meltdown is a well - deserved bestseller .
It is scrupulously researched , cogently argued , and entertainingly written .
[ 2 ]
And it became a big hit without the benefit of a review in a major media outlet , including the Times .
In identifying the culprits in the current crisis , Woods names one villain as the driving force behind the others .
All of the proximate causes — the CRA , Fannie , Freddie , the cartel of ratings agencies that blessed mortgage - backed securities with AAA approval , the widespread campaign to lower lending standards , the politically - connected enterprises that are " too big to fail " — promote reckless risk - taking , but the big kahuna that sets the stage is the " elephant in the living room that everyone pretends not to notice " ( p. 9 ) , " the institution whose fingerprints are all over our current mess " : the Federal Reserve ( pp. 2–3 ) .
The Fed , he says , " is dedicated to central economic planning , the great discredited idea of the twentieth century " ( p. 8 ) .
The secondary villains named above " played a role in channeling into the housing market the new money the Fed was creating .
But it was the Fed , ultimately , that made the boom in housing possible in the first place " ( p. 27 ) .
If Meltdown had gone no further than blaming the Fed 's cheap credit for the crisis , it might have made the Times review page .
Mainstream criticism of the Fed 's artificially low interest rates does exist , though usually in the form of indirect reprimands .
For example , in a November 2008 presentation titled " Why is the Country Facing a Financial Crisis ? " Julie L. Stackhouse , senior vice president of the St. Louis Fed , includes several slides with the headline " Easy money meant that more and more subprime mortgages were financed . "
Of course , since March 2005 , Bernanke has been hitting the lecture circuit , with one hand on the Bible , telling his audiences that the easy money was due to a " saving glut " in the emerging economies , thereby exonerating the Fed from any malfeasance .
But Ms. Stackhouse 's slides say " Easy money , " not " Easy money resulting from an inflow of foreign saving , " and there is no reference anywhere in her presentation to saving as the cause of the low mortgage rates .
It 's hard to imagine someone in her position being that careless with her wording if she did n't mean to implicate the Fed .
( Granted , it 's a presentation , not an article , and she could have clarified the headline in delivering her talk , but the slides alone do n't give us her view on where all the money came from , and it's only the slides that internet visitors will see . )
Another suggestion that the Fed was at fault comes from CNBC , which offers a comprehensive crisis timeline that begins with a section called " Greenspan 's Cheap Credit " :
[ L]ess than a week after 9/11 , the Fed began a series of interest rate cuts that made it easier and cheaper to borrow money …
The cuts continued for nearly two years , through June 2003 , and created incredible new demand for mortgages , home equity loans , automobile financing , and other kinds of credit .
Neither CNBC nor Julie Stackhouse come close to condemning the Fed as the primary culprit in the crisis , though their comments do provide support for Woods 's thesis .
But regardless of the kind and extent of mainstream criticism , the Fed is not Woods 's undoing .
It 's his Austrian view of money that makes him an outcast among mainstreamers .
" Easy money , " " cheap credit , " " artificially low interest rates , " and the artfully opaque " quantitative easing , " are only possible with a " flexible " currency , and it's that kind of money Meltdown rejects .
As a supporter of government stimulus efforts , the Times would logically reject Woods 's position .
Indeed , sound money is an abomination to all inflationists .
Helicopter Ben did n't earn his nickname because he promised to drop gold coins on our front lawns .
When he decides to open the monetary floodgates , he does n't whistle his way to the mines with a pick over his shoulder .
He does n't break a sweat at all — other than perhaps to worry about what his latest " liquidity injection " will do .
The Fed 's one policy tool is manipulating the money supply or hinting that it might , but sound money by its nature resists manipulation .
[ 3 ]
From the perspective of those who wish to profit from credit expansion — primarily those closest to the money production process , meaning government and the banking system — sound money has to be outlawed .
Outlawed and ridiculed .
In January 1974 , two - and - a - half years after President Nixon severed the dollar 's tenuous tie to gold , the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court dismissed as frivolous an appellant 's demand that banks redeem his Fed notes for gold or silver coin .
Woods 's Monetary Heresy
" If there 's one issue that fashionable opinion does n't want discussed in connection with the economic crisis , it 's money , " Woods says ( p. 109 ) .
We 're not supposed to question a monetary system that 's left the dollar as valuable as a nickel once was ; we 're not supposed to wonder if it 's desirable for government to create money out of thin air , as a counterfeiter would ; we 're not supposed to explore the connection between artificially low interest rates and the boom - bust cycle .
Most importantly , we 're not supposed to ask what money is .
A money economy , he says , arises spontaneously out of a barter economy from the free choices of market participants .
In the process of bartering , certain goods become more marketable than others , and over time they become accepted in trade not for their own sake but to use for future exchanges .
Such goods are called money .
In a money economy , it is somewhat misleading to say goods are exchanged for money ; it is more accurate to say , as Woods does , that in a money economy " goods are exchanged indirectly for each other " ( p. 111 ) or " that goods exchange against other goods , and the exchanges are simply denominated in money " ( p. 133 , emphasis in original ) .
As a good becomes a money , it acquires an array of prices of other goods in terms of itself .
Instead of a pair of shoes trading for 10 loaves of bread , say , it would trade for a certain weight of the money commodity , and a loaf of bread would trade for one - tenth that weight , and so on , throughout the rest of the economy .
If this is how money originated , how did we get to the point where the Fed can create money at will and depreciate the dollars we use and save ?
Woods lists three steps :
society adopts a commodity money ( such as gold or silver , or both ) ; government or the banks issue paper notes that can be redeemed in a given weight of the commodity money ; the notes begin to circulate as a convenient substitute for the precious metal coins ; government confiscates the commodity to which the paper note holders are entitled , leaving them with paper money only ( pp. 112–13 ) .
As a result of government favors , only the Fed and the fractional - reserve banking system it influences can inflate the supply of unbacked paper money .
And through legal tender laws , the government forces us to accept the Fed 's depreciating paper issues in the settlement of debts and for spot payments , even if we would prefer a money that 's not subject to bureaucratic manipulation . [ 4 ]
The upshot is a fiat paper money system that is said to be more " flexible " than a commodity money system because bankers can make more loans , which allegedly boosts prosperity .
But what is it the banks are actually lending people when entrepreneurs receive money from Fed credit expansion ?
An adequate pool of savings must exist before any production process can be completed .
Fed credit does n't come from savings : it comes from nowhere .
As Woods points out ,
A bank issuing loans based on credit it creates out of thin air , and which possesses no gold backing , is " flexible " enough to make more loans , but unless it has the magical ability to create real resources out of thin air , it can never increase the number of projects the economy can complete .
( pp. 130 –31 , emphasis in original )
Manufacturing more money to lower the interest rate will usually stimulate the economy but it is a " sugar high , " as Woods calls it .
Some of the investments made during the boom " will prove to be unsustainable and will have to be abandoned , with the resources devoted to them having been partially or completely squandered " ( p. 70 ) .
The Deflation Argument
Some charge that the supply of precious metals cannot keep up with the growth in the supply of goods , and therefore the economy will suffer from falling prices .
But , as Woods notes , falling prices are the natural outcome of a growing economy that uses a commodity money .
This " growth deflation , " as he calls it ( borrowing a term from Joseph Salerno ) , " characterized the American economy from 1789 through 1913 , a period in which the American economy reached extraordinary heights of prosperity . "
More recently , China experienced growth deflation from 1998 to 2001 .
Retail prices declined between 0.8 percent and 3.0 percent in each of those years , while real GDP increased at an annual average of 7.6 percent ( pp. 135–36 ) .
Even in an inflationary environment , both consumers and companies have benefited from sector - specific growth deflation in high - tech products .
Computer shipments increased from 490,000 units in 1980 to roughly 43 million units in 1999 , while quality - adjusted prices fell by 90 percent over the same period .
It 's true , as Woods says , that under a commodity money , government would n't have the tools to push prices back up after a bubble bursts .
But under a commodity money , " we would never have had the inflated prices in the first place , since the money supply would n't substantially increase " ( p. 137 ) .
A Breakthrough
Economist Judy Shelton has shown that the mainstream is not impregnable to radically sound reasoning .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal on February 11 , 2009 , she calls for a return to the gold standard because " it stands in the way of runaway government spending . "
People should have the choice of switching to gold as an alternative to government fiat money — too much of which , she says , " results in inflation . "
Furthermore ,
Inflation is the enemy of capitalism , chiseling away at the foundation of free markets and the laws of supply and demand .
It distorts price signals , making retailers look like profiteers and deceiving workers into thinking their wages have gone up .
It pushes families into higher income tax brackets without increasing their real consumption opportunities .
In short , inflation undermines capitalism by destroying the rationale for dedicating a portion of today 's earnings to savings .
Accumulated savings provide the capital that finances projects that generate higher future returns ; it 's how an economy grows , how a society reaches higher levels of prosperity .
But inflation makes suckers out of savers .
( emphasis added )
As Woods notes in his closing chapter , the WSJ has not been sympathetic to the classical gold standard , yet they 've published several articles by Shelton in which she argues convincingly for its adoption ( and for dispensing with the Federal Reserve ) .
As long as government is not part of the " standard , " Woods would agree .
" The ' gold standard ' of the nineteenth century as it existed in the West … often involved the coercive suppression of alternative monies , " he says ( p. 153 ) .
What we need is freedom to choose the money that suits us best .
If the Times 's editors truly reject the arguments of a book on their bestseller list , one would hope they would at least explain why in a review .
If they 're having trouble composing a rebuttal , Meltdown readers will understand .

Making a stand in Mumbai
BELYING its name , Harris Park is neither leafy nor green .
It is a gritty western Sydney suburb , where Indian students have recently taken to the streets in protest against some of the worst ethnic - based attacks Australia has seen .
As young Indian men gather by the local railway station , police converge further down the street and arrest two non-Indians .
Asked about the wave of violence against their community , two Indians lower their voices .
“ Lebanese , ” says one .
Others wonder if the answer may be more complicated .
The violence sprang to public notice when two Indian men were attacked with screwdrivers in Melbourne last month .
One was robbed .
Both ended up in hospital .
A demonstration of about 2,000 Indian students in Melbourne called for stronger police action .
They claimed the attacks fitted into a wider pattern of violence over the past year against Indians in Australia .
The Melbourne attacks came as a firebomb was hurled in Harris Park through the window of a house where young Indians lived .
One suffered bad burns .
On June 8th two more Indians were attacked near a Harris Park restaurant , where Indian community leaders had gathered , prompting two successive nights of demonstrations in the suburb .
The Indian press accused Australia of racism .
Amitabh Bachchan , a Bollywood superstar , refused an honorary doctorate from a university in Brisbane .
Over the past 40 years Australia has received waves of immigrants from Vietnam , Lebanon and other parts of Asia and the Middle East .
Most have settled peaceably .
Indians are the latest to arrive .
In the decade to 2006 the number of Australian residents born in India almost doubled .
India was the third - fastest - growing source of immigrants , after New Zealand and China .
There has also been a big increase in students coming from India , especially in courses for skills where qualifications offer a fast track to permanent residency .
Since 2006 Indian enrolments in such “ vocational ” courses jumped by 161 % , reaching 52,000 last year .
Many Indian students have fanned out from inner-city student quarters to private colleges in the suburbs , and to places like Harris Park where rents are cheaper , and crime rates higher .
In recent years Indians have displaced Lebanese as the suburb 's biggest ethnic group .
Initially , police said the motive for the glut of attacks on Indians was robbery : students going home from night jobs carrying money and mobile phones were “ soft ” targets .
Later , they conceded that some attacks were race - based .
Many Indian students privately blame Lebanese youths , who may well be jobless gang - members .
But at Billu's Indian Eatery and Sweet House , a Harris Park gathering point , Aruna Chandrala , an Indian community leader , carefully avoids censure .
“ It 's a law - and - order issue , ” she says .
“ The students are saying ‘ Enough is enough ' . ”
It has also become a diplomatic embarrassment for Australia , at a time when it has been seeking to boost relations with India to what Stephen Smith , Australia 's foreign minister , calls “ the front rank of our international partnerships ” .
Kumari Selja , India 's tourism minister , has cancelled a planned visit to Australia in July .
And Manmohan Singh , the prime minister , has said he is “ appalled ” at the violence , calling some of it racially motivated .
Kevin Rudd , his Australian counterpart , dismissed race as a motive , and called the violence “ just a regrettable fact of urban life ” .
About 20 Australians , he pointed out , had been assaulted or murdered in India over the past decade .
That is a good debating point : but not one that will help persuade Indian parents that Australia is a safe place to send their children .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
The system reportedly blocks legitimate as well as banned content Every PC in China could be at risk of being taken over by malicious hackers because of flaws in compulsory government software .
The potential faults were brought to light by Chinese computer experts who said the flaw could lead to a " large - scale disaster " .
The Chinese government has mandated that all computers in the country must have the screening software installed .
It is intended to filter out offensive material from the net .
The Chinese government said that the Green Dam Youth Escort software , as it is known , was intended to push forward the " healthy development of the internet " and " effectively manage harmful material for the public and prevent it from being spread . "
" We found a series of software flaws , " explained Isaac Mao , a blogger and social entrepreneur in China , as well as a research fellow at Harvard University 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
For example , he said , tests had shown that communications between the software and the servers at the company that developed the program were unencrypted .
Mr Mao told BBC
News that this could allow hackers to " steal people 's private information " or " place malicious script " on computers in the network to " affect [ a ] large scale disaster . "
For example , a hacker could use malicious code to take control of PCs using the software .
" Then you have every computer in China potentially as part of a botnet , " Colin Maclay , also of Harvard , told BBC News .
A botnet is the name given to a network of hijacked computers that can then be used to pump out spam or launch concerted attacks on commercial or government websites .
No one from Jinhui Computer System Engineering , the company that developed Green Dam , was available for comment .
' Naked pig '
The software has also caused a backlash amongst privacy experts , academics and some Chinese citizens .
It has also raised the scorn of the blogosphere inside the country who feel the system is no match for tech - savvy teenagers .
Every new computer in China will have the software installed One blogger posted a screenshot of the software purportedly blocking an attempt to visit a porn site using Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
But , he said , there was no problem accessing the site using the Firefox web browser .
Others have reported that the system only runs on Microsoft Windows , allowing Mac and Linux users to bypass the software .
It is thought that at least 3 m computer users have already downloaded the software , opening them up to potential security problems .
Another formal study by the Open Network Initiative into the risks posed by the software is expected soon .
However , many people in China who have been forced to use the software are already reporting other problems .
For example , the system reportedly blocks legitimate as well as banned content .
It is designed to identify the proportion of skin colour in a picture to determine whether it is pornography .
But comments on a bulletin board run by the software company that designed the system , suggest the system does not work perfectly .
Once you 've got government - mandated software installed on each machine , the software has the keys to the kingdom
Professor Jonathan Zittrain " I went on the internet to check out some animal photos .
A lovely little naked pig was sent onto the black list .
Pitiful little pig ! , " read one comment .
" I was curious , so I looked up some photos of naked African women .
Oh , they were not censored ! "
Another message read : " We were ordered to install the software .
So I have to come to this website and curse .
After we installed the software , many normal websites are banned . "
The forum was taken down after it was seemingly flooded with complaints .
A message on the site said says it is being " upgraded " .
Mr Mao told BBC
News that they believed there was a new guideline from the country 's central propaganda department " to comb all media and online forums to block critics and discussion over the issue . "
Firewall flaw
The government may be keen to shut down discussion to quell rumours that the system could be used to monitor its citizens .
" Once you 've got government - mandated software installed on each machine , the software has the keys to the kingdom - anything can be logged or affected , " said Professor Jonathan Zittrain , also of Harvard 's Berkman Center .
Virtual police patrol China web " While the justification may be pitched as protecting children and mostly concerning pornography , once the architecture is set up it can be used for broader purposes , such as the filtering of political ideas . "
In particular , the system could be used to report citizens ' web habits .
" It creates log file of all of the pages that the users tries to access , " Mr Maclay told BBC News .
" At the moment it 's unclear whether that is reported back , but it could be . "
A twitter user in China claims that the software transmits reports to Jinhui - the maker of the software - when the user tries to access blacklisted websites .
However , Zhang Chenmin , general manager of the developer of Green Dam , told the China Daily newspaper last year : " Our software is simply not capable of spying on internet users , it is only a filter . "
Although many countries around the world routinely block and filter net content , China 's regime is regarded as particularly severe .
" There is no transparency about what they are blocking , " said Mr Maclay .
Free speech campaigners are concerned that the list could be tweaked to suits the government 's aims .
Recently , there has been a web black out across China in advance of the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
Website such as Twitter and the photo - sharing site Flickr were blocked in an attempt by the government to prevent online discussion on the subject .
However , some users were able to bypass the filters to distribute pictures and commentary including links to photos of plain - clothes policemen blocking the lenses of foreign journalists with their umbrellas .
The country is able to take action like this because it already has a sophisticated censorship regime , including the so - called Great Firewall of China .
However , it is known to have some flaws .
A 2007 study by US researchers showed that the system was much more porous than previously thought .
It found that the technology often failed to block content banned by the Chinese government , allowing web users to browse unencumbered at least some of the time .
Filtering and blocking was " particularly erratic " , they said , when large numbers of people were online in China .
Despite the failures , the researchers said , the idea of the firewall was more effective than the technology at discouraging talk about banned subjects .
This kind of social pressure was also key to another tactic used by the Chinese government to make sure its citizens only use sanitised portions of the web .
In 2007 , the government introduced virtual policemen that pop-up onscreen when web surfers visit many of China 's popular website to remind them to stay away from illicit content .
In addition , the government expects internet service providers in China to actively monitor and censor published content , such as blogs .
Experiments have suggested that this approach is hit - and - miss , with some organisations more proactive than others .
However , these systems , combined with the new software , will allow the Chinese government to sanitise the web for most of the 300m of China 's population of 1.3 bn have access to the net .
" I think this is intended as a sort of belt - and - braces approach , said Professor Zittrain .

US President Barack Obama made a major gesture of conciliation to Iran on Thursday when he admitted US involvement in the 1953 coup which overthrew the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh .
“ In the middle of the Cold War , the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government , ” Obama said during his keynote speech to the Muslim world in Cairo .
It is the first time a serving US president has publicly admitted American involvement in the coup .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The CIA , with British backing , masterminded the coup after Mossadegh nationalised the oil industry , run until then in by the British - owned Anglo - Iranian Oil Company .
For many Iranians , the coup demonstrated duplicity by the United States , which presented itself as a defender of freedom but did not hesitate to use underhand methods to get rid of a democratically elected government to suit its own economic and strategic interests .

When I ’m designing software , I spend a lot of time thinking about names .
For me , thinking about names is inseparable from the process of design .
To name something is to define it .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The Gospel According to John
One of the ways I know a design has really clicked is when the names feel right .
It may take some time for this to happen ( I rename things a lot when I ’m first putting them down in code ) , but that ’s OK .
Good design does n’t happen fast .
Of course , good names alone do n’t make a good design , but it ’s been my experience that crappy names do prevent one .
With that in mind , here ’s the guidelines I try to follow when naming things .
The examples here are in C++ , but work more or less for any language .
Types ( Classes , Interfaces , Structs )
The name should be a noun phrase .
Bad : Happy Good : Happiness
Do not use namespace - like prefixes .
That ’s what namespaces are for .
Bad : SystemOnlineMessage Good : System :: Online :: Message
Use just enough adjectives to be clear .
Bad : IAbstractFactoryPatternBase Good : IFactory
Do not use “ Manager ” or “ Helper ” or other null words in a type name .
If you need to add “ Manager ” of “ Helper ” to a type name , the type is either poorly named or poorly designed .
Likely the latter .
Types should manage and help themselves .
Bad : ConnectionManager XmlHelper Good : Connection XmlDocument , XmlNode , etc .
If a class does n’t represent something easily comprehensible , consider a concrete metaphor .
Bad : IncomingMessageQueue CharacterArray SpatialOrganizer Good : Mailbox String Map
If you use a metaphor , use it consistently .
Bad : Mailbox , DestinationID Good : Mailbox , Address
Functions ( Methods , Procedures )
Be terse .
Bad : list .GetNumberOfItems ( ) ; Good : list .
Count ( ) ;
Do n’t be too terse .
Bad : list .
Verify ( ) ; Good : list.ContainsNull ( ) ;
Avd abbrvtn .
Bad : list .
Srt( ) ; Good : list .
Sort ( ) ;
Name functions that do things using verbs .
Bad : obj.RefCount( ) ; Good : list .
Clear ( ) ; list .
Sort ( ) ; obj.
AddReference ( ) ;
Name functions that return a boolean ( i.e. predicates ) like questions .
Bad : list .
Empty ( ) ; Good : list .
IsEmpty ( ) ; list .
Contains ( item ) ;
Name functions that just return a property and do n’t change state using nouns .
Bad : list .
GetCount ( ) ; Good : list .
Count ( ) ;
( In C# , you ’d actually use properties for this . )
Do n’t make the name redundant with an argument .
Bad : list .
AddItem ( item ) ; handler.ReceiveMessage( msg ) ; Good : list .
Add(item ) ; handler.Receive(msg ) ;
Do n’t make the name redundant with the receiver .
Bad : list .
AddToList ( item ) ; Good : list .
Add( item ) ;
Only describe the return in the name if there are identical functions that return different types .
Bad : list .GetCountInt ( ) ; Good : list .
GetCount ( ) ; message .
GetIntValue( ) ; message.GetFloatValue ( ) ;
Do n’t use “ And ” or “ Or ” in a function name .
If you ’re using a conjunction in the name , the function is likely doing too much .
Break it into smaller pieces and name accordingly .
If you want to ensure this is an atomic operation , consider creating a name for that entire operation , or possibly a class that encapsulates it .
Bad : mail.VerifyAddressAndSendStatus ( ) ; Good : mail.VerifyAddress ( ) ; mail .
SendStatus ( ) ;
Does it Matter ?
Yes , I firmly believe it does .
A module with well - named parts quickly teaches you what it does .
By reading only a fraction of the code , the you ’ll quickly build a complete mental model of the whole system .
If it calls something a “ Mailbox ” you ’ll expect to see “ Mail ” , and “ Addresses ” without having to read the code for them .
Well - named code is easier to talk about with other programmers , helping knowledge of the code to spread .
No one wants to try to say “ ISrvMgrInstanceDescriptorFactory ” forty times in a meeting .
Over on the other side , poor names create an opaque wall of code , forcing you to painstakingly run the program in the your head , observe its behavior and then create your own private nomenclature .
“ Oh , DoCheck ( ) looks like it ’s iterating through the connections to see if they ’re all live .
I ’ll call that AreConnectionsLive ( ) . ”
Not only is this slow , it ’s non-transferrable .
From the code I ’ve seen , there ’s a strong correspondence between a cohesive set of names in a module , and a cohesive module .
When I have trouble naming something , there ’s a good chance that what I ’m trying to name is poorly designed .
Maybe it ’s trying to do too many things at once , or is missing a critical piece to make it complete .
It ’s hard to tell if I ’m designing well , but one of the surest guides I ’ve found that I ’m not doing it well is when the names do n’t come easy .
When I design now , I try to pay attention to that .
Once I ’m happy with the names , I ’m usually happy with the design .
What you ’re about to see is a gameplay demonstration of the company ’s much - hyped sequel , Modern Warfare 2 .
Though Infinity Ward chose to drop the Call of Duty moniker in order to stand out from Treyarch ’s take on the series , the gameplay shown for MW2 really does speak for itself .
The footage showcases the game ’s snow level , something that fans have been begging for since the first Modern Warfare title .
Captain Mactavish returns from the first game , though as a non-playable character this time .
Infinity Ward is testing out some new gameplay opportunities , including a gun equipped with a heartbeat sensor .
Check out the footage below , and let us know what you think !

Things That Are Not In the U.S. Constitution
Have you ever heard someone say , " That 's unconstitutional ! " or " That 's my constitutional right ! " and wondered if they were right ?
You might be surprised how often people get it wrong .
You might also be surprised how often people get it right .
Your best defense against misconception is reading and knowing your Constitution .
A lot of people presume a lot of things about the Constitution .
Some are true , some are not .
This page will detail some of the things that people think are in the Constitution , but are not .
One critique of this page is that it is full of nit-picks .
Slavery , for example , may not be " in " the original Constitution , but it is in the original Constitution — the word may not have been there , but the concept was .
This is absolutely true .
But by studying the words and coming to know them intimately , we gain a better understanding of our history and how some arguments about the Constitution endure .
The Air Force
The Constitution was ratified in 1787 , long , long before the advent of the airplane .
It provides , specifically , for a navy and an army in Article 1 , Section 8 .
Though they were aware of lighter - than - air flying craft , the Framers could not have reasonably provided for an Air Force .
It should be noted at the outset that the Constitution does not provide , specifically , for the other uniformed services , the Marines and Coast Guard .
The Marines , however , as an arm of the Navy , could be excepted ; and the Constitution does provide for " naval forces , " and the Coast Guard could thus be excepted .
How , then , do we except the Air Force ?
The first way is via common sense — the Framers certainly did not intend to preclude the use of new technology in the U.S. military , and because of the varied roles of the Air Force , it makes sense for it to be a separate branch .
The second ( and less desirable ) way is historical — the Air Force originated as the Army Air Corps , an arm of the Army , similar to the Navy / Marine relationship .
Basically , unless your interpretation of the Constitution freezes it in 1789 , the Air Force is a perfectly constitutional branch of the U.S. military .
Congressional Districts
Congressional Districts divide almost every state in the United States into two or more chunks ; each district should be roughly equal in population throughout the state and indeed , the entire country .
Each district elects one Representative to the House of Representatives .
The number of districts in each state is determined by the decennial census , as mandated by the Constitution .
But districts are not mentioned in the Constitution .
The United States Code acknowledges districting , but leaves the " how's " to the states ( gerrymandering , however , is unconstitutional [ as seen in Davis v Bandemer , 478 U.S. 109 ( 1986 ) , though , the intent of gerrymandering is difficult to prove ] ) .
The Electoral College
The concept of the presidential elector is certainly in the Constitution , but never is the group of people collectively referred to as " The Electoral College . "
Article 1 , Section 2 speaks of " Electors , " as do several of the Amendments , but never the college itself .
The term comes from common usage in the early 1800's , in the same way that the " College of Cardinals " elects a pope , and is based on the Latin word collegium , which simply refers to a body of people acting as a unit .
The term " College of Electors " is used in U.S. law , at 3 USC 4 .
For more on the Electoral College , see the topic page .
Executive Orders
Executive Orders have two main functions : to modify how an executive branch department or agency does its job ( rule change ) or to modify existing law , if such authority has been granted to the President by Congress .
Executive orders are not mentioned by the Constitution , but they have been around a long , long time .
George Washington issued several Presidential Proclamations , which are similar to EO 's ( Proclamations are still issued today ) .
EO 's and Proclamations are not law , but they have the effect of statutes .
A typical modern Proclamation might declare a day to be in someone 's honor .
Historically , they have had broader effect , such as the Emancipation Proclamation .
A typical EO might instruct the government to do no business with a country we are at war with .
Executive orders are subject to judicial review , and can be declared unconstitutional .
Today , EO's and Proclamations are sequentially numbered .
The average president issues 58 EO 's a year .
As of March 13 , 1936 , all EO 's must be published in the Federal Register .
The first to have been so published was # 7316 , by President Roosevelt .
Executive Privilege
Executive privilege is a right to withhold information from the legislative and judicial branches by the President or by one of the executive departments .
There is question of whether the right exists at all , a question that has lingered since the very first President , George Washington , asserted executive privilege in his very first term .
Most times , executive privilege is asserted for purported national security reasons .
Washington , however , asserted the privilege when the House requested details of the Jay Treaty — his rationale was that the House has no role in treaty - making and hence no right to request the documents .
In modern times , Bill Clinton refused to simply comply with an order to appear before a grand jury , and instead negotiated terms under which he would appear .
Richard Nixon's is the most infamous use of executive privilege , and while the Supreme Court , in U.S. v Nixon , 418 U.S. 683 ( 1974 ) , recognized that there exists a need for some secrecy in the executive branch , but that the secrecy cannot be absolute .
The Court ordered Nixon to turn over tapes and documents that a special prosecutor had subpoenaed .
More recently , the minutes and records of Vice President Dick Cheney 's energy task force were requested and denied based on executive privilege .
This case made its way to the Supreme Court , where the Court deflected the case and sent it back to a lower court for further adjudication .
Freedom of Expression
It is often said that one of the rights protected by the 1st Amendment is the freedom of expression .
This site , in fact , uses that term in its quick description of the amendment : " Freedom of Religion , Press , Expression . "
But " expression " is not used in the amendment at all .
This term has come to be used as a shorthand , a term of art , for three of the freedoms that are explicitly protected : speech , petition , and assembly .
While the use of " freedom of expression " is ubiquitous in this area of 1st Amendment study , it is important to note exactly what " freedom of expression " refers to — let this be such a note .
( Absolute ) Freedom of Speech and Press
The Constitution does protect the freedom of speech of every citizen , and even of non-citizens — but only from restriction by the Congress ( and , by virtue of the 14th Amendment , by state legislatures , too ) .
There are plenty of other places where you could speak but where speech can and is suppressed .
For example , freedom of speech can be and often is restricted in a work place , for example : employers can restrict your right to speak in the work place about politics , about religion , about legal issues , even about Desperate Housewives .
The same restrictions that apply to the government do not apply to private persons , employers , or establishments .
For another example , the government could not prohibit the sale of any newspaper lest it breech the freedom of the press .
No newsstand , however , must carry every paper against its owners ' wishes .
From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs
According to a 2002 Columbia Law School study , nearly two - thirds of persons polled thought that this phrase came from the Constitution or might have been crafted by the Framers .
This phrase , however , originates from Karl Marx , and was written in 1875 's Critique of the Gotha Program .
It is considered by many to be a brief summation of the principles of communism .
God
It has often been seen on the Internet that to find God in the Constitution , all one has to do is read it , and see how often the Framers used the words " God , " or " Creator , " " Jesus , " or " Lord . "
Except for one notable instance , however , none of these words ever appears in the Constitution , neither the original nor in any of the Amendments .
The notable exception is found in the Signatory section , where the date is written thusly : " Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven " .
The use of the word " Lord " here is not a religious reference , however .
This was a common way of expressing the date , in both religious and secular contexts .
This lack of any these words does not mean that the Framers were not spiritual people , any more than the use of the word Lord means that they were .
What this lack of these words is expositive of is not a love for or disdain for religion , but the feeling that the new government should not involve itself in matters of religion .
In fact , the original Constitution bars any religious test to hold any federal office in the United States .
For more information , see the Religion Topic Page .
Impeachment Means Removal From Office
The word " impeachment " and the phrase " removal from office " are not synonymous .
For a President , judge , or other federal official to be removed from office against their will ( because resignation is always an option ) , they must be impeached .
Impeachment consists of three phases — the passage of the impeachment by the House , a trial by the Senate , and the imposition of a penalty if the Senate convicts .
For members of the executive branch , removal from office is automatic upon conviction .
The Senate may also decide to prevent the person from holding any other public office ( see Article 2 , Section 4 ) .
For any other impeachable officer ( including judges ) , there are basically two punishments , which provide four options : the Senate can do nothing ; they can remove the person from their office ; they can prevent the person from ever holding any office in the federal government again , or both ( see Article 1 , Section 3 ) .
Innocent Until Proven Guilty
First , it should be pointed out that if you did it , you 're guilty , no matter what .
So you 're not innocent unless you 're truly innocent .
However , our system presumes innocence , which means that legally speaking , even the obviously guilty are treated as though they are innocent , until they are proven otherwise .
The concept of the presumption of innocence is one of the most basic in our system of justice .
However , in so many words , it is not codified in the text of the Constitution .
This basic right comes to us , like many things , from English jurisprudence , and has been a part of that system for so long , that it is considered common law .
The concept is embodied in several provisions of the Constitution , however , such as the right to remain silent and the right to a jury .
It 's a Free Country
A commonly heard mantra is , " Read your Constitution — it 's a free country , you know ! "
Well , read your Constitution — it never says it is a free country .
The implication of the aphorism is that in the United States , you can do whatever you want to do , and the Constitution is there to ensure that .
It is certainly true that the Constitution protects many civil rights .
The 1st Amendment ensures freedom of religious choice and freedom of speech , but those things are not without limit .
You cannot create a religion that allows you to kill someone without civil punishment ; you cannot use libelous or slanderous words without recourse .
There are other things that restrict freedom — from the ability to suspend habeas corpus to the issuance of patents .
Certainly the United States is a very free country , but it is not totally free — which is actually a good thing , unless you actually like anarchy .
It is interesting to note that in his confirmation hearings in 2005 , John Roberts said several times , " It 's a free country . "
It will be interesting to see how this enters into his judicial philosophy on the Court .
Judicial Review
We often hear about the Supreme Court striking down a law or a provision in a law , or , more often , reaffirming some law or provision .
Take a look in the Constitution — judicial review , as this is known , is nowhere to be found .
It seems like a perfectly normal action — after all , what kind of check does the Judicial Branch have on the other two branches if laws and orders cannot be declared unconstitutional .
But judicial review is not specifically mentioned .
So how did judicial review come to be ?
In the landmark case of Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) , Chief Justice John Marshall declared a federal law , the Judiciary Act of 1789 , to be unconstitutional , and thus null and void .
This was the first time a Supreme Court ruling overturned a law .
Jury of Peers
People often say " I have a right to have my case heard by a jury of my peers ! " when there is no such right in the Constitution .
The Constitution does take up the issue of juries , however .
It is the nature of the jury which is not in the Constitution .
In Article 3 , Section 2 , the Constitution requires that all criminal trials be heard by a jury .
It also specifies that the trial will be heard in the state the crime was committed .
The 6th Amendment narrows the definition of the jury by requiring it to be " impartial . "
Finally , the 7th Amendment requires that certain federal civil trials guarantee a jury trial if the amount exceeds twenty dollars .
Note that no where is a jury " of peers " guaranteed .
This is important for some historical and contemporary reasons .
Historically , the notion of a peer is one of social standing — in particular , in a monarchy such as the one the United States grew up from , commoners would never stand in judgement of lords and barons .
Along these same lines , since suffrage and jury service have always been closely tied ( and in the beginnings of the United States it was typical for only white , male , property - owners to be allowed the vote ) , any combination of gender , race , and economic status would be judged by only one kind of jury , hardly by " peers . "
Today , the American ideal dictates that we are all peers of one another , that regardless of gender , race , religion , social status , or any other division ( except age ) , we are all equal .
In this ideal , since we are all peers , a guarantee of a jury of ones peers would be redundant .
While some argue with this ideal , it is the most democratic way to approach the subject .
Juries need only be impartial , and not made up of one 's peers , else the jury system would be unworkable .
" Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness "
This phrase is commonly attributed to the Constitution , but it comes from the Declaration of Independence .
The 5th Amendment does offer protections to our " life , liberty , or property , " noting we can not be deprived of any of them without due process of law .
Marriage
In 2004 , a lot of controversy began to swirl around the topic of marriage as homosexual marriage entered the news once again .
In 1999 , the Vermont Supreme Court ordered that the state must make accommodations for gay unions , bringing the issue into the public eye .
Vermont created civil unions as a result .
In 2004 , the Massachusetts Supreme Court went a step further , and ruled that the state must accommodate not just an institution equal to marriage , as civil union was designed to be , but that gay marriage itself must be offered in the state .
Subsequently , mayors in New York and California began to offer gay marriage in their towns and cities , citing civil rights concerns .
Those opposed to gay marriage began to urge that an amendment to the Constitution be created to define marriage as being between a man and a woman only .
Opponents of the amendment pointed to the failed Prohibition Amendment as a reason why such social issues should stay out of the Constitution .
In the absence of any such amendment , however , marriage is not mentioned in the Constitution at any point .
More information is available on the Marriage Topic Page .
Martial Law
The terms " martial law " or " law martial " are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution , but a key aspect of martial law , the suspension of habeas corpus certainly is —
Congress cannot suspend habeas corpus except when public safety is in jeopardy in times of rebellion or invasion .
This clause , found at Article 1 , Section 9 , is often taken as shorthand for martial law , but in reality , martial law can exist while habeas corpus is in place — the two are commonly linked , but not mutually exclusive .
More details can be found on the Martial Law Topic Page .
No Taxation Without Representation
The battle cry " No taxation without representation ! " was a great political slogan coined to counter the Sugar Act of 1764 .
In order to help recoup the debt it incurred during the French and Indian War ( or the Seven Years ' War ) , the British Parliament passed the act , which taxed all manner of foodstuffs imported into the colonies .
The Americans , in the midst of economic depression following the war , were not particularly enamored of a new tax .
Some have written that the Americans were simply whining tax evaders .
The slogan was good for rallying the troops with an easy issue for every one to discern : that since they were not represented in Parliament , the tax should not be levied .
However , the ultimate goal of most of the agitators was not representation in Parliament , but independence .
The concept of " no taxation without representation " may be present in general in the United States .
But those who are unrepresented ( such as convicts and immigrants who cannot vote ) are still subject to taxation .
Notably , the citizens of Washington , DC , do not have any voting representation in Congress ( though it does send a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives ) .
Since 2000 , DC license plates have included the phrase " Taxation Without Representation " in an effort to raise awareness of the issue , especially among tourists visiting the city .
By virtue of the 23rd Amendment , however , DC does have at least three electoral votes .
Number of Justices in the Supreme Court
Article 3 , Section 1 specifies that there will be a Supreme Court , Article 1 , Section 3 mentions the Chief Justice , and Article 2 , Section 2 mentions the " Judges of the Supreme Court " , but aside from these small mentions , the make - up of the Supreme Court is not defined in the Constitution .
There will be a Supreme Court , there will be a Chief Justice , and there will be other Justices — but how many ?
Originally , there were six members , and the number has fluctuated up to as many as ten .
In 1869 , the number was set in the law at nine , and it has remained at nine ever since .
The number of justices is now set in the U.S. Code at 28 USC 1 .
" Of the People , By the People , For the People "
This phrase is commonly attributed to the Constitution , but it comes from the Gettysburg Address .
Paper Money
The Constitution does not directly mention paper money , a staple of today 's economy .
It does give the Congress the power to " coin money , " however .
The Constitution does prohibit states from issuing " bills of credit , " but no such prohibition is in place for the federal government .
What does this mean ?
Is paper money unconstitutional , but coins are okay ?
See FAQ Question # 154 for a discussion of this topic .
Political Parties
Political parties are such a basic part of our political system today , that many people might assume the Constitution must at least mention parties in one way or another ... but there is absolutely no mention of political parties anywhere in the Constitution .
In fact , in the times of the Articles of Confederation , there were n't even any parties ; factions , perhaps ; regional blocs , yes ; but no parties .
Not until the Jackson and Van Buren administrations did organized parties really take hold in the American political system .
Primary Elections
The Primary Election season can be exciting and heady as candidates for the presidency , and other national and state offices , vie for their party 's endorsement and spot on the ballot .
Many people today assume that because the process is second nature that it must be spelled out in the Constitution .
No where in the Constitution , however , will you find any mention of how elections should be conducted .
Since the Constitution is silent on the issue , we have been free to develop any system we wished , and the result is the system of primary elections we now use .
Though the point of the party elections is to select a single member of the party for the " real " election , the courts have still exerted influence , reasoning that through primaries , disenfranchisement can be effected .
Party elections , then , must be open to anyone asserting party affiliation — parties cannot , for example , bar any person of color solely on the basis of race .
Since they are party elections , however , the Supreme Court has ruled that primary elections can bar voters not registered with that party .
Qualifications for Judges
Article 1 , Section 2 specifies the qualifications to be a Representative , Article 1 , Section 3 specifies those for Senators , and Article 2 , Section 1 those for President .
The 12th Amendment adds the Vice President .
But no where does the Constitution specify how federal judges are to be qualified .
There is no minimum age and no residency requirement .
The primary reason for this is that the Framers were well aware of how judges became judges — they were appointed because they excelled at the law .
To do that , you must have had at least a minimum of knowledge in the law ( though in the 18th and 19th centuries , lawyers were often self - taught ) .
The Right To Privacy
The Constitution does not specifically mention a right to privacy .
However , Supreme Court decisions over the years have established that the right to privacy is a basic human right , and as such is protected by virtue of the 9th Amendment .
The right to privacy has come to the public 's attention via several controversial Supreme Court rulings , including several dealing with contraception ( the Griswold and Eisenstadt cases ) , interracial marriage ( the Loving case ) , and abortion ( the well - known Roe v Wade case ) .
In addition , it is said that a right to privacy is inherent in many of the amendments in the Bill of Rights , such as the 3rd , the 4th's search and seizure limits , and the 5th's self - incrimination limit .
The Right To Travel
As the Supreme Court notes in Saenz v Roe , 98 - 97 ( 1999 ) , the Constitution does not contain the word " travel " in any context , let alone an explicit right to travel ( except for members of Congress , who are guaranteed the right to travel to and from Congress ) .
The presumed right to travel , however , is firmly established in U.S. law and precedent .
In U.S. v Guest , 383 U.S. 745 ( 1966 ) , the Court noted , " It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized . "
In fact , in Shapiro v Thompson , 394 U.S. 618 ( 1969 ) , Justice Stewart noted in a concurring opinion that " it is a right broadly assertable against private interference as well as governmental action .
Like the right of association , ... it is a virtually unconditional personal right , guaranteed by the Constitution to us all . "
It is interesting to note that the Articles of Confederation had an explicit right to travel ; it is now thought that the right is so fundamental that the Framers may have thought it unnecessary to include it in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights .
The Right To Vote
The Constitution contains many phrases , clauses , and amendments detailing ways people cannot be denied the right to vote .
You can not deny the right to vote because of race or gender .
Citizens of Washington DC can vote for President ; 18 - year - olds can vote ; you can vote even if you fail to pay a poll tax .
The Constitution also requires that anyone who can vote for the " most numerous branch " of their state legislature can vote for House members and Senate members .
Note that in all of this , though , the Constitution never explicitly ensures the right to vote , as it does the right to speech , for example .
It does require that Representatives be chosen and Senators be elected by " the People , " and who comprises " the People " has been expanded by the aforementioned amendments several times .
Aside from these requirements , though , the qualifications for voters are left to the states .
And as long as the qualifications do not conflict with anything in the Constitution , that right can be withheld .
For example , in Texas , persons declared mentally incompetent and felons currently in prison or on probation are denied the right to vote .
It is interesting to note that though the 26th Amendment requires that 18 - year - olds must be able to vote , states can allow persons younger than 18 to vote , if they chose to .
The Separation Of Church and State
The phrase " separation of church and state " does not appear anywhere in the Constitution .
Thomas Jefferson wrote that the 1st Amendment erected a " wall of separation " between the church and the state ( James Madison said it " drew a line , " but it is Jefferson 's term that sticks with us today ) .
The phrase is commonly thought to mean that the government should not establish , support , or otherwise involve itself in any religion .
The Religion Topic Page addresses this issue in much greater detail .
The Separation Of Powers Clause
Though it may be implied or even directly stated in some news reports , blog postings , or web sites , there is no clause of the Constitution that is called the " Separation of Powers Clause . "
This is because there is no one clause that says " separation of powers " or " checks and balances " or any other phrase that is used synonymously .
The concept of the Separation of Powers is written into the first three articles of the Constitution , as detailed elsewhere .
Slavery
Originally , the Framers were very careful about avoiding the words " slave " and " slavery " in the text of the Constitution .
Instead , they used phrases like " importation of Persons " at Article 1 , Section 9 for the slave trade , " other persons " at Article 1 , Section 2 , and " person held to service or labor " at Article 4 , Section 2 for slaves .
Not until the 13th Amendment was slavery mentioned specifically in the Constitution .
There the term was used to ensure that there was to be no ambiguity as what exactly the words were eliminating .
In the 14th Amendment , the euphemism " other persons " ( and the three - fifths value given a slave ) was eliminated .
The Slavery Topic Page has a lot more detail .
" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal "
This phrase is commonly attributed to the Constitution , but it comes from the Declaration of Independence .
Immigration
The Constitution never uses the word immigration , so how is it that the rules for immigrants , and quotas for countries , are set by the federal government and not by the state governments ?
After all , as the 10th Amendment states , are the powers not delegated to the United States held by the states , or the people ?
The Supreme Court has ruled that the Congressional power to regulate naturalization , from Article 1 , Section 8 , includes the power to regulate immigration ( see , for example , Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong , 426 U.S. 88 [ 1976 ] ) .
It would not make sense to allow Congress to pass laws to determine how an immigrant becomes a naturalized resident if the Congress cannot determine how , or even if , that immigrant can come into the country in the first place .
Just because the Constitution lacks the word immigration does not mean that it lacks the concept of immigration .
There is also an argument that immigration is an implied power of any sovereign nation , and as such , the federal government has the power to regulate immigration because the United States is a sovereign nation .
While it is true that the United States is a sovereign nation , and it may be true that all sovereign nations have some powers inherent in that status , it is not necessary to determine if immigration is such a power that does not even require constitutional mention , because the Naturalization Clause handles the power .

" A telling documentary about the startling connections between the 15th century prophet Nostradamus and 9/11 , Barack Obama , Bush , and the november elections , " says EdgarMetro .
In his video , EdgarMetro speaks again about Nostradamus living in the 15th century , but the prophet was born on 14 December 1503 at St Rémy in the south of France , so he lived in the 16th century .
According to this Nostradamus expert , the prophet has made over 25 correct predictions .
This statement is followed by one of the quatrains of Nostradamus :
In the City of God there will be a great thunder ,
Two brothers torn apart by Chaos , while the fortress endures ,
the great leader will succumb .
The third big war will begin when the big city is burning .
Now , as has been pointed out on various sites , this is n't a quatrain written by Nostradamus : " More precisely , its attribution to Nostradamus is a hoax .
The passage was lifted intact from a web page ( since deleted from the hosting server due to overwhelming post - 9/11 traffic ) containing an essay written several years ago by college student Neil Marshall entitled " A Critical Analysis of Nostradamus . "
Marshall invented the quatrain to demonstrate — quite ironically , in light of its subsequent misuse — how a Nostradamus - like passage can be so cryptically composed as to lend itself to myriad interpretations . "
This quatrain is followed by one that is only partly of Nostradamus , Century VI , Quatrain 97 :
At forty - five degrees the sky will burn ,
Fire to approach the great new city :
In an instant a great scattered flame will leap up ,
When one will want to demand proof of the Normans .
EdgarMetro has a translation of his own :
At forty - five degrees the sky will burn from the World Centre .
Fire to approach the great new city :
in an instant a great scattered flame will leap up
when one will want to demand proof of the Normans .
The original French text goes like this :
Cinq et quarante degrez ciel bruslera
Feu approcher de la grand cit neuue
Instant grand flamme esparse sautera
Quand on voudra des Normans faire preuue .
New York is 40 43 ' degrees north of the equator so that does n't match , but in the original French text there and in the " true " translation , there is nothing about a " World Centre " - this is a pure invention by EdgarMetro & Co. to get at least one match with 9/11 .
And what are the Normans doing here ?
This quatrain is followed by Century I , Quatrain 87 .
It looks like a straight translation from the French original , but EdgarMetro has changed " centre of the earth " ( centre de la terre ) in " the World Centre " - again to have at least one match with 9/11 :
Earthshaking fire from the World Centre ( centre of the earth )
will cause tremors around the New City .
Two great rocks will war for a long time ,
then Arethusa will redden a new river .
EdgarMetro now states Nostradamus predicted that the world will change in 2012 ( " Change ...
Yes , we can ! " ) and that all of the Mayan and Aztec calendars end in 2012 , hereby suggesting that Nostradamus has predicted the End of the World in 2012 .
There is only one minor problem with this statement : EdgarMetro does n't tell us where , when or how Nostradamus has made this prediction of " change in 2012 " .
And there is a good reason for that : EdgarMetro has invented it , to get a match with Barack Obama and the End of the World .
Nostradamus warned us that there would come a " world dictator " called the AntiChrist , EdgarMetro says , and the next elected president will " precide over the coming of the AntiChrist " .
This statement is followed by a picture of Barack Obama , who has had " a sudden rise to popularity " , is a great orator and a charismatic person who reaches the masses .
Now it 's time again for a Nostradamus quatrain :
The great empire will be torn from limb ,
The all - powerful one for more than four hundred years :
Great power given to the dark one from slaves come ,
The Aryana will not be satisfied thereby .
" Did Nostradamus predict the election of Barack Obama , the first Black President in the White House ? " I wrote in an article .
" Professor Eugene Randell , Deputy Director of the Smithsonian Institution Archives , declared that the Institute was holding some very rare Nostradamus manuscripts .
One previously unreleased quatrain spoke about a " great empire " that would be " torn from limb " and a " great power given to the dark one from slaves come " .
The lines were eagerly copied and pasted on numerous blogs and websites , but all these " believers " forgot to mention ( or did n't know ) that the original article was published by The Daily Squib , the World 's Finest ( Satirical ) News Source .
Professor Eugene Randell did not exist and the previously unreleased quatrain definitely was a hoax . "
EdgarMetro says Nostradamus prophesized " the name of the Antichrist as Mabus " .
But that 's rubbish too .
Nostradamus has never said a Mr. Mabus will be the Antichrist .
In Century 2 , Quatrain 62 he states that " when Mabus will die " , there will be " a horrible undoing of people and animals " .
But the " true believers " of EdgarMetro do n't believe these facts , only their own fiction : they take the last two letters from " Obama " and the first three of " Bush " and they get " Mabus " .
And who will be in the White House in 2012 ?
A Black President , dammit !
On all sort of trashy White Power sites , a bunch of creepy details are added tot this " information " .
What is the zipcode of Chicago ?
60606 !
Eliminate the zero's and you get 666 , the Number of the Beast !
And who lives in Chicago ?
Yes ...
Now , this is for sure : the AntiChrist really has to be a moron , and his believers too , if it has to be that simple to find and / or detect him !
A Santa Barbara company said Friday that the Internet - filtering software that China has mandated for all new personal computers sold in that country contains stolen programming code .
Solid Oak Software Inc. said parts of its filtering program , which is designed for parents , can be found in the Green Dam Youth Escort filtering software that must be packaged with all computers sold in China starting next month .
Brian Milburn , Solid Oak Software ’s founder , said he planned to seek an injunction against the Chinese developer that built the software , but he acknowledged that the company was on unfamiliar legal terrain .
“ I do n’t know how far you can try and reach into China and try to stop stuff like this , ” Milburn said .
“ We ’re still trying to assess what they ’re doing . ”

The Chinese developer could not be reached for comment .
The software blocks sites from a user ’s machine .
China has mounted a vigorous public defense of the software , saying it wants it to block violence and pornography .
But critics say it could be used for political censorship .
A report released Thursday by University of Michigan researchers who examined the software supported the assertion that it contained code from Solid Oak ’s Cybersitter program .

A number of the “ blacklist ” files that Green Dam employs were taken from Cybersitter , the researchers found .
Blacklists are lists of websites that have been flagged as violent , pornographic , malicious or otherwise offensive .
Web browsers on computers where blacklists are in use are instructed to block those sites .
The report ’s authors -- researchers in the university ’s computer science and engineering division -- said they found another clue that Solid Oak ’s programming code was stolen : a file containing a 2004 Cybersitter news bulletin that appeared to have been accidentally included in Green Dam ’s code .
The researchers also said they found serious security vulnerabilities in the Chinese software that could allow hackers to hijack personal computers running it .

If you studied the traditional sort of biology , you ’re probably carrying around an unfortunate prejudice .
You see terrestrial habitats as a simplified nutrients - and - energy pyramid .
At the bottom are green plants , feeding on sunlight , carbon dioxide and soil water and minerals .
Next layer up on the pyramid is the herbivore mob : leaf and stem eaters , sapsuckers , root nibblers , seed and fruit gobblers .
Above these green feeders are a couple of layers of predators .
And that about sums up the world , right ?
Wrong .
That ’s only part of the world , and a small , very specialised part of it , too .
To begin with , most animals can’t eat green food .
Herbivores are dietary specialists among the insects , mollusks , birds and mammals .
Your average green leaf or stem does n’t show much herbivore damage , and for good reason .
It ’s mainly water boxed in by cellulose and other structural carbohydrates , which are impossible or extremely hard for animals to digest .
Other nutrients are present , but at low concentrations .
You need to eat a great mass of indigestible green stuff to get a decent return of elements like nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium and calcium .
As for animals eating wood , which makes up most of the biomass in a forest – well , there are termites , and …um…termites …
The truth is that in the real world outside the biology classroom , only a tiny proportion of terrestrial primary production goes through the stomachs of the few evolutionary lineages brave enough to tackle what green plants produce .
In any terrestrial habitat , the great bulk of primary production just does * not* get eaten .
It sits , instead , at the bottom of a very different food pyramid .
I call it the Dead Plants Society ( DPS ) , as opposed to the Green Feeders Guild ( GFG ) .
In the absence of fire , all that uneaten primary production is first attacked by fungi and bacteria .
By ‘ attacked ’
I mean ‘ converted from low - nutrient indigestibles to concentrated yummies ’ , i.e. fungal and bacterial bodies .
Stacked on top of this microbial layer in the pyramid are microbivorous layers of nematodes , mites , springtails , earthworms , millipedes and other soil animals .
On top of those are predators – but picture ‘ centipede ’ , not ‘ eagle ’ .
The GFG and DPS animal communities differ in many ways .
To begin with , in any given habitat the GFG has very high species diversity ( think of plant - eating insects ) but low higher - taxon diversity , while the DPS has great higher - taxon diversity ( lots of strange sorts of animals ) , but low species diversity .
Next , GFG herbivores tend to specialise on particular plants , while DPS microbivores will eat anything that ’s rotting nicely .
There are also a lot of winged GFG members ( ‘ gotta find that particular plant I like … ’ ) , whereas almost no DPS members have wings , at least in their younger , feeding stages .
There ’s an architectural difference , too .
The GFG extends well up in the air , to ca. 100 m in some tall forests , while the DPS is largely confined to the ground .
Then there ’s the matter of heritage .
The earliest DPS fossils are of mites , springtails and millipedes , and they ’re more than 400 million years old , from a time when terrestrial vegetation was mainly mossy and ground - hugging .
The first solid evidence for green feeding ( early insects with spores in their guts ) appears much later in the fossil record , from coal swamp times .
The DPS is vastly older than the GFG , and when you handle richly organic soil you ’re holding animal communities which are spectacularly ancient and robust .
You can almost imagine a springtail thinking : ‘ Seen the dinosaurs come and go , mammals are nearly done .
Wonder what great lumbering dopes we ’ll see in the next 100 million years ?
Yum , love these hyphae with yeast sprinkles !’
While Will is enjoying sunny California and playing the “ I ’ll show you mine if you show me yours ” game with his iPhone , a new rumor has just cropped up on the internet regarding iPhone tethering .
Appmodo claims to have been informed by a source within AT&T that tethering will cost an additional $ 55 per month ; I ’m not fucking joking .
They ’ve also been told that MMS will be launched in mid July , which is much more plausible .
Usually I do n’t comment on rumors since they ’re a waste of my time , and yours , but something tells me this is really going to happen .
Thanks to the internet , the world is a smaller place .
Hardcore iPhone fans know will soon find out that places like Austria get tethering for free , and the Nordic countries have had unlimited data plans that allow tethering for less than $ 20 a month for several years now .
Granted , $ 14 will get you unlimited 384 kbps here in Finland , if you want unlimited 2 Mbps data it is around $ 42 , which is fairly reasonable .
Do n’t let this news upset your day too much since it still is n’t official and AT&T has a way of bending to the demands of the iPhone mob as we saw with the extension of eligibility for subsidies .
Update : AT&T used their Facebook page to let the world know that the $ 55 figure is false .
That does n’t really mean much since it could be $ 54.99 and they would not by lying :

Communities Secretary Hazel Blears has quit the cabinet , increasing pressure on UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
Her departure is the second top - level resignation on the eve of the European and English local elections .
It led to stormy Commons scenes as Mr Brown denied his government was in " meltdown " and rejected calls for an immediate general election .
Health Secretary Alan Johnson has been forced to deny he is ready to take over amid reports of a backbench plot .
Mr Johnson told the BBC : " He is doing the job and there is absolutely no one who could do that job better . "
He said Mr Brown 's performance at prime minister 's questions had shown he had the " courage and tenacity " to lead the country " under circumstances made difficult for him " .
' Step down '
Other cabinet ministers , including Hilary Benn , Andy Burnham and Lord Mandelson , have also rallied round the prime minister and attempted to calm speculation he will be forced to quit .
Meanwhile the BBC has seen a proposed letter to Gordon Brown from one Labour MP calling on the PM to step down .
It says Mr Brown has made " an enormous contribution " but adds : " We believe that in the current political situation you can best serve the Labour Party and the country by stepping down as party leader and prime minister " .
At the time when people need help , need action , the country does n't have a government , it has a void
Nick Clegg
Lib Dem leader
Full story : PM 's questions Labour leadership rules
It has not yet been widely circulated but the BBC understands Mr Brown 's critics intend to send out some kind of " round robin " letter or e-mail to MPs , possibly on Friday , to test whether there is an appetite for a challenge to Mr Brown .
But Business Secretary Lord Mandelson urged Labour MPs : " British politics is in a bad old state , nobody is happy and it's affecting all the parties .
" Do n't please , through your actions , make it any worse for the Labour Party than for the other parties who have all got to come to grips with this crisis affecting British politics . "
Reshuffle speculation Seventy Labour MPs would have to nominate a challenger to Gordon Brown to force a leadership contest .
Attempts to gain enough support for someone to stand against Mr Brown for the Labour leadership have failed twice before - when he succeeded Tony Blair in 2007 and last summer .
It comes amid continued speculation about Mr Brown 's planned reshuffle .
The BBC understands Mr Brown met John Reid on Tuesday , but the former home secretary is thought to have turned down the offer of a return to government , although No 10 sources say they talked mainly about football .
I am returning to the grassroots ( where I began ) , to political activism , to the cut and thrust of political debate
Hazel Blears
Communities Secretary
Profile : Hazel Blears
In full : Blears and Brown letters
And a friend of Chancellor Alistair Darling has told the BBC that he would not accept any other job .
Downing Street has insisted a reshuffle is not under way and a source suggested there would be no announcements over the next 24 hours .
Speaking earlier at Prime Minister 's Questions , Mr Brown said recent weeks had put " enormous pressure " on MPs of all parties and their families because of the string of revelations about their expenses .
He accused Tory leader David Cameron of seeking party political advantage from the situation .
But Mr Cameron said the prime minister was " in denial " and the communities secretary resigning on the eve of local government elections was a " direct challenge to his authority " .
He said Mr Brown 's team was now " deserting him " , the government was " collapsing " and he urged the prime minister to " get down to the Palace , ask for a dissolution , call an election " .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said : " It 's a tragedy that exactly at the time when people need help , need action , the country does n't have a government , it has a void .
Labour is finished . "
Media pressure Ms Blears has been under fire over her expenses claims despite repaying £ 13,000 , following allegations she avoided paying capital gains tax on a property sale .
She was tipped for the axe in the forthcoming reshuffle .
The Salford MP denied doing anything wrong but Mr Brown described her claims as " totally unacceptable " .
She is said to believe she was being made a scapegoat by Mr Brown over the expenses issue and is believed to have vented her anger at him at a meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday .
Deliberate , calculated and with intent .
That is the only possible interpretation of Hazel Blears ' decision to resign today
Nick Robinson
BBC political editor
Read the blog in full Allies of the prime minister have suggested she feared further revelations about her expenses but sources close to Ms Blears accused them of " a smear campaign " .
Lord Mandelson said she was planning to stand down after the elections but had decided to go early due to media pressure , adding that she would never do anything to damage the party .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who also faced expenses criticism and went public on Tuesday with her decision to stand down , said she backed Mr Brown and denied Ms Blears was deliberately trying to undermine him .
In her resignation statement , Ms Blears said : " I 've never sought high office for the sake of it , or for what I can gain , but for what I can achieve for the people I represent and serve . "

Downing Street said Mr Brown " respects and understands " Ms Blears ' decision to quit the cabinet and believes she had made " an outstanding contribution to public life " .
The Salford MP is a former Labour Party chairman and was one of the most prominent Blairites in Gordon Brown 's cabinet but she came last in the poll to be Labour deputy leader two years ago .
Last month she launched what was seen as a thinly - veiled attack on Mr Brown in a newspaper article , criticising the government 's " lamentable " failure to get its message across .
In an apparent jibe at the PM 's much - mocked appearance on You Tube , she said : " You Tube if you want to . "
Senior Labour backbencher Barry Sheerman told the BBC Mr Brown 's decision to announce plans to reform MPs expenses on YouTube - the day after he had been to a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party without mentioning his ideas - had provoked anger among Labour backbenchers .
" There was a deep feeling of resentment that we had been snubbed and I think the present problems stem all from that evening , " Mr Sheerman said .

Formal complaint of academic misconduct filed against Ken Zucker :

Subject : Formal complaint of academic misconduct against Kenneth Zucker , Ph.D .
Dear Dr. Whiteside :
I hereby file a formal complaint of academic misconduct against Kenneth Zucker , Ph.D. , a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry , Faculty of Medicine , at the University of Toronto .
I maintain an internet news - feed of links to emerging news of interest to the transgender community .
[ 1 ]
On January 30 , 2009 I received an e-letter dated January 27 , 2009 from Peter M. Jacobsen , an attorney representing CAMH and Dr. Zucker .
The letter ( attached ) accused me of libeling both CAMH and Dr. Zucker , claiming that my news - feed �contains very serious false and defamatory allegations of criminal conduct and sexual abuse by Dr. Zucker . �[ 2 ]
It was immediately obvious to me ( and to attorneys with whom I have consulted ) that the accusation of libel was blatantly false , for there were no such allegations anywhere in my website .
I responded by posting a report on the internet [ 3 ] that led to a LOGO / CBS - News interview about CAMH�s false accusations [ 4 , 5 ] , a series of blog essays [ 6 , 7 ] and a GLBT media report on � Dr. Kenneth Zucker�s War on Transgenders � ( attached ) that well - summarizes the situation . [ 8 ]
It soon became clear that CAMH�s accusation of libel was timed to suppress my university website during the run-up to the American Psychiatric Association meeting in May , where Dr. Zucker�s practices were expected to be widely protested both within and outside the meeting .
[ 9 , 10 ]
In 2007 , my website had widely exposed Dr. Zucker as running a ' trans - reparatist ' clinic aimed at �curing � transgender children and forcing them to accept their birth gender . [ 11 ]
By late 2008 , Dr. Zucker was facing criticism from within CAMH itself , in a Diversity Programs Office report exposing his work as flawed .
[ 12 , 13 ]
At this critical moment in his academic career , Dr. Zucker apparently perceived my website as a threat , leading him to launch CAMH�s false accusation .
My very public report on the situation was sufficient to squelch Dr. Zucker�s accusation and to reveal it as a shameful act .
However , we cannot let the matter rest there , for these events raise serious questions about ongoing conflicts of interest and abuses of institutional power .
After all , how could a major medical Centre at the University of Toronto , i.e. , a public institution of the Province of Ontario , be lured into falsely accusing a faculty member at a university in the United States of libel ?
And why would the official accusation of libel on behalf of that Provincial institution be sent not only to that faculty member , but also to her University ?
p.2
I urge you to promptly investigate and publicly answer those serious questions .
In the meantime , I bring this academic misconduct to your attention and file this complaint by citing the University of Toronto�s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters . [ 14 ] The Code states ( italics for emphasis )
3 . It shall be an offence for a faculty member and student alike knowingly :
( b ) to engage in any form of cheating , academic dishonesty or misconduct , fraud or
misrepresentation not herein otherwise described , in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind . [ 14 , p.3 ]
By concocting a false accusation of libel against me and causing it to be launched by a public Provincial institution ( CAMH ) , Dr. Zucker has �engaged in misconduct or misrepresentation in order to obtain academic advantage . . .�
Not only did Dr. Zucker apparently misappropriate University legal funds to press a personal action aimed at intimidating and silencing a transgender critic , thereby defrauding the people of the Province of Ontario , he also abused his position of authority as a senior faculty member to co-opt CAMH into enjoining this unethical action � i.e. , joining into a false accusation of libel .
Furthermore , he has engaged in a pattern of such activities , i.e. , repeatedly co-opting CAMH into launching libel threats against his critics � thus terribly frightening and intimidating others too .
The evidence of this is quite clear , for several other transitioned women have recently posted legal threats that they have received from CAMH [ 15 ] and these are likely just the tip of the iceberg .
This situation has been best summed up by Dr. Kelley Winters , of GID Reform Advocates :
� We trans people who transition to affirmed roles , who do not acquiesce to the bonds of our assigned birth - roles -- we lose our jobs , our homes , our children , our health care and our civil justice to defamatory stereotypes of mental disorder and sexual deviance promoted by the CAMH .
Now , those of us who do not acquiesce to these maligning stereotypes , who dare to speak out against our own oppression , are threatened by the same CAMH with the loss of our life savings , our homes and our possessions by punitive litigation .
For those of us who grew up beneath the fists of schoolyard bullies , the message is clear : whenever we are not sufficiently impoverished , marginalized , pathologized , and sexualized into submissiveness toward our psychiatric policy masters , we will be impoverished by aggression through the courts . �
� Kelley Winters , Ph.D . [ 7 ]
I ask that Dr. Zucker be officially reprimanded for this academic misconduct and restrained from ever again exploiting CAMH�s institutional power to threaten , intimidate and silence his critics .
Sincerely ,
Ms. Lynn Conway

SYDNEY – Living happily ever after need n't be only for fairy tales .
Australian researchers have identified what it takes to keep a couple together , and it's a lot more than just being in love .
A couple 's age , previous relationships and even whether they smoke or not are factors that influence whether their relationship is going to last , according to a study by researchers from the Australian National University .
The study , titled What 's Love Got to Do With It , tracked nearly 2,500 couples – married or living together – from 2001 to 2007 to identify factors associated with those who remained together , compared with those who divorced or separated .
It found that couples in which the man is nine or more years older than his wife are twice as likely to get divorced , as are men who get married before they turn 25 .
One - fifth of couples who have kids before marriage – together or from a previous relationship – separated , compared to 9 per cent of those with no children before marriage .
Women who want children much more than their partners are also more likely to get a divorce .
The study also showed about 16 per cent of people whose parents separated or divorced experienced their own marital separation , compared to 10 per cent for those whose parents stayed together .
Also , partners who are on their second or third marriage are 90 per cent more likely to separate than those in their first marriage .
Not surprisingly , money also plays a role , with up to 16 per cent of respondents who indicated they were poor , or cases where the husband was unemployed , saying they had separated , compared with only 9 per cent of couples with healthy finances .
The wife 's employment status was found to have no significant effect .
Couples where only one partner smokes are more likely to split up .
Factors found to not significantly affect separation risk included the number and age of children born to a married couple and the number of years couples had been employed .
The study was jointly written by Rebecca Kippen and Bruce Chapman from the Australian National University , and Peng Yu from the Department of Families , Housing , Community Services and Indigenous Affairs .
July 15 , 2009 Silbury Hill , Wiltshire County , England -
On the night of July 4 to 5 , 2009 , a crew of documentary filmmakers with high definition video cameras were camped on top of Silbury Hill from about 2 AM until sunup between 4 and 4:30 AM in the British higher latitude summer light .
Atop Silbury
Hill , the film crew was only a quarter - mile from the location of what many experienced crop formation investigators say is as spectacular a wheat formation as there has ever been .
The pattern spans 350 feet in diameter with unusual shading and " immaculate " ground lay .
“ The film crew said there was heavy dew on the laid down crop , yet there were no footprints and it was not disturbed .
They said the headdress formation was immaculate . ”

After the apex court granted him bail on Monday , human rights activist and Peoples ' Union for Civil Liberties ( PUCL ) leader Dr Binayak Sen expressed his gratitude to all those who had supported him during his hour of crisis .
While he said he was confident of being cleared of all charges against him , Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said " let the law take its own course " .
" I thank everyone who supported me , " said Sen at the sessions court , where the trial against him is progressing , after hearing about the Supreme Court decision .
However , the Chief Minister said , " Our stand has been clear right from the beginning .
Let the law take its own course .
We have full faith in the judiciary . "
Asked whether Sen got the bail as the prosecution could not put up a strong case against him , Singh said , " The bail has nothing to do with the ongoing trial in the court . "
Sen has been in Raipur jail since May 14 , 2007 , for his alleged links with the outlawed Maoists .
He was arrested under the provisions of the controversial Chhattisgarh Public Security Act , 2005 , and Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , 1967 , on the charges of acting as a courier for an alleged Naxalite ideologue , Narayan Sanyal , who is in jail .
Human rights activists , NGOs and his supporters across the world had unleashed a " free Binayak Sen campaign " , mounting pressure on the state and the Central governments to free the jailed activist .
They described Sen as " a distinguished paediatrician and tireless human rights activist , who is being held under draconian state laws " .
However , the state Government has been maintaining so far that it was for the court to take a decision about his release .
State PUCL president Rajendra Sail welcomed the apex court move , saying " he should have got bail two years ago " .
" There is a sense of relief among Sen 's supporters and all those who have expressed solidarity .
Our stand has been vindicated , " he added .

Gary McKinnon could face up to 70 years in a US prison A British computer hacker who targeted Nasa should be tried in the UK not the US because his mental state is so fragile , the High Court has heard .
Lawyers for Gary McKinnon say there is " clear , uncontradicted expert evidence " that the stress of extradition could result in psychosis and suicide .
He has Asperger 's syndrome and claims he was looking for details of UFOs .
Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon , 42 , from Wood Green , north London , faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted in the US .
Mr McKinnon , who was arrested by British police in 2002 , has already appealed unsuccessfully to the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights to avoid extradition .
He is now seeking judicial review of the then home secretary Jacqui Smith 's decision last October to order his extradition .
Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Wilkie , at the High Court in London , will be asked to rule on whether the health risk is too great to allow his removal .
' Sorry ' Mr McKinnon hacked into 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa during 2001 and 2002 .
The US government says this caused damage costing $ 800,000 ( £ 500,000 ) at a time of heightened security in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks .
I 'm not , you know , a master hacker .
I did n't write my own programmes or anything
Gary McKinnon
Mr McKinnon told the BBC that he recognises that he committed a crime and said : " I am sorry for that . "
But he disputes the amount of damage the US alleges he caused to its computer systems and says he did not employ any complicated techniques .
He said : " I 'm not , you know , a master hacker .
I did n't write my own programmes or anything .
I used commercially off - the - shelf available software . "
Mr McKinnon 's lawyer , Edward Fitzgerald QC , told the High Court on Tuesday that the home secretary had " underestimated the gravity " of the threat to his client 's mental health .
He said Mr McKinnon was " an eccentric person who has passionate views about UFOs " - not a malicious hacker - and extradition was " unnecessary , avoidable and disproportionate " .
' In bits '
Mr McKinnon earlier told the BBC that the last seven years since his arrest had taken a considerable toll on him , both personally and financially , as he is unable to work in IT .
But he said the worst impact has been psychological .
" You 're in bits every day .
I mean , I wake up feeling like someone 's stamping on my chest every morning . "
His solicitor Karen Todner said being sent to the US would be very difficult for Mr McKinnon .
The evidence we have does not come near to reflecting the criminality that is alleged by the American authorities
CPS organised crime division
She said : " One of the problems with Asperger 's is that you need to have your family and support network around you and Gary would be completely denied that . "
She added : " He 's absolutely terrified about going to America . "
Mr McKinnon 's legal case is being supported by the National Autistic Society ( NAS ) .
The NAS said : " Asperger syndrome is part of the autism spectrum .
" It is not uncommon for people with Asperger syndrome to develop single - minded , obsessional interests , and to be unaware of the effect their actions have on others . "
In February the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) turned down a request from his lawyers for Mr McKinnon to be prosecuted in the UK on lesser charges .
Speaking at the time , the head of the CPS organised crime division , Alison Saunders , said the best place for the case to be heard was the US .
She said : " The evidence we have does not come near to reflecting the criminality that is alleged by the American authorities .
" These were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach US defence systems at a critical time which caused well - documented damage . "

You hear the word humor a lot .
People talk about office humor , sense of humor , a guy named Hugh Moore–but what does it really mean ?
Before reading on , see if you can think of the definition .
Got a guess ?
No seriously , think of something , I ’ll wait .
…
Ok , so the word humor , as defined by Random House Dictionary , means
a comic , absurd , or incongruous quality causing amusement . [ 1 ]
Were you close ?
I know the first time I looked it up , I was way off .
I mean the definition does n’t mention anything about laughter or jokes , how can it be humor ?
I had to find out .
Humor vs Comedy vs Jokes
To better understand what humor is , lets look at two other words most people relate to humor–comedy and jokes .
The House of Random says comedy is
any comic or humorous incident or series of incidents . [ 2 ]
And a joke is
something said or done to provoke laughter or cause amusement . [ 3 ]
Do you remember when you were studying for the SATs and you had to do those logic problems which tested if you understood that all lions are cats , but not all cats are lions ?
That ’s what the relationship of humor , comedy and jokes is like : all jokes are comedy , and all comedy is humor , but not all humor is comedy and certainly not all jokes .
So What is Humor ?
As the definition states , humor is anything that causes amusement .
The joke “ A leader of an orchestra was recently electrocuted , proving after all , he was a good conductor ” is humorous ( to some at least ) , but so is a smile .
Humor in the workplace could be watching episodes of The Office during lunch or taking a break to play some foosball–it ’s whatever can cause amusement .
The important thing to remember is that humor , in it ’s many forms , is beneficial to the work and life .
Office humor makes the “ 9 - 5 ” more enjoyable .
Humor and Laughter
Many people assume that in order for something to be deemed humorous , it must evoke laughter .
And while stand - up comedians may use that as a measure of success , that ’s not the case for humor at work .
Anything that relaxes the body , gets people to breathe , causes a smile , or elicits happiness is humor .
In fact , the tendency in the corporate world is to suppress laughter .
And as silly as it seems , there are a number of reasons why people do n’t laugh at work .
But the use of humor can help change that .
Humor At Work
With our new understanding of humor , you start to see how easy it can be to bring it into the workplace and have some fun at work .
Fun at work ?
Is n’t that an oxymoron ?
First , do n’t call me a moron , and second , of course not .
As Dale Carnegie , author of How to Win Friends and Influence People , said
“ People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing . ”
Humor That Works
Now that you understand humor , its ’ time to start using it to help yourself , your team , and your entire company .
You can find some ideas to get you started under How - To Humor .

By Marta Harnecker , translated by Federico Fuentes for Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal
1 . We have previously stated that politics is the art of constructing a social and political force capable of changing the balance of forces in order to make possible tomorrow that which today appears to be impossible .
But , to be able to construct a social force it is necessary for political organisations to demonstrate a great respect for grassroots movements ; to contribute to their autonomous development , leaving behind all attempts at manipulation .
They must take as their starting point that they are n’t the only ones with ideas and proposals and , on the contrary , grassroots movements have much to offer us , because through their daily struggles they have also learned things , discovered new paths , found solutions and invented methods which can be of great value .
2. Political organisations have to get rid of the idea that they are the only ones capable of generating creative , new , revolutionary and transformative ideas .
And that therefore , their role is not only to make echo of the demands of the social movements , but to also be willing to gather ideas and concepts from these movements to enrich its own conceptual arsenal .
3. Political and social leaders should leave behind the method of pre-established schemas .
We have to struggle to eliminate all verticalism that stifles the initiative of the people .
The role of a leader must be one of contributing with ideas and experiences in order to help grow and strengthen the movement , and not displace the masses .
4 . Their role is to push the mass movement forward , or perhaps more than push , facilitate the conditions necessary so that the movement can unleash its capacity to confront those that exploit and oppress them .
But helping to push forward is only possible if we fight shoulder to shoulder in local , regional , national and international struggles .
5 . The relationship of political organisations with grassroots movements should therefore be a two ‑way circuit : from the political organisation to the social movement and from the social movement to the political organisation .
Unfortunately , the tendency continues to be that it only functions in the first direction .
6 . It is important to learn to listen and to engage in dialogue with the people ; it is necessary to listen carefully to the solutions proposed by the people themselves to defend their conquests or struggle for their demands and , with all the information collected , we must be capable of correctly diagnosing their mood and synthesise that which could unite them and generate political action , and at the same time tackle pessimistic and defeatist ideas they may hold .
7 . Wherever possible , we must involve the grassroots in the process of decision making , that is to say , we have to open up new spaces for people ’s participation , but people ’s participation is not something that can be decreed from above .
Only by taking as our starting point the true motivations of the people , only if one helps them to discover the necessity of carrying out certain task for themselves , and only by winning over their hearts and minds , will they be willing to fully commit themselves to the actions proposed .
8 . This is the only way to ensure that efforts made to help orient the movement are not felt as orders coming from outside the movement and to help create an organisational process capable of involving , if not all , then at least an important part of the people into the struggle and , little by little , win over the more backward and pessimistic sectors .
When these latter sectors understand that , as Che Guevara said , the aims we are fighting for are not only necessary but possible , they too will choose to join the struggle .
9 . When the people realise that their own ideas and initiatives are being put into practice , they we see themselves as the protagonists of change and their capacity to struggle will enormously increase .
10 .
Taking all that has been said above into consideration , it becomes clear that the type of political cadres we need cannot be cadres with a military mentality -- today , it is not about leading an army , which is not to say that at some critical junctures this may and should be the case , nor that of a demagogic populist -- because it is not about leading a flock of sheep ; political cadres should fundamentally be popular pedagogues , capable of fostering the ideas and initiative that emerge for within the grassroots movement .
11 . Unfortunately , many of the current leaders have been educated in the school of leading the people by issuing orders , and that is not something that can be changed overnight .
Thus , I do not want to create an impression of excessive optimism here .
Achieving a correct relationship with the social movements is still a long way off .

" I think we should go from saying ' when in doubt , do n't circumcise ' to ' when in doubt , do ' . "
The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has flagged it will not change its policy against circumcision despite evidence the procedure can prevent the spread of HIV and other sexual diseases .
The college , which represents physicians and paediatricians in Australia and New Zealand , has adopted the position that " there is no medical indication for routine neonatal circumcision " since 2004 .
But it has been reviewing this stance in part following recent scientific research suggesting that the risk of HIV infection could be dramatically reduced by the practice .
Three trials conducted in South Africa , Kenya and Uganda between 2005 and 2007 showed conclusively , according to the World Health Organisation , " that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60 per cent " .
Further research , published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine , has found that circumcision can reduce the transfer of human papillomavirus - the chief cause of cervical cancer in women - by 35 per cent , and herpes simplex virus - the chief cause of herpes - by 25 per cent .
Three trials conducted in South Africa , Kenya and Uganda between 2005 and 2007 showed conclusively , according to the World Health Organisation , " that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60 per cent " .
The journal said the findings underscored " the potential public health benefits of the procedure " .
The college , which began its review in 2006 and was supposed to come out with a revised policy at the end of 2007 , will not do so until the end of this year , as it considers the new evidence .
It is estimated that 10 to 20 per cent of male infants are circumcised in Australia .
The chairman of the college 's panel considering the issue , David Forbes , of the University of Western Australia 's school of paediatrics , said the African studies had delayed the new recommendation , but so too had the fact " it is a contentious and non-clear - cut issue " .

" It 's quite clear that there 's evidence that circumcision in adult males helps prevent HIV in Africa , " said Professor Forbes .
" It 's not so clear that circumcision in Australia in infants is of benefit to the infants or the community .
" Policy is about getting the right message to health planners so that we have safe but cost - effective expenditure . "
New concerns about the practice of circumcision in Australia were raised last week after the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute found that parental consent might not be enough to protect the circumcisers of baby boys from later legal action .
No specific laws regulate the removal of the foreskin .
Professor Forbes said he wanted to have the college 's position " finalised by the end of this year , hopefully before " .
He said the benefit of reducing human papillomavirus " appears not to be such an issue in Australia " because a vaccine was being produced .
And there were important differences between the HIV situation in Africa and Australia : HIV rates in Australia were far lower and condom use was much higher .
He said although there was clear evidence that circumcision reduced the rate of urinary tract infection , this alone did not justify routine use of the procedure as the infection rate was so small .
He said the 10 - strong panel consisted of paediatricians , surgeons and policy and public health experts .
" There are extremely strong views at both ends of the spectrum for those who promote circumcision and those who oppose it , " he said .
" Undertaking elective surgery of minors who are not able to consent is for many paediatricians an even bigger issue , especially when there are examples of ( Muslim ) societies who elect to have it at puberty when people can choose . "
Dr Forbes declined to preview what the college 's recommendation would be .
" Policy change tends to be evolutionary , not revolutionary , and given that there are no trials of neonatal circumcision for prevention of HIV , I would n't expect revolutionary change .
I would expect evolutionary change . "
Roger Short , from Melbourne University 's department of obstetrics and gynaecology , hopes the college will view circumcision in a more favourable light .
" It would be exciting to see the Royal College come forward with a slightly more progressive attitude than its previous pronouncements , " he said .
" The evidence is coming in , and it is irrefutable , that there are major benefits . "
Professor Short said there were no grounds for making circumcision mandatory .
Instead , the college should change its recommendation .
" I think we should go from saying ' when in doubt , do n't circumcise ' to ' when in doubt , do ' . "

The dogs were found during a storm three weeks ago A new home has been found for a blind border collie and his very own guide dog which were both found on a country road in Suffolk .
The dogs , who have been named Bonnie and Clyde , were taken to Meadowgreen Dog Rescue Centre , near Loddon , Norfolk , and could not be separated .
The rescue centre began a search for a home for the two dogs and a new owner has now been found .
More than 500 people came forward to offer a home for the pair .
It is thought Clyde lost his sight because of a degenerative disease .
Cherie Cootes , from the rescue centre , said : " If Clyde 's unsure where he is , he will suddenly go behind Bonnie and put his face on the back of her so she can guide him , he totally relies on her .
" And when she walks she tends to stop and make sure he 's there - she does look out for him .
" When she 's about you would n't notice he is blind , but when she 's not about he refuses to move . "
The dogs were found running through Blundeston , near Lowestoft in Suffolk , during a storm three weeks ago .
Neither Clyde , who is thought by the rescue centre workers to be about five years old , nor Bonnie , whose estimated age is two or three , had identifying collars or chips .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Nearly one - third of all U.S. bird species are endangered , threatened or in significant decline , with birds in Hawaii facing a “ borderline ecological disaster , ” scientists reported on Thursday .
Challenger , a 15 - year - old American Bald Eagle , screeches at the new Bald Eagle Refuge Exhibit opening at the National Zoo in Washington in this file photo taken on July 2 , 2003 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed / Files
The State of the Birds report , issued by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar along with conservation groups and university ornithologists , also noted some successes , including the recovery of the bald eagle , the peregrine falcon and other species after the banning of the chemical DDT .
“ When we talk about birds and we talk about wildlife , we ’re also talking about the economics of this country , ” Salazar told reporters as the report was released .
Wildlife watching and recreation generate $ 122 billion annually , the report said .
Salazar mentioned revenue from hunting , fishing and bird - watching , but added that President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package and proposed federal budgets for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 offer more money for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which aims to protect birds and other creatures .
The report , available online at www.stateofthebirds.org, presents data collected by government and academic scientists , as well as information contributed by amateur bird - watchers .
Wetland bird populations have soared since 1968 , with an increase of up to 60 from levels 40 years ago .
But birds in other habitats -- forests , grasslands and arid areas -- have declined as much as 40 percent .
HAWAIIAN BIRDS MOST VULNERABLE
It is in the perceived paradise of Hawaii that birds have declined the most , the report said .
“ More bird species are vulnerable to extinction in Hawaii than anywhere else in the United States , ” according to the report .
Before humans arrived in the Hawaiian islands , possibly as early as the year 300 , there were 113 bird species that occurred nowhere else on Earth .
Since humans arrived , 71 species have gone extinct and 31 more are listed as threatened or endangered .
The main culprits are new plant and animal species introduced into the Hawaiian ecosystem , said George Wallace of the American Bird Conservancy , who wrote the report ’s section on Hawaii .
“ Most Americans would be surprised that a place that we usually associate with being an idyllic paradise would have so many serious bird conservation problems , ” Wallace said in a telephone interview .
“ These types of isolated island flora and fauna tend to be very , very sensitive to introductions of foreign organisms . ”
John Fitzpatrick of Cornell University went farther , calling Hawaii a “ borderline ecological disaster ” and “ the epicenter of extinctions and near extinctions . ”
Overall , the United States is home to more than 800 species of birds ; 67 of those are federally listed as endangered or threatened , with an additional 184 species causing concern because of they are narrowly distributed or have declining populations , the report said .
Sometimes I wonder if reporters have any damned sense at all .
The reason the unemployment rolls have dropped is simple - people ( like me ! ) have tapped out their benefits :
June 18 ( Bloomberg ) --
The number of Americans receiving claims for unemployment benefits dropped for the first time since January , adding to evidence the job market is starting to thaw .
The number of people collecting unemployment insurance plunged by 148,000 in the week to June 6 , the most since November 2001 , to 6.69 million , the Labor Department said today in Washington .
Initial claims rose by 3,000 to 608,000 in the week ended June 13 , in line with forecasts .
The average number of claims over the last four weeks fell to the lowest level in four months , an indication that the U.S. economy is stabilizing after the worst recession in half a century .
Even so , companies are likely to be slow to hire new employees , sending unemployment rates higher , analysts said .
“ The labor market remains weak but it ’s starting to stabilize , ” said Maxwell Clarke , chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal in New York .
“ An improvement in employment conditions and improvement in confidence go hand in hand with an improvement in consumer spending . ”
News arrived this morning of a rather strange marriage between America ’s health insurance industry and the reality TV phenomenon .
WellPoint , which bills itself as the nation ’s biggest health care insurer by medical membership , said it was teaming up with The Biggest Loser star and fitness trainer Bob Harper to help it develop a new program designed to prevent behaviorally based health problems such as smoking and obesity .
The way I read the announcement , the program will echo the show by encouraging people to basically shame others in their social network to adopt healthier behavior .
They will set the proper tone by example .
This is , at its root , the basic ingredient in The Biggest Loser .
Obviously , it ’s a competition .
There is something about the show that makes me uncomfortable – the parading of flabby flesh before a judgmental audience , the idea that the participants are trying to lose the most weight , but they are also , in a more general way , “ the biggest losers . ”
Call me socially out of touch for not sitting glued to the set when the big weigh - in comes , and the shot ends with a close - up of tears welling up in the contestant ’s eyes .
Rather than going into detail here , my view is represented rather eloquently in this video of The Young Turks show .
So , WellPoint turns to Bob Harper .
In the standard canned comment issued by the company today , Harper said , “ Whether we realize it or not , when we are around others who eat healthy and model healthy behaviors , we begin to follow .
“ Expanding this into a more formal , conscious effort can help each of us become role models for others in our lives .
For any person who ’s ever tried to quit smoking , lose weight , eat healthier or adopt a more active lifestyle , knowing you will also have an impact on others can be a powerful motivator .
“ By working together with WellPoint , we hope to provide the information and tools to help millions across the country live healthy lives . ”
WellPoint , along with other big insurers , has been working on wellness programs for several years .
It makes perfect sense to prevent illness by changing people ’s risky behavior , whether that means smoking a pack a day or paying a morning visit to McDonald ’s seven days a week .
From the insurance company ’s standpoint , it ’s far more profitable to cover folks with healthy lifestyles .
There ’s some science behind the effort , too .
WellPoint goes into detail in a report issued this month called The Ripple Effect of Individual Health Choices .
For example , if both a husband and wife smoke , the likelihood of one quitting rises 67 percent if the other quits first , according to a study cited by the insurer .
On the other hand , if your best friend becomes obese , your chances of becoming obese goes up by 57 percent .
“ People underestimate the influence they have over others when it comes to health – and the potential to help others even as they help themselves , ” the report notes .
True .
But in helping your friends and family , there may be a fine line between prodding them toward better health and making them feel like they ’re the biggest loser .
Watch this trend carefully over the next few years .
It could be the most interesting reality show of all .
At Michael Jackson 's memorial service July 7 , the Rev. Al Sharpton gave a rousing speech that had the congregation at the Staples Center rise to their feet at times with shouts of " Amen . "
Sharpton made one particular statement in his speech to MJ's three children , addressing Jackson 's eccentricities when he said , " I want his children to know there was nothing strange about your daddy .
It was strange what your daddy had to deal with , but he dealt with it anyway . "
While clearly Sharpton 's statement hinted to the racism Jackson ensued in the music industry as an African - American entertainer trying to be a crossover success , Sharpton 's statement totally ignored — as much as the Black community has in its tribute to Jackson — the homophobia , too , from us and the music industry .
Diagnosed with vitiligo , a skin disorder that causes depigmentation in patches of his skin , Jackson bleached his skin , not as a denunciation of his blackness , but rather , as he said , as a way to cosmetically have a more even skin tone .
Just as Jackson was Black , he was also queer because he did not conform to our society 's heterosexist norms .
And as the man in the mirror faded from black to white so , too , did his staged gender performance from cute straight boy lead singer of the Jackson 5 to an effeminate male solo artist donning outfits in sequins .
And as the consummate drag performer he was not only a singer and dancer , Jackson was also a shape - shifter .
Jackson 's transitioned himself first into looking like Diana Ross and then later into looking like his baby sister Janet and then later he transitioned himself into something , well , as inhumanly ghastly as he became more ghostly looking .
Jackson 's gender - blending was as transgressive , taboo and subversive as his skin- bleaching .
He wore many masks until the masks became him .
Jackson 's costumes and accessories ranged from various signature wigs to his hypermasculine look with his military / marching band outfits or his classic red ( faux ) leather look from " Beat It " to the white nylon socks he displayed beneath his black dress pants when moonwalking .
Whereas Jackson could n't be on the down low about his skin bleaching , he could be and had to be on the down low about his sexuality .
With an entertainment industry that forced Rock Hudson , a movie idol , in the closet until his death , and with a Black community that still has light years to go in accepting its own LGBTQ population , Jackson concealed his desire to grow up with an asexual Peter Pan image .
But when rumors abound , nonetheless , that Jackson was gay so too did rumors that Jackson was a serial pedophile who beguiled young impressionable boys into his bed using the Neverland Ranch as a lure .
Although Jackson was acquitted of all charges , the strangeness Jackson had to deal with that Sharpton did not speak about was homophobic bigotry , predicated on the stereotype that one 's gayness or perceived gayness is not only deviant but also innately criminal .
" Every time they knocked Michael down he got back up .
Every time they counted him out he got back in , " Shaprton said at the tribute .
The child sexual - abuse charges not only knocked Jackson down but it shocked his fan base .
And with the potential of his multimillion recording industry collapsing under false allegations Jackson had to go into action .
When Jackson tied the knot first with Lisa Marie Presley , Elvis 's daughter , in 1994 following the first child - molestation charges in 1993 everyone knew that Jackson was in damage - control mode .
And his second marriage , rumored to be not consummated , in 1997 to Debbie Rowe , who is the mother of two of Jackson 's three children , you get to see how compulsory heterosexuality exacted a toll on his life .
" We will never understand what he endured ... being judged , ridiculed .
How much pain cans one take ?
Maybe , now , Michael , they will leave you alone , " Marlon Jackson stated at his brother 's tribute .
And maybe Marlon is right .
Michael Jackson was unquestionably eccentric , and his masks did not always protect him or liberate him because he always had to don them within the restricted boundaries of both race and sexual discrimination .
Perhaps Jackson 's queerness was more a function of society 's homophobia than it was his own .
The Ministry of Defence is trying to block all internet access to the whistleblowing site Wikileaks from thousands of its own computers after discovering that dissidents have been using it to leak copies of British military manuals .
Newly obtained MoD emails reveal alarm over the discovery that Wikileaks is freely publishing manuals that are used by patrols in Iraq .
One email says : " There are thousands of things on here , I literally mean thousands .
Not just UK MoD but other places as well .
Everything I clicked on to do with MoD was ' restricted ' ...
It is huge . "
Dismay was sparked by the discovery that Wikileaks had posted copies of a 2007 manual on UK tactics for Iraq and Afghanistan , and a handbook on Istar ( intelligence surveillance , target acquisition and reconnaissance ) on its website .
The Iraq " stability operations " manual contains details on how to organise roadblocks , conduct searches and tackle suicide bombers , advising : " Immediate incapacitation of the suicide bomber , using lethal force , is likely to be the only means of stopping him . "
The manual contains " cultural awareness " advice on Arab and Afghan etiquette , warning soldiers that it is " very rude " to make the thumbs - up sign in Afghanistan .
It advises : " Feel free to return a hug or kiss on the cheek , initiated by an Iraqi man .
This is a sign of friendship , not homosexuality . "
" Restricted " is the lowest level of security classification , but MoD officials feared that terminals at some of Britain 's 1,100 military locations were being used by disaffected soldiers to email copies of the documents .
After an " urgent " investigation , one unnamed official warned that it " might be quite tricky to block " because Wikileaks has a variety of domain names .
The MoD 's directorate of information , headed by John Taylor , nevertheless went ahead and instructed BT , which has a private contract to manage the military 's landlines , to block access to Wikileaks and one of their main servers in Sweden .
A Wikileaks source said yesterday : " Wikileaks has many alternative names .
MoD site blocking has not prevented dissident MoD staff providing us with material exposing the UK involvement in Iraq and elsewhere . "
Asked why it had blocked access to Wikileaks , an MoD spokesman told the Guardian : " MoD staff are unable to access Wikileaks because there is no compelling business reason to have the facility . "
The MoD released some of its emails following a freedom of information request .
Currently , the only LEED Platinum ( non-home ) project in Kentucky is a visitor center , and this commercial building , The Green Building , could just become the next .
Located in the East Market District of Louisville Kentucky , an area increasingly being referred to as “ NuLu , ” or New Louisville , The Green Building is a major renovation of an old building .
Originally built 110 years ago as a dry goods store , the 14,000 sf masonry structure now houses a café , gallery , record label , book store , and more .
Its owners are Augusta and Gill Holland , transplants from New York who fell in love with the distressed East Market District .
Augusta holds an MA in Urban Planning from Columbia University and Gill is a film producer ; they teamed up with architect Doug Pierson from ( fer ) studio for the green project .
Construction began in 2007 and finished a short year later in the fall of 2008 ; the project cost was $ 2.2 million , and if everything goes as planned , it will received LEED Platinum certification .
The owners took impressive steps to reuse materials .
A workshop was set up in the back where a century of dust and smoke was planed off of the old timbers .
The old ceiling and floor substrates also were milled and reused as finished floor material .
They even made new furniture out of the framing .
When original bricks were removed , they were assembled in different locations , and when cinder blocks were used , they opted instead for “ Mineshaft Blocks , ” which are solid and made of coal slag and Portland cement .
Some other green elements include :
Solar panels that generate 17 % of the building ’s electrical load .
Three collection tanks on the side of the building that collect up to 240 cubic feet of storm water .
A cylindrical ice storage system that freezes during off peak hours and generates cool air a fraction of the normal energy cost .
Twelve geothermal wells that provide renewable energy to the building .
Energy recovery units in the highest and lowest points of the building to redistribute hot and cold air throughout the building .
A green wall with drought tolerant sedums in the courtyard .
But the Holland ’s do n't want to stop here .
With The Green Building as a hub , they 're planning to create a two - acre downtown marketplace with produce and food products from local growers and vendors .
The marketplace will be known as Jefferson Public Market .

An 18 - year - old Easton man was arraigned this afternoon by District Judge Gay Elwell for allegedly robbing three victims at gunpoint on Apple Street .
Police said Michael Manuel Ramos of the 1000 block of Elm Street , along with two accomplices , approached three people at about 2:30 this morning and forced them to walk south on Apple Street before threatening them with the gun and demanding money .
When Elwell found out that Ramos had graduated from Easton Area High School just two days ago , she looked at him , raised her arms in exasperation , dropped them onto her desk , shook her head slowly and said , " Two days after you graduate from high school . "
Then she left the courtroom .
Police said the three got away with $ 100 in cash and a cell phone .
Police were called and searched for the men , but were able to capture only Ramos , who allegedly admitted to his role in the robbery and cooperated with police in identifying and trying to locate his accomplices , Donald Raymond Sigafoos of the 900 - block of Walnut Street and Jeffrey Falwell of the 1300 block of Spring Garden Street .
Ramos was charged with two counts of robbery , making terroristic threats , a weapons violation , simple assault , theft and receiving stolen property .
Falwell and Sigafoos are still at large .
Ramos was sent to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $ 25,000 bail .
There 's a ton of spam on the Internet — we all are painfully aware of this already .
However , what once required an actual person to send is increasingly being taken over by botnets .
A new report ( PDF ) from Symantec 's MessageLabs says that more than 80 percent of all spam sent today comes from botnets , despite several recent shut - downs .
According to MessageLabs ' June report , spam accounted for 90.4 percent of all e-mail sent in the month of June — this was roughly unchanged since May .
Botnets , however , sent about 83.2 percent of that spam , with the largest spam - wielding botnet being Cutwail .
Cutwail is described as " one of the largest and most active botnets " and has doubled its size and output per bot since March of this year .
As a result , it is now responsible for 45 percent of all spam , with others like Mega - D , Xarvester , Donbot , Grum , and Rustock making up much of the difference .
The security firm says that many of the smaller botnets send spam through various webmail accounts , making it appear as if a real person was sending the messages .
In this sense , there could be an even higher percentage of spam with botnets behind it .
Other items of interest in the MessageLabs report were the fact that instant messenger spam containing links to malware were on the rise , and that image spam continues to grow .
Researchers had noted earlier this year that image spam was making a comeback after almost going extinct in 2008 , and now MessageLabs says that it accounts for between 8 and 10 percent of all intercepted spam .
" Almost certainly sent from a botnet , the emails often contain no hyperlinks , " reads the report .
" The spammers ’ website names are frequently included in the content of the images . "
It 's clear that botnet activity is not going to slow down anytime soon , despite some high - profile shutdowns in recent months .
Spam took a bit of a nosedive after McColo was taken offline in the fall of 2008 and there was even a bit of a dip when Pricewert was forced offline this year .
The other botnets almost always make up for the loss of spam activity , however , and this will continue to be true until all those unsuspecting Internet users stop clicking through in hopes of getting great deals on erection drugs or weight loss pills .
The Transportation Security Administration , taking a break from its critical shoe - removal and water - bottle - disposal duties , has told the mule - skinners at Hugh Moore Park that they must comply with strict post - 9/11 security measures by applying for high - tech biometric Transportation Worker Identification Credentials .
Why they might need these was not immediately clear , since " mule - skinners " are actors in colonial garb who use mules to pull a canal barge .
" We have one boat , " said Sarah B. Hays , operations director for the National Canal Museum , and presumably al Qaeda 's current third - in - command .
" It 's pulled by two mules .
On a good day they might go two miles per hour . "
Other park officials said that they would consider the mules " weapons of mass destruction " only if they were aimed at food .
Hays asked Rep. Charles Dent ( R - Pa. ) to see if he could help get a waiver .
Dent wrote to the TSA , making clear that the transportation in question was " mule - drawn canal boats . "
The TSA responded immediately , saying that the requirement would be waived .
Just kidding .
The TSA wrote back in January , noting that the TWIC requirement applies to all mariners holding credentials issued by the Coast Guard .
And since the mule - skinners hold such credentials , the TSA explained — though it did not explain why mule - skinners need those to begin with , barge or no barge — they must also comply with the TWIC requirement .
" We encourage the crew members . . . who possess Coast Guard mariner credentials to obtain a TWIC at their earliest convenience to comply with these requirements and not risk suspension or revocation of their other credentials , " the TSA wrote .
In February , Rep .
Dent got a chance to ask the new Secretary of Homeland Security , Janet Napolitano , about the controversy .
He took the opportunity to show the ( presumably declassified ) picture of the security threat shown above .
" Now , Hank and George , " he said , referring to the mules , " while sometimes [ they ] are ornery , they are not terrorists . "
Napolitano got a bit defensive .
" Obviously , this is a picture designed to say , ' Hey , is n't it absurd that they be required to have TWIC cards , ' " she said , apparently suggesting the picture had been doctored in some way to make the mule - skinners seem less threatening .
After some further discussion , Napolitano expressed a willingness to compromise .
" [ L ] et 's work with you on this particular case , if we might , " she said , and they did .
Just kidding .
In March , the museum was notified that it would not be granted an exemption after all .
Dent and Hays both said they were disappointed by the ruling .
Hays said the additional expense might force the museum to raise the ticket price for canal rides , now $ 7 but likely well worth it for the once - in - a - lifetime experience of a two - mile - per - hour barge ride .
On the other hand , I suppose the thrill factor goes up substantially if you think your mule - skinners might suddenly try to crash your barge into a nuclear plant .
Hays said the added expense of the biometric ID cards was pointless , since the barges do not enter high - security areas at any point along the ride .
Or so she claimed .

Claims that Britons have been arrested after protests in Tehran are being investigated by the Foreign Office , a spokesman said today .
Reports on Iranian state television said some British passport - holders had been detained following unrest sparked by the recent election .
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said : " We are aware of the reports and we will be looking into them . "
Riot police and protesters clashed in the streets around Iran 's parliament last night as hundreds of people converged on a Tehran square in defiance of government orders banning demonstrations .
It followed a declaration by the country 's supreme leader that the government would not yield to the opposition .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the US , Britain and other foreign powers of being behind the street protests .
Iranian intelligence minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei also accused Britain of issuing propaganda against Iran .
Iranian television quoted Mr Ejei as referring to the " meddling of alien countries " and saying that one which " strongly propagated in its media against the Islamic Republic of Iran and some of its agents have been involved in Iran 's tension is England " .
The Foreign Office confirmed that it was aware of the case of a journalist with joint British and Greek nationality who was held in the crackdown at the end of last week .
The Washington Times reporter , believed to be Iason Athanasiadis - Fowden , known as Jason Fowden , was arrested as he was attempting to leave the country according to the Iranian news agency IRNA .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said that they understood that Greek officials were providing consular assistance .
" We stand ready to help if needed , " the spokeswoman said .
Downing Street said the British ambassador in Tehran , Simon Gass , had been in contact with his Greek counterpart about Mr Athanasiadis - Fowden 's case .
The Prime Minster 's spokesman said Mr Gass had also made a request to the Iranain ministry of foreign affairs for consular access .
' Little Satan ' Britain accused over violence
Wednesday , 24 June 2009
Pro-government supporters in Tehran may continue to chant " death to America " but for Iran 's leaders it is the " Little Satan " of Britain that is to blame for stirring up recent unrest .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the UK as the " most evil " country during his address last Friday , precipitating tit - for - tat diplomatic expulsions between the two countries .
The reasons why Britain has been singled out for Iranian anger are a mixture of historic distrust , modern concerns and political realities .
The UK has long been accused of " meddling " in Iranian affairs .
In 1941 British and Russian occupied the country and forced its ruler , Reza Shah , to abdicate in favour of his son .
The deposed Shah was then sent into exile , living out the last of his years in British territories .
Relations between the Iranian people and the UK deteriorated after the war .
In 1953 , the British Government - angered over plans to nationalise Iranian oil production - instigated and then backed a CIA plot which saw popular prime minister Dr Mohammad Mossadegh removed from power .
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , the UK supported the increasingly corrupt and repressive rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi .
Since the Iranian revolution there has continued to be points of contention such as the fatwa handed down on author Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini and the UK 's involvement in Iraq .
But despite historic distrust , experts point towards more recent developments as to why Iran 's leaders are reserving their most stinging criticism for London during the current unrest .
Top of these is the position of the BBC .
Tehran has been angered by the launch of the broadcaster 's Persian service at the beginning of the year .
Mehrun Etedari , research assistant at the Saban Centre for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute , explained : " The Iranian government has been especially hard on the new BBC Persian service , which it has categorised as propaganda of the British state .
" They see it as a big threat to the state control of broadcast media . "
" Several months before the election , there was a government threat to anyone who co-operated with the BBC service . "
In recent days , state media in Iran has paraded contrite " protesters " who claim that they were influenced by the BBC into rebelling .
A BBC correspondent is also among the foreign media expelled from the country since the contested election .
It may also be the case that Britain is a better target than the " Great Satan " of America for political reasons .
The US - a far greater influence in the region - is now in the hands of a president who has expressed a desire to engage Iran in negotiation .
By focusing anger on Britain as opposed to the US , Iran 's leaders could be making sure that they do not force President Barack Obama to shut the diplomatic openings he has seemingly offered Tehran .
Mr Etedari said : " It is not as if the Iranian government is saying that only Britain is to blame for stirring up protest , they are also accusing the US .
But Khamenei 's harshest words have been for the UK .
" You could see it as the Iranian government leaving a bit of room open for negotiations with the US , especially considering the importance Obama has put on talks . "

The NHL has suspended Boston Bruins forward Milan Lucic for one game for delivering a blow to the head of Montreal forward Maxim Lapierre in the third period of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday .
Stanley Cup Playoffs Blog Check out the latest updates and analysis from the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs as our NHL crew weighs in :
• 2009 Playoffs blog
At the 15:28 mark of the third , Lucic delivered a cross-check to the head of Lapierre .
" While it is unclear whether Lucic 's glove or stick makes contact with Lapierre , what is clear is that he delivered a reckless and forceful blow to the head of his opponent , " said Colin Campbell , NHL senior executive vice president of hockey operations , in a statement Sunday evening .
Lucic's hit set off another brawl in what has become a feisty and fight - filled series between the Original Six rivals .
Lucic received a match penalty and will sit out Game 3 on Monday night when Montreal hosts Boston .
The 6 - foot - 4 , 220 - pound forward is the second player to be suspended in the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs .
Philadelphia Flyers forward Daniel Carcillo was suspended one game for a shot to the head of Pittsburgh Penguins forward Maxime Talbot following a faceoff late in Game 1 of their series .
Lucic scored 17 goals to pair with 43 points and 136 penalty minutes during the regular season .
Boston leads Montreal 2 - 0 in the best - of - seven series .
New research provides support for the use of St. John 's wort extracts in treating major depression .
A Cochrane Systematic Review backs up previous research that showed the plant extract is effective in treating mild to moderate depressive disorders .
" Overall , we found that the St. John 's wort extracts tested in the trials were superior to placebos and as effective as standard antidepressants , with fewer side effects , " says lead researcher , Klaus Linde of the Centre for Complementary Medicine in Munich , Germany .
Extracts of the plant Hypericum perforatum , commonly known as St. John 's wort , have long been used in folk medicine to treat depression and sleep disorders .
The plant produces a number of different substances that may have anti-depressive properties , but the whole extract is considered to be more effective .
Cochrane Researchers reviewed 29 trials which together included 5,489 patients with symptoms of major depression .
All trials employed the commonly used Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression to assess the severity of depression .
In trials comparing St. John 's wort to other remedies , not only were the plant extracts considered to be equally effective , but fewer patients dropped out of trials due to adverse effects .
The overall picture is complicated , however , by the fact that the results were more favourable in trials conducted in German speaking countries , where St. John 's extracts have a long tradition and are often prescribed by doctors .
Despite the favourable findings for St. John 's wort , researchers are anxious not to make generalisations about the plant 's use as an anti-depressant and recommend consulting a doctor in the first instance , especially as the extracts can sometimes affect the actions of other beneficial drugs .
" Using a St. Johns wort extract might be justified , but products on the market vary considerably , so these results only apply to the preparations tested , " says Linde .

The US Air Force has been developing an aircraft that employs an air - breathing scramjet engine , and hopes to run test flights in the fall of 2009 .
Officials hope the X - 51 “ Waverider ” aircraft will provide high speed aircraft for reconnaissance or strike missions , and eventually the engines will be used for rockets to deploy satellites in space .
“ The long - range goal of this for the Air Force is access to space , ” said Charlie Brink , an Air Force Research Laboratory propulsion directorate official who manages the X - 51 program from Wright - Patterson Air Force Base .
The first test flight of the X - 51 will be on Oct. 27 , 2009 , launched from a B - 52 aircraft with a missile booster to at least Mach 4.5 , the minimum speed at which the air - breathing scramjet engine operates , before the scramjet kicks in and accelerates the vehicle to at least Mach 6 — six times the speed of sound .
The Air Force Research Laboratory expects that the aircraft will fly for about five minutes before crashing into the Pacific .
The October flight — and three separate test flights planned in early 2010 — are designed to demonstrate the practicality of using the air - breathing scramjet engine to power and control an aircraft at hypersonic speeds ( Mach 5 or greater ) .
The $ 246.5 million development program has been under development since December 2003 .
Scramjet is an acronym for Supersonic Combustion Ramjet .
A ramjet has no moving parts and achieves compression of intake air by the forward speed of the vehicle .
The scramjet differs from the ramjet in that combustion takes place at supersonic air velocities through the engine .
It stays aloft , in part , with lift generated by the shock waves of its own flight .
It is mechanically simple , but vastly more complex aerodynamically than a jet engine .
Hydrogen is normally the fuel used .
In 2004 , NASA conducted flight tests of a hydrogen - based scramjet engine which reached speeds of Mach 9.6 , or nearly 7,000 mph , powering an aircraft known as the X - 43 .
However , none of the vehicles survived a flight test .
Brink compares the work of developing the scramjet — to complement aircraft turbine engines and rockets — with aviation ’s earlier transition from propellers to jet engines .
Air Force leadership will decide the scramjet program ’s next step , depending on how the project turns out , Brink said .

When in the course of Human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the
realities prescribed for the masses , and to establish Truth where the tenets of
Honesty are missing , it becomes our duty to advance the movements of Truth
and Liberty , to respect and enforce the Natural Rights of Man that the God of
Nature hath bestowed upon us .
Human history has shown that a people vulnerable to despotism suffer the most when the veil of secrecy is cast upon them , for it is this veil that hides the crimes and transgressions of the leadership to be carried out in the name of the people these guards are supposed to represent .
The Declaration of Independence of the Original 13 colonies dictates that the most heinous of grievances be enumerated .
We must declare our independence as we have been left to it without recourse or representation for some years .
Let it be known the crimes of the Federal Government :
1 . The suspension of the Writ Habeas Corpus :
Thus allowing that citizen and non-citizen alike be imprisoned indefinitely without charge or trial , without the benefit of counsel , without benefit of examining evidence , and be subject to punishments cruel and unusual .
2. Entangling the nation in foreign conflicts , and engaging in military action without declaration of war :
By committing the Armed Forces of the United States , and the National Guard of the Several States to war without legal recourse , without evidence of clear and imminent threat , without clear strategy , and without the means of finance .
3 . The Creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the Expansion of Power of the National Security Agency :
The creation of institutions of espionage for the purpose of spying on the American people without Due Process of the Law .
4. The Federal Reserve System :
The creation of a central banking institution that has resulted in these United States being cast into the abyss of unsustainable and unpayable debt .
5. Members of congress and other Federal Officials have called for , and taken steps to form programs of involuntary servitude .
6 . The Federal Government has used the Interstate commerce clause of the US Constitution to restrict the regular flow of goods and services through regulation intended to single out smaller competition .
Under this very modus operandi the Federal Government has also ceded National sovereignty to multinational - corporate interests including the international banking and energy industries .
7 . The members of the Federal Regime have engaged in the pilfering of public funds for corporate welfare programs opposed by the majority of the People .
8. Members of the Federal Regime have manipulated the vote of the people in regional and national elections to influence the outcome .
9 . The Federal Regime has infringed , and continues to infringe on the Right of the People to keep and Bear Arms in attempts to disarm and subjugate the people .
10 . The Federal Regime has engaged in a military propaganda campaign against the people of these United States in order to garner moral support for an illegal , undeclared war , by the insertion of Pentagon political operatives in nearly all media organizations .
11 . The Federal Regime and Government have targeted political dissidents and publicly declared them terrorists for political purposes .
12 . The Federal Government has engaged in fraud by manipulating economic data , accounting data , and statistical data to misinform the public as to the true nature of the Nation ’s finances .
Members have taken bribes in the form of “ campaign contributions ” by private interests in order to influence public policy .
13 . The Federal Government has established a Tax Code System so pervasive and large that it has become , in practice , taxation without representation .
Today it threatens to reduce the Nation to poverty .
14 . The Federal Regimes and Government have by legislation subjected the American people to unreasonable searches and seizures and gross violations of privacy that the Federal Government would never tolerate in turn .
15 . The Federal Government has created a “ Constitution Free zone ” extending 100 miles inland from all borders in an effort to subvert the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the land in nearly 2/3 of the Nation .
16 . The Federal Government has refused to enforce immigration laws leaving the Nation vulnerable to waves of illegal immigrants and potential international terrorists .
In each instance the American people , using their Constitution as a guide , have petitioned the government for a redress of grievances , be it by vote , protest , or direct contact .
All attempts , peaceful in nature , have been met with contempt and answered with further injury to the Rights of the Several States and the People .
Such injustices have been suffered patiently .
History shows that such a patient suffering of injustices are natural to the People , as the People are often reluctant to fundamentally change or dissolve the establishments to which they are accustomed .
But when these establishments become destructive to the Liberty of the People , it is their right and duty to establish new government , and new guards to their future security :
Therefore ,
We the Undersigned Declare our Independence from the Tyranny of the Federal Government and it ’s regimes .
And to this end we pledge our lives , our fortunes , and our Sacred Honor .
If we were to write a Declaration today , taking into account the history of our first declaration , what would it look like ?
Well , I gave it a go , and this is what I came up with .
Anyone care to sign on ?
I have this posted on my online gallery as well .
I though I 'd give it as much exposure as possible .
projectvxn.deviantart.com ...
Do you suppose writing something like this could get me in alot of trouble ?
It does kind of worry me , these days expressing opinion is terrorism .
A document like this could be exactly what we may see in the near future .

" Sir " Allen Stanford of Texas , not a Mormon , just another crooked bankster
John Boehner ( R - OH ) - $ 5,000
Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) - $ 5,000
Pete Sessions ( R - TX ) - $ 5,000
Roger Wicker ( R - MS ) - $ 5,000
Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) - $ 5,000

In June 2005 , the Securities and Exchange Commission made a secret plea to Antigua ’s top banking regulator , Leroy King : help investigate whether Stanford International Bank , based in the Caribbean money haven , was engaged in a huge fraud of its investors .
But unknown to the agency , someone else had gotten to him first .
R. Allen Stanford , the Texas billionaire whose bank made him a powerful figure in Antigua , had already started making a series of payments to Mr. King that would eventually top $ 100,000 in exchange for his help in warding off the S.E.C .
“ To go to Texas ?
Yes ma’am , ” Stanford responded .
Earlier , he repeatedly shook his head as the charges against him were read .
He was led away in leg irons by two U.S. marshals .
In 2008 Sir Stanford started his own PAC , The Stanford Financial Group Political Action Committee .
Previously he'd been most generous to some of Congress ' biggest whores -- particularly indicted criminals Tom DeLay ( R - TX ) and Bob Ney ( R - OH ) .
But the PAC spread the tainted cash around in a very bipartisan way .
Of the $ 120,000 it distributed directly to members of Congress , exactly 50 % went to Republicans and exactly 50 % went to Democrats .
The bigger the congressmember 's reputation for sleaziness and corruption , the bigger the chance that they would get a nice large check from the Stanford Financial Group PAC .
The half dozen most greased : That , of course , does n't count how much it cost Sir Stanford to buy his knighthood from Antigua -- nor the protection that criminal enterprise / banana republic afforded him and his schemes .
After he was charged in the criminal conspiracy by the U.S. government , Antigua suspended Leroy King , head of the Antigua and Barbuda Financial Services Regulatory Commission .
King had been paid at least $ 100,000 by Stanford to permit him to run his ponzi scheme while conducting sham audits of Stanford International Bank Ltd on behalf of the notoriously crooked off shore banking haven .
U.S. prosecutors pointed out that Stanford 's business practices put the “ integrity of the markets ” at risk .
Stanford is being held without bail since he is considered a 100 % flight risk , already having been apprehended trying to escape on a chartered jet .
He 's been in jail in Virginia and said he was anxious to get back to Texas , a state where they know how to take care of well - connected rich white people .
Over a billion dollars of investors ' money seems to have vanished without a trace although one investigator said there were " billions of dollars more in missing funds because much was wasted on a variety of risky investments , as well as cricket sponsorships , jets , yachts and other accouterments of Mr. Stanford ’s lifestyle . "
Stanford and everyone involved , of course , claims to be innocent .
We should add that before Leroy King , an American citizen , became Antigua 's chief regulatory officer , he was a vice president at a less blatantly corrupt operation , Bank of America .

This February , Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) introduced HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 to audit the FED .
When I first reported on it in March , privately I was quite ecstatic that there were 11 co-sponsors , and three were Democrats .
Why ?
Well , Dr. Paul has tried for some time to audit and limit , even abolish , the Federal Reserve .
The hallmarks of Dr. Paul 's twenty years in Congress are common sense bills that have been mostly ignored as our past Congresses and the Federal Reserve led us down the path to economic ruin .
However , what happened next in the House is amazing – HR 1207 now has 207 co-sponsors , close to a majority !
The big picture is that it only takes half a brain and a pulse to get angry about the fact that the central bankers gave the American people the equivalent of a middle finger on Bloomberg 's Freedom of Information Act request .
The FED denied to disclose how they used $ 2 trillion dollars in open market operations that they executed outside of Congressional authority .
Congress has no clue or control over how the FED used the money since that is not how the FED works .
Without an audit , Congress does not even know how much gold our nation owns .
Who wants to be on the “ No ” side with all of the popular sentiment against it ?

The legislative process in Washington is usually as slow as molasses , and most bills die in committee with the obvious exceptions of very long lobbyist bills like the USA PATRIOT
Act and urgent banker bailout - stimulus plans that no one in Congress even has time to read before voting on them and are passed in a blind panic .
In fact , I personally am insulted by this video of the infamous speedreader incident of this 900 - page “ Cap and Trade ” lobbyist amendment from May .
Ron Paul is a veteran legislator , and most of his bills this decade are quite short – HR 1207 is only 446 words .
As a candidate for Congress , I thought I would answer a few questions I have received which also outline the next steps that need to occur .
The bill is currently in committee .
Q : “ What does it take to get this bill out of committee and on the floor of the House for a vote ? ”
A : It is possible ( but not likely at this point ) that the bill will be tabled , or die , while in committee .
Committees were formed originally to have focus groups , but their modern usage merely serves to endow the committee chairs from the majority parties with a lot of power , and to stifle the minority party 's bills from ever reaching the House floor .
To pass , the committee must have quorum – the necessary amount of representatives present to vote on it – and passing requires a majority of those in attendance at committee before moving to a House vote where only a simple majority of 218 is needed .
This process is described here , see page 21/67 .
Currently , 34 co-sponsors are on the Financial Services Committee of 71 members , so just two more co-sponsors would give the bill a majority !
Please check the roster to the right .
Attached here is a spreadsheet with all current co-signers on pages 1 - 5 , and the Financial Services committee members all on page 6 .
In the file , just click on their name to visit their website and contact them .
Q : “ How many co-sponsors does it need to force that ?
Or does that even matter ? ”
A : The number of co-sponsors technically does not matter , and co-sponsors are not obligated to vote for the bill .
However , it serve as an indicator of the minimum support a bill expected on the House floor , so is a key indicator while in committee .
While bills are in committee , they can be marked up and amended , which is why the simplicity of Paul 's bill is key – there is simply not much to mark up .
Q : “ What if the Chairman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) continues to postpone a vote on HR 1207 ? ”
A : Representative Barney Frank , D - MA , is the chair of the Financial Services committee .
He has not co-signed the bill , and traditionally is allied closely with the banking special interests and the FED , so no cooperation can be expected from him .
Frank has spoken about Paul , HR 1207 , and committee politics – and boldly proclaiming that there is no inflation while inflation remains high at 7 % .
However , page 20 / 67 states that “ three or more members of a standing committee may file with the committee a written request that the chairman call a special meeting ” to force a vote .
Furthermore , the rules also state that the committee may be “ discharged ” or circumvented if a majority of Representatives ( 218 ) have signed a motion to discharge the bill from committee .
( pages 31-32/67 )
Obviously , to help secure the bill 's passage , a majority of co-signers – just 11 more would be helpful .
The most prudent path still appears to move the bill through committee , and secure a couple more committee members as co-signers .
Writing a quick note to the Financial Services committee would also help .
Q : “ What is the gravest threat to the bill ? ”
A : I happen to believe that if this bill can be approved by Congress and delivered to the President , he would sign it per all of his rhetoric about an open government and transparency .
A win in the House now appears likely , so I would say the gravest threat is that the bill will die in the Senate .
Senator Bernard Sanders ( I - VT ) has sponsored S 604 , the “ Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009 . ”
The text of the bill is currently identical to HR 1207 , but Sanders has zero co-sponsors .
Therefore , activists should target their U.S. Senator 's offices .
I recommend using DownsizeDC's “ Audit the FED ” Campaign to thank or urge your representative and Senators to co-sign this bill .
However , writing directly to your Senator 's office and placing a phone call are also recommended .
An action item summary :
Contact your Representative or target a few from the list above .
If two ( 2 ) more members of the Financial Services Committee co-sign , HR 1207 will be assured of passing committee unchanged .
If eleven ( 11 ) more members of the House co-sign , HR 1207 will be assured of passing the House .
Write a note to the Financial Services Committee , urging them to vote on HR 1207 and pass it unamended .
Urge your Senators to co-sign S 604 by DownsizeDC , but also by email and phone .
Spread the word to friends and family about the impact of this bill .
Education is key !
Rely on sites like Campaign for Liberty and Liberty Maven to keep up with the current status .
Shelly Roche and the gang at www.BreakTheMatrix.com are doing a nice job as well !

Remember HR 1207 is not just an audit of the FED , it is an audit of your local Representative !

Click to viewThere are plenty of robot builders , but none bring as much elegance to engineering as Shigeo Hirose .
His creatures are Star Wars , Iron Giant and Dean Kamen rolled into one cybernetic maki .
Truth is , I 'd never heard of Shigeo Hirose or the Hirose - Fukushima Robotics Lab at Tokyo Tech until I read Wired for War — author PW Singer , featured in our interview here , sings the praises of the robot master , possibly the world 's foremost .
Advertisement
As you can see in the montage and the rundown , below , the dude has been building stuff for years , and things he designed 30 years ago , still seem startling compared to the commercial robotics we 've grown used to .
Swimming snakes , tiny velociraptors , and giant hands that close around women 's waists — this guy seems to know that the real fuel of robotic development is a careful combination of humor and fear .
Advertisement
Make sure you watch all three minutes of the video — the last 30 seconds feature a rollerskating robot that quite frankly blew my mind .
Here 's a rundown of the featured models , in the order in which they appear in the video :
Active Code Mechanism R5 ( 2005 ) - This swimming snake scared the hell out of me .
I used to be afraid of sharks , now sharks should be afraid of ACM .

Elastor ( ???? ) -
What 's cool about this slinky with a claw is that it can easily reach things a human arm can't .
That and it looks like the prototype for the Lost In Space robot .
Danger !

Genbu ( 1995 ) - This " articulated multi- wheeled mobile robot " is one of many robots Hirose has designed that can navigate over debris .
What makes this one special is it 's shiny silver spiky look — like it 's also a lot of fun at S&M parties .

Soft Gripper II ( 1978 ) -
We have all seen this in movies :
The robot hand reaches out and grabs someone , King Kong style , around the waste .
But when you see it demonstrated in real life , with a giggling woman , it 's frankly chilling .
Where 's the rest of your gargantuan killer robot , Hirose ?
Wait , do n't answer that .

VmaxCarrier ( 2000 ) - This " holonomic omni-directional vehicle " at first reminded me of Eddie Murphy 's Billy Ray Valentine , panhandling the beginning of Trading Places .
Then I glimpsed the underside of this lightweight device — with its four omni-discs , each with eight motorized wheels ( for a total of 32 wheels ) — and realized this was no movie prop .

Titrus III (???? ) -
I think the lack of a page describing this robot confirms that Hirose only did it to show that he could .
The shuffling little dinobot may be more cute than practical , but damn if I do n't want six of them .

SMC Rover ( 1997 ) - This planetary exploration robot can send its wheeled legs off on autonomous missions , owing to motors and batteries housed in the wheels themselves .
It 's brilliant and whimsical , but it also reminds me of John Carpenter 's The Thing for some reason .

TAQT Carrier ( 1991 ) -
This mechanical wheelchair is no match for Dean Kamen 's pre-Segway one , but it was built many years earlier , and has a rounded styling that reminds me of Star Wars , like it could be found on Tatooine .

Soryu V ( 1997 ) - One set of treads , and a robot can fall on its back as it climbs vertical terrain .
Two or three , as in this case , and it 's suddenly more adaptable .
Here , to prove the point , Hirose shows it on grass and snow .

Roller - Walker ( 1994 ) -
It 's a rollerskating robot .

Q&A with Mike Furci
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Hi Mike ,
I am 14 years old , 110 pounds , and 5 - foot - 3 .
My max bench is 70 pounds ( low but just started weightlifting ) .
I know you already said weightlifting wo n’t stunt your growth , but am I too young to be weightlifting or not ?
I am also pretty short for my age compared to my friends , so I want to grow taller .
I just want to be reassured that weightlifting wo n’t stunt my growth and if I am weightlifting at a young age .
I understand your concern , but I assure you weight lifting wo n’t stunt your growth .
Your height is governed by your genetics .
If most of your family is short , chances are you ’ll be short .
If most of your family is tall , you ’ll probably be on the tall side .
If you have both tall and short people in your family it ’s a crap - shoot , and you could wind up with genetics from either .
The best thing you can do for yourself is to continue to weight train the rest of your life .
It is the best and most productive exercise one can do for health and appearance .
Make the best out of the body you have no matter how tall you are .
A 5 - foot - 3 person can look as good , be as strong , and be as healthy as somebody who ’s 5 - foot - 10 .
The only restriction I would put on your training is to not max - out .
There is no reason for you to perform rep ranges of three or below .
I would prefer you do between eight and 15 .
Once you hit your late teens ( 17 to 19 ) , and you ’ve got a few years of good experience and development , then you can start to add low rep sets once every couple of months .
Make sure you ’re eating correctly .
Make sure to stay away from processed food as much as possible .
Mike ,
I 'll try to keep it short and sweet .
Love your Bullz - Eye.com articles , but had two clarifying questions regarding your recent Biceps Routine within your “ Bigger Arms ” write - up .
1. Tempo .
I ’m a big supporter of slow , controlled movement and form when lifting and like the tempo you refer to here .
With your first number outlining the time to lower the weight , am I correct in assuming that I should be working the negative as the initial movement ( s ) ?
2. Changing the exercises .
The outline of the nine - week routine seems pretty straightforward .
However , I was a bit confused when you said , “ Notice the exercises change every three weeks .
This is to give multiple examples on exercise choice .
Choose one set of exercises and perform them throughout the nine weeks .
At the end of your nine - week cycle , choose another set . ”
What do you mean by “ one set of exercises ? ”
Am I to pick and choose between the exercises you show to put together my own routine , or should I just follow the three - week breakdowns you outline ?
Thanks for the help and keep sharing the knowledge !
Beau
Beau ,
Tempo is the speed of the reps you ’re performing .
Tempo is always expressed in a three or four digit number .
The first number always represents the time it takes to lower the weight , or “ eccentric ” phase .
This is solely for standardization .
This does not mean that you start each exercise with the negative portion of the lift .
In many cases you ’ll be forced to start movements with the “ concentric ” phase
The type of movement dictates the sequence of the lift phases .
Some lifts , like the bench press , start with your arms extended , and the first portion of the lift is the eccentric phase .
Other movements , like the pull - up , start with your arms extended , but the first portion of the lift is the concentric phase .
When choosing exercises for your nine - week cycles , stick with the same exercises for the full nine weeks .
Then change it up for another nine weeks .
I was just giving examples of groups of exercises that could be performed together .
Sorry for the confusion .
Thanks so much for visiting Bull - Eye.com and taking the time to read my articles .
Glad I could help .
I weigh 213 pounds and I ’m trying to lose weight .
I ’ve been working out and drinking those protein shakes ( Wheybolic Extreme ) .
I just started taking creatine and was wondering if it was possible to get to 195 pounds if I am taking creatine .
Ken
Ken ,
Absolutely it ’s possible .
You may notice a three - to - five - pound gain after the first two weeks of using creatine , but rest assured , it ’s not fat .
Creatine allows you to produce and store more adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) in the muscle .
ATP is the energy source used for short , intense bursts of energy as in weight lifting and sprinting .
A secondary effect is cell volumization .
ATP pulls water into the muscle cell and gives you a fuller , more muscular look .
Wheybolic Extreme is a good protein .
Whey protein isolate , which is the first ingredient on Wheybolic ’s ingredient list , is an excellent protein source .
Mike ,
I ’m glad to hear that your back is doing much better .
I was in a major car accident in my late 20s and had severe back trauma .
Orthopedic surgeons told me it was minor ( mild pain killers , hot and cold packs , etc. ) or that I needed major surgery .
I was puzzled how the experts gave me such contradictory explanations .
Some friends recommended I visit a chiropractor after two weeks of constant and severe pain .
The chiropractor treatments worked for me and changed my life .
I still use chiropractics 20 years later .
I became familiar with ART over the past 18 months with two sports injuries , one from running / biking ( piriformis muscle with sciatica ) and one from skiing ( hyper - extended calf , sprained ankle and some trauma with the ankle / foot connections ) .
ART fixed them up , although the piriformis is a stubborn injury that still is n’t 100 percent .
Thanks for sharing this info with your readers .
I think this is very valuable information .
The doctors are unable to effectively deal with soft tissue injuries and the public needs to know what other therapy options are available for treating and healing their injuries .
I love your columns .
Best regards ,

Mark ,
Thanks for taking the time to visit Bullz - Eye.com and for reading my articles .
I hope the information contained in my interview with Dr. Young gets to some people that need it .
Mike ,
I ’ve been reading some of your articles from time to time and I have always found the information useful .
I ’ve recently started working out again and would like build some muscle quickly .
A buddy of mine told me about taking testosterone and some sort of human growth hormone .
I was just curious as to your thoughts on these types of products , and if you had any recommendations ?
Thanks ,
Orlando
Long Beach , Calif .
Orlando ,
Testosterone and HGH are prescription medication .
If you are not going to go through a doctor , and try to obtain it through the black market , you are taking a big legal risk .
These medications are illegal without a prescription .
There are doctors who specialize in hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) .
In fact , you should have no problem finding a doctor in California because there are quite a few anti-aging clinics that offer HRT .
However , these clinics can be pretty expensive if you do not have good health insurance .
There are numerous studies showing the health benefits of HRT for men .
However ,
If HRT is not the route for you , there are a couple of over - the - counter supplements you can use that I have found to be very beneficial .
One is 6 OXO by Ergopharm and another is Alpha Male by Biotest ; both are really good pro testosterone supplements .
If money is a little tight , Tribex Tribulus Gold will also give you a good boost .
I go back and forth between the three products .
One month I ’ll use 6 OXO , then one month Tribulus Gold .
The third month I ’ll use Alpha Male then back to Tribulus Gold .
Good luck ,
Mike
Great recipe , followed the original proportions with just a couple of minor application changes .
We sliced a French loaf into thick , Texas toast style slices , used a mandolin to coarsely grate the cheese .
The coarse shreds melted quickly into the sauce and melted awesomely in the broiler .
We used a cast iron skillet to brown the sandwiches and then transferred the skillet to the broiler to finish off melting the cheese .
We also used egg griddle rings to make the fried eggs perfectly circular .
Next time will either slice the bread thinner or use only one slice to make the sandwich open faced .
We also made extra sauce and used it for dipping , adding a pinch of smoked Thai chile for a little heat .
Outstanding !
We will definitely make again and will make for guests as it is quite impressive .
A software company that specializes in " brain fitness " has released a title aimed at drivers who want to speed up their reaction time and track more objects in their peripheral vision .
DriveSharp by Posit Science features mental exercises the company says trains users ' brain to better process what it sees .
Posit claims studies funded by the National Institutes of Health show the exercises lead to safer driving , cut the risk of an accident by 50 percent and speed up processing and reaction time 200 percent .
These gains are especially important for the over - 65 crowd .
" Many brain functions including the visual behaviors that support good driving decline as we grow older , but that does n’t mean the brain ca n’t be rejuvenated , " company co-founder Dr. Michael Merzenich said in a statement .
" Using DriveSharp , visual skills supporting safer driving can be very significantly improved for almost all adult drivers . "
In one exercise , Jewel Diver , users track hidden jewels moving across the screen – an exercise that mimics the need to track pedestrians and merging traffic .
Another exercise , Road Tour , has users search for specific cars and signs to help boost their field of vision and visual processing speed .
Posit found that DriveSharp users cut their stopping distance by 22 feet at 55 miles per hour .
Additionally , users expanded their Useful Field of View ( UFOV ) – the area in which useful visual information can be understood from a single glance .
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety ( AAAF ) found the software so valuable it has recommended it to their clubs , as it helps " safely extend driving years , " according to AAAF CEO Peter Kissinger .
We 're sure that Posit hopes to sell the software to suburban boomers terrified of what might happen when they have to give up the keys along with their independence – and to older folks who fear they might not pass new elder - focused driving laws so many states are talking about enacting .
Sadly , for those poor souls beyond hope of regaining lost skills , there 's no exercise for drivers needing a reminder that the gas is on the right and the brake is on the left and the turn signal is still blinking .

Money and Politics
By far the most secret and least accountable operation of the federal government is not , as one might expect , the CIA , DIA , or some other super - secret intelligence agency .
The CIA and other intelligence operations are under control of the Congress .
They are accountable : a Congressional committee supervises these operations , controls their budgets , and is informed of their covert activities .
It is true that the committee hearings and activities are closed to the public ; but at least the people 's representatives in Congress insure some accountability for these secret agencies .
It is little known , however , that there is a federal agency that tops the others in secrecy by a country mile .
The Federal Reserve System is accountable to no one ; it has no budget ; it is subject to no audit ; and no Congressional committee knows of , or can truly supervise , its operations .
The Federal Reserve , virtually in total control of the nation 's vital monetary system , is accountable to nobody — and this strange situation , if acknowledged at all , is invariably trumpeted as a virtue .
Thus , when the first Democratic president in over a decade was inaugurated in 1993 , the maverick and venerable Democratic Chairman of the House Banking Committee , Texan Henry B. Gonzalez , optimistically introduced some of his favorite projects for opening up the Fed to public scrutiny .
His proposals seemed mild ; he did not call for full - fledged Congressional control of the Fed 's budget .
The Gonzalez bill required full independent audits of the Fed 's operations ; videotaping the meetings of the Fed 's policy - making committee ; and releasing detailed minutes of the policy meetings within a week , rather than the Fed being allowed , as it is now , to issue vague summaries of its decisions six weeks later .
In addition , the presidents of the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks would be chosen by the president of the United States rather than , as they are now , by the commercial banks of the respective regions .
It was to be expected that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would strongly resist any such proposals .
After all , it is in the nature of bureaucrats to resist any encroachment on their unbridled power .
Seemingly more surprising was the rejection of the Gonzalez plan by President Clinton , whose power , after all , would be enhanced by the measure .
The Gonzalez reforms , the President declared , " run the risk of undermining market confidence in the Fed . "
On the face of it , this presidential reaction , though traditional among chief executives , is rather puzzling .
After all , does n't a democracy depend upon the right of the people to know what is going on in the government for which they must vote ?
Would n't knowledge and full disclosure strengthen the faith of the American public in their monetary authorities ?
Why should public knowledge " undermine market confidence " ?
Why does " market confidence " depend on assuring far less public scrutiny than is accorded keepers of military secrets that might benefit foreign enemies ?
What is going on here ?
The standard reply of the Fed and its partisans is that any such measures , however marginal , would encroach on the Fed 's " independence from politics , " which is invoked as a kind of self - evident absolute .
The monetary system is highly important , it is claimed , and therefore the Fed must enjoy absolute independence .
" Independent of politics " has a nice , neat ring to it , and has been a staple of proposals for bureaucratic intervention and power ever since the Progressive Era .
Sweeping the streets ; control of seaports ; regulation of industry ; providing social security ; these and many other functions of government are held to be " too important " to be subject to the vagaries of political whims .
But it is one thing to say that private , or market , activities should be free of government control , and " independent of politics " in that sense .
But these are government agencies and operations we are talking about , and to say that government should be " independent of politics " conveys very different implications .
For government , unlike private industry on the market , is not accountable either to stockholders or consumers .
Government can only be accountable to the public and to its representatives in the legislature ; and if government becomes " independent of politics " it can only mean that that sphere of government becomes an absolute self - perpetuating oligarchy , accountable to no one and never subject to the public 's ability to change its personnel or to " throw the rascals out . "
If no person or group , whether stockholders or voters , can displace a ruling elite , then such an elite becomes more suitable for a dictatorship than for an allegedly democratic country .
And yet it is curious how many self - proclaimed champions of " democracy , " whether domestic or global , rush to defend the alleged ideal of the total independence of the Federal Reserve .
Representative Barney Frank ( D. , Mass . ) , a co-sponsor of the Gonzalez bill , points out that " if you take the principles that people are talking about nowadays , " such as " reforming government and opening up government — the Fed violates it more than any other branch of government . "
On what basis , then , should the vaunted " principle " of an independent Fed be maintained ?
It is instructive to examine who the defenders of this alleged principle may be , and the tactics they are using .
Presumably one political agency the Fed particularly wants to be independent from is the U.S. Treasury .
And yet Frank Newman , President Clinton 's Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance , in rejecting the Gonzalez reform , states : " The Fed is independent and that 's one of the underlying concepts . "
In addition , a revealing little point is made by the New York Times , in noting the Fed 's reaction to the Gonzalez bill : " The Fed is already working behind the scenes to organize battalions of bankers to howl about efforts to politicize the central bank " ( New York Times , October 12 , 1993 ) .
True enough .
But why should these " battalions of bankers " be so eager and willing to mobilize in behalf of the Fed 's absolute control of the monetary and banking system ?
Why should bankers be so ready to defend a federal agency which controls and regulates them , and virtually determines the operations of the banking system ?
Should n't private banks want to have some sort of check , some curb , upon their lord and master ?
Why should a regulated and controlled industry be so much in love with the unchecked power of their own federal controller ?
Let us consider any other private industry .
Would n't it be just a tad suspicious if , say , the insurance industry demanded unchecked power for their state regulators , or the trucking industry total power for the ICC , or the drug companies were clamoring for total and secret power to the Food and Drug Administration ?
So should n't we be very suspicious of the oddly cozy relationship between the banks and the Federal Reserve ?
What 's going on here ?
Our task in this volume is to open up the Fed to the scrutiny it is unfortunately not getting in the public arena .
Absolute power and lack of accountability by the Fed are generally defended on one ground alone : that any change would weaken the Federal Reserve 's allegedly inflexible commitment to wage a seemingly permanent " fight against inflation . "
This is the Johnny - one - note of the Fed 's defense of its unbridled power .
The Gonzalez reforms ,
Fed officials warn , might be seen by financial markets " as weakening the Fed 's ability to fight inflation " ( New York Times , October 8 , 1993 ) .
In subsequent Congressional testimony , Chairman Alan Greenspan elaborated this point .
Politicians , and presumably the public , are eternally tempted to expand the money supply and thereby aggravate ( price ) inflation .
Thus to Greenspan :
The temptation is to step on the monetary accelerator or at least to avoid the monetary brake until after the next election Giving in to such temptations is likely to impart an inflationary bias to the economy and could lead to instability , recession , and economic stagnation .
The Fed 's lack of accountability , Greenspan added , is a small price to pay to avoid " putting the conduct of monetary policy under the close influence of politicians subject to short - term election cycle pressure " ( New York Times , October 14 , 1993 ) .
So there we have it .
The public , in the mythology of the Fed and its supporters , is a great beast , continually subject to a lust for inflating the money supply and therefore for subjecting the economy to inflation and its dire consequences .
Those dreaded all - too - frequent inconveniences called " elections " subject politicians to these temptations , especially in political institutions such as the House of Representatives who come before the public every two years and are therefore particularly responsive to the public will .
The Federal Reserve , on the other hand , guided by monetary experts independent of the public 's lust for inflation , stands ready at all times to promote the long - run public interest by manning the battlements in an eternal fight against the Gorgon of inflation .
The public , in short , is in desperate need of absolute control of money by the Federal Reserve to save it from itself and its short - term lusts and temptations .
One monetary economist , who spent much of the 1920s and 1930s setting up Central Banks throughout the Third World , was commonly referred to as " the money doctor . "
In our current therapeutic age , perhaps Greenspan and his confreres would like to be considered as monetary " therapists , " kindly but stern taskmasters whom we invest with total power to save us from ourselves .
But in this administering of therapy , where do the private bankers fit in ?
Very neatly , according to Federal Reserve officials .
The Gonzalez proposal to have the president instead of regional bankers appoint regional Fed presidents would , in the eyes of those officials , " make it harder for the Fed to clamp down on inflation . "
Why ?
Because , the " sure way " to " minimize inflation " is " to have private bankers appoint the regional bank presidents . "
And why is this private banker role such a " sure way " ?
Because , according to the Fed officials , private bankers " are among the world 's fiercest inflation hawks " ( New York Times , October 12 , 1993 ) .
The worldview of the Federal Reserve and its advocates is now complete .
Not only are the public and politicians responsive to it eternally subject to the temptation to inflate ; but it is important for the Fed to have a cozy partnership with private bankers .
Private bankers , as " the world 's fiercest inflation hawks , " can only bolster the Fed 's eternal devotion to battling against inflation .
There we have the ideology of the Fed as reflected in its own propaganda , as well as respected Establishment transmission belts such as the New York Times , and in pronouncements and textbooks by countless economists .
Even those economists who would like to see more inflation accept and repeat the Fed 's image of its own role .
And yet every aspect of this mythology is the very reverse of the truth .
We cannot think straight about money , banking , or the Federal Reserve until this fraudulent legend has been exposed and demolished .
There is , however , one and only one aspect of the common legend that is indeed correct : that the overwhelmingly dominant cause of the virus of chronic price inflation is inflation , or expansion , of the supply of money .
Just as an increase in the production or supply of cotton will cause that crop to be cheaper on the market ; so will the creation of more money make its unit of money , each franc or dollar , cheaper and worth less in purchasing power of goods on the market .
But let us consider this agreed - upon fact in the light of the above myth about the Federal Reserve .
We supposedly have the public clamoring for inflation while the Federal Reserve , flanked by its allies the nation 's bankers , resolutely sets its face against this short - sighted public clamor .
But how is the public supposed to go about achieving this inflation ?
How can the public create , i.e. , " print , " more money ?
It would be difficult to do so , since only one institution in the society is legally allowed to print money .
Anyone who tries to print money is engaged in the high crime of " counterfeiting , " which the federal government takes very seriously indeed .
Whereas the government may take a benign view of all other torts and crimes , including mugging , robbery , and murder , and it may worry about the " deprived youth " of the criminal and treat him tenderly , there is one group of criminals whom no government ever coddles : the counterfeiters .
The counterfeiter is hunted down seriously and efficiently , and he is salted away for a very long time ; for he is committing a crime that the government takes very seriously : he is interfering with the government 's revenue : specifically , the monopoly power to print money enjoyed by the Federal Reserve .
" Money , " in our economy , is pieces of paper issued by the Federal Reserve , on which are engraved the following : " This Note is Legal Tender for all Debts , Private , and Public . "
This " Federal Reserve Note , " and nothing else , is money , and all vendors and creditors must accept these notes , like it or not .
So : if the chronic inflation undergone by Americans , and in almost every other country , is caused by the continuing creation of new money , and if in each country its governmental " Central Bank " ( in the United States , the Federal Reserve ) is the sole monopoly source and creator of all money , who then is responsible for the blight of inflation ?
Who except the very institution that is solely empowered to create money , that is , the Fed ( and the Bank of England , and the Bank of Italy , and other central banks ) itself ?
In short : even before examining the problem in detail , we should already get a glimmer of the truth : that the drumfire of propaganda that the Fed is manning the ramparts against the menace of inflation brought about by others is nothing less than a deceptive shell game .
The culprit solely responsible for inflation , the Federal Reserve , is continually engaged in raising a hue - and - cry about " inflation , " for which virtually everyone else in society seems to be responsible .
What we are seeing is the old ploy by the robber who starts shouting " Stop , thief ! " and runs down the street pointing ahead at others .
We begin to see why it has always been important for the Fed , and for other Central Banks , to invest themselves with an aura of solemnity and mystery For , as we shall see more fully , if the public knew what was going on , if it was able to rip open the curtain covering the inscrutable Wizard of Oz , it would soon discover that the Fed , far from being the indispensable solution to the problem of inflation , is itself the heart and cause of the problem .
What we need is not a totally independent , all - powerful Fed ; what we need is no Fed at all .
1. The Genesis of Money
It is impossible to understand money and how it functions , and therefore how the Fed functions , without looking at the logic of how money , banking , and Central Banking developed .
The reason is that money is unique in possessing a vital historical component .
You can explain the needs and the demand for everything else : for bread , computers , concerts , airplanes , medical care , etc. , solely by how these goods and services are valued now by consumers .
For all of these goods are valued and purchased for their own sake .
But " money , " dollars , francs , lira , etc. , is purchased and accepted in exchange not for any value the paper tickets have per se but because everyone expects that everyone else will accept these tickets in exchange .
And these expectations are pervasive because these tickets have indeed been accepted in the immediate and more remote past .
An analysis of the history of money , then , is indispensable for insight into how the monetary system works today .
Money did not and never could begin by some arbitrary social contract , or by some government agency decreeing that everyone has to accept the tickets it issues .
Even coercion could not force people and institutions to accept meaningless tickets that they had not heard of or that bore no relation to any other pre-existing money .
Money arises on the free market , as individuals on the market try to facilitate the vital process of exchange .
The market is a network , a lattice - work of two people or institutions exchanging two different commodities .
Individuals specialize in producing different goods or services , and then exchanging these goods on terms they agree upon .
Jones produces a barrel of fish and exchanges it for Smith 's bushel of wheat .
Both parties make the exchange because they expect to benefit ; and so the free market consists of a network of exchanges that are mutually beneficial at every step of the way .
But this system of " direct exchange " of useful goods , or " barter , " has severe limitations which exchangers soon run up against .
Suppose that Smith dislikes fish , but Jones , a fisherman , would like to buy his wheat .
Jones then tries to find a product , say butter , not for his own use but in order to resell to Smith .
Jones is here engaging in " indirect exchange , " where he purchases butter , not for its own sake , but for use as a " medium , " or middle - term , in the exchange .
In other cases , goods are " indivisible " and cannot be chopped up into small parts to be used in direct exchange .
Suppose , for example , that Robbins would like to sell a tractor , and then purchase a myriad of different goods : horses , wheat , rope , barrels , etc .
Clearly , he can't chop the tractor into seven or eight parts , and exchange each part for a good he desires .
What he will have to do is to engage in " indirect exchange , " that is , to sell the tractor for a more divisible commodity , say 100 pounds of butter , and then slice the butter into divisible parts and exchange each part for the good he desires .
Robbins , again , would then be using butter as a medium of exchange .
Once any particular commodity starts to be used as a medium , this very process has a spiralling , or snowballing , effect .
If , for example , several people in a society begin to use butter as a medium , people will realize that in that particular region butter is becoming especially marketable , or acceptable in exchange , and so they will demand more butter in exchange for use as a medium .
And so , as its use as a medium becomes more widely known , this use feeds upon itself , until rapidly the commodity comes into general employment in the society as a medium of exchange .
A commodity that is in general use as a medium is defined as a money .
Once a good comes into use as a money , the market expands rapidly , and the economy becomes remarkably more productive and prosperous .
The reason is that the price system becomes enormously simplified .
A " price " is simply the terms of exchange , the ratio of the quantities of the two goods being traded .
In every exchange , x amount of one commodity is exchanged for y amount of another .
Take the Smith - Jones trade noted above .
Suppose that Jones exchanges 2 barrels of fish for Smith 's 1 bushel of wheat .
In that case , the " price " of wheat in terms of fish is 2 barrels of fish per bushel .
Conversely , the " price " of fish in terms of wheat is one - half a bushel per barrel .
In a system of barter , knowing the relative price of anything would quickly become impossibly complicated : thus , the price of a hat might be 10 candy bars , or 6 loaves of bread , or 1 / 10 of a TV set , and on and on .
But once a money is established on the market , then every single exchange includes the money - commodity as one of its two commodities .
Jones will sell fish for the money commodity , and will then " sell " the money in exchange for wheat , shoes , tractors , entertainment , or whatever .
And Smith will sell his wheat in the same manner .
As a result , every price will be reckoned simply in terms of its " money - price , " its price in terms of the common money - commodity .
Thus , suppose that butter has become the society 's money by this market process .
In that case , all prices of goods or services are reckoned in their respective money - prices ; thus , a hat might exchange for 15 ounces of butter , a candy bar may be priced at 1.5 ounces of butter , a TV set at 150 ounces of butter , etc .
If you want to know how the market price of a hat compares to other goods , you do n't have to figure each relative price directly ; all you have to know is that the money - price of a hat is 15 ounces of butter , or 1 ounce of gold , or whatever the money - commodity is , and then it will be easy to reckon the various goods in terms of their respective money - prices .
Another grave problem with a world of barter is that it is impossible for any business firm to calculate how it 's doing , whether it is making profits or incurring losses , beyond a very primitive estimate .
Suppose that you are a business firm , and you are trying to calculate your income , and your expenses , for the previous month .
And you list your income : " let 's see , last month we took in 20 yards of string , 3 codfish , 4 cords of lumber , 3 bushels of wheat … etc. , " and " we paid out : 5 empty barrels , 8 pounds of cotton , 30 bricks , 5 pounds of beef . "
How in the world could you figure out how well you are doing ?
Once a money is established in an economy , however , business calculation becomes easy : " Last month , we took in 500 ounces of gold , and paid out 450 ounces of gold .
Net profit , 50 gold ounces . "
The development of a general medium of exchange , then , is a crucial requisite to the development of any sort of flourishing market economy .
In the history of mankind , every society , including primitive tribes , rapidly developed money in the above manner , on the market .
Many commodities have been used as money : iron hoes in Africa , salt in West Africa , sugar in the Caribbean , beaver skins in Canada , codfish in colonial New England , tobacco in colonial Maryland and Virginia .
In German prisoner - of - war camps of British soldiers during World War II , the continuing trading of CARE packages soon resulted in a " money " in which all other goods were priced and reckoned .
Cigarettes became the money in these camps , not because of any imposition by German or British officers or from any sudden agreement : it emerged " organically " from barter trading in spontaneously developed markets within the camps .
Throughout all these eras and societies , however , two commodities , if the society had access to them , were easily able to out compete the rest , and to establish themselves on the market as the only moneys .
These were gold and silver .
Why gold and silver ?
( And to a lesser extent , copper , when the other two were unavailable . )
Because gold and silver are superior in various " moneyish " qualities — qualities that a good needs to have to be selected by the market as money .
Gold and silver were highly valuable in themselves , for their beauty ; their supply was limited enough to have a roughly stable value , but not so scarce that they could not readily be parcelled out for use ( platinum would fit into the latter category ) ; they were in wide demand , and were easily portable ; they were highly divisible , as they could be sliced into small pieces and keep a pro rata share of their value ; they could be easily made homogeneous , so that one ounce would look like another ; and they were highly durable , thus preserving a store of value into the indefinite future .
( Mixed with a small amount of alloy , gold coins have literally been able to last for thousands of years . )
Outside the hermetic prisoner - of - war camp environment , cigarettes would have done badly as money because they are too easily manufactured ; in the outside world , the supply of cigarettes would have multiplied rapidly and its value diminished nearly to zero .
( Another problem of cigarettes as money is their lack of durability . )
Every good on the market exchanges in terms of relevant quantitative units : we trade in " bushels " of wheat ; " packs " of 20 cigarettes ; " a pair " of shoelaces ; one TV set ; etc .
These units boil down to number , weight , or volume .
Metals invariably trade and therefore are priced in terms of weight : tons , pounds , ounces , etc .
And so moneys have generally been traded in units of weight , in whatever language used in that society .
Accordingly , every modern currency unit originated as a unit of weight of gold or silver .
Why is the British currency unit called " the pound sterling ? "
Because originally , in the Middle Ages , that 's precisely what it was : a pound weight of silver .
The " dollar " began in sixteenth - century Bohemia , as a well - liked and widely circulated one - ounce silver coin minted by the Count of Schlick , who lived in Joachimsthal .
They became known as Joachimsthalers , or Schlichtenthalers , and human nature being what it is , they were soon popularly abbreviated as " thalers , " later to become " dollars " in Spain .
When the United States was founded , we shifted from the British pound currency to the dollar , defining the dollar as approximately 1/20 of a gold ounce , or 0.8 silver ounces .
2. What Is the Optimum Quantity of Money ?
The total stock , or " supply , " or quantity of money in any area or society at any given time is simply the sum total of all the ounces of gold , or units of money , in that particular society or region .
Economists have often been concerned with the question : what is the " optimal " quantity of money , what should the total money stock be , at the present time ?
How fast should that total " grow " ?
If we consider this common question carefully , however , it should strike us as rather peculiar .
How come , after all , that no one addresses the question : what is the " optimal supply " of canned peaches today or in the future ?
Or Nintendo games ?
Or ladies ' shoes ?
In fact , the very question is absurd .
A crucial fact in any economy is that all resources are scarce in relation to human wants ; if a good were not scarce , it would be superabundant , and therefore be priced , like air , at zero on the market .
Therefore , other things being equal , the more goods available to us the better .
If someone finds a new copper field , or discovers a better way of producing wheat or steel , these increases in supply of goods confer a social benefit .
The more goods the better , unless we returned to the Garden of Eden ; for this would mean that more natural scarcity has been alleviated , and living standards in society have increased .
It is because people sense the absurdity of such a question that it is virtually never raised .
But why , then , does an optimal supply of money even arise as a problem ?
Because while money , as we have seen , is indispensable to the functioning of any economy beyond the most primitive level , and while the existence of money confers enormous social benefits , this by no means implies , as in the case of all other goods , that , other things being equal , the more the better .
For when the supplies of other goods increase , we either have more consumer goods that can be used , or more resources or capital that can be used up in producing a greater supply of consumer goods .
But of what direct benefit is an increase in the supply of money ?
Money , after all , can neither be eaten nor used up in production .
The money - commodity , functioning as money , can only be used in exchange , in facilitating the transfer of goods and services , and in making economic calculation possible .
But once a money has been established in the market , no increases in its supply are needed , and they perform no genuine social function .
As we know from general economic theory , the invariable result of an increase in the supply of a good is to lower its price .
For all products except money , such an increase is socially beneficial , since it means that production and living standards have increased in response to consumer demand .
If steel or bread or houses are more plentiful and cheaper than before , everyone 's standard of living benefits .
But an increase in the supply of money cannot relieve the natural scarcity of consumer or capital goods ; all it does is to make the dollar or the franc cheaper , that is , lower its purchasing power in terms of all other goods and services .
Once a good has been established as money on the market , then , it exerts its full power as a mechanism of exchange or an instrument of calculation .
All that an increase in the quantity of dollars can do is to dilute the effectiveness , the purchasing - power , of each dollar .
Hence , the great truth of monetary theory emerges : once a commodity is in sufficient supply to be adopted as a money , no further increase in the supply of money is needed .
Any quantity of money in society is " optimal . "
Once a money is established , an increase in its supply confers no social benefit .
Does that mean that , once gold became money , all mining and production of gold was a waste ?
No , because a greater supply of gold allowed an increase in gold 's non-monetary use : more abundant and lower - priced jewelry , ornaments , fillings for teeth , etc .
But more gold as money was not needed in the economy .
Money , then , is unique among goods and services since increases in its supply are neither beneficial nor needed ; indeed , such increases only dilute money 's unique value : to be a worthy object of exchange .
3. Monetary Inflation and Counterfeiting
Suppose that a precious metal such as gold becomes a society 's money , and a certain weight of gold becomes the currency unit in which all prices and assets are reckoned .
Then , so long as the society remains on this pure gold or silver " standard , " there will probably be only gradual annual increases in the supply of money , from the output of gold mines .
The supply of gold is severely limited , and it is costly to mine further gold ; and the great durability of gold means that any annual output will constitute a small portion of the total gold stock accumulated over the centuries .
The currency will remain of roughly stable value ; in a progressing economy , the increased annual production of goods will more than offset the gradual increase in the money stock .
The result will be a gradual fall in the price level , an increase in the purchasing power of the currency unit or gold ounce , year after year .
The gently falling price level will mean a steady annual rise in the purchasing power of the dollar or franc , encouraging the saving of money and investment in future production .
A rising output and falling price level signifies a steady increase in the standard of living for each person in society .
Typically , the cost of living falls steadily , while money wage rates remain the same , meaning that " real " wage rates , or the living standards of every worker , increase steadily year by year .
We are now so conditioned by permanent price inflation that the idea of prices falling every year is difficult to grasp .
And yet , prices generally fell every year from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the latter part of the eighteenth century until 1940 , with the exception of periods of major war , when the governments inflated the money supply radically and drove up prices , after which they would gradually fall once more .
We have to realize that falling prices did not mean depression , since costs were falling due to increased productivity , so that profits were not sinking .
If we look at the spectacular drop in prices ( in real even more than in money terms ) in recent years in such particularly booming fields as computers , calculators , and TV sets , we can see that falling prices by no means have to connote depression .
But let us suppose that in this idyll of prosperity , sound money , and successful monetary calculation , a serpent appears in Eden : the temptation to counterfeit , to fashion a near - valueless object so that it would fool people into thinking it was the money - commodity .
It is instructive to trace the result .
Counterfeiting creates a problem to the extent that it is " successful , " i.e. , to the extent that the counterfeit is so well crafted that it is not found out .
Suppose that Joe Doakes and his merry men have invented a perfect counterfeit : under a gold standard , a brass or plastic object that would look exactly like a gold coin , or , in the present paper money standard , a $ 10 bill that exactly simulates a $ 10 Federal Reserve Note .
What would happen ?
In the first place , the aggregate money supply of the country would increase by the amount counterfeited ; equally important , the new money will appear first in the hands of the counterfeiters themselves .
Counterfeiting , in short , involves a twofold process : ( 1 ) increasing the total supply of money , thereby driving up the prices of goods and services and driving down the purchasing power of the money - unit ; and ( 2 ) changing the distribution of income and wealth , by putting disproportionately more money into the hands of the counterfeiters .
The first part of the process , increasing the total money supply in the country , was the focus of the " quantity theory " of the British classical economists from David Hume to Ricardo , and continues to be the focus of Milton Friedman and the monetarist " Chicago school . "
David Hume , in order to demonstrate the inflationary and non-productive effect of paper money , in effect postulated what I like to call the " Angel Gabriel " model , in which the Angel , after hearing pleas for more money , magically doubled each person 's stock of money overnight .
( In this case , the Angel Gabriel would be the " counterfeiter , " albeit for benevolent motives . )
It is clear that while everyone would be euphoric from their seeming doubling of monetary wealth , society would in no way be better off : for there would be no increase in capital or productivity or supply of goods .
As people rushed out and spent the new money , the only impact would be an approximate doubling of all prices , and the purchasing power of the dollar or franc would be cut in half , with no social benefit being conferred .
An increase of money can only dilute the effectiveness of each unit of money .
Milton Friedman 's more modern though equally magical version is that of his " helicopter effect , " in which he postulates that the annual increase of money created by the Federal Reserve is showered on each person proportionately to his current money stock by magical governmental helicopters .
While Hume 's analysis is perceptive and correct so far as it goes , it leaves out the vital redistributive effect .
Fried - man 's " helicopter effect " seriously distorts the analysis by being so constructed that redistributive effects are ruled out from the very beginning .
The point is that while we can assume benign motives for the Angel Gabriel , we cannot make the same assumption for the counterfeiting government or the Federal Reserve .
Indeed , for any earthly counterfeiter , it would be difficult to see the point of counterfeiting if each person is to receive the new money proportionately .
In real life , then , the very point of counterfeiting is to constitute a process , a process of transmitting new money from one pocket to another , and not the result of a magical and equi-proportionate expansion of money in everyone 's pocket simultaneously .
Whether counterfeiting is in the form of making brass or plastic coins that simulate gold , or of printing paper money to look like that of the government , counterfeiting is always a process in which the counterfeiter gets the new money first .
This process was encapsulated in an old New Yorker cartoon , in which a group of counterfeiters are watching the first $ 10 bill emerge from their home printing press .
One remarks : " Boy , is retail spending in the neighborhood in for a shot in the arm ! "
And indeed it was .
The first people who get the new money are the counterfeiters , which they then use to buy various goods and services .
The second receivers of the new money are the retailers who sell those goods to the counterfeiters .
And on and on the new money ripples out through the system , going from one pocket or till to another .
As it does so , there is an immediate redistribution effect .
For first the counterfeiters , then the retailers , etc. , have new money and monetary income which they use to bid up goods and services , increasing their demand and raising the prices of the goods that they purchase .
But as prices of goods begin to rise in response to the higher quantity of money , those who have n't yet received the new money find the prices of the goods they buy have gone up , while their own selling prices or incomes have not risen .
In short , the early receivers of the new money in this market chain of events gain at the expense of those who receive the money toward the end of the chain , and still worse losers are the people ( e.g. , those on fixed incomes such as annuities , interest , or pensions ) who never receive the new money at all .
Monetary inflation , then , acts as a hidden " tax " by which the early receivers expropriate ( i.e. , gain at the expense of ) the late receivers .
And of course since the very earliest receiver of the new money is the counterfeiter , the counterfeiter 's gain is the greatest .
This tax is particularly insidious because it is hidden , because few people understand the processes of money and banking , and because it is all too easy to blame the rising prices , or " price inflation , " caused by the monetary inflation on greedy capitalists , speculators , wild - spending consumers , or whatever social group is the easiest to denigrate .
Obviously , too , it is to the interest of the counterfeiters to distract attention from their own crucial role by denouncing any and all other groups and institutions as responsible for the price inflation .
The inflation process is particularly insidious and destructive because everyone enjoys the feeling of having more money , while they generally complain about the consequences of more money , namely higher prices .
But since there is an inevitable time lag between the stock of money increasing and its consequence in rising prices , and since the public has little knowledge of monetary economics , it is all too easy to fool it into placing the blame on shoulders far more visible than those of the counterfeiters .
The big error of all quantity theorists , from the British classicists to Milton Freidman , is to assume that money is only a " veil , " and that increases in the quantity of money only have influence on the price level , or on the purchasing power of the money unit .
On the contrary , it is one of the notable contributions of " Austrian School " economists and their predecessors , such as the early - eighteenth - century Irish - French economist Richard Cantillon , that , in addition to this quantitative , aggregative effect , an increase in the money supply also changes the distribution of income and wealth .
The ripple effect also alters the structure of relative prices , and therefore of the kinds and quantities of goods that will be produced , since the counterfeiters and other early receivers will have different preferences and spending patterns from the late receivers who are " taxed " by the earlier receivers .
Furthermore , these changes of income distribution , spending , relative prices , and production will be permanent and will not simply disappear , as the quantity theorists blithely assume , when the effects of the increase in the money supply will have worked themselves out .
In sum , the Austrian insight holds that counterfeiting will have far more unfortunate consequences for the economy than simple inflation of the price level .
There will be other , and permanent , distortions of the economy away from the free market pattern that responds to consumers and property - rights holders in the free economy .
This brings us to an important aspect of counterfeiting which should not be overlooked .
In addition to its more narrowly economic distortion and unfortunate consequences , counterfeiting gravely cripples the moral and property rights foundation that lies at the base of any free - market economy .
Thus , consider a free - market society where gold is the money .
In such a society , one can acquire money in only three ways : ( a ) by mining more gold ; ( b ) by selling a good or service in exchange for gold owned by someone else ; or ( c ) by receiving the gold as a voluntary gift or bequest from some other owner of gold .
Each of these methods operates within a principle of strict defense of everyone 's right to his private property .
But say a counterfeiter appears on the scene .
By creating fake gold coins he is able to acquire money in a fraudulent and coercive way , and with which he can enter the market to bid resources away from legitimate owners of gold .
In that way , he robs current owners of gold just as surely , and even more massively , than if he burglarized their homes or safes .
For this way , without actually breaking and entering the property of others , he can insidiously steal the fruits of their productive labor , and do so at the expense of all holders of money , and especially the later receivers of the new money .
Counterfeiting , therefore , is inflationary , redistributive , distorts the economic system , and amounts to stealthy and insidious robbery and expropriation of all legitimate property - owners in society .
4. Legalized Counterfeiting
Counterfeiters are generally reviled , and for good reason .
One reason that gold and silver make good moneys is that they are easily recognizable , and are particularly difficult to simulate by counterfeits .
" Coin-clipping , " the practice of shaving edges off coins , was effectively stopped when the process of " milling " ( putting vertical ridges onto the edges of coins ) was developed .
Private counterfeiting , therefore , has never been an important problem .
But what happens when government sanctions , and in effect legalizes , counterfeiting , either by itself or by other institutions ?
Counterfeiting then becomes a grave economic and social problem indeed .
For then there is no one to guard our guardians against their depredations of private property .
Historically , there have been two major kinds of legalized counterfeiting .
One is government paper money .
Under a gold standard , say that the currency unit in a society has become " one dollar , " defined as 1/20 of an ounce of gold .
At first , coins are minted with a certified weight of gold .
Then , at one point , the first time in the North American colonies in 1690 , a central government , perhaps because it is short of gold , decides to print paper tickets denominated in gold weights .
At the beginning , the government prints the money as if it is equivalent to the weight of gold : a " ten dollar " ticket , or paper note , is so denominated because it implies equivalence to a " ten- dollar " gold coin , that is , a coin weighing 1 / 2 an ounce of gold .
At first , the equivalence is maintained because the government promises redemption of this paper ticket in the same weight of gold whenever the ticket is presented to the government 's Treasury .
A " ten-dollar " note is pledged to be redeemable in 1 / 2 an ounce of gold .
And at the beginning , if the government has little or no gold on hand , as was the case in Massachusetts in 1690 , the explicit or implicit pledge is that very soon , in a year or two , the tickets will be redeemable in that weight of gold .
And if the government is still trusted by the public , it might be able , at first , to pass these notes as equivalent to gold .
So long as the paper notes are treated on the market as equivalent to gold , the newly issued tickets add to the total money supply , and also serve to redistribute society 's income and wealth .
Thus , suppose that the government needs money quickly for whatever reason .
It only has a stock of $ 2 million in gold on hand ; it promptly issues $ 5 million in paper tickets , and spends it for whatever expenditure it deems necessary : say , in grants and loans to relatives of top government officials .
Suppose , for example , the total gold stock outstanding in the country is $ 10 million , of which $ 2 million is in government hands ; then , the issue of another $ 5 million in paper tickets increases the total quantity of money stock in the country by 50 percent .
But the new funds are not proportionately distributed ; on the contrary , the new $ 5 million goes first to the government .
Then next to the relatives of officials , then to whomever sells goods and services to those relatives , and so on .
If the government falls prey to the temptation of printing a great deal of new money , not only will prices go up , but the " quality " of the money will become suspect in that society , and the lack of redeemability in gold may lead the market to accelerated discounting of that money in terms of gold .
And if the money is not at all redeemable in gold , the rate of discount will accelerate further .
In the American Revolution , the Continental Congress issued a great amount of non-redeemable paper dollars , which soon discounted radically , and in a few years , fell to such an enormous discount that they became literally worthless and disappeared from circulation .
The common phrase " Not worth a Continental " became part of American folklore as a result of this runaway depreciation and accelerated worthlessness of the Continental dollars .
5. Loan Banking
Government paper , as pernicious as it may be , is a relatively straightforward form of counterfeiting .
The public can understand the concept of " printing dollars " and spending them , and they can understand why such a flood of dollars will come to be worth a great deal less than gold , or than uninflated paper , of the same denomination , whether " dollar , " " franc , " or " mark . "
Far more difficult to grasp , however , and therefore far more insidious , are the nature and consequences of " fractional - reserve banking , " a more subtle and modern form of counterfeiting .
It is not difficult to see the consequences of a society awash in a flood of new paper money ; but it is far more difficult to envision the results of an expansion of intangible bank credit .
One of the great problems in analyzing banking is that the word " bank " comprises several very different and even contradictory functions and operations .
The ambiguity in the concept of " bank " can cover a multitude of sins .
A bank , for example , can be considered " any institution that makes loans . "
The earliest " loan banks " were merchants who , in the natural course of trade , carried their customers by means of short - term credit , charging interest for the loans .
The earliest bankers were " merchant - bankers , " who began as merchants , and who , if they were successful at productive lending , gradually grew , like the great families the Riccis and the Medicis in Renaissance Italy , to become more bankers than merchants .
It should be clear that these loans involved no inflationary creation of money .
If the Medicis sold goods for 10 gold ounces and allowed their customers to pay in six months , including an interest premium , the total money supply was in no way increased .
The Medici customers , instead of paying for the goods immediately , wait for several months , and then pay gold or silver with an additional fee for delay of payment .
This sort of loan banking is non-inflationary regardless of what the standard money is in the society , whether it be gold or government paper .
Thus , suppose that in present - day America I set up a Rothbard Loan Bank .
I save up $ 10,000 in cash and invest it as an asset of this new bank .
My balance sheet , see Figure 1 , which has assets on the left - hand side of a T - account , and the ownership of or claim to those assets on the right - hand side , the sum of which must be equal , now looks as follows :
The bank is now ready for business ; the $ 10,000 of cash assets is owned by myself .
Suppose , then , that $ 9,000 is loaned out to Joe at interest .
The balance sheet will now look as follows in Figure 2 .
The increased assets come from the extra $ 500 due as interest .
The important point here is that money , whether it be gold or other standard forms of cash , has in no way increased ; cash was saved up by me , loaned to Joe , who will then spend it , return it to me plus interest in the future , etc .
The crucial point is that none of this banking has been inflationary , fraudulent , or counterfeit in any way .
It has all been a normal , productive , entrepreneurial business transaction .
If Joe becomes insolvent and cannot repay , that would be a normal business or entrepreneurial failure .
If the Rothbard Bank , enjoying success , should expand the number of partners , or even incorporate to attract more capital , the business would expand , but the nature of this loan bank would remain the same ; again , there would be nothing inflationary or fraudulent about its operations .
So far , we have the loan bank investing its own equity in its operations .
Most people , however , think of " banks " as borrowing money from one set of people , and relending their money to another set , charging an interest differential because of its expertise in lending , in channeling capital to productive businesses .
How would this sort of borrow - and - lend bank operate ?
Let us take the Rothbard Loan Bank , as shown in Figure 3 , and assume that the Bank borrows money from the public in the form of Certificates of Deposit ( CDs ) , repayable in six months or a year .
Then , abstracting from the interest involved , and assuming the Rothbard Bank floats $ 40,000 of CDs , and relends them , we will get a balance sheet as follows :
Again , the important point is that the bank has grown , has borrowed and reloaned , and there has been no inflationary creation of new money , no fraudulent activity , and no counterfeiting .
If the Rothbard Bank makes a bad loan , and becomes insolvent , then that is a normal entrepreneurial error .
So far , loan banking has been a perfectly legitimate and productive activity .
6. Deposit Banking
We get closer to the nub of the problem when we realize that , historically , there has existed a very different type of " bank " that has no necessary logical connection , although it often had a practical connection , with loan banking .
Gold coins are often heavy , difficult to carry around , and subject to risk of loss or theft .
People began to " deposit " coins , as well as gold or silver bullion , into institutions for safekeeping .
This function may be thought of as a " money - warehouse . "
As in the case of any other warehouse , the warehouse issues the depositor a receipt , a paper ticket pledging that the article will be redeemed at any time " on demand , " that is , on presentation of the receipt .
The receipt - holder , on presenting the ticket , pays a storage fee , and the warehouse returns the item .
The first thing to be said about this sort of deposit is that it would be very peculiar to say that the warehouse " owed " the depositor the chair or watch he had placed in its care , that the warehouse is the " debtor " and the depositor the " creditor . "
Suppose , for example , that you own a precious chair and that you place it in a warehouse for safekeeping over the summer .
You return in the fall and the warehouseman says , " Gee , sorry , sir , but I 've had business setbacks in the last few months , and I am not able to pay you the debt ( the chair ) that I owe you . "
Would you shrug your shoulders , and write the whole thing off as a " bad debt , " as an unwise entrepreneurial decision on the part of the warehouseman ?
Certainly not .
You would be properly indignant , for you do not regard placing the chair in a warehouse as some sort of " credit " or " loan " to the warehouseman .
You do not lend the chair to him ; you continue to own the chair , and you are placing it in his trust .
He does n't " owe " you the chair ; the chair is and always continues to be yours ; he is storing it for safekeeping .
If the chair is not there when you arrive , you will call for the gendarmes and properly cry " theft ! "
You , and the law , regard the warehouseman who shrugs his shoulders at the absence of your chair not as someone who had made an unfortunate entrepreneurial error , but as a criminal who has absconded with your chair .
More precisely , you and the law would charge the warehouseman with being an " embezzler , " defined by Webster 's as " one who appropriates fraudulently to one 's own use what is entrusted to one 's care and management . "
Placing your goods in a warehouse ( or , alternatively , in a safe - deposit box ) is not , in other words , a " debt contract " ; it is known in the law as a " bailment " contract , in which the bailor ( the depositor ) leaves property in the care , or in the trust of , the bailee ( the warehouse ) .
Furthermore , if a warehouse builds a reputation for probity , its receipts will circulate as equivalent to the actual goods in the warehouse .
A warehouse receipt is of course payable to whomever holds the receipt ; and so the warehouse receipt will be exchanged as if it were the good itself .
If I buy your chair , I may not want to take immediate delivery of the chair itself .
If I am familiar with the Jones Warehouse , I will accept the receipt for the chair at the Jones Warehouse as equivalent to receiving the actual chair .
Just as a deed to a piece of land conveys title to the land itself , so does a warehouse receipt for a good serve as title to , or surrogate for , the good itself .
Suppose you returned from your summer vacation and asked for your chair , and the warehouseman replied , " Well , sir , I have n't got your particular chair , but here 's another one just as good . "
You would be just about as indignant as before , and you would still call for the gendarmes : " I want my chair , dammit ! "
Thus , in the ordinary course of warehousing , the temptations to embezzle are strictly limited .
Everyone wants his particular piece of property entrusted to your care , and you never know he they will want to redeem it .
Some goods , however , are of a special nature .
They are homogeneous , so that no one unit can be distinguished from another .
Such goods are known in law as being " fungible , " where any unit of the good can replace any other .
Grain is a typical example .
If someone deposits 100,000 bushels of No. 1 wheat in a grain warehouse ( known customarily as a " grain elevator " ) , all he cares about when redeeming the receipt is getting 100,000 bushels of that grade of wheat .
He does n't care whether these are the same particular bushels that he actually deposited in the elevator .
Unfortunately , this lack of caring about the specific items redeemed opens the door for a considerable amount of embezzlement by the warehouseowner .
The warehouseman may now be tempted to think as follows : " While eventually the wheat will be redeemed and shipped to a flour mill , at any given time there is always a certain amount of unredeemed wheat in my warehouse .
I therefore have a margin within which I can maneuver and profit by using someone else 's wheat . "
Instead of carrying out his trust and his bailment contract by keeping all the grain in storage , he will be tempted to commit a certain degree of embezzlement .
He is not very likely to actually drive off with or sell the wheat he has in storage .
A more likely and more sophisticated form of defrauding would be for the grain elevator owner to counterfeit fake warehouse - receipts to , say , No. 1 wheat , and then lend out these receipts to speculators in the Chicago commodities market .
The actual wheat in his elevator remains intact ; but now he has printed fraudulent warehouse - receipts , receipts backed by nothing , ones that look exactly like the genuine article .
Honest warehousing , that is , one where every receipt is backed by a deposited good , may be referred to as " 100 percent warehousing , " that is , where every receipt is backed by the good for which it is supposed to be a receipt .
On the other hand , if a warehouseman issues fake warehouse receipts , and the grain stored in his warehouse is only a fraction ( or something less than 100 percent ) of the receipts or paper tickets outstanding , then he may be said to be engaging in " fractional - reserve warehousing . "
It should also be clear that " fractional - reserve warehousing " is only a euphemism for fraud and embezzlement .
Writing in the late nineteenth century , the great English economist W. Stanley Jevons warned of the dangers of this kind of " general deposit warrant , " where only a certain category of good is pledged for redemption of a receipt , in contrast to " specific deposit warrants , " where the particular chair or watch must be redeemed by the warehouse .
Using general warrants , " it becomes possible to create a fictitious supply of a commodity , that is , to make people believe that a supply exists which does not exist . "
On the other hand , with specific deposit warrants , such as " bills of lading , pawn - tickets , dock - warrants , or certificates which establish ownership to a definite object , " it is not possible to issue such tickets " in excess of goods actually deposited , unless by distinct fraud . "
In the history of the U. S. grain market , grain elevators several times fell prey to this temptation , spurred by a lack of clarity in bailment law .
Grain elevators issued fake warehouse receipts in grain during the 1860s , lent them to speculators in the Chicago wheat market , and caused dislocations in wheat prices and bankruptcies in the wheat market .
Only a tightening of bailment law , ensuring that any issue of fake warehouse receipts is treated as fraudulent and illegal , finally put an end to this clearly impermissible practice .
Unfortunately , however , this legal development did not occur in the vitally important field of warehouses for money , or deposit banking .
If " fractional - reserve " grain warehousing , that is , the issuing of warehouse receipts for non-existent goods , is clearly fraudulent , then so too is fractional - reserve warehousing for a good even more fungible than grain , i.e. , money ( whether it be gold or government paper ) .
Any one unit of money is as good as any other , and indeed it is precisely for its homogeneity , divisibility , and recognizability that the market chooses gold as money in the first place .
And in contrast to wheat , which after all , is eventually used to make flour and must therefore eventually be removed from the elevator , money , since it is used for exchange purposes only , does not have to be removed from the warehouse at all .
Gold or silver may be removed for a non-monetary use such as jewelry , but paper money of course has only a monetary function , and therefore there is no compelling reason for warehouses ever to have to redeem their receipts .
First , of course , the money - warehouse ( also called a " deposit bank " ) must develop a market reputation for honesty and probity and for promptly redeeming their receipts whenever asked .
But once trust has been built up , the temptation for the money - warehouse to embezzle , to commit fraud , can become overwhelming .
For at this point , the deposit banker may think to himself : " For decades , this bank has built up a brand name for honesty and for redeeming its receipts .
By this time , only a small portion of my receipts are redeemed at all .
People make money payments to each other in the market , but they exchange these warehouse receipts to money as if they were money ( be it gold or government paper ) itself .
They hardly bother to redeem the receipts .
Since my customers are such suckers , I can now engage in profitable hanky - panky and none will be the wiser . "
The banker can engage in two kinds of fraud and embezzlement .
He may , for example , simply take the gold or cash out of the vault and live it up , spending money on mansions or yachts .
However , this may be a dangerous procedure ; if he should ever be caught out , and people demand their money , the embezzling nature of his act might strike everyone as crystal - clear .
Instead , a far more sophisticated and less blatant course will be for him to issue warehouse receipts to money , warehouse receipts backed by nothing but looking identical to the genuine receipts , and to lend them out to borrowers .
In short , the banker counterfeits warehouse receipts to money , and lends them out .
In that way , insofar as the counterfeiter is neither detected nor challenged to redeem in actual cash , the new fake receipts will , like the old genuine ones , circulate on the market as if they were money .
Functioning as money , or money - surrogates , they will thereby add to the stock of money in the society , inflate prices , and bring about a redistribution of wealth and income from the late to the early receivers of the new " money . "
If a banker has more room for fraud than a grain warehouseman , it should be clear that the consequences of his counterfeiting are far more destructive .
Not just the grain market but all of society and the entire economy will be disrupted and harmed .
As in the case of the coin counterfeiter , all property - owners , all owners of money , are expropriated and victimized by the counterfeiter , who is able to extract resources from the genuine producers by means of his fraud .
And in the case of bank money , as we shall see further , the effect of the banker 's depredations will not only be price inflation and redistribution of money and income , but also ruinous cycles of boom and bust generated by expansions and contractions of the counterfeit bank credit .
7. Problems for the Fractional - Reserve Banker : The Criminal Law
A deposit banker could not launch a career of " fractional - reserve " fraud and inflation from the start .
If I have never opened a Rothbard Bank , I could not simply launch one and start issuing fraudulent warehouse - receipts .
For who would take them ?
First , I would have to build up over the years a brand name for honest , 100 - percent reserve banking ; my career of fraud would have to be built parasitically upon my previous and properly built - up reputation for integrity and rectitude .
Once our banker begins his career of crime , there are several things he has to worry about .
In the first place , he must worry that if he is caught out , he might go to jail and endure heavy fines as an embezzler .
It becomes important for him to hire legal counsel , economists , and financial writers to convince the courts and the public that his fractional - reserve actions are certainly not fraud and embezzlement , that they are merely legitimate entrepreneurial actions and voluntary contracts .
And that therefore if someone should present a receipt promising redemption in gold or cash on demand , and if the banker cannot pay , that this is merely an unfortunate entrepreneurial failure rather than the uncovering of a criminal act .
To get away with this line of argument , he has to convince the authorities that his deposit liabilities are not a bailment , like a warehouse , but merely a good - faith debt .
If the banker can convince people of this trickery , then he has greatly widened the temptation and the opportunity he enjoys , for practicing fractional - reserve embezzlement .
It should be clear that , if the deposit banker , or money - warehouseman , is treated as a regular warehouseman , or bailee , the money deposited for his safe - keeping can never constitute part of the " asset " column on his balance sheet .
In no sense can the money form part of his assets , and therefore in no sense are they a " debt " owed to the depositor to comprise part of the banker 's liability column ; as something stored for safekeeping , they are not loans or debts and therefore do not properly form part of his balance sheet at all .
Unfortunately , since bailment law was undeveloped in the nineteenth century , the bankers ' counsel were able to swing the judicial decisions their way .
The landmark decisions came in Britain in the first half of the nineteenth century , and these decisions were then taken over by the American courts .
In the first important case , Carr v. Carr , in 1811 , the British judge , Sir William Grant , ruled that since the money paid into a bank deposit had been paid generally , and not earmarked in a sealed bag ( i.e. , as a " specific deposit " ) that the transaction had become a loan rather than a bailment .
Five years later , in the key follow - up case of Devaynes v. Noble , one of the counsel argued correctly that " a banker is rather a bailee of his customer 's fund than his debtor , … because the money in … [ his ] hands is rather a deposit than a debt , and may therefore be instantly demanded and taken up . "
But the same Judge Grant again insisted that " money paid into a banker 's becomes immediately a part of his general assets ; and he is merely a debtor for the amount . "
In the final culminating case , Foley v. Hill and Others , decided by the House of Lords in 1848 , Lord Cottenham , repeating the reasoning of the previous cases , put it lucidly if astonishingly :
The money placed in the custody of a banker is , to all intents and purposes , the money of the banker , to do with as he pleases ; he is guilty of no breach of trust in employing it ; he i s not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy , i f he engages in a hazardous speculation ; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of his principal ; but he is , of course , answerable for the amount , because he has contracted .
The argument of Lord Cottenham and of all other apologists for fractional - reserve banking , that the banker only contracts for the amount of money , but not to keep the money on hand , ignores the fact that if all the depositors knew what was going on and exercised their claims at once , the banker could not possibly honor his commitments .
In other words , honoring the contracts , and maintaining the entire system of fractional - reserve banking , requires a structure of smoke - and - mirrors , of duping the depositors into thinking that " their " money is safe , and would be honored should they wish to redeem their claims .
The entire system of fractional - reserve banking , therefore , is built on deceit , a deceit connived at by the legal system .
A crucial question to be asked is this : why did grain warehouse law , where the conditions — of depositing fungible goods — are exactly the same , and grain is a general deposit and not an earmarked bundle — develop in precisely the opposite direction ?
Why did the courts finally recognize that deposits of even a fungible good , in the case of grain , are emphatically a bailment , not a debt ?
Could it be that the bankers conducted a more effective lobbying operation than did the grain men ?
Indeed , the American courts , while adhering to the debt - not - bailment doctrine , have introduced puzzling anomalies which indicate their confusion and hedging on this critical point .
Thus , the authoritative law reporter Michie states that , in American law , a " bank deposit is more than an ordinary debt , and the depositor 's relation to the bank is not identical to that of an ordinary creditor . "
Michie cites a Pennsylvania case , People 's Bank v. Legrand , which affirmed that " a bank deposit is different from an ordinary debt in this , that from its very nature it is constantly subject to the check of the depositor , and is always payable on demand . "
Also , despite the law 's insistence , following Lord Cottenham , that a bank " becomes the absolute owner of money deposited with it , " yet a bank still " cannot speculate with its depositors ' [ ? ] money . "
Why are n't banks treated like grain elevators ?
That the answer is the result of politics rather than considerations of justice or property rights is suggested by the distinguished legal historian Arthur Nussbaum , when he asserts that adopting the " contrary view " ( that a bank deposit is a bailment not a debt ) would " lay an unbearable burden upon banking business . "
No doubt bank profits from the issue of fraudulent warehouse receipts would indeed come to an end as do any fraudulent profits when fraud is cracked down on .
But grain elevators and other warehouses , after all , are able to remain in business successfully ; why not genuine safe places for money ?
To highlight the essential nature of fractional - reserve banking , let us move for a moment away from banks that issue counterfeit warehouse receipts to cash .
Let us assume , rather , that these deposit banks instead actually print dollar bills made up to look like the genuine article , replete with forged signatures by the Treasurer of the United States .
The banks , let us say , print these bills and lend them out at interest .
If they are denounced for what everyone would agree is forgery and counterfeiting , why could n't these banks reply as follows : " Well , look , we do have genuine , non-counterfeit cash reserves of , say , 10 percent in our vaults .
As long as people are willing to trust us , and accept these bills as equivalent to genuine cash , what 's wrong with that ?
We are only engaged in a market transaction , no more nor less so than any other type of fractional - reserve banking . "
And what indeed is wrong about this statement that cannot be applied to any case of fractional - reserve banking ?
8. Problems for the Fractional - Reserve Banker : Insolvency
This unfortunate turn of the legal system means that the fractional - reserve banker , even if he violates his contract , cannot be treated as an embezzler and a criminal ; but the banker must still face the lesser , but still unwelcome fact of insolvency .
There are two major ways in which he can become insolvent .
The first and most devastating route , because it could happen at any time , is if the bank 's customers , those who hold the warehouse receipts or receive it in payment , lose confidence in the chances of the bank 's repayment of the receipts and decide , en masse , to cash them in .
This loss of confidence , if it spreads from a few to a large number of bank depositors , is devastating because it is always fatal .
It is fatal because , by the very nature of fractional - reserve banking , the bank cannot honor all of its contracts .
Hence the overwhelming nature of the dread process known as a " bank run , " a process by which a large number of bank customers get the wind up , sniff trouble , and demand their money .
The " bank run , " which shivers the timbers of every banker , is essentially a " populist " uprising by which the duped public , the depositors , demand the right to their own money .
This process can and will break any bank subject to its power .
Thus , suppose that an effective and convincing orator should go on television tomorrow , and urge the American public : " People of America , the banking system of this country is insolvent .
‘ Your money ’ is not in the bank vaults .
They have less than 10 percent of your money on hand .
People of America , get your money out of the banks now before it is too late ! "
If the people should now heed this advice en masse , the American banking system would be destroyed tomorrow .
A bank's " customers " are comprised of several groups .
They are those people who make the initial deposit of cash ( whether gold or government paper money ) in a bank .
They are , in the second place , those who borrow the bank 's counterfeit issue of warehouse receipts .
But they are also a great number of other people , specifically those who accept the bank 's receipts in exchange , who thereby become a bank 's customers in that sense .
Let us see how the fractional - reserve process works .
Because of the laxity of the law , a deposit of cash in a bank is treated as a credit rather than a bailment , and the loans go on the bank 's balance sheet .
Let us assume , first , that I set up a Rothbard Deposit Bank , and that at first this bank adheres strictly to a 100 - percent reserve policy .
Suppose that $ 20,000 is deposited in the bank .
Then , abstracting from my capital and other assets of the bank , its balance sheet will look as in Figure 4 :
So long as Rothbard Bank receipts are treated by the market as if they are equivalent to cash , and they function as such , the receipts will function instead of , as surrogates for , the actual cash .
Thus , suppose that Jones had deposited $ 3,000 at the Rothbard Bank .
He buys a painting from an art gallery and pays for it with his deposit receipt of $ 3,000 .
( The receipt , as we shall see , can either be a written ticket or an open book account . )
If the art gallery wishes , it need not bother redeeming the receipt for cash ; it can treat the receipt as if it were cash , and itself hold on to the receipt .
The art gallery then becomes a " customer " of the Rothbard Bank .
It should be clear that , in our example , either the cash itself or the receipt to cash circulates as money : never both at once .
So long as deposit banks adhere strictly to 100 - percent reserve banking , there is no increase in the money supply ; only the form in which the money circulates changes .
Thus , if there are $ 2 million of cash existing in a society , and people deposit $ 1.2 million in deposit banks , then the total of $ 2 million of money remains the same ; the only difference is that $ 800,000 will continue to be cash , whereas the remaining $ 1.2 million will circulate as warehouse receipts to the cash .
Suppose now that banks yield to the temptation to create fake warehouse receipts to cash , and lend these fake receipts out .
What happens now is that the previously strictly separate functions of loan and deposit banking become muddled ; the deposit trust is violated , and the deposit contract cannot be fulfilled if all the " creditors " try to redeem their claims .
The phony warehouse receipts are loaned out by the bank .
Fractional - reserve banking has reared its ugly head .
Thus , suppose that the Rothbard Deposit Bank in the previous table decides to create $ 15,000 in fake warehouse receipts , unbacked by cash , but redeemable on demand in cash , and lends them out in various loans or purchases of securities .
For how the Rothbard Bank 's balance sheet now looks see Figure 5 :
In this case , something very different has happened in a bank 's lending operation .
There is again an increase in warehouse receipts circulating as money , and a relative decline in the use of cash , but in this case there has also been a total increase in the supply of money .
The money supply has increased because warehouse receipts have been issued that are redeemable in cash but not fully backed by cash .
As in the case of any counterfeiting , the result , so long as the warehouse receipts function as surrogates for cash , will be to increase the money supply in the society , to raise prices of goods in terms of dollars , and to redistribute money and wealth to the early receivers of the new bank money ( in the first instance , the bank itself , and then its debtors , and those whom the latter spend the money on ) at the expense of those who receive the new bank money later or not at all .
Thus , if the society starts with $ 800,000 circulating as cash and $ 1.2 million circulating as warehouse receipts , as in the previous example , and the banks issue another $ 1.7 million in phony warehouse receipts , the total money supply will increase from $ 2 million to $ 3.7 million , of which $ 800,000 will still be in cash , with $ 2.9 million now in warehouse receipts , of which $ 1.2 million are backed by actual cash in the banks .
Are there any limits on this process ?
Why , for example , does the Rothbard Bank stop at a paltry $ 15,000 , or do the banks as a whole stop at $ 1.7 million ?
Why does n't the Rothbard Bank seize a good thing and issue $ 500,000 or more , or umpteen millions , and the banks as a whole do likewise ?
What is to stop them ?
The answer is the fear of insolvency ; and the most devastating route to insolvency , as we have noted , is the bank run .
Suppose , for example , that the banks go hog wild : the Rothbard Bank issues many millions of fake warehouse receipts ; the banking system as a whole issues hundreds of millions .
The more the banks issue beyond the cash in their vaults , the more outrageous the discrepancy , and the greater the possibility of a sudden loss of confidence in the banks , a loss that may start in one group or area and then , as bank runs proliferate , spread like wildfire throughout the country .
And the greater the possibility for someone to go on TV and warn the public of this growing danger .
And once a bank run gets started , there is nothing in the market economy that can stop that run short of demolishing the entire jerry - built fractional - reserve banking system in its wake .
Apart from and short of a bank run , there is another powerful check on bank credit expansion under fractional reserves , a limitation that applies to expansion by any one particular bank .
Let us assume , for example , an especially huge expansion of pseudo - warehouse receipts by one bank .
Suppose that the Rothbard Deposit Bank , previously hewing to 100 - percent reserves , decides to make a quick killing and go all - out : upon a cash reserve of $ 20,000 , previously backing receipts of $ 20,000 , it decides to print unbacked warehouse receipts of $ 1,000,000 , lending them out at interest to various borrowers .
Now the Rothbard Bank 's balance sheet will be as in Figure 6 :
Everything may be fine and profitable for the Rothbard Bank for a brief while , but there is now one enormous fly embedded in its ointment .
Suppose that the Rothbard Bank creates and lends out fake receipts of $ 1,000,000 to one firm , say the Ace Construction Company .
The Ace Construction Company , of course , is not going to borrow money and pay interest on it but not use it ; quickly , it will pay out these receipts in exchange for various goods and services .
If the persons or firms who receive the receipts from Ace are all customers of the Rothbard Bank , then all is fine ; the receipts are simply passed back and forth from one of the Rothbard Bank 's customers to another .
But suppose , instead , that the receipts go to people who are not customers of the Rothbard Bank , or not bank customers at all .
Suppose , for example , that the Ace Construction Company pays $ 1 million to the Curtis Cement Company .
And the Curtis Cement Company , for some reason , does n't use banks ; it presents the receipt for $ 1 million to the Rothbard Bank and demands redemption .
What happens ?
The Rothbard Bank , of course , has peanuts , or more precisely , $ 20,000 .
It is immediately insolvent and out of business .
More plausibly , let us suppose that the Curtis Cement Company uses a bank , all right , but not the Rothbard Bank .
In that case , say , the Curtis Cement Company presents the $ 1 million receipt to its own bank , the World Bank , and the World Bank presents the receipt for $ 1 million to the Roth - bard Bank and demands cash .
The Rothbard Bank , of course , does n't have the money , and again is out of business .
Note that for an individual expansionist bank to inflate warehouse receipts excessively and go out of business does not require a bank run ; it does n't even require that the person who eventually receives the receipts is not a customer of banks .
This person need only present the receipt to another bank to create trouble for the Rothbard Bank that cannot be overcome .
For any one bank , the more it creates fake receipts , the more danger it will be in .
But more relevant will be the number of its banking competitors and the extent of its own clientele in relation to other competing banks .
Thus , if the Rothbard Bank is the only bank in the country , then there are no limits imposed on its expansion of receipts by competition ; the only limits become either a bank run or a general unwillingness to use bank money at all .
On the other hand , let us ponder the opposite if unrealistic extreme : that every bank has only one customer , and that therefore there are millions of banks in a country .
In that case , any expansion of unbacked warehouse receipts will be impossible , regardless how small .
For then , even a small expansion by the Rothbard Bank beyond its cash in the vaults will lead very quickly to a demand for redemption by another bank which cannot be honored , and therefore insolvency .
One force , of course , could overcome this limit of calls for redemption by competing banks : a cartel agreement among all banks to accept each other 's receipts and not call on their fellow banks for redemption .
While there are many reasons for banks to engage in such cartels , there are also difficulties , difficulties which multiply as the number of banks becomes larger .
Thus , if there are only three or four banks in a country , such an agreement would be relatively simple .
One problem in expanding banks is making sure that all banks expand relatively proportionately .
If there are a number of banks in a country , and Banks A and B expand wildly while the other banks only expand their receipts a little , claims on Banks A and B will pile up rapidly in the vaults of the other banks , and the temptation will be to bust these two banks and not let them get away with relatively greater profits .
The fewer the number of competing banks in existence , the easier it will be to coordinate rates of expansion .
If there are many thousands of banks , on the other hand , coordination will become very difficult and a cartel agreement is apt to break down .
9. Booms and Busts
We have so far emphasized that bank credit expansion under fractional - reserve banking ( or " creation of counterfeit warehouse receipts " ) creates price inflation , loss of purchasing power of the currency unit , and redistribution of wealth and income .
Euphoria caused by a pouring of new money into the economy is followed by grumbling as price inflation sets in , and some people benefit while others lose .
But inflationary booms are not the only consequence of fractional - reserve counterfeiting .
For at some point in the process , a reaction sets in .
An actual bank run might set in , sweeping across the banking system ; or banks , in fear of such a run , might suddenly contract their credit , call in and not renew their loans , and sell securities they own , in order to stay solvent .
This sudden contraction will also swiftly contract the amount of warehouse receipts , or money , in circulation .
In short , as the fractional - reserve system is either found out or in danger of being found out , swift credit contraction leads to a financial and business crisis and recession .
There is no space here to go into a full analysis of business cycles , but it is clear that the credit - creation process by the banks habitually generates destructive boom - bust cycles .
10 . Types of Warehouse Receipts
Two kinds of warehouse receipts for deposit banks have developed over the centuries .
One is the regular form of receipt , familiar to anyone who has ever used any sort of warehouse : a paper ticket in which the warehouse guarantees to hand over , on demand , the particular product mentioned on the receipt , e.g. , " The Rothbard Bank will pay to the bearer of this ticket on demand , " 10 dollars in gold coin , or Treasury paper money , or whatever .
For deposit banks , this is called a " note " or " bank note . "
Historically , the bank note is the overwhelmingly dominant form of warehouse receipt .
Another form of deposit receipt , however , emerged in the banks of Renaissance Italy .
When a merchant was large - scale and very well - known , he and the bank found it more convenient for the warehouse receipt to be invisible , that is , to remain as an " open book account " on the books of the bank .
Then , if he paid large sums to another merchant , he did not have to bother transferring actual bank notes ; he would just write out a transfer order to his bank to shift some of his open book account to that of the other merchant .
Thus , Signor Medici might write out a transfer order to the Ricci Bank to transfer 100,000 lira of his open book account at the Bank to Signor Bardi .
This transfer order has come to be known as a " check , " and the open book deposit account at the bank as a " demand deposit , " or " checking account . "
Note the form of the contemporary transfer order known as a check : " I , Murray N. Rothbard , direct the Bank of America to pay to the account of Service Merchandise 100 dollars . "
It should be noted that the bank note and the open book demand deposit are economically and legally equivalent .
Each is an alternative form of warehouse receipt , and each takes its place in the total money supply as a surrogate , or substitute , for cash .
However , the check itself is not the equivalent of the bank note , even though both are paper tickets .
The bank note itself is the warehouse receipt , and therefore the surrogate , or substitute for cash and a constituent of the supply of money in the society .
The check is not the warehouse receipt itself , but an order to transfer the receipt , which is an intangible open book account on the books of the bank .
I f the receipt - holder chooses to keep his receipts in the form of a note or a demand deposit , or shifts from one to another , it should make no difference to the bank or to the total supply of money , whether the bank is practicing 100 - percent or fractional - reserve banking .
But even though the bank note and the demand deposit are economically equivalent , the two forms will not be equally marketable or acceptable on the market .
The reason is that while a merchant or another bank must always trust the bank in question in order to accept its note , for a check to be accepted the receiver must trust not only the bank but also the person who signs the check .
In general , it is far easier for a bank to develop a reputation and trust in the market economy , than for an individual depositor to develop an equivalent brand name .
Hence , wherever banking has been free and relatively unregulated by government , checking accounts have been largely confined to wealthy merchants and businessmen who have themselves developed a widespread reputation .
In the days of uncontrolled banking , checking deposits were held by the Medicis or the Rockefellers or their equivalent , not by the average person in the economy .
If banking were to return to relative freedom , it is doubtful if checking accounts would continue to dominate the economy .
For wealthy businessmen , however , checking accounts may yield many advantages .
Checks will not have to be accumulated in fixed denominations , but can be made out for a precise and a large single amount ; and unlike a loss of bank notes in an accident or theft , a loss of check forms will not entail an actual decline in one 's assets .
11 . Enter the Central Bank
Central Banking began in England , when the Bank of England was chartered in 1694 .
Other large nations copied this institution over the next two centuries , the role of the Central Bank reaching its now familiar form with the English Peel Act of 1844 .
The United States was the last major nation to enjoy the dubious blessings of Central Banking , adopting the ' Federal Reserve System in 1913 .
The Central Bank was privately owned , at least until it was generally nationalized after the mid-twentieth century .
But it has always been in close cahoots with the central government .
The Central Bank has always had two major roles : ( 1 ) to help finance the government 's deficit ; and ( 2 ) to cartelize the private commercial banks in the country , so as to help remove the two great market limits on their expansion of credit , on their propensity to counterfeit : a possible loss of confidence leading to bank runs ; and the loss of reserves should any one bank expand its own credit .
For cartels on the market , even if they are to each firm 's advantage , are very difficult to sustain unless government enforces the cartel .
In the area of fractional - reserve banking , the Central Bank can assist cartelization by removing or alleviating these two basic free - market limits on banks ' inflationary expansion credit .
It is significant that the Bank of England was launched to help the English government finance a large deficit .
Governments everywhere and at all times are short of money , and much more desperately so than individuals or business firms .
The reason is simple : unlike private persons or firms , who obtain money by selling needed goods and services to others , governments produce nothing of value and therefore have nothing to sell .
Governments can only obtain money by grabbing it from others , and therefore they are always on the lookout to find new and ingenious ways of doing the grabbing .
Taxation is the standard method ; but , at least until the twentieth century , the people were very edgy about taxes , and any increase in a tax or imposition of a new tax was likely to land the government in revolutionary hot water .
After the discovery of printing , it was only a matter of time until governments began to " counterfeit " or to issue paper money as a substitute for gold or silver .
Originally the paper was redeemable or supposedly redeemable in those metals , but eventually it was cut off from gold so that the currency unit , the dollar , pound , mark , etc. became names for independent tickets or notes issued by government rather than units of weight of gold or silver .
In the Western world , the first government paper money was issued by the British colony of Massachusetts in 1690 .
The 1690s were a particularly difficult time for the English government .
The country had just gone through four decades of revolution and civil war , in large part in opposition to high taxes , and the new government scarcely felt secure enough to impose a further bout of higher taxation .
And yet , the government had many lands it wished to conquer , especially the mighty French Empire , a feat that would entail a vast increase in expenditures .
The path of deficit spending seemed blocked for the English since the government had only recently destroyed its own credit by defaulting on over half of its debt , thereby bankrupting a large number of capitalists in the realm , who had entrusted their savings to the government .
Who then would lend anymore money to the English State ?
At this difficult juncture , Parliament was approached by a syndicate headed by William Paterson , a Scottish promoter .
The syndicate would establish a Bank of England , which would print enough bank notes , supposedly payable in gold or silver , to finance the government deficit .
No need to rely on voluntary savings when the money tap could be turned on !
In return , the government would keep all of its deposits at the new bank .
Opening in July 1694 , the Bank of England quickly issued the enormous sum of £ 760,000 , most of which was used to purchase government debt .
In less than two years time , the bank 's outstanding notes of £ 765,000 were only backed by £ 36,000 in cash .
A run demanding specie smashed the bank , which was now out of business .
But the English government , in the first of many such bailouts , rushed in to allow the Bank of England to " suspend specie payments , " that is , to cease its obligations to pay in specie , while yet being able to force its debtors to pay the bank in full .
Specie payments resumed two years later , but from then on , the government allowed the Bank of England to suspend specie payment , while continuing in operation , every time it got into financial difficulties .
The year following the first suspension , in 1697 , the Bank of England induced Parliament to prohibit any new corporate bank from being established in England .
In other words , no other incorporated bank could enter into competition with the Bank .
In addition , counterfeiting Bank of England notes was now made punishable by death .
A decade later , the government moved to grant the Bank of England a virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes .
In particular , after 1708 , it was unlawful for any corporation other than the Bank of England to issue paper money , and any note issue by bank partnerships of more than six persons was also prohibited .
The modern form of Central Banking was established by the Peel Act of 1844 .
The Bank of England was granted an absolute monopoly on the issue of all bank notes in England .
These notes , in turn , were redeemable in gold .
Private commercial banks were only allowed to issue demand deposits .
This meant that , in order to acquire cash demanded by the public , the banks had to keep checking accounts at the Bank of England .
In effect , bank demand deposits were redeemable in Bank of England notes , which in turn were redeemable in gold .
There was a double - inverted pyramid in the banking system .
At the bottom pyramid , the Bank of England , engaging in fractional - reserve banking , multiplied fake warehouse receipts to gold — its notes and deposits — on top of its gold reserves .
In their turn , in a second inverted pyramid on top of the Bank of England , the private commercial banks pyramided their demand deposits on top of their reserves , or their deposit accounts , at the Bank of England .
It is clear that , once Britain went off the gold standard , first during World War I and finally in 1931 , the Bank of England notes could serve as the standard fiat money , and the private banks could still pyramid demand deposits on top of their Bank of England reserves .
The big difference is that now the gold standard no longer served as any kind of check upon the Central Bank 's expansion of its credit , i.e. , its counterfeiting of notes and deposits .
Note , too , that with the prohibition of private bank issue of notes , in contrast to demand deposits , for the first time the form of warehouse receipt , whether notes or deposits , made a big difference .
If bank customers wish to hold cash , or paper notes , instead of intangible deposits , their banks have to go to the Central Bank and draw down their reserves .
As we shall see later in analyzing the Federal Reserve , the result is that a change from demand deposit to note has a contractionary effect on the money supply , whereas a change from note to intangible deposit will have an inflationary effect .
12 . Easing the Limits on Bank Credit Expansion
The institution of Central Banking eased the free - market restrictions on fractional - reserve banking in several ways .
In the first place , by the mid-nineteenth century a " tradition " was craftily created that the Central Bank must always act as a " lender of last resort " to bail out the banks should the bulk of them get into trouble .
The Central Bank had the might , the law , and the prestige of the State behind it ; it was the depository of the State 's accounts ; and it had the implicit promise that the State regards the Central Bank as " too big to fail . "
Even under the gold standard , the Central Bank note tended to be used , at least implicitly , as legal tender , and actual redemption in gold , at least by domestic citizens , was increasingly discouraged though not actually prohibited .
Backed by the Central Bank and beyond it by the State itself , then , public confidence in the banking system was artificially bolstered , and runs on the banking system became far less likely .
Even under the gold standard , then , domestic demands for gold became increasingly rare , and there was generally little for the banks to worry about .
The major problem for the bankers was international demands for gold , for while the citizens of , say , France , could be conned into not demanding gold for notes or deposits , it was difficult to dissuade British or German citizens holding bank deposits in francs from cashing them in for gold .
The Peel Act system insured that the Central Bank could act as a cartelizing device , and in particular to make sure that the severe free - market limits on the expansion of any one bank could be circumvented .
In a free market , as we remember , if a Rothbard Bank expanded notes or deposits by itself , these warehouse receipts would quickly fall into the hands of clients of other banks , and these people or their banks would demand redemption of Rothbard warehouse receipts in gold .
And since the whole point of fractional - reserve banking is not to have sufficient money to redeem the receipts , the Rothbard Bank would quickly go under .
But if a Central Bank enjoys the monopoly of bank notes , and the commercial banks all pyramid expansion of their demand deposits on top of their " reserves , " or checking accounts at the Central Bank , then all the Bank need do to assure successful cartelization is to expand proportionately throughout the country , so that all competing banks increase their reserves , and can expand together at the same rate .
Then , if the Rothbard Bank , for example , prints warehouse receipts far beyond , say triple , its reserves in deposits at the Central Bank , it will not , on net , lose reserves if all the competing banks are expanding their credit at the same rate .
In this way , the Central Bank acts as an effective cartelizing agent .
But while the Central Bank can mobilize all the banks within a country and make sure they all expand the money - substitutes they create at the same rate , they once again have a problem with the banks of other countries .
While the Central Bank of Ruritania can see to it that all the Ruritanian banks are mobilized and expand their credit and the money - supply together , it has no power over the banks or the currencies of other countries .
Its cartelizing potential extends only to the borders of its own country .
13 . The Central Bank Buys Assets
Before analyzing operations of the Federal Reserve in more detail , we should understand that the most important way that a Central Bank can cartelize its banking system is by increasing the reserves of the banks , and the most important way to do that is simply by buying assets .
In a gold standard , the " reserve " of a commercial bank , the asset that allegedly stands behind its notes or deposits , is gold .
When the Central Bank enters the scene , and particularly after the Peel Act of 1844 , the reserves consist of gold , but predominantly they consist of the bank 's demand deposit account at the Central Bank , an account which enables the bank to redeem its own checking account in the notes of the Central Bank , which enjoys a State - granted monopoly on the issue of tangible notes .
As a result , in practice the banks hold Central Bank deposits as their reserve and they redeem in Central Bank notes , whereas the Central Bank is pledged to redeem those notes in gold .
This post - Peel
Act structure , it is clear , not undesignedly paved the way for a smooth transition to a fiat paper standard .
Since the average citizen had come to use Central Bank notes as his cash , and gold was demanded only by foreigners , it was relatively easy and not troublesome for the government to go off gold and to refuse to redeem its or its Central Bank notes in specie .
The average citizen continued to use Bank notes and the commercial banks continued to redeem their deposits in those notes .
The daily economic life of the country seemed to go on much as before .
It should be clear that , if there had been no Central Bank , and especially no Central Bank with a Peel Act type monopoly of notes , going off gold would have created a considerable amount of trouble and a public outcry .
How , then , can the Central Bank increase the reserves of the banks under its jurisdiction ?
Simply by buying assets .
It does n't matter whom it buys assets from , whether from the banks or from any other individual or firm in the economy .
Suppose a Central Bank buys an asset from a bank .
For example , the Central Bank buys a building , owned by the Jonesville Bank for $ 1,000,000 .
The building , appraised at $ 1,000,000 , is transferred from the asset column of the Jonesville Bank to the asset column of the Central Bank .
How does the Central Bank pay for the building ?
Simple : by writing out a check on itself for $ 1,000,000 .
Where did it get the money to write out the check ?
It created the money out of thin air , i.e. , by creating a fake warehouse receipt for $ 1,000,000 in cash which it does not possess .
The Jonesville Bank deposits the check at the Central Bank , and the Jonesville Bank 's deposit account at the Central Bank goes up by $ 1,000,000 .
The Jonesville Bank 's total reserves have increased by $ 1,000,000 , upon which it and other banks will be able , in a short period of time , to multiply their own warehouse receipts to non-existent reserves manyfold , and thereby to increase the money supply of the country manyfold .
Figure 7 demonstrates this initial process of purchasing assets .
We now have to deal with two sets of T - accounts : the commercial bank and the Central Bank The process is shown as in figure 7 .
Now , let us analyze the similar , though less obvious , proce

The UK Independence Party has called for the elections minister to resign in a row over folded ballot papers .
UKIP says hundreds of people could not find the party 's box as it was hidden under a small fold at the bottom of the list of European election candidates .
The party says it may challenge the result and says minister Michael Wills did not do enough to sort it out .
The government says returning officers run elections and an alert had been put out once the problem emerged .
In a letter to Mr Wills , UKIP leader Nigel Farage said : " We are outraged that today 's European election have not been contested on a free and fair basis .
" We have been swamped with upset voters who failed to find us on the ballot paper .
In many cases they have voted for other parties such as NO2EU and even the BNP . "
' Prise open '
He said in some cases ballot papers were " machine folded and with a sharp crease " .
" A good pair of fingernails were needed to prise open the last page , " he added .
The party says it is gathering information from across the UK and may issue a legal challenge to demand a rerun of the election .
An enlarged copy of the full ballot paper is on display in every polling station
Ministry of Justice Mr Farage said he had tried to contact Mr Wills but was rebuffed with the message that the problem had " already been handled " - something the UKIP leader rejects .
He said Mr Wills ' " total refusal " to meet him to resolve the matter showed he was " unfit to remain in office " and should resign .
A number of people , mainly from the Yorkshire and the Humber region , contacted the BBC about the problem .
One man from York told the BBC he had been " absolutely shocked " that he could not find the party he wanted to vote for on the ballot paper and had to ask officials where it was .
" They explained you have to unfold it again , right at the very bottom there was another very neat fold that you could not see , folded backwards , " he said .
During the day the Electoral Commission issued an alert to returning officers , advising them papers should be handed out unfolded , after the issue was raised by UKIP .
A spokesman for the commission told the BBC they were " aware of the issue - and the general issues that long ballot papers can cause " .
He said ballot papers were folded to help protect secrecy .
The Ministry of Justice said that the government was responsible for " setting the legislative framework " for elections , and for funding them .
Returning officers were responsible for conducting them and it was important they were independent , it said .
The department said there were no strict rules on how a ballot paper should be folded and it was clear that in some areas there were lots of candidates which meant ballot papers were extra long .
It added that providing guidance on the conduct of elections was a matter for the Electoral Commission which had quickly issued a circular asking polling staff not to fold the papers when the problem emerged .
" It is also worth bearing in mind that an enlarged copy of the full ballot paper is on display in every polling station , " a spokesman said .
" Polling station staff also have to hand an enlarged copy of the ballot paper which is available on request . "

Will the Waxman - Markey bill spark a full - scale energy revolution ?
No .
Not on its own , not in the next 10 - 15 years .
The short - term targets for reducing greenhouse gases are too low , the renewable electricity standard is too weak , too many offsets are allowed , and there ’s too little investment in clean energy .
To boot , there ’s every indication the bill will get worse before it passes … in the unlikely event it passes .
The green world is grappling with these unpleasant facts right now , fluctuating between rage ( kill it ! ) , dread ( we ’re screwed ) , and resignation ( it ’s better than nothing ) .
Or maybe that ’s just me .
Anyway , on odd - numbered days , I think I ’ve reached a fragile zen detente with the whole process .
Mainly , I ’ve been trying to focus on a different question : will there be an energy revolution ?
After all , the American Clean Energy and Security Act is not the only shot for Obama to make good on his campaign promises on energy .
Nor is the legislation our last chance to tackle the climate crisis .
No bill can carry that kind of weight , not at this moment , with this Congress .
America is at the tail end of an era of cheap energy and heedless economic growth .
Waxman - Markey is just the struggle to get an extremely hidebound , backward - looking set of political institutions to acknowledge that the old order is collapsing .
Building a new order is something else entirely .
The question is , what ’s going to happen after the bill is passed ?
An energy revolution will require a combination of social , technological , business , legal , regulatory , and legislative changes .
Federal legislation can’t do all the lifting .
Conversely , other changes can compensate somewhat for a weak ( at least at the outset ) federal framework .
What will ultimately make the difference is not the specific mechanics of the bill but the , ahem , Sweep of History .
( And who better to capture the Sweep of History than Some Blogger ? )
I am reasonably optimistic , despite the flaws in Waxman - Markey , that history is on our side , and that the arguments happening today in Congress will soon be seen as peculiar and archaic .
Here , briefly , is why :
Obama ( Lo , is he not The Beginning of All Lists ? )
There is no reason to think that this bill is going to be Obama ’s only legacy on energy .
Already there ’s been the stimulus bill , which will probably do more for clean energy in the next five years than Waxman - Markey , the new mileage standards , and the big climate impacts report .
And there is plenty more to come .
In the latest issue of Rolling Stone , Jeff Goodell has a fantastic piece on Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
( For reasons only RS understands , it is not yet online .
However , Charlie Petit at Knight has a bootleg PDF copy and some thoughts on the piece .
Also read Brad Plumer .
And while you ’re at it , read Brad ’s long and extremely excellent piece on the question of whether we need technological breakthroughs to beat climate change , which is centered on Chu . )
The RS piece contains this striking passage :
“ The fact is , we ’re not going to level out at 450 ppm , ” [ Chu ] says .
“ We ’re going to go over 450 ppm .
So what will we do ?
I ’m not in favor of deploying geoengineering .
But thinking about it is OK . ”
For a moment , the room goes quiet .
In effect , the United States secretary of energy has just told an elite group of scientists and politicians that , no matter what happens with climate legislation this summer in Congress , no matter what China does or does not do , no matter what targets are set at climate negotiations in Copenhagen later this year , our future as a species is likely a grim one .
Chu has uttered the politically unthinkable : that his own administration ’s efforts to halt global warming might not be enough to avert a catastrophe .
In other words , Chu gets it .
He knows that this is n’t just political football .
It is n’t just another “ issue . ”
It ’s imminent misery , not just for future generations but for people alive today .
And he ’s not the only one .
White House science adviser John Holdren gets it .
So do climate czar Carol Browner , EPA administrator Lisa Jackson , CEQ chief Nancy Sutley , and both Hillary Clinton and Todd Stern at State .
So , if we ’re to believe those close to him , does Barack Obama ( though many of his supporters are beginning to have their doubts , what with his ongoing low profile on the subject ) .
If Obama wins a second term , we will have eight years of an administration filled with people who believe that the fate of millions , possibly human civilization itself , rests on their ability to tackle this problem .
They ’re not going to view the passage of a compromised cap - and - trade bill as the end of their responsibility .
They ’ll use their eight years to make sure the long - term emission - reduction framework put in place by Waxman - Markey is part of our national DNA .
They ’ll keep pushing China .
They ’ll use executive branch tools ( including , but not only , the EPA ) .
They ’ll drive research and deployment .
In eight years , the quest for a clean energy revolution will not be a subject for partisan dispute but a simple fact , a shared national mission , and part of every business ’s long - term planning .
Some other reasons for hope :
• Oil prices threaten the economic recovery , as Ryan Avent keeps warning .
Coal is getting more expensive , and several coal utilities are applying for rate increases .
Gas prices are going to fluctuate ( generally on the way up ) .
In short , fossil fuels are not going to become less of an economic pain in the ass .
Their corrosive effects on the economy and public health seem likely to become steadily more apparent .
Once consumers are familiar with alternative sources that offer stable , effectively free ( after the initial capital investment ) power , they ’re going to start demanding them .
• Cleantech is cool .
This is from Joshua Green ’s excellent piece on clean energy in The Atlantic :
Shortly after the inauguration , a friend up for several jobs in the new administration confessed that he yearned to wind up at the Department of Energy .
“ It ’s like NASA in the ’60s , ” he told me .
“ All the best and brightest want to be there . ”
Obama ’s choice of Steven Chu , the Nobel laureate physicist , as secretary of energy only heightened the allure .
In the early Obama era , romantic notions about making one ’s mark on history tend to take the form of helping recast America ’s economy , and by extension the world ’s , in a way that will head off global catastrophe .
And this :
“ Think of the smartest guy you ’ve ever met and then imagine 50,000 more just like him innovating all at once , ” Mike Danaher , a partner and cleantech specialist at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati , told me .
“ Just as they did with telecom in the ’90s , they ’re attacking every component of every kind of alternative energy to improve it . ”
Cleantech ’s allure can partly be captured via numbers — the amount of VC investment , the amount of stimulus money — but it goes beyond that .
It ’s about nerd chic .
Figuring out energy is what all the hot - shit brainiacs coming out of Ivy League schools want to do these days .
There ’s just an amazing amount of brainpower being devoted to these problems , more every day .
I predict the pace of innovation is going to outstrip even the most optimistic projections .
The clean - energy mammals will overwhelm the dirty - energy dinosaurs sooner than we think .
• The need for a real economy .
One thing you frequently hear about the bubble - busts of the last 20 years is that there was too much capital chasing too few real investments .
We need a new source of economic growth to absorb that capital .
And there ’s a felt need today for Americans to start making stuff again — inventing , manufacturing , and exporting things of real value .
What can we make ?
What ’s the new source of growth ?
Here ’s how economist James K. Galbraith put it :
Finally , there is the big problem : … How to build the productive economy for the next generation ? …
Today the largest problems we face are energy security and climate change — massive issues because energy underpins everything we do , and because climate change threatens the survival of civilization .
And here , obviously , we need a comprehensive national effort .
Such a thing , if done right , combining planning and markets , could add 5 or even 10 percent of GDP to net investment .
That ’s not the scale of wartime mobilization .
But it probably could return the country to full employment and keep it there , for years .
Moreover , the work does resemble wartime mobilization in important financial respects .
Weatherization , conservation , mass transit , renewable power , and the smart grid are public investments .
As with the armaments in World War II , work on them would generate incomes not matched by the new production of consumer goods .
If handled carefully — say , with a new program of deferred claims to future purchasing power like war bonds — the incomes earned by dealing with oil security and climate change have the potential to become a foundation of restored financial wealth for the middle class .
This basic view , albeit toned down , is mirrored in Joe Biden ’s Middle Class Task Force , which is pushing hard on clean energy as a source of restored middle class prosperity .
All of which is to say : the structural position of the U.S. economy more or less requires a push toward clean energy .
You ca n’t build an economy on moving fake money around forever .
If you want large and expanding markets , there are n’t that many places to go .
• States and cities wo n’t stop .
Waxman - Markey may set national standards at relatively weak levels , but plenty of states have tougher renewable electricity standards .
A few are experimenting with feed - in tariffs ( see here and here ) and producing extraordinary results .
You ca n’t throw a rock without hitting a mayor who wants to revitalize his or her city by establishing a reputation as green ( see Grist ’s list of 15 green mayors ) .
The federal debate is warped by the outsized influence of carbon - intensive states and industries ( magnified both by corporate contributions and by the frakked - up structure of U.S. constitutional government ) .
But at the subnational level , there is a swarm of political leaders without the same constraints .
Eventually , their success — not only environmental success but subsequent economic and political success — will alter the political calculus even in the most recalcitrant states .
Whether or not the trend is accelerated by Waxman - Markey , wealth is already transferring from middle states to the coasts , because the East and West coasts are where the action and innovation are .
• We are on the cusp of an extended progressive era .
This is the one I ’m least confident about , so I ’m putting it last .
But in my optimistic moments , I agree with the politics editor at The Nation , Chris Hayes :
Look at how far we ’ve come in the last four years .
We have a black president who ran on the most ambitiously progressive domestic agenda in a generation .
Look at the political perspectives of the youngest voters , the most progressive cohort since the dawn of polling on almost every issue .
White , male , Christians are the demographic roadblock .
And the country is getting less white and less Christian .
The macro forces are moving in our direction .
What makes you lose hope is the hand - to - hand combat happening on Capitol Hill .
Progressives have a unique lack of self - confidence where we feel like we are just going to get this one little chance , but I think the force of history is on our side .
I believe that with every last fiber of my being .
I ca n’t say I believe that with my every fiber .
Maybe 60 to 70 percent of my fibers .
But sometimes , when I squint just right , I see a future blooming with cultural and technological ferment , a tidal change on the way that will be helped by a strong federal climate bill but will not be stopped by a weak one .
As fewer and fewer newspapers commit enough resources , time and manpower to produce in - depth investigative reports , many citizen media enthusiasts seem to suggest that citizen journalists can step in to fill the gap .
Do citizen journalists hold the key to the future of in - depth investigative journalism ?
Perhaps .
From time to time we will be highlighting blogs from the Sub - Saharan Africa that are focused on investigative reports .
We are starting with Kumekucha , which is arguably one of the most controversial blogs in East Africa .
It is known for publishing controversial investigative reports and biting political commentary on Kenya .
Kumekucha is a very popular blog judging by the number of comments left on its posts .
It is difficult to verify the truth of information published on the blog .
Recently , another Kenyan blog , KenMedia Watch , pointed out that the minister named by Kumekucha as the one who receveid a visa ban from the United States was not correct .
Kumekucha reported that it was the Agriculture Minister , William Ruto .
The US ambassador to Kenya revealed that it was Joshua Kulei ( ex - Moi aide ) .
This is what Kumekucha revealed before the identity of visa ban minister was made public :
Kumekucha can confirm today that the cabinet minister who received a visa ban from the Americans earlier this week is agriculture minister , William Ruto .
For Kenyans still thinking in terms of ODM and PNU , this clearly underlines the fact that corruption has no party or tribal boundaries , the cancer eats into our society right across the board .
My information tells me that the minister is “ very upset ” over the news more so because there are indications that his family members and business associates will also be affected .
After the US ambassador to Kenya revealed that it was Joshua Kulei , KenMedia Watch had this to say :
Now that US Ambassador Michael Ranneberger — in an anti-climactic moment , and violating the usual protocol — has revealed the identity of the man the US recently banned from entering its shores ( ex - Moi aide Joshua Kulei ) , should we now expect a series of apologies from those rumourmongers who maliciously fingered Ruto as the banned official ?
That would be naive .
I ’m no fan of Ruto , but would n't you
Kumekucha explains the error in their reporting :
It ’s Ruto… No It ’s Kulei .
Oops Or Is It Ruto ?
It has never happened before and I was totally shocked .
Usually this informant gives me A1 information in terms of reliability .
In fact the problem with most of the info they give me is that it is too hot to use ( sometimes even in my raw notes ) .
But this time round they came back a few days after telling me Ruto was the Visa ban minister to tell me that it was NOT Ruto after all .
The name they gave me confused me .
The US envoy had said that the banned person was a senior member of government .
The last time I checked Joshua Kulei was NOT a member of the Kibaki administration .
My source however assured me that Ruto was next on the dreaded list and as a matter of fact it is highly unlikely that he could ever be granted a visa incase he wants to travel to the United States .
So I made a decision to keep quiet until something happens .
Well it happened last night when the Americans told us that the banned person they were referring to was in fact Kulei .
Now this is really fascinating stuff because Mr Kulei is a very major investor in the American economy .
In fact his entire family is currently based in the United States and his main business operations are in New York ( a place where many wealthy Americans cannot afford to operate from ) .
Kumekucha has a newsletter , which carries stories that are too sensitive to publish on the blog and also has a twitter account :

Let 's look at some investigative reports that have appeared on the blog :
Moi family problems in securing wealth :
The family lawyer advised the Moi's to keep as much of their wealth and assets as they possibly could overseas .
The lawyer pointed out that legally no court order or ruling had been issued declaring the Moi wealth as having been acquired through corrupt or illegal means , which would be required by the government to freeze those assets and bank accounts abroad .
They were also advised to use trusts that were experienced in hiding controversial assets on behalf of high profile clients .
However the meeting did not end well .
It emerged that Joshua Kulei's own estimates of the amount he held in trust for the Moi family and which he was now required to surrender and estimates of the same by Moi 's sons did not tally .
The tension got so high that death threats are believed to have been issued against Kulei .
Matters got worse at a meeting later held at Philip 's house to try and resolve the misunderstanding over the issue and Kulei made the unfortunate decision to go outside the Moi family to seek for help .
It is highly likely that this is the move that caused details of the meeting to leak to those who were not involved .
Kulei consulted Mr Tum of the Kenya Seed Company to talk to the former president on his behalf .
He told Tum that the crux of the problem was that the president 's sons had failed to make any distinction between his ( Kulei's ) private wealth and that held by the president in trust .
A significant chunk of the Moi assets and fortune in general is now in Namibia where it is under the protection of the former president 's good friend and president of that country Sam Nujoma .
It is believed that Gideon Moi may transfer ( if he has not dome so already ) a lot of the family wealth from South Africa to Namibia where the family feel more comfortable and secure to keep their treasure chest .
Gideons trip with his father to banks [ Gideons is the son of Kenya 's former President , Daniel Arap Moi ] :
A fight that took place at a popular entertainment spot in Nairobi between Gideon Moi and the family lawyer Dr Kiplagat , emphasizes this .
Evidence seems to suggest that the fight was instigated by the sale of US $ 650,000 property in South Africa which Dr Kiplagat facilitated in behalf of the younger Moi .
After the sale was complete the lawyer did not hand over the proceeds from the sale but instead prepared an invoice for $ US 1.5 million for various legal services rendered to Gideon over a lengthy period of time that was still outstanding .
He then issued a credit note for US $ 650,000 and demanded that the balance owed to him be paid .
Gideon was furious .
Interestingly this appears to be a contradiction of his own well - voiced principals .
The same Kroll report talks about a frequent boast Gideon makes to the effect that any deals worth less than US$ 1 million is not worth his while .
Since December 2003 , Gideon has been trying to get the money from the sale of the South African property from Kiplagat , but with no success .
On several occasions he sent Chepkonga to demand the cash on his behalf from the lawyer .
So when Chepkonga saw the lawyers car parked outside Fairview Hotel , he immeditaley called Gideon who quickly arrived and headed straight to the table where Dr Kiplagat was seated .
A fierce argument ensued with Gideon making his usual threats .
Eyewitnesses said that what triggered the fight was the point where Kiplagat told Gideon ; “ … your father is no longer the president of this country and the days you used to order people around are long gone . ”
To add insult to injury he then ordered Gideon to move to another table .
That is when fists and kicks started flying as baffled onlookers watched and other hurried to separate the two men .
Assassinations seasons now here with us :
For months now controversial Kumekucha blogger Phil has been warning of coming assassinations in Kenya ’s political landscape .
I too have warned in several posts that we are entering an extremely dangerous phase of our politics where we should expect politically motivated assassinations on an unprecedented scale .
I called them some of the painful birth pangs for the new Kenya that is coming .
The kind of Kenya we all dream of .
I have some information that is so sensitive that it cannot be shared here which makes it clear that there is nothing but plenty of trouble ahead .
I really wish there was a way to stop these crazy guys .
But let me back up a little here and discuss the special circumstances in our politics that has brought us to where we are now .
How Kibaki and Michuki plotted the raid at the Standard Group :
The motive behind the March 2 , 2006 , police raid at the Standard Group offices has remained top secret to date .
However Kumekucha today unveils the secrets behind the raid based on interviews from two of President Kibaki ’s aides privy to the “ Government operation . ”
In February 2006 , President Kibaki chaired a meeting at State House , Nairobi , which was attended by the then Minister for Internal Security , Mr John Michuki , Mr Stanley Murage , Head of Civil Service Francis Muthaura , NSIS Director General Michael Gichangi , the then CID Director Joseph Kamau , among other State House operatives .
Despite the gravity of the matter under discussion , the Commissioner of police , Maj Gen Mohamed Ali , was not invited .
This was purely a Nyumba ya Mumbi affair .
The House of Mumbi had been rattled .
There was tension and anger in the room .
The NSIS chief tabled two pieces of paper which he told the meeting had two explosive stories the Standard Group was planning to publish .
This blogger has seen and read the two “ articles ” the Standard was alleged to be planning to publish .
The first “ article ” was about how Kibaki , when he was the DP chairman and was vying for presidency in 1997 , allegedly travelled to Southern Sudan to meet with Al Qaeda founder and world ’s Number One terrorist Osama bin Laden to solicit funds for his presidential campaign .
In the second “ article ” , the author was discussing Kibaki ’s failing health in January and February 2003 , shortly after he was sworn in as president .
The “ article ” even quoted Raila Odinga saying there was going to be a snap election within the year ( implying Kibaki was dying / would be dead to warrant a snap election ) .
Inside story behind strange killing at Sarit Centre :
A couple of weeks ago a man walked up to an ATM machine at Sarit Centre did his business and emerged .
Seconds later another man stepped forward and shot him at point blank range .
It was clear from the way he was shot that the idea was to make sure he died .
What followed was puzzling .
A section of the media reported the incident and even added the critical bit of information that the man had some information on police extra-judicial killings .
Then suddenly the story vanished and nobody seemed to follow up what would appear to be a very big story .
Today I reveal the inside details behind the killing and exactly what happened .
The name of the deceased was Constable Kirinya and he was a driver at the Eagle Squad – a sister squad of Kwekwe which it has been whispered have been given express orders “ from above ” to execute anyone they IMAGINE is linked or sympathetic to Mungiki .
Constable Kirinya and his team arrested a notorious drug baron from Mombasa , who had Sh4m in cash and drugs of an unknown value .
It happened that the drug baron was known to some senior cops – two of them being Nairobi Provincial Police Officer , Njue Njagi , and his deputy , Julius Ndegwa .
Insiders say Njue and Ndegwa called for the suspect and shared the loot .
Eagle Squad officers who had arrested the drug baron were given Sh200,000 each .
The cops who were tracking him down got wind he was in Nairobi and they trailed him to Sarit Centre where they shot him dead and made the scene of crime to look like he was killed by thugs .
The house in Nairobi that would make the Nyayo House torture chamber look like a kindergarten :
Recently a company by the name of Kingsway Tyres has burst into the limelight .
This firm has been mentioned adversely in the ongoing Charterhouse Bank controversy .
Actually the company is situated in a building that occupies a large chunk of both University Way and Muindi Mbingu street in Nairobi , with one side of the building facing the University of Nairobi .
If buildings could speak , then this particular building would have plenty to say from its ’ rather notorious history .
Especially the side that houses offices which are accessed through a small door that is easy to miss along Muindi Mbingu street .
This building once housed the notorious dreaded Special Branch and what has happened here in the past would make the Nyayo House torture chamber look like a kindergarten .
It is said that this is the building where the late JM Kariuki was tortured and interrogated , even shot , before being killed and dumped at Ngong Forest .
That was sometime in early March 1975 .
It is also believed to be the building where the assassination plot that took the life of one of Kenya 's most illustrious politicians , Tom Mboya was planned .
A prominent reader of this blog recently passed on this information to this blogger and brief initial inquires and research seem to support this amazing allegation .
In later years this building came to house Kenya Times , the Kanu daily paper and I personally visited this building many times over the years .
Samples of political analyses that have appeared on Kumekucha :
Smiling Wako ( Amos Wako is Kenya's Attorney General ) :
He is the wearer of that poisonous smile .
Wait a minute , his must be a case of mistaking short lips and long teeth for a permanent grin .
Amos Wako is one lawyer who epitomizes everything rotten about Kenya .
Wako is the singular face that captures everything wrong with Kenya .
He waxes lyrical and legalistic all loaded with no sensitivity nor relevance to the Kenyan people .
And the gatekeepers know him better in partnering with him to defraud us more drawing from his vast expertise in LEGAL FLEECING .
On Obama :
Then there is Obama .
The man is not coming to Kenya .
I 've heard many people castigate Kibaki and Odinga , folks saying that our nation is in turmoil so Obama could n't visit .
Crap .
Here is what I say …if he is the kind of a guy who would only visit us because everything was okay , let him stay the hell away .
Like his nation that is grappling with racism , classism and periodically the madness of the Bush type , our nation will have issues it grapples with from time to time .
Does it mean when we face those issues we should be shunned ?
I feel that Barack Obama , by shunning Kenya , has missed a golden opportunity to stand in the middle of Nairobi and proclaim his wishes for Kenya right in the face of Kibaki and Odinga .
It would have been a powerful symbol that this son of Kogelo would come here and make it known that he is solidly for reforms .
To send some dude called Johnny Carson … and an ambassador who is partly responsoble for the mess we are in makes me sick to my stomach .
And may Obama be told that we will have no use for him should he come here after his presidency is over .

Britain up slightly to 35th position , US up six places to 83rd while Iraq sits at the bottom of the list
On top of the many humiliations that have rained down on Iceland recently – the implosion of its economy , banks and currency to name just three – the erstwhile Viking tiger today lost its title as the safest place in the world .
New Zealand is now officially your best bet for a risk - free destination , according to the new Global Peace Index ( GPI ) , an annual ranking of the world 's nations on the basis of how peaceful they are .
Despite the much - vaunted progress on security , Iraq remained bottom of the list , below Afghanistan , Somalia and Israel , which found itself listed as more dangerous than Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
At the top , the usual Nordic suspects clustered below New Zealand : Denmark , Norway and Iceland came second , third and fourth , followed by Austria and then Sweden .
Britain was 35th : better than last year , and one position higher than Italy , but still below most of Europe and countries as diverse as Botswana , South Korea , Malaysia and Qatar .
The United States has clawed its way up six places to 83rd – still weighed down by two foreign wars , a high prison population and the general availability of guns .
Its slight rise was attributed to the number of years since 9/11 that the country has avoided a terrorist attack , and the relative decline of other countries .
The index was collated by the Economist Intelligence Unit for a new thinktank called the Institute for Economics and Peace .
It uses a weighted mix of 23 criteria , including foreign wars , internal conflicts , respect for human rights , the number of murders , the number of people in jail , the arms trade , and degrees of democracy .
This year 's results found the economic downturn had made the world a little less peaceful .
That , say the authors , " appears to reflect the intensification of violent conflict in some countries and the effects of both the rapidly rising food and fuel prices early in 2008 and the dramatic global economic downturn in the final quarter of the year .
" Rapidly rising unemployment , pay freezes and falls in the value of house prices , savings and pensions is causing popular resentment in many countries , with political repercussions that have been registered by the GPI through various indicators measuring safety and security in society . "
The results come from a groundbreaking study , released alongside the 2009 GPI , which estimates the economic impact of lost peace on the global economy at $ 7.2tn ( £ 4.4tn ) a year .
Of this , $ 4.8tn is made up of business activities that never see the light of day because of violence ; a further $ 2.4tn relates to the redeployment of resources and expenditure away from industries benefiting from violence to those that benefit from peace .
" The reality is that the net economic benefit of peace to humanity is substantial , and governments and businesses should seriously consider how adopting practices and policies that promote peace helps their bottom line , " said Clyde ­McConaghy , who oversees the index at the institute .
" It is this kind of thinking that the Institute for Economics and Peace will promote . "
RIVERSIDE , Calif .  A California man was sentenced to death on Friday for setting a hillside inferno in 2006 that killed five United States Forest Service firefighters .
The penalty had been recommended by the jury that convicted the man , Raymond L. Oyler , 38 , of murder and arson in March .
In imposing the sentence , Judge W. Charles Morgan of Superior Court in Riverside County said Mr. Oyler had “ set on a mission  why ?
no one knows  to create havoc in this county by setting fires of his own design , for his own purpose . ”
Judge Morgan added , “ He knew young men and young women would put their lives on the line to protect property and people . ”
Mr. Oyler remained silent and stared straight ahead as the judge announced the sentence .
Under California law , the sentence will be automatically appealed , said Mr. Oyler ’s lawyer , Mark McDonald .
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Fla . 
Seven astronauts blasted off for one last dance with the Hubble Space Telescope on Monday .
The space shuttle Atlantis , commanded by Scott D. Altman , bolted through the sky on a pillar of smoke and fire just after 2 p.m. Monday .
Atlantis is carrying 22,000 pounds of custom - designed tools , replacement parts and new instruments to slice and dice starlight as well as the hearts of scientists and stargazers everywhere .
It is rushing toward a Wednesday rendezvous with the telescope , which happened to be floating about 350 miles directly above Cape Canaveral at launching time .
If all goes well , in five spacewalks starting Thursday morning , the crew members will revamp and refresh the telescope , which has dazzled the public and the science community with its iconic cosmic postcards .
Then they will say goodbye on behalf of humanity forever .
Sometime in the middle of the next decade , the Hubble will run out of juice , and it will eventually be crashed into the ocean .
Besides Commander Altman , the crew includes Gregory C. Johnson , as pilot , and John M. Grunsfeld , Michael J. Massimino , Michael T. Good , Andrew J. Fuestel and K. Megan McArthur , as mission specialists .
Defending what Paul Krugman Wrote By Arnold Kling
In 2002 , he passed along a joke that the economy needed a housing bubble .
Krugman is controversial , so the post generated comments on this blog and elsewhere , some of which are overly “ gotcha ” in character .
Some points I would make :
1. Krugman was mainly expressing pessimism .
He was not cheerfully advocating a housing bubble , but instead he was glumly saying that the only way he could see to get out of the recession would be for such a bubble to occur .
2 . In the event , we had a housing bubble and we got out of the recession .
To me , this raises the question of whether a distorted recovery is better than an undistorted recession .
That question might be asked in the context of fiscal stimulus as well –at what point do the distortions of the stimulus outweigh getting out of a recession ?
3 . I personally do not think that Greenspan caused the housing bubble .
I do not believe that monetary policy and short - term interest rates are as all - powerful as many economists do .
What I was writing in August of 2002 was this .
4. Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong thought that Greenspan kept rates too high in 2002 .
This makes them poorly positioned to criticize Greenspan now for keeping rates too low .
I am pretty sure that Brad is guilty of this hypocrisy .
I believe that Paul is not .
[ UPDATE : Brad denies committing this hypocrisy , and he is right .
He has stood by his views that interest rates in 2001 and 2002 were , if anything , too high .
I stand corrected . ]
5 . The main reason I put Paul ’s quote on my blog was because I am compiling a history of the events that caused financial crisis .
I have a paragraph that says :
the current crisis led to a sharp recession that could not be mitigated with monetary expansion .
This suggests that in hindsight more should have been done to prevent the housing bubble from expanding as much as it did .
This in turn suggests that the monetary easing that took place from 2001 - 2003 was excessive .
However , at the time , the sluggish growth in employment ( the 2001 - 2003 period was commonly referred to as a “ jobless recovery ” ) was thought to justify the monetary expansion and low levels of interest rates .
The Krugman quote can help to support that paragraph .
I can pick other quotes , obviously , but the one about needing a housing bubble is particularly poignant .
The hot topic this week in Boston will surely be what to do about the crowded Red Sox rotation when John Smoltz comes off the disabled list , but simmering below the surface is the ongoing question of whether Clay Buchholz deserves a spot as well .
The 24 - year - old Buchholz has been mowing down Triple A hitters , sporting a 4 - 0 record and 1.74 ERA in 11 starts with the PawSox .
Yet in all the talk about imminent decisions that must be made regarding the Red Sox pitching staff , his name is not really in the conversation , a fact that is n’t lost on Buchholz .

“ There ’s nowhere to go , it ’s sort of a logjam up there and they ’re doing what they feel is right up there for the team to win , ” Buchholz told NECN ’s Mike Giardi over the weekend ( video at left ) .
“ Whenever they come to a problem they seem like they find a way to fix it without me being in the picture .
It is what it is .
It ’s frustrating at times but I ’m going out every fifth day here , trying to help this team win and trying to get better every day I go out . ”
Buchholz , whose start with the PawSox was rained out last night and likely pushed to Wednesday , did not demand a trade by any stretch .
But he did indicate he would be open to one if it meant an opportunity to pitch in the big leagues .
“ All the way up through the system in the minor leagues there was n’t really that big of a hill that I had to climb … it was n’t until I got to the big leagues was when I faced [ adversity ] , ” Buchholz told Giardi .
“ I feel like I ’m more equipped with everything that I have right now as far as the pitches and the mental aspect and physically healthy to be up there and helping that team .
If not that team I want to be in the big leagues and I do want to go somewhere where I ’ll be able to play and pitch every fifth day . ”

It ’s worth noting that righthanders ( albeit Triple A righthanders ) are hitting a paltry .111 against Buchholz .
Major league righties are hitting .419 against struggling Red Sox starter Daisuke Matsuzaka this season .
The 22 - year - old Michael Bowden ( 3 - 3 , 2.48 ERA ) is another member of the PawSox rotation who could be pitching in the big leagues were he with another organization , but he seems perfectly content , at least for now , waiting for his opportunity with the Red Sox .
“ It ’s out of my control , and if I ca n’t control it why worry about it ? ” Bowden told Giardi ( video at left ) when asked about his name coming up in trade rumors .
“ If it happens it happens I understand it ’s a business and there will be opportunities elsewhere .
But I love this organization and would hate to leave … ”
I ’d rather stay in the minors an extra year or so to play for Boston , to play in Boston at Fenway with that group of guys . ”
For the past five years , Ernie DiGiacomo has been able to count on parents to guarantee the $ 1,500 to $ 2,500 rents he charges for the 15 apartments he owns in Williamsburg , Brooklyn .
When he called renters who had missed payments , he often heard , “ My parents will send you a check . ”
But in the past six months , the parents are pulling back financial help , he said , and as a result , he has watched more renters move out .
“ Most of them are moving back with parents , ” Mr. DiGiacomo said .
Luis Illades , an owner of the Urban Rustic Market and Cafe on North 12th Street , said he had seen a steady number of applicants , in their late 20s , who had never held paid jobs :
They were interns at a modeling agency , for example , or worked at a college radio station .
In some cases , applicants have stormed out of the market after hearing the job requirements .
“ They say , ‘ You want me to work eight hours ? ’ ” Mr. Illades said .
“ There is a bubble bursting . ”
Famed for its concentration of heavily subsidized 20 - something residents  also nicknamed trust - funders or trustafarians 
Williamsburg is showing signs of trouble .
Parents whose money helped fuel one of the city ’s most radical gentrifications in recent years have stopped buying their children new luxury condos , subsidizing rents and providing cash to spend at Bedford Avenue ’s boutiques and coffee houses .
From OpenBIOS
This page tells how to build the x86 version of Open Firmware to boot under a conventional BIOS .
These instructions specifically describe a configuration that is good for running on the QEMU and VirtualBox emulators , but very similar instructions can be used to make a version that runs on any PC .
In this version , OFW is stored on a floppy disk image .
The conventional BIOS boots it as if it were an operating system like DOS or Windows .
OFW then " takes over " the machine , ignoring the conventional BIOS that booted it .
That BIOS has already done the work of early - startup machine initialization - turning on the memory controller and configuring chipset - dependent registers .
In addition to this BIOS - loaded version , there are two other ways to run OFW under QEMU :
You can build an OFW image that replaces the QEMU BIOS ROM image , entirely from code in the OFW tree - see Building OFW for QEMU .
You can build an OFW image that replaces the QEMU BIOS ROM image , using OFW as a " payload " for Coreboot , so Coreboot does the early - startup stuff - see OFW as a Coreboot Payload .
Software Requirements
qemu-0.9.1 or VirtualBox
Open Firmware rev. >= 1053
GCC and GNU make - most versions work for builing OFW
Getting Open Firmware Source
$ svn co svn://openfirmware.info/openfirmware
Building OFW
$ cd cpu/x86/pc/biosload / $ cp config-virtualbox.fth config.fth $ cd build $ make floppyofw.img
The " config-virtualbox.fth " configuration is known to work with QEMU .
Other configurations may work also - but the " qemu- loaded " config option is n't what you want for this technique , because it 's a subcase of the CoreBoot - payload configuration .
You will use the " floppyofw.img " output file in a later step .
Making a bootable Floppy Image
$ ../../../ Linux / forth fw.dic ../makefloppy.fth
This creates a file that is a bootable floppy image with an empty FAT12 filesystem .
This step only has to be done once .
Copying OFW onto the Floppy Image
$ mkdir flp $ sudo mount -t msdos -o loop floppy.img flp $ sudo cp floppyofw.img flp /ofw.img $ sudo umount flp
Copy floppy.img to the QEMU or VirtualBox directory .
Booting OFW from QEMU
$ qemu - L < dir > - boot a - fda floppy.img
" < dir > " is the directory that contains QEMU 's BIOS and VGA BIOS files .
Booting OFW from VirtualBox
The following VirtualBox configuration settings work for me :
OS Type = Other / Unknown Base Memory = 64 MB Video Memory = 8 MB Boot Order = Floppy , Hard Disk ACPI = Disabled IO APIC = Disabled VT-x / AMD - V = Disabled PAE /NX = Disabled Floppy Image = floppy.img Network Adapter 1 = PCnet - PCI
II ( host interface , < tap name > ) ( other settings are mostly irrelevant )
Recompiling
If you want to make changes and recompile OFW , you need not repeat the " makefloppy " step ; you can just loopback mount the floppy image and copy the new OFW version to ofw.img .
What is on the Floppy Image
The floppy image is a bootable floppy with a FAT12 filesystem .
Its first two sectors contain a simple bootloader program that uses BIOS INT 13 callbacks to read floppy sectors .
The program scans the FAT root directory entries to find the file " ofw.img " , then loads that into memory and jumps to it .
When you build floppyofw.img , as a side effect it also builds bootsec.img , which is that simple bootloader .
The source code ( Forth - style assembly language ) is in biosload / bootsec.fth .
The " makefloppy.fth " program that creates the image is pretty simple ; it copies bootsec.img to the output file " floppy.img " , creates a couple of initially empty FAT tables , zeros the root directory area , and fills the data area with zeros .
Making a Prototype Floppy Image with Linux Commands
Here 's a pair of Linux commands that accomplish the same thing as makefloppy .
fth :
Step6a $ /sbin/mkdosfs -C -f 2 -F 12 - R 2 -r 224 -s 1 -S 512 floppy.img 1440 Step6 b $ dd < bootsec.img of=floppy.img conv=nocreat , notrunc
The arguments to mkdosfs force the filesystem layout to match the layout that is specified in the BIOS parameter block in bootsec.img .
The advantage of makefloppy .
fth is that it reads the filesystem layout parameters from the BPB in bootsec.img , so its guaranteed to be consistent .
If bootsec. fth were edited to change the layout , the arguments to " mkdosfs " would have to change .
( But there 's little need to change that layout , since it 's a standard floppy size . )
The advantage of the Linux command sequence is that it creates a file with " holes " , thus saving disk space for awhile ( until something fills in the holes ) .
Booting on a Real PC from a USB Key
To build for a real PC :
$ cd openfirmware / cpu/x86/ biosload $ cp config-usbkey .fth config.fth $ cd build $ make
That will create a file named " ofw.c32 " that can be booted from a USB key that has " syslinux " installed on it .
http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic=21902
has some tips on how to install syslinux .
Your syslinux.cfg file needs a line that says :
kernel ofw.c32
Booting on a Real PC via GRUB or Etherboot
You can make a version in " Multiboot " format that you can boot with GRUB :
$ cd openfirmware / cpu/x86 / biosload $ cp config - grub . fth config.fth $ cd build $ make
The output file is " ofwgrub.elf " .
Copy that in to / boot on your GRUB - enabled disk and add this to / boot / grub / menu.lst :
title Open Firmware kernel / boot / ofwgrub.elf
That version can also be booted via Etherboot .
Here 's an example of how to Etherboot it with QEMU ( assuming that the ofwgrub.elf file is in /tmp on the host machine ) :
qemu - L . - boot n - tftp /tmp - bootp /ofwgrub.elf

Britain faces a " ticking timebomb " of mental illness and suicide among young Army veterans who return from hand - to - hand combat in Afghanistan , the Conservatives will warn today .
A lack of mental health care for veterans , combined with the stress of fighting the Taliban , will mean many survivors of the conflict pay a heavy price in psychological problems and self harm , according to David Cameron and the shadow Defence Secretary Liam Fox .
As the bodies of eight soldiers – including three teenagers – killed in a bloody 24 hours in Helmand were repatriated yesterday , mental health experts joined the politicians in warning that not enough was being done to care for returning members of the armed forces .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Research suggests that veterans aged 18 to 23 are up to three times more likely to commit suicide than their civilian counterparts .
Setting out plans today to boost mental health care for returning troops , Mr Fox and Mr Cameron will argue that more veterans of the Falklands campaign and the first Gulf War killed themselves after quitting the forces than died in action .
An estimated 264 Falklands veterans have committed suicide since the conflict ended , compared with 255 soldiers killed in action , according to an ex-servicemen 's organisation .
Twenty - four British soldiers died during the 1991 Gulf War , but the Ministry of Defence disclosed last year that 169 veterans of the conflict had died from " intentional self - harm " or in circumstances that led to open verdicts at inquests .
Mr Fox told The Independent : " The suicide figures for past conflicts are deeply concerning .
I worry that with the intensity of current operations in Afghanistan we are building up a timebomb of mental health problems . "
David Hill , director of operations for the charity Combat Stress , said it took an average of 14 years for veterans to ask for help with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Many suffered in silence – often harbouring suicidal thoughts – because they were reluctant to admit to their vulnerability .
Mr Hill said : " Servicemen and women are exposed to stresses that most people wo n't be exposed to in their lives .
In Afghanistan , they are exposed to them quite early in their careers .
There is a general lack of understanding about how intense these stresses can be . "
A study by Manchester University this year found that ex-servicemen under 24 were between two and three times more likely to kill themselves than men of the same age from outside the forces .

Researchers suggested three possible reasons : that they were already more vulnerable to suicide before joining up ; that they had trouble re-adapting to civilian life ; or that they were affected by " exposure to adverse experiences " .
Professor Nav Kapur , one of the report 's authors , warned : " Young men leaving the armed forces appear to be at a higher risk .
That needs to be recognised and action taken . "
Kevan Jones , the Veterans minister , said : " We have made great progress both in the treatment of mental health problems and in reducing the stigma associated with seeking help .
I 'm working with the NHS to make sure GPs are telling veterans about the support available , such as the six community mental health schemes we have set up specifically tailored for veterans . "
The Cabinet discussed the growing bloodshed in Afghanistan as the political controversy over the Government 's tactics intensified .
Fifteen UK soldiers were killed in a 10 - day spell last week , bringing the number of deaths since 2001 to 184 .
Downing Street insisted yesterday that the Army was " making progress " in its attacks on Taliban positions in Helmand , but acknowledged British troops were facing a " critical period " .
A spokesman for Gordon Brown said : " The clear view coming out of Cabinet was that we do have the right approach in Afghanistan . "
He denied Mr Brown had chosen the cheapest option for reinforcing the British forces by sending 700 extra troops rather than the 2,000 requested by military chiefs .
The head of the British Army disclosed yesterday that the military will review strategy in the light of the recent surge in deaths .
General Sir Richard Dannatt said : " We have got to think through the way we operate , the resources we have got , the numbers ... to make sure we have given ourselves the absolute best chance of succeeding . "
Senior officers will analyse details from the latest combat in Helmand to ascertain what lessons can be learned .
In particular they will examine how the Taliban are honing their use of roadside bombs and mines .
Stressing that withdrawal was not an option , General Dannatt said : " This mission is really important .
If we were to pull out unilaterally , just come out of the mission ... frankly , the consequences will be catastrophic . "
Meanwhile 140 extra troops from the 2nd Battalion Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , currently based in Cyprus , are being deployed to Afghanistan to assist with the offensive against the Taliban in Helmand , codenamed Operation Panther 's Claw .
What are the other members of Nato doing to help us ?
Q . Why have there been such levels of recrimination over British troop numbers in Afghanistan ?
What is the situation now ?
A . The UK deployment of about 4,000 troops to Afghanistan in 2006 took place against the background of a major commitment in Iraq .
Commanders were concerned about " overstretch " and fighting on two fronts .
Since then , the force in Afghanistan has reached 9,100 troops .
When the UK began withdrawing from southern Iraq , the US wanted some forces diverted to Afghanistan .
Senior British officers wanted 2,000 to 2,500 more troops sent to Helmand .
A troop shortage meant ground won from the Taliban could not be held and it was felt that with up to 22,000 US troops heading to the country 's south , including to Helmand , the British had to raise their numbers to maintain credibility .
Gordon Brown opted for the lowest commitment option : a temporary deployment of 700 for the Afghan elections .
The decision sparked controversy and will be reviewed after the autumn election .
It is expected the 700 will become permanent and an additional force sent .
Q. What has been the British strategy in Afghanistan since 2006 ?
A. John Reid , the then defence secretary , said he hoped the mission would end " without a shot being fired in anger " .
Since then , about six million rounds are thought to have been fired .
From the start of the mission , UK policy seemed confused and drifting .
The official mission statement was that troops would help bring governance to a traditionally lawless part of the country and assist in poppy eradication .
But they charged off to outlying areas and set up platoon houses , in effect inviting Taliban attacks .
The operation ran counter to a plan by General ( now Sir ) David Richards , the British commander of Nato forces , which called for secure areas to be set up around larger towns , where reconstruction could begin .
Instead , swaths of Helmand turned into battlefields , and there was little development .
Q. Gordon Brown has asked for more Afghan government troops to be based in Helmand .
Why ?
And how effective will this be ?
A. Nato 's aim is for Afghans to provide their own security but it will be a while before they can .
Mr Brown has said the Afghan forces should hold ground which British forces cannot , effectively acknowledging there are not enough British forces on the ground .
About 11 per cent of the 85,000 - strong Afghan army are in Helmand , which has seen almost half of recent fighting .
But much of the Afghan force is still training .
The plan is to expand the Afghan forces to 134,000 .
But even that number would seem unlikely to be able to meet a Taliban emergency which is recruiting international jihadists and is supported by elements in the Pakistani military and intelligence .
Iraq , with a similar population , has about 600,000 in its force .
Q. What about contributions from other Nato countries ?
A. No less than 42 countries contribute to the International Security Assistance Force .
But many contingents , including some from Nato countries , operate under caveats which restrict what they are allowed to do , rendering them virtually ineffective in combat scenarios .
The UK and US have demanded that other Western states should do more .
The Canadians have the worst fatality rate , losing 126 personnel from a force of 2,800 .
The British have lost 185 out of 9,000 and the Americans , 723 from 60,000 .
The deadliest attack was on a French unit last August ; 10 soldiers died in an engagement 40 miles from Kabul .

Google and the Evolution of Search I : Human Evaluators
The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as ‘ What shall I do tomorrow ? ’ and ‘ What job shall I take ?
’… We are very early in the total information we have within Google .
The algorithms [ software ] will get better and we will get better at personalization .
— Google CEO Eric Schmidt
For many years , Google ( GOOG ) , on its Explanation of Our Search Results page , claimed that “ a site ’s ranking in Google ’s search results is automatically determined by computer algorithms using thousands of factors to calculate a page ’s relevance to a given query . ”
Then in May of 2007 , that statement changed : “ A site ’s ranking in Google ’s search results relies heavily on computer algorithms using thousands of factors to calculate a page ’s relevance to a given query . ”
A slight adjustment in wording , but an important comment on the supremacy of the algorithm that Google had touted for years .
Google had finally acknowledged that its search results were no longer solely and automatically determined by the company ’s vaunted algorithms .
Now they simply “ relied heavily ” on them .
Why the sudden change ?
Google claims it was arbitrary , unrelated to any sudden philosophical shifts within the company .
But it seems far too specific an adjustment to chalk up to a random brand - management edit .
We are , after all , talking about the company ’s official explanation of its search results .
And indeed , sources say the language was changed to account for the continual calibration of the algorithm , which these days is done with a bit of human help .
Google , for example , employs a vast team of human search “ Quality Raters ” ( You ’ll find a copy of an old training manual here ) .
Spread out around the world , these evaluators , mostly college students , review search returns against established criteria–testing different algorithms and see which works “ best ” in predicting the quality of a site ( though not directly judging the quality of any individual site itself ) .
They ’re aided by Google ’s own registered users , who can now , when logged into their Google accounts , promote and delete sites from their own search returns according to their preferences .
These data too are used to tweak and further optimize the algorithm .
So Google ’s objective evaluation and ranking of Web sites is to some extent defined by subjective reasoning of a collective human intelligence .
And so it must be if Google is to continue returning search results that we perceive to be the “ best ” answers to our search queries .
In interviews serialized over the next three days , key Google engineers with central roles in managing the company ’s search engine discuss resources and techniques they use to optimize the system for users world - wide .
The series kicks off below with Engineering director Scott Huffman , who oversees the company ’s search evaluation team .
Senior Google software engineer Matt Cutts appears tomorrow .
And Google Fellow Amit Singhal wraps up the series on Friday .
Part I : Scott Huffman
John Paczkowski :
How do you maintain quality in search ranking ?
Scott Huffman :
We are constantly evaluating the quality of our results in something like a hundred different locales and language tiers all around the world .
So every day , we are looking at a random sample of grades that we think represent the queries we get from users .
Evaluators look at the quality of each result relative to those queries .
We are constantly tracking a pretty wide array of different kinds of quality signals that come through our text .
JP : Talk a bit more about the human element here .
You ’ve hired people to evaluate pages ?
SH : Yes , we have folks around the world who are trained to evaluate the quality of results .
We like them to be in - country so they understand the culture and that type of thing .
And then we have a work flow system that feeds them different kinds of evaluation tasks .
Things like “ tell us how good you think this result is for this query . ”
And then out of the data , we produce a set of aggregate metrics that we look at and that we can track over time .
JP : So how many of these evaluators are there ?
SH : How many ?
I do n’t think we can talk about the exact number , unfortunately .
JP : Ballpark ?
I ’ve heard 10,000 .
SH : Well , the number actually is pretty large and that ’s for a couple of reasons .
One is that , like I mentioned , we try to do an evaluation pretty broadly across all of the locales Google is in , and there are a lot of them .
So you ’re already talking about a pretty large group of people .
Secondly , we prefer a larger group to a narrow one because we want to use our evaluations to give us an independent picture of our quality .
We get a lot of queries from all over the world so we need a broad base of people to help us understand how good our results are for them .
JP : So are these raters college students or random folks responding to a job post ?
What are the requirements ?
SH : It ’s a pretty wide range of folks .
The job requirements are not super - specific .
Essentially , we require a basic level of education , mainly because we need them to be able to communicate back and forth with us , give us comments and things like that in writing .
JP : And how are they trained ?
SH : The training is pretty simple .
There are manuals and video training and , ultimately , participation in the rating program .
We help them understand what it means for search results to be highly relevant and useable for the viewer .
Is there a dominant result for a particular query today ?
If so , it should be right there at the top .
Take a broad - based query like …
“ Olympics . ”
If a user searches for “ Olympics , ” the results from the 1996 Olympics are not as interesting as the ones from the 2008 Olympics .
JP : So how do you vet data provided by the raters ?
Is there any quality control ?
SH : Well , the raters work in - country , so we do n’t see them everyday .
And we do n’t typically talk to them on the phone .
We have some automated measures that account for things like , say , evaluators who consistently say two sites in a side - by - side comparison are about the same .
We also have moderators .
But ultimately , the real quality control is done by the folks who are working on ranking and search UI .
They ’re the ones who understand why we are better today in China than we were a week ago or a month ago .
What changed ?
What are we are doing better ?
The evaluation program really just gives our engineers an aggregate measure of how good their algorithms are so they can improve them .
JP : So you ’re describing a process in which these evaluators are going to specific Web pages and rating them according to a specific criteria .
Do these data have any effect on those sites ’ page ranks or pay - per-click and Ad Word bids ?
SH : We do n’t use any of the data we gather in that way .
I mean , it is conceivable you could .
But the evaluation site ratings that we gather never directly affect the search results that we return .
We never go back and say , “ Oh , we learned from a rater that this result is n’t as good as that one , so let ’s put them in a different order . ”
Doing something like that would skew the whole evaluation by - and - large .
So we never touch it .
JP : Let ’s backtrack a little bit .
How did this project begin ?
Who came up with it ?
What were its origins ?
SH : Well , from the earlier days of Google , of course , we have always been interested in measuring how well our search algorithms are doing .
I was n’t here , but what I understand is that way back when there was a set of Sergy ’s favorite 10 queries , people would run those and they would make sure that any change they made to the ranking algorithms would make those work .
Obviously , as Google grew in traffic and reach , it needed a broader set of queries , and there was a realization that we really needed to have evaluators in the countries we service who understand the culture to do that well .
We needed a team that could evaluate results from the users ’ perspective .
OUR STORY
GEAR Shop Brisbane is a community focused bike shop ,
Our cosy store is based in the heart of Brisbane .
One of the most contentious issues now in the news , in the aftermath of the assassination of Dr. George Tiller , is how much moral culpability the anti-choice movement bears for motivating the man who took Dr. Tiller 's life .
One of the most contentious issues now in the news , in the aftermath of the assassination of Dr. George Tiller , is how much moral culpability the anti-choice movement bears for motivating the man who took Dr. Tiller ’s life .
I ’ve had innumerable discussions with folks who are confused about the extremism and anger that characterizes the “ right to life ” movement , people who mistakenly believe that it ’s a mostly harmless group of rosary - shuffling grandmothers who , at worst , sit around abortion clinics looking doe - eyed .
Or that the picketers at women ’s clinics could be reasonably described as peaceful .
Discrediting these myths is n’t fun or easy , but something that fell into my lap in the past week coincidentally turns out to be quite helpful in convincing people that the anti-choice movement , rather than being composed of generally good - hearted folks who just have a thing for fetuses , is in fact composed of hard - hearted
sexist ideologues .
I ’ve got my hands on a 113 - page training manual ( PDF ) for protesters working for Justice For All , an anti-choice organization that targets college campuses ( in keeping with the anti-choice obsession with singling out young , middle class women , whom they wish to preserve as symbols of virginal innocence ) .
Do n’t worry .
My sources got this manual the old - fashioned way , by asking .
As a long - time observer of the anti-choice movement , I thought I ’d really seen it all in terms of lying , phony sanctimony , and heated rhetoric that will push anti-choicers to commit violence , but still , reading this manual , titled “ Abortion : From Debate To Dialogue , ” was distressing .
The book assumes that its protesters will be sent into a field where they actually have to engage arguments instead of merely yelling abuse and scaring women seeking abortion care .
Since my scanner is slow , and time is limited , I did n’t turn all 113 pages into a PDF , and since much of it is just Q&A sections and scripture , I did n’t feel I had to .
But I did grab some interesting pages on arguments to make and rhetorical strategies to use against pro-choicers who try to engage anti-choice activists .
What I first learned was that Justice For All has no problem instructing its activists to use deception to lure people into a conversation .
In the section titled “ Why Do n’t You Pass Out Condoms and Promote Birth Control ? , ” the authors tacitly admit that sensible people might be put off by the anti-choice movement ’s willingness to increase the abortion rate by standing as firmly against contraception , especially the birth control pill , as they do legal abortion .
So instead of allowing members to admit their hostility to all forms of contraception , they instruct them to conceal their beliefs until a target has been softened up to hear about their true message –sexual abstinence for all not trying to procreate –through a series of dodgy , misleading arguments , including misinformation about how the birth control pill works .
This tactic is a mainstay of the anti-choice movement : it shows one face to the initiated , and another to the public , especially on the topic of contraception .
Once you realize this , the movement ’s half - hearted denunciations of Dr. Tiller ’s murder , coupled with the enthusiastic return to calling Dr. Tiller a monster , become all the more
chilling .

Throughout the handbook , you find a willingness to ignore or outright deny inconvenient facts .
The section “ What If The Mother ’s Life Is In Danger ” is particularly outrageous , in light of the fact that it spreads many of the lies that led directly to Dr. Tiller ’s assassination .
Dr. Tiller performed a number of medically indicated late term abortions , and anti-choice attempts to use legal persecution to catch him fudging the ugly realities proved fruitless .
Despite this , Justice For
All encourages its activists to believe they know better than medical doctors what constitutes a medically necessary abortion , and the handbook claims there is only one instance where a pregnancy can threaten a woman ’s life .
Conveniently , the one dangerous condition they ’ll admit exists ( and consider a justifiable reason for an abortion ) happens to be the one that is most likely to threaten her future fertility –the ectopic pregnancy–so they can rest easy knowing that even if a woman ’s life is saved through abortion , she ’s paid a steep price .
Other dangerous conditions caused by pregnancy –eclampsia and placenta previa being the two biggies–are dismissed as myths used to get away with abortions .
Other life - threatening illnesses like cancer are ignored , and it ’s assumed that a woman ’s health is certainly an acceptable sacrifice for a pregnancy .
This casual disregard for women ’s lives is acknowledged as a credibility - wrecking problem in another section “ Women Will Die in the Back Alleys with Coat Hangers . ”
It ’s clear that Justice for All activists have convinced themselves that making abortion illegal actually does n’t hinder access to safe abortions (! ) , but followers are instructed to pretend to concede that illegal abortion is dangerous , to gain credibility .
( Which means they have to pretend to believe what they do n’t , but ironically what they do n’t believe is true .
It ’s a rabbit hole of deceit and misinformation . )
The important thing is creating the illusion of concern for women ’s lives , apparently , and the manual even offers a small section titled “ Sound Bites For Showing Concern , ” which the activist is supposed to use to soften up the target before comparing an elective abortion ( most commonly performed in the first trimester ) to shooting a toddler .
One does wonder when reading this section if Justice for All offers role - playing classes so you can practice your “ concerned ” face when someone brings up the problem of women who are mutilated and die due to illegal abortion .
Shocking as all this is , perhaps the most shocking is the section addressing what Justice For All believes about the motivations of doctors who perform and women who obtain abortion , in a section titled “ Abortion Is n’t Genocide ! ”
Yes , they believe that abortion is genocide , and their rationales for this belief depend on a bunch of out - of - context quotes suggesting that terminating a pregnancy is exactly the same thing as targeting a people for elimination .
People commit genocide because they hate the group in question , so the implication ( barely implied , and almost directly stated ) is that doctors and women who have abortions do so because they hate fetuses .
Not because the woman ca n’t go through a pregnancy for a myriad of personal reasons .
Not because the doctor is trying to help the woman .
No , because pro-choicers hate fetuses .
This is the sort of vicious lie that led to Dr. Tiller ’s assassination .
Realistically speaking , Dr. Tiller was a good man who loved children enough to have four of his own , who joyfully celebrated the pregnancies of women who wanted to be pregnant , who opened his home to women who wished to give their babies up for adoption , and who mourned the loss of very much wanted pregnancies with his patients who had to terminate .
In the eyes of his detractors , Dr. Tiller was a genocidal monster who killed fetuses because he hated them .
That is why every person who trots out this nonsense about how abortion is “ genocide ” played a part in Sunday ’s tragedy .
You paint good , moral , righteous man who lived by his principles , even in the face of grave danger as an
irrational monster who gets his kicks by killing babies , and the people who believe you will feel they have to do something .
Even if that something is murder .

Displaying Calculations in Dynamic DC
The Dynamic DC analysis calculates the DC operating point for the circuit and dynamically displays the resulting DC node voltage , device current , and device power values on the schematic .
The current and power displays are only available for the analog primitive devices such as the diode or the NPN .
Any components that are modeled as a subcircuit or macro will not have currents and powers available for display .
Some users may want to expand on the available set of displayed values by using formula text to create their own calculations .
With formula text , the existing voltage , current , and power values may be referenced to create new calculations such as device voltages , differential voltages , and subcircuit power calculations .
The schematic below displays the use of formula text in making additional voltage , current , and power calculations for the circuit .
The circuit is a simple differential amplifier .
Formula text has been entered below the circuit .
There are two varieties of schematic grid text that can use formulas .
The first form is as follows :
=formula
Grid text of this form behaves like a small spreadsheet .
The presence of the = at the first character position tells Micro - Cap that the following text should be calculated as a formula .
The four voltage calculations use this form , and the expressions used for them are shown as follows .
= V( OutA , OutB )
= V( R1 )
= VCE ( Q1 )
= VCE ( Q3 )
Note that each of these expressions must be added separately through the Grid Text mode as this type of formula text can only handle a single expression .
The first expression calculates the differential voltage between nodes OutA and OutB .
The second expression calculates the voltage across the R1 resistor .
The last two expressions calculate the voltages between the collector and emitter leads for the Q1 and Q3 NPN transistors .
The second form of formula text is as follows :
text ...[ formula ] ... text
Formula text of this type is calculated only if the Formula checkbox is enabled in the Text dialog box .
The advantage to this form as opposed to the first one is that any number of formulas may be entered within the same text object .
The power and current calculations in the schematic have been specified in this form .
The following text was used for these calculations :
PD ( X1 ) = [ V( OutA, 9 ) * I ( R5 ) ]
PD ( X2 ) = [ V( OutB , 9 ) * I ( R2 ) ]
I( V3 ) = [ I ( V3 ) ]
I( V3 ) = [ V( R8 ) / R( R8 ) + V( R9 ) / R( R9 ) ]
Since the X1 and X2 NPN transistors are actually modeled as a subcircuit , the basic power displays in Dynamic DC are not available for them .
A simple calculation of the power is used instead where the voltage from the collector to the emitter is multiplied by the current through the resistor that is in series with the collector lead .
The current calculations produce the same calculation using two different methods .
The first I ( V3 ) just calculates the current through the V3 source whereas the second calculation uses the voltage and resistance values of the two resistive branches that connect to the V3 source .
As can be seen in the result , Kirchoff 's laws are met .
One nice feature of the formula text is that the calculations are updated when the circuit is modified .
The schematic below shows the updated calculations when the V2 source has been increased to 10V .

How do you string fibre in a facility such at 151 ?
Does the building owner have its own people who physically put the cables in between 2 points that you specify ?
Or do you just string your cables along " public use " paths on the ceiling ( or under floor ) between different points in the building ?
Are you allowed to lift tiles on the floor ?
Or does that require special permission that deactivates alarms ?
( For instance , if you need to string a cable between 2 racks on opposite sides of an aisle ) .

You basically request the " x " amount of fibres from your collocation provider , they charge you a setup fee ( and monthly after it is setup ) ....
They would then take care of pulling the fibres to / from the various points .
Suspect you need some sort of building authorization to pull between suites ....

This is so cool , we know exactly how things happen ...
I work for a gaming server company and we have our own boxes in certain datacenters over the US .
My boss did tell me how the noise level was high in those datacenters , but MAN that 's loud XD

Also I believe they charge per foot / month for the pipes for the water cooling system to a suite .
I used to love going to 151 , wish I could go there again .
Nothing beats going for street meat at 3 am on all nighters lol .
Still have my access card , but they have to be " renewed " annually .
Spent many a long night there with my friends at Accelerated Connections ...
And those guys in Switch & Data can be fun .
The best is the fees they charge for conduit for running from the risers to your suite .. they charge per foot per month for the conduit .

In the recent days I looked around a bit , how other open source projects work and what do the respective foundations do .
Especially I looked at how the Eclipse Foundation is working .
Clearly the Perl community is different from the Java community or the Eclipse community but we might learn a few things from the way they operate .
The Eclipse Foundation does not employ developers but they employ a full - time professional staff .
They provide four services .
I 'll try to describe the similar services provided either by The Perl Foundation , by EPO , the Enlightened Perl Organisation or by others in the Perl Community .
IT Infrastructure
The Perl community has certain servers ( e.g. perl.org ) donated by some organizations and maintained by Robert and Ask on a volunteer base .
Many other services are running on machines donated by other companies ( e.g. perl5.git.perl.org was donated by Booking.com a major user of Perl ) .
A lot of other services are running on machines financed by the developer herself or by various Perl Monger groups .
Smoke testing is done by many volunteers on their own machine .
What the Perl community is missing in this is a lot of other machines of the less common types ( AIX , VMS , etc ... ) to run tests on and to help in development .
A central svn or git server might be also interesting .
Intellectual Property ( IP ) Management or in other words Legal services
The Perl Foundation employs a legal counselor ( though I am not sure if that is for a fee or pro-bono ) .
They are mostly dealing with the Perl Trademark , the Artistic license and the copyright of Perl 5 and Rakudo .
( Parrot is dealt by the Parrot Foundation )
The TPF does not provide legal assistance for the individual CPAN modules and their authors .
While there might not be many legal issues the Perl community needs to deal with it seems the allocated time is still not enough .
I asked the TPF more than a year ago to provide an official wording that the CPAN module authors could put on their modules - ( As I understand The licensed as Perl ... is not really good and even that is not copy pasted correctly by some of us . ) .
The need was acknowledged and some process was made but other legal issues were more important so there still is no official answer .
I do n't know how important that is but maybe some ( more ? ) money should be spent on the legal issues .
or in other words Development Community Support
In this the Eclipse Foundation tries to streamline the development of the many sub-projects and organizes the release train which is an effort to release several projects at the same time .
I do n't see any such need in the Perl community nor do I see any possibility to coordinate the development work of the thousands of volunteer developers in the 16.000 or so sub-projects .
In addition they help to implement the Eclipse Development Process .
I have not read through that but maybe the Perl community should look at that process and see what can we adopt .
The Eclipse Foundation ensures that all Eclipse projects are run in an open , transparent and meritocratic manner .
This is something we need to adapt .
There are too many things - some of them around the TPF some on the services in the Perl community - that are not open source and are not transparent .
We should change this !
Ecosystem Development
Under this entry the Eclipse Foundation helps both the open source projects in the Eclipse Foundation and the commercial projects of the member companies in marketing their products .
This includes among other things conference organizations , on - line catalogs and various marketing efforts .
The Perl community is doing quite a good job in organizing both local and international conferences but they are relatively small ( 300 people on YAPC ::NA and YAPC : :EU ) and most of the people on these conferences are the same core developers .
The conference are good to help the core developers but do n't work too well in marketing Perl .
There are hackatons organized mostly by people from the community that too help the core developers .
The EPO has the Iron Man blogging Challenge which I believe is a good step in the direction of marketing Perl and the community .
What I think is really missing is professional marketing services .
Maybe a marketing manager who can full - time work on marketing the Perl ecosystem .
It is nice that we try to market our language and our own projects but we do it only in our spare time which is little .
We are also quite closed in our circles while we should reach outside of the core perl community .
So I think it would be money well spent if the TPF or the EPO hired a full - time marketing professional to advance Perl and our projects .
I know some of you will disagree .
That 's a big part of what makes Perl and the Perl community to what it is .
A diverse set of individuals with lots of different ideas about what and how .
So what do you think ?
Red meat is a source of animal fats Eating a diet high in red meat and dairy products is linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer , a US study has suggested .
Researchers followed 500,000 people who had completed a food diary for an average of six years .
The Journal of the National Cancer Institute paper found those who had the most animal fats in their diet had a higher risk of developing the cancer .
UK experts said cutting down on the fats was a way of reducing risk .
There has previously been confusion over whether there was a link between animal fats and pancreatic cancer , with different studies reaching opposite conclusions .
About 7,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the UK each year , with smoking being the biggest risk factor .
The prognosis is poor - the time between diagnosis and death is usually about six months .
' Welcome addition '
This latest research was carried out by the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , which felt earlier studies had been too small to give reliable results .
The participants were being followed to see if they developed a range of diseases .
This large study adds to the evidence that pancreatic cancer is more common in people who eat too much fat , particularly saturated fat
Josephine Querido , Cancer Research UK
Of the half a million studied , 1,337 developed pancreatic cancer .
Men who consumed the highest amount of total fats had a 53 % higher relative rate of pancreatic cancer compared with men who ate the least .
In women , there was a 23 % higher rate of the disease in those eating the most fat compared with those who ate the least .
Overall , people who consumed high amounts of saturated fats had 36 % higher relative rates of pancreatic cancer compared with those who consumed low amounts .
Writing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , the researchers led by Dr Rachel Stolzenberg - Solomon , said : " We observed positive associations between pancreatic cancer and intakes of total , saturated , and monounsaturated fat overall , particularly from red meat and dairy food sources .
" We did not observe any consistent association with polyunsaturated or fat from plant food sources .
" Altogether , these results suggest a role for animal fat in pancreatic carcinogenesis . "
In an editorial in the journal , Dr Brian Wolpin , of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , and Dr Meir Stampfer , of the Harvard School of Public Health , said the study was a " welcome addition to the understanding of a disease that is in great need of new insights " .
Josephine Querido , senior science information officer for Cancer Research UK , said : " This large study adds to the evidence that pancreatic cancer is more common in people who eat too much fat , particularly saturated fat .
" Understanding ways of reducing the risk of pancreatic cancer is very important because it can be very difficult to treat .
" Apart from stopping smoking , the best way to reduce your risk of cancer is to eat plenty of fruit vegetables and fibre , and to cut down on fatty foods , red and processed meat and limit your intake of alcohol . "

VATICAN CITY - Pope Benedict XVI has encouraged young Catholics to use the Internet to spread the church 's message .
The pope promoted the use of the digital world as a means of making the Gospel known in remarks to 20,000 pilgrims at his weekly audience Wednesday .
He says that the Internet has brought about change in the way news is distributed and how people relate to each other .
Benedict urges young people to use the potential of the Internet to build a better world through bonds of friendship and solidarity .
He also underlines the need for a what he calls a culture of respect when navigating .
The Vatican is constantly updating its own presence on the Internet .
Earlier this year , the pope got his own YouTube channel .
Ancient bones suggest “ lefties ” have been coping with a right - handed world for more than half a million years .
A study of Homo heidelbergensis , an ancestor of Neanderthals , seems to show that the ancient humans were predominately right - handed .
“ Finding that a hominin species as old as Homo heidelbergensis is already right - handed helps to trace back the chain of modernity concerning hand laterality , ” says Marina Mosquera , a paleoanthropologist at Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona , Spain , who was involved in the study .
Humans are the only animal believed to show a strong preference for performing tasks with one hand or the other .
Determining when right - handedness first evolved could shed light on traits linked to lateralised brains , such as language and technology , Mosquera says .
Efforts to solve this mystery have looked to ancient human skulls and marks left on tools .
But these methods may not be reliable .
Two - million - year - old tools carved out of animal bones contain marks that might be indicative of use by right - handers ; however left - handers could have created the same patterns , she says .

Similarly ancient skulls may have been split into two hemispheres , but these changes could also reflect language processing , which occurs predominately in the left brain of both right - handed and left - handed people , Mosquera says .
‘ Third hand ’
In search of a less ambiguous indicator of handedness , Mosquera ’s team looked to teeth , of all things .
Ancient humans probably used their teeth like a third hand , she says , clenching onto meat and other objects to cut them with stone tools .
And in the process , ancient humans might have grazed their incisors , creating diagonal marks .
To avoid cutting their noses off , ancient humans probably moved their blade in a downward motion , causing right - handers to make tooth marks in one direction , left - handers in another .
Mosquera ’s team confirmed this bias by asking left and right - handed assistants to simulate the process while wearing mouth guards .
Next , her team analyzed 592 cut marks on 163 teeth found at Sima de los Huesos cave in northern Spain , which has produced a trove of Homo heidelbergensis remains .
The vast majority of the marks looked to be made by right - handers , Mosquera ’s team found .
Indeed , out of the 19 individuals to whom the teeth belonged , 15 appeared to be right - handed and none left - handed .
Teeth from four individuals contained mostly vertical marks and , therefore , could not be interpreted .
‘ Same old problems ’
Travis Pickering , a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison , agrees that dental marks are a good way of determining handedness in ancient humans .
“ Most hominins , even early hominins , are going to be bright enough not to bring a blade up to their noses , ” he says .
But the new study runs into the same problems as other attempts to understand ancient human behaviour by analysing marks left on teeth or tools , Pickering says .
A right - handed lab assistant may create diagonal marks across a tooth guard while using a stone tool , but cut marks on a 500,000 year - old tooth could have come from entirely different activities or even natural wear and tear .

Two freshmen U.S. senators — who also happen to be cousins — have introduced a bill that would create a national renewable energy standard ( RES ) of twenty - five percent by 2020 .
The bill would initiate a federal minimum standard mandating retail energy suppliers to diversify their portfolios with the first requirement of six percent for 2012 , and consistently increase thereafter until meeting the 2025 goal .
The proposal dovetails with that of President Obama who has proposed a goal of doubling renewable energy within the next three years .
Twenty - eight states already have renewable generation standards with various timelines and targets and this legislation would not preempt states that have stronger standards .
On paper , the proposed RES would appear to surpass the EU enewables requirement of twenty percent by 2020 .
But municipal and other publicly - owned power plants and rural electric co-ops would be exempted from the requirements .
“ This legislation is a long - overdue step toward energy security our country needs , ” the bill ’s co-sponsor Mark Udall ( D - CO ) said .
“ The renewable energy goals this bill sets are significant .
Our RES bill will create jobs , benefit farmers , save consumers money , reduce air pollution , and increase reliability and energy security . ”
Qualifying renewables are wind , solar , ocean , geothermal , biomass , landfill gas and incremental hydropower .
Existing hydropower generators and municipal solid waste generators are excluded from the base amount from which the percentage requirements are calculated .
Excluding large hydro and waste to energy , renewables already account for almost 3 % of U.S. electricity production .
Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie found that a national RES would lower natural gas and electricity prices and save more than $ 100 billion for American consumers .
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed national RES .
David Wright , commissioner of the South Carolina Public Service Commission , said a federal renewable energy standard fails to recognize the significant differences among the states in terms of available and cost - effective renewable energy resources , and that having such a standard in energy legislation will ultimately increase consumers ’ electricity bills . ”

Thursday , May 21 , 2009 : The Nigerian military has been accused of killing hundreds , maybe thousands , of civilians in the oil - rich Niger Delta .
The military offensive began eight days ago but has received little international attention .
We go to Nigeria to speak with Denzil Amagbe Kentebe of the Ijaw National Congress .
We 're also joined by Sandy Cioffi , director of the new documentary " Sweet Crude " about the Niger Delta .
The village of Oporoza , where much of the film was shot , has just been burned down .
We turn now to Nigeria where the Nigerian military continues to carry out attacks by land , air and sea on the oil - rich Niger Delta .
Reports indicate hundreds –if not thousands –of Nigerian civilians may be dead .
Entire villages have been reportedly burned to the ground .
The military offensive began eight days ago but has received little international attention .
Aid groups and journalists have been blocked from entering the remote region which is accessible only by boat .
On Wednesday , a coalition of environmental and human rights groups called on the International Criminal Court to launch an immediate investigation into the killings .
The Nigerian military has claimed the attacks have only targeted militant camps as part of a peace - keeping effort .
For years activist groups in the Niger Delta have advocated for fair distribution of oil wealth to local communities in the impoverished region .
Last week one of the main militant groups in the Niger Delta , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta or MEND , declared an oil war and threatened all international industry vessels that approach the region .
80 % of the oil extraction in Nigeria is in the Niger Delta .
Major oil firms in the area include Shell and Chevron .
We are joined by two guests .
Denzil Amagbe Kentebe is on the phone from Nigeria .
He is the chair of the Ijaw National Congress , Lagos chapter .
He is from Bayelsa State , the site of the ongoing military attacks .
Sandy Cioffi joins us in Seattle Washington .
She is the director of the new film “ Sweet Crude ” about the Niger Delta .
On Wednesday the village of Oporoza , where much of Sweet Crude was filmed , was burned down .
Denzil Amagbe Kentebe , chair of the Ijaw National Congress ( INC ) , Lagos Chapter .

A view of Rat Island in the western Aleutians is seen in this March 28 , 2006 file photo .
REUTERS / Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge / Handout .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Alaska ’s Rat Island is finally rat - free , 229 years after a Japanese shipwreck spilled rampaging rodents onto the remote Aleutian island , decimating the local bird population .
After dropping poison onto the island from helicopter - hoisted buckets for a week and a half last autumn , there are no signs of living rats and some birds have returned , according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
Rats have ruled the island since 1780 , when they jumped off a sinking Japanese ship and terrorized all but the largest birds on the island .
The incident introduced the non-native Norway rat -- also known as the brown rat -- to Alaska .
The $ 2.5 million Rat Island eradication project , a joint effort between the U.S. federal government , the Nature Conservancy and Island Conservation , is one of the world ’s most ambitious attempts to remove destructive alien species from an island .
Now there are signs that several species of birds , including Aleutian cackling geese , ptarmigan , peregrine falcons and black oystercatchers , are starting to nest again on the 10 - square - mile ( 26 - sq - km ) island .
It is too soon to say that Rat Island is definitively rat - free , however .
That can only be established after at least two years of monitoring , said Bruce Woods , a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage .
“ We do n’t know that there ’s not a couple of happy rats hiding away that are going to spring out and repopulate the island , ” he said .
With states facing nearly $ 100 billion in combined budget deficits this year , we 're seeing more governors than ever proposing the Barack Obama solution to balancing the budget :
Soak the rich .
Lawmakers in California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Oregon want to raise income tax rates on the top 1 % or 2 % or 5 % of their citizens .
New Illinois Gov. Patrick Quinn wants a 50 % increase in the income tax rate on the wealthy because this is the " fair " way to close his state 's gaping deficit .
Mr. Quinn and other tax - raising governors have been emboldened by recent studies by left - wing groups like the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities that suggest that " tax increases , particularly tax increases on higher - income families , may be the best available option . "
A recent letter to New York Gov. David Paterson signed by 100 economists advises the Empire State to " raise tax rates for high income families right away . "
Here 's the problem for states that want to pry more money out of the wallets of rich people .
It never works because people , investment capital and businesses are mobile :
They can leave tax - unfriendly states and move to tax - friendly states .
And the evidence that we discovered in our new study for the American Legislative Exchange Council , " Rich States , Poor States , " published in March , shows that Americans are more sensitive to high taxes than ever before .
The tax differential between low - tax and high - tax states is widening , meaning that a relocation from high - tax California or Ohio , to no-income tax Texas or Tennessee , is all the more financially profitable both in terms of lower tax bills and more job opportunities .
Updating some research from Richard Vedder of Ohio University , we found that from 1998 to 2007 , more than 1,100 people every day including Sundays and holidays moved from the nine highest income - tax states such as California , New Jersey , New York and Ohio and relocated mostly to the nine tax - haven states with no income tax , including Florida , Nevada , New Hampshire and Texas .
We also found that over these same years the no-income tax states created 89 % more jobs and had 32 % faster personal income growth than their high - tax counterparts .
President Obama will announce tomorrowMonday that he is reversing President Bush ’s ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research ( AP , Bloomberg ) .
With the announcement , President Obama will become the second American President to allow the use of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
The first , of course , was President Bush .
Bush ’s 2001 announcement declared that federal funding would be available for the 21 lines created before the announcement , but no others .
The ban – and President Obama ’s lifting of the ban – does not change the policy for privately - funded research .
One of the President ’s advisors is quoted as saying Obama plans to “ use sound , scientific practice and evidence , instead of dogma ” to guide his policy , rebuking the previous administration .
The announcement indicates the NIH will have 3 months to write new rules governing the research .
The announcement comes three years after Japanese researchers have shown they can transform skin cells into cells with embryonic stem cell properties .
Last February , those results were confirmed by scientists at UCLA .
With the announcement , researchers can apply for funds for stem cell lines outside the original 21 just like they would apply for any other research grant .
Adult stem cells are currently used in the treatment of some 75 diseases .
With the current success of adult stem cells and the ability to turn cells into embryonic stem cells , I wonder if opening up funding is really necessary .
What do you think ?
An international team of scientists has determined the structure of the chlorophyll molecules in green bacteria that are responsible for harvesting light energy .
The team 's results one day could be used to build artificial photosynthetic systems , such as those that convert solar energy to electrical energy .
The scientists found that the chlorophylls are highly efficient at harvesting light energy .
" We found that the orientation of the chlorophyll molecules make green bacteria extremely efficient at harvesting light , " said Donald Bryant , Ernest C. Pollard Professor of Biotechnology at Penn State and one of the team 's leaders .
According to Bryant , green bacteria are a group of organisms that generally live in extremely low - light environments , such as in light - deprived regions of hot springs and at depths of 100 meters in the Black Sea .
The bacteria contain structures called chlorosomes , which contain up to 250,000 chlorophylls .
" The ability to capture light energy and rapidly deliver it to where it needs to go is essential to these bacteria , some of which see only a few photons of light per chlorophyll per day . "
Because they have been so difficult to study , the chlorosomes in green bacteria are the last class of light - harvesting complexes to be characterized structurally by scientists .
Scientists typically characterize molecular structures using X - ray crystallography , a technique that determines the arrangement of atoms in a molecule and ultimately gives information that can be used to create a picture of the molecule ; however , X - ray crystallography could not be used to characterize the chlorosomes in green bacteria because the technique only works for molecules that are uniform in size , shape , and structure .
" Each chlorosome in a green bacterium has a unique organization , " said Bryant .
" They are like little andouille sausages .
When you take cross-sections of andouille sausages , you see different patterns of meat and fat ; no two sausages are alike in size or content , although there is some structure inside , nevertheless .
Chlorosomes in green bacteria are like andouille sausages , and the variability in their compositions had prevented scientists from using X - ray crystallography to characterize the internal structure . "
To get around this problem , the team used a combination of techniques to study the chlorosome .
They used genetic techniques to create a mutant bacterium with a more regular internal structure , cryo-electron microscopy to identify the larger distance constraints for the chlorosome , solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the chlorosome 's component chlorophyll molecules , and modeling to bring together all of the pieces and create a final picture of the chlorosome .
First , the team created a mutant bacterium in order to determine why the chlorophyll molecules in green bacteria became increasingly complex over evolutionary time .
To create the mutant , they inactivated three genes that green bacteria acquired late in their evolution .
The team suspected that the genes were responsible for improving the bacteria 's light - harvesting capabilities .
" Essentially , we went backward in evolutionary time to an intermediate state in order to understand , in part , why green bacteria acquired these genes , " Bryant said .
The team found that the more evolved , wild - type bacteria grow faster at all light intensities than the mutant form .
" Indeed , the reason that chlorophylls became more complex was to increase light - harvesting efficiency , " said Bryant .
Next , the team isolated chlorosomes from the mutant and the wild - type forms of the bacteria and used cryo-electron microscopy -- a type of electron microscopy that is performed at super - cold cryogenic temperatures -- to take pictures of the chlorosomes .
The pictures revealed that chlorophyll molecules inside chlorosomes have a nanotube shape .
" They are like Russian dolls , with one concentric tube fitting inside the next , " said Bryant .
" The mutant bacterium 's chlorosomes contain only one set of tubes , whereas the wild - type chlorosomes contain many tubes , each arranged in a unique pattern , like those andouille sausages . "
The team then went a step further and used solid - state NMR spectroscopy -- a technique in which samples are spun very rapidly and exposed to a magnetic field -- to look deep inside the chlorosome .
This technique enables researchers to understand the relationships between atomic nuclei in a sample and , ultimately , to acquire structural information about the molecules of interest .
" The NMR data revealed to us that the individual chlorophyll molecules in green bacteria are arranged in dimers -- molecules consisting of two identical simpler molecules -- with their long hydrophobic , or water - repellent , tails sticking out of either side , " said Bryant .
" We also learned precisely how the chlorophyll molecules attach to one another , and we were able to measure the distance between chlorophyll molecules .
The cryo-electron microscopy pictures showed gross structural details and distances , and the NMR results allowed us to quantify these distances as well , and confirmed to us that what were were seeing was , in fact , stacks of the chlorophyll molecules all lined up , " he said .
The NMR results also enabled the scientists to determine that the chlorophyll molecules in green bacteria are arranged in helical spirals .
In the mutant bacteria , the chlorophyll molecules are positioned at a nearly 90 - degree angle in relation to the long axis of the nanotubes , whereas the angle is less steep in the wild - type organism .
" It 's the orientation of the chlorophyll molecules that is the most important thing here , " said Bryant .
The last steps for the team were to pull together all of their data and to create a detailed computer model of the structure .
" At first it seems counterintuitive that green bacteria have managed to evolve a better light - harvesting system by increasing disorder in the chlorosome structure , " said Bryant .
" Most people would think that if you make something that is more highly ordered , you 'll end up with something that works better .
But this is clearly a case where that is n't true .
If all of the chlorophylls are identically arranged in a chlorosome , then the energy from the photon , once it is absorbed , is going to wander around over all of those chlorophylls , which could take a long time .
In the wild - type form , you have these different domains where chlorophyll molecules are located and , therefore , the ability of photon energy to migrate becomes restricted .
In other words , the energy in an individual photon visits a smaller number of chlorophylls , and that 's an advantage to the organism because the energy can get to where it needs to go faster .
Speed is the name of the game that green bacteria play with light .
The organisms have only a couple of nanoseconds for the energy to get someplace useful or else the energy is going to be lost .
The speed required can be a problem for bacteria that receive only a few photons of light per chlorophyll per day . "
Bryant said that the team 's results may one day be used to build artificial photosynthetic systems that convert solar energy to electricity .
" The interactions that lead to the assembly of the chlorophylls in chlorosomes are rather simple , so they are good models for artificial systems , " he said .
" You can make structures out of these chlorophylls in solution just by having the right solution conditions .
In fact , people have done this for many years ; however , they have n't really understood the biological rules for building larger structures .
I wo n't say that we completely understand the rules yet , but at least we know what two of the structures are now and how they relate to the biological system as a whole , which is a huge advance . "
The team also includes researchers from the Leiden Institute of Chemistry and the Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute in the Netherlands , and the Max Planck Institute in Germany .
This research was supported by the United States Department of Energy .
Since the mid-1990s , Fred Phelps ' Westboro Baptist Church ( WBC ) has spelled out its core message in neon - rainbow picket signs that read , " God Hate F ---. "
In a series of outrageous stunts , members of WBC have disrupted the funerals of servicemen killed in Iraq for supporting a " F - - - loving " country , protested a memorial for victims of the 2006 Sago mine disaster claiming it was God 's punishment on the US for tolerating homosexuality , and picketed the University of Wisconsin , where three students had recently died in a house fire , claiming the parents were to blame for " teaching them to be w----- and bastards . "
Now WBC has turned its ire on the Jewish community , targeting synagogues and Jewish community centers with a new hate - filled taunt , " God Hates Jews . "
The Topeka , Kan. , based church began picketing Jewish religious and cultural institutions in April of this year when they issued a press release that read , " Yes , the Jews killed the Lord Jesus … Now they 're carrying water for the f--- ; that 's what they do best : sin in God 's face every day , with unprecedented and disproportionate amounts of sodomy , fornication , adultery , abortion and idolatry ! "
After years of bizarre , publicity - craving pickets of funerals aimed at gays and lesbians , why has the WBC begun to target Jews ?
Phelps ' daughter Margie told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the Jewish community , and particularly its religious leaders , are " one of the loudest voices " in favor of homosexuality and abortion .
According to the group ’s picket schedule , the WBC plans to protest Chicago and New York Jewish institutions this weekend .
To one synagogue in Chicago 's Hyde Park neighborhood WBC warns , " Men , take the covering off your heads .
While you are doing that , you need to repent of the FACT that you Killed Christ ! ”
This coming Sunday , in New York City 's Central Park , the Phelps clan plans to visit an Israeli tourism event , with a calendar entry that reads , " All the remainder can sit and stew in your own filth , remain filthy until the day God spews you out of the land and punishes you for never repenting from having killed Jesus .
You will be destroyed at the hand of Antichrist Obama , and you will eat your little cute , chubby , Kosher babies . "
The WBC ’s recent turn to rabid anti-Semitism is not something totally out of character for the group .
The Anti-Defamation League notes that as far back as 1996 , Fred Phelps wrote in a flyer , “ F-- Jew Nazis are worse than ordinary Nazis … .
The First Holocaust was a Jewish Holocaust against Christians .
The latest Holocaust is by Topeka Jews against WBC … ”
For day two of Black Hat , we sat in on on [ Joe Grand ] , [ Jacob Appelbaum ] , and [ Chris Tarnovsky ] ’s study of the electronic parking meter industry .
They decided to study parking meters because they are available everywhere , but rarely considered from a security perspective .
They focused on the San Francisco ’s MTA implementation of electronic smart card meters .
To start they purchased several meters on eBay just to see the different styles .
SF MTA lets you purchase disposable payment cards with values of $ 20 or $ 50 .
They decided to sniff the interaction between the meter and the smartcard using a shim .
With that first capture they were able to easily replay the transaction .
This did n’t require a smartcard reader , just an oscilloscope .
They then took the attack a little further .
[ Joe ] built a smartcard emulator using a PIC16F648A .
They used it to capture multiple transactions and then decoded the interactions by hand .
Luckily , the card was using the IEC 7816 standard so they had some insight into the protocol .
They found that the card has a stored maximum value and only writes how many times the value has been decremented .
As a proof of concept , they change the maximum value , which you can see on the meter above .
They could also have just changed the acknowledgement so that the card never writes any deductions .
The PIC16F648A was a good choice because it ’s available in a smart card format called a ‘ silver card ’ .
You can find the emulator code and slides from the talk on [ Joe ] ’s site about the project .
THE idea that climate change will lead to war is often raised by environmental pessimists , and a meeting on the climatic past of South - East Asia , held last month in Dalat , Vietnam , suggests it is not such an unlikely thought .
The meeting was organised by the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , part of Columbia University , some of whose researchers have been trying to reconstruct the pattern of South - East Asia 's monsoons over the past few centuries .
One matter they raised was the possibility that two periods of conflict in the area , in the 15th and 18th centuries , were provoked by droughts .
Historical records of the climate in Asia are lamentable outside India , where the weather - obsessed British collected good data during the 19th and 20th centuries .
The observatory 's researchers had therefore to rely on tree rings .
This is hard in South - East Asia .
Many of the larger , and therefore older specimens in the area 's forests have been logged .
Even among those that remain , seasonal differences in the rings ' growth rates are less noticeable than those that mark summer and winter in temperate climes .
Ironically , the diversity of species in tropical forests also presents dendroclimatologists with problems .
They would prefer just one or two types of tree , so that they could compare several samples of each more easily .
Nevertheless , Brendan Buckley , one of the observatory 's researchers , found that a conifer called Fokienia hodginsii , which can live for more than 1,000 years , gave him the marker he needed .
Using it , he has built up a series of tree - ring chronologies from Thailand and Vietnam that indicate a period of severe drought across mainland South - East Asia in the early 1400s .
This was the period when the city of Angkor in present - day Cambodia went into rapid decline , a fact that some historians have blamed on invasions by the rival Siamese and Champa kingdoms .
Dr Buckley 's data , however , suggest another possibility — that Angkor 's canals and reservoirs ran dry and that the invasions were therefore a consequence of decline , rather than its cause .
Similarly , another prolonged drought in the 18th century , which was noted by foreign visitors to Siam ( modern - day Thailand ) , coincided with a series of political upheavals that included the sacking of the Siamese capital by Burmese invaders .
The question is what causes such droughts in South - East Asia ?
El Niño , a periodic warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean , is part of the answer .
It corresponds with a weaker south - west monsoon and a longer dry season .
It cannot , however , be the whole explanation .
Dr Buckley 's tree cores show that the 18th - century drought in Siam lasted 30 years or more .
That should have corresponded with a warmer Pacific but according to Kevin Anchukaitis , another of the observatory 's researchers , data from coral suggest it did not .
The answer may lie in the Indian Ocean , which also influences monsoon patterns , rather than in the Pacific , and there is some evidence that the Indian Ocean was indeed cooler during the 18th - century drought .
The details , though , remain obscure — which serves as a reminder of just how much remains to be found out before even the local climate truly becomes explicable .

Of those polled , 13 % said Rush Limbaugh was the " main person " who speaks for the Republicans today .
GOP UNREST GOP UNREST THE IMAGES THEY PROJECT THE IMAGES THEY PROJECT
The Gallup Poll asked Americans what words come to mind when they think of the two major political parties .
The results offer insight into the challenge Republicans face in regaining support .
Question :
What comes to mind when you think of ... The Republican Party 1 . Unfavorable 25 % 2 . Conservative 16 % 3 . Favorable 7 % 4 . No direction 6 % 5 . Cater to the rich 6 % 6 . George W. Bush 4 % 7 . Close - minded / Not open to new ideas 3 % 8 . Cater to big business 3 % 9 . Poor economic conditions 3 % 10 .
Pro-military / Pro-war 2 % The Democratic Party 1 . Liberal 15 % 2 . Favorable 10 % 3 . For the people 10 % 4 . Socially conscious / progressive 10 % 5 . Big spending 8 % 6 . Unfavorable 6 % 7 . Self - centered / Out for themselves 4 % 8 . Big government 3 % 9 . Barack Obama 3 % 10 .

WASHINGTON  Republicans , out of power and divided over how to get it back , are finding even the most basic questions hard to answer .
Here 's one : Who speaks for the GOP ?
The question flummoxes most Americans , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds , which is among the reasons for the party 's sagging state and uncertain direction .
A 52 % majority of those surveyed could n't come up with a name when asked to specify " the main person " who speaks for Republicans today .
Of those who could , the top response was radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh ( 13 % ) , followed in order by former vice president Dick Cheney , Arizona Sen .
John McCain and former House speaker Newt Gingrich .
Former president George W. Bush ranked fifth , at 3 % .
So the dominant faces of the Republican Party are all men , all white , all conservative and all old enough to join AARP , ranging in age from 58 ( Limbaugh ) to 72 ( McCain ) .
They include some of the country 's most strident voices on issues from Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination to the Supreme Court to President Obama 's policies at home and abroad .
Two are retired from politics , and one has never been a candidate .
Only McCain holds elective office , and his age and status as the loser of last year 's presidential election make him an unlikely standard bearer for the party 's future .
" It 's a problem , " says Douglas Holtz - Eakin , an adviser to McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign who this month is filing the papers to create a think tank aimed at generating new ideas for conservatives .
" We need the perceived leadership of the party to be those who are the future . "
" We can not be a party of balding white guys , " says former Republican Party national chairman Ed Gillespie , a White House counselor for George W. Bush .
" We have to have a broader appeal , but there 's time for us to make that change . "
Republicans have seen an erosion of support across almost all demographic groups — the steepest decline since World War II , even bigger than in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s .
Since 2004 , Republicans have gone from a 3 percentage point advantage in party identification over Democrats in USA TODAY polls to a 7 point disadvantage .
In that time , the GOP has lost control of the White House , the House of Representatives and the Senate .
It is struggling to forge a united response to the popular new Democratic president .
The result has been to give Obama " an extension " to his political honeymoon , Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg says .
No surprise , then , that a debate rages over what to do next .
The annual Congressional Republican fundraising dinner Monday prompted weeks of political drama over who would deliver the keynote address .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's name was announced , but when questions arose over her schedule Gingrich was tapped .
Then a last - minute kerfuffle developed over whether Palin , McCain 's running mate , would attend after all .
In the end , she showed up at the Washington Convention Center , walked across the stage and waved but did n't speak .
He delivered an hour - long , policy - laden address that castigated Obama for having " already failed " on the economy and called for a " majority Republican Party " that would tolerate disparate views .
In recent days , the party 's divisions over Sotomayor have played out in public .
At one end of the spectrum , Limbaugh labeled the appellate judge a racist and Gingrich said she should be forced to withdraw , although he later backed away from his harshest words .
At the other , Sen. Olympia Snowe , R- Maine , praised the nominee 's judicial philosophy and defended Sotomayor 's temperament after meeting with her last week .
" We 're undergoing , obviously , an identity problem , both in terms of the issues and what we represent as Republicans , what the Republican brand is all about , " Snowe says .
One of the few moderate Republicans left in the Senate — their ranks shrank when Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania switched to the Democrats — she worries her party has " lost its way . "
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele , who declined to be interviewed about the GOP 's future , has been caught in the crossfire between Limbaugh and others .
( In the USA TODAY / Gallup Poll , only 1 % said Steele spoke for the GOP . )
USA TODAY asked whether Republicans , to succeed , should either do a better job arguing for conservative views or change positions on some issues to appeal to moderates — an ongoing debate within the party .
Cheney sparked headlines last month when he said on CBS '
Face the Nation that he would rather have a GOP defined by the conservative Limbaugh than the moderate former secretary of State , Colin Powell .
A majority of those surveyed said the party should make changes to draw moderates .
Among Republicans , however , nearly two - thirds said the party would be better off by holding a conservative line and advocating it more effectively — as Limbaugh advocates .
" They 're disorganized , they do n't have a leader , and they 're trying to be too moderate , " Kim Lowe , 43 , of Charlotte , says .
The conservative stay - at - home mom and interior designer , who was among those surveyed , predicts that a message of fiscal responsibility ultimately will prevail with voters .
" I believe they 'll come back once America sees what Obama is doing , " she says .
' Politics is self - correcting ' Political fortunes are cyclical , of course .
Republicans were crushed in Lyndon Johnson 's 1964 landslide but regained the White House four years later amid turmoil over civil rights and the Vietnam War .
In the 1980s , Democratic liberals and centrists faced off , sometimes bitterly , over welfare , crime and other issues until Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 .
" When you have a party out of power , especially after you 've lost an election , it 's not surprising there would be many voices competing to speak , " says Frank Donatelli , who was political director in the Reagan White House and helped run the Republican National Committee for the McCain campaign last year .
Republican opportunities will come in response to Democratic excesses , Donatelli says : " Politics is self - correcting . "
In time , the GOP will be defined and led by its presidential nominee , he says .
Several prospects are laying the groundwork for potential runs in 2012 .
Last week , Minnesota Gov.
Tim Pawlenty announced he would n't seek a third term , stoking speculation that he is interested in the White House .
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Gingrich have been making appearances in key primary states .
Republican candidates also are competitive in this year 's two gubernatorial races , in New Jersey and Virginia , for seats now held by Democrats .
Winning either would help Republicans argue they are making a comeback .
Still , some see the GOP 's immediate plight as perilous .
" We 're in the basement of a 100 - story building , " says Ed Rollins , a Republican strategist who advised the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan in 1984 , independent Ross Perot in 1992 and Huckabee in 2008 .
Rollins says next year 's congressional and state legislative elections are crucial .
If Republicans do n't make significant gains in the House , he says , the redrawing of congressional district lines after the 2010 Census could lock in Democratic advantages for a decade .
Then there are the demographics of the GOP 's decline .
From Bush 's inauguration in 2001 to Obama 's inauguration in 2009 , Republicans lost significant support among nearly every major demographic group , according to a Gallup analysis — among men and women , Americans at all income levels , residents of every region and those ages 18 - 64 .
The losses were particularly steep among those under 30 , the rising Millennial generation .
Support for the GOP among college graduates fell by about 10 percentage points .
Surveys of voters as they left polling places also showed a significant decline among Hispanics , the nation 's fastest - growing ethnic group .
Republicans maintained support among seniors , conservatives and frequent churchgoers .
To win elections , Gillespie says , the party needs to make more inroads among the rapidly expanding parts of the population .
" I was not a math major , but I know that getting an increasing share of a decreasing percentage of the overall vote is not a good thing , " he says .
" That 's what we 're doing now . "
" The world has changed , and they can not be staying in the same place where they 've been for the last 200 years , " says Erika Quinteros , 63 , an independent from suburban Philadelphia who was called in the survey .
The retired doctor sometimes votes for Republicans — she liked former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge — but says the current GOP seems " too radical " for her .
In the poll , 34 % had a favorable impression of the Republican Party , matching the lowest level in more than a decade .
In comparison , 53 % had a favorable impression of the Democratic Party .
Dissatisfaction with the GOP extends to within its own ranks .
Among Republicans , 33 % had an unfavorable impression of their own party .
In contrast , 4 % of Democrats had an unfavorable impression of their party .
The GOP 's electoral setbacks , policy divisions and image problems make it harder for the party to influence the national debate .
" It 's as if the Republican Party is in a time - out chair , " says Charlie Cook , editor and publisher of the non-partisan Cook Political Report .
" Nobody 's really listening to them .
Nobody 's caring what they think .
The question is when they 're asked to rejoin the class , are they going to have something new or different to say ? "
" I do n't think people know what they stand for , " says Troy Collett , 39 , a Republican from Shelbyville , Ind. , who was surveyed .
In the 2008 election , he says , " all they knew was there was a war in Iraq that most people disagreed with , and spending was out of control , and gas prices were high . "
A GOP ' wilderness '
Asked by Gallup " what comes to mind when you think of the Republican Party , " 25 % said " unfavorable " and another 1 in 4 offered negative assessments including " no direction , " " close - minded " and " poor economic conditions . "
Sixteen percent said " conservative " and 7 % " favorable . "
For the Democratic Party , the most dominant impression was " liberal , " mentioned by 15 % .
One in 3 used positive phrases such as " for the people " and " socially conscious . "
The most prevalent negative judgments saw the Democrats as " big spending " ( 8 % ) and " self - centered " ( 4 % ) .
The survey of 1,015 adults , taken by land line and cellphone May 29 - 31 , has a margin of error of +/– 3 percentage points .
Like the Democrats or not , there was a broad consensus about who speaks for the party .
Obama was named by 58 % .
He was followed by 11 % who cited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 3 % who cited Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Twenty - one percent could n't come up with a name .
And Obama 's popularity — 67 % had a favorable opinion of him — is boosting his party .
Even the 14 - year - old daughter of Rollins , the Republican strategist , has put up posters of the president in her bedroom .
Some analysts say a stumble by the president and the Democrat - controlled Congress would give Republicans their best opportunity to recover .
" Republicans are counting on the Obama administration to disintegrate , to disappoint , very rapidly and very spectacularly , and a big popular movement of unhappiness with the administration to coalesce , " says David Frum , a speechwriter in the Bush White House .
Frum , who says the party has n't yet come to terms with its problems , has launched a website called newmajority .com to encourage a debate .
" There 's a lot of time and nothing wrong with the Republican Party that health care reform or the cap - and - trade ( energy plan ) or something like that blowing up would n't help fix , " Cook says .
At the moment , though , " Republicans are going through a wilderness period , and it may take a while to come out of it . "

Thanks to the growing popularity of Google Maps , a number of romantic messages etched and painted on the surface of the Earth have been captured from way up high and viewed by millions of people over the past 5 years or so .
You 've got to hand it to those responsible for these efforts : successful or not , it 's a grand gesture and a tough one to plan .
Some were written purely to be seen on websites such as Google Maps itself , others probably from aircraft as part of a less geeky plan .
Here are some of the best ...
1. I ♥ U
[ Above ]
We 'll start with the simplest message possible , as seen in a field in Thousand Oaks , California .
We 're unsure as to the artist 's identity and maybe this is a general declaration to the entire population ; we 're not sure .

Nicolas Sarkozy 's problem is that he has n't read enough Hegel .
Let me rephrase that : one of his problems is that he has n't read enough Hegel .
When the French president told a special session of parliament in Versailles earlier this week , " We can not accept to have in our country women who are prisoners behind netting , cut off from all social life , deprived of identity " , he would have done better to hold his tongue , and instead reflect on that passage in the Philosophy of Right in which Hegel distinguishes between abstract and concrete freedom .
The former means the freedom to do whatever you want , which , as you know , is the basis of western civilisation and why you can choose between 23 different kinds of coffee in your local cafe , or 32 different kinds of four - inch wedges the glossies tell you look sexy this summer but in none of which you can walk comfortably .
Such is the freedom of late capitalism , which seems to systematically strive to deprive us of an identity that we might construct ourselves .
For Hegel this is n't real freedom , because our wants and desires are determined by society .
By those lights , a western fashion victim is as much a sartorial prisoner as a woman in a burka .
Neither is really free .
Those that must buy what someone else tells them are this season 's must - haves are as much in mental chains as those who put on head - to - toe garment with netting for the eyes because of the strictures of the society to which they belong .
By real freedom , Hegel meant not doing whatever one wants but having the freedom from societal conditioning and the fatuous whirl of desires by using reason .
If you come across someone who manages to be really free in this sense in either capitalistic or strict Islamic society then send me their names so we can celebrate their escape .
None of us is really free in that sense .
I used to think otherwise .
I once wrote an article under the headline " If only we were more like the French : Call me a chippy atheist , but I 'd rather see a headscarf ban than Muslim ghettoes . "
I thought forcibly liberating people from their mental and sartorial shackles would make us free .
I was wrong .
Now I believe the creation of Muslim ghettoes is made more likely by official displays of intolerance towards what some Muslim women wear , that the social integration France overtly seeks through its policy of laïcité , or secularism , is less likely .
One of the reasons for this shift is because of thinking about what Hegel means about freedom in thesociety to which I belong .
Yes , but , you might well want to say , surely women who wear burkas are more oppressed than those who treat the sartorial laws of Grazia as though they were truly the words of God ( which , as you know , they are ) ?
None of what I 've said means that I feel anything but depressed when I see a woman in a burka , but that 's my problem , something that I can't resolve in the way Sarkozy suggests .
What 's striking in Sarkozy 's speech is that it is yet again a man who denounces women and presumes that they are cut off from social life .
They may be cut off from Sarkozy 's secular French society , and that may be difficult for allegedly tolerant western liberals , but they are not cut off from all society .
In fact they 're very much part of the society that many westerners despise as oppressing women .
Sarkozy 's remarks , though they 're bound to upset some of France 's five million Muslims , are consistent with French revolutionary culture and the tradition of laïcité that led , in 2004 , to the banning of headscarfs in French schools .
Does n't he realise then that his speech exemplifies an abstract freedom of expression which , in Hegelian terms , proceeds from social conditioning , not reason ?
It seems unlikely .
For French political culture , religion is tolerable only if it keeps itself to itself .
As soon as a person of faith tries to present what religion means for them in public in France , they risk being accused of fundamentalism .
Sarkozy now goes further , following revolutionary logic in not just chasing those who dress in ways he and French political culture finds intolerable out of public spaces , but pursuing those who dress in a way that is a rejection of western values even into their private worlds .
He said : " The burka is not a sign of religion , it is a sign of subservience .
It will not be welcome on the territory of the French republic . "
Even religious justification is bad enough , run the suppressed premises of this argument , but the absence of such despicable justifications is worse .
The woman in a burka is revealed as subservient to patriarchal culture .
She must be made free to choose to be more western .
Sarkozy proposes , in giving his backing to the establishment ofa parliamentary commission to look at whether to ban the wearing of burkas in public , that such imposed freedom would improve her lot .
French venerate such abstract freedoms .
We need n't .
They were , for Hegel , the basis of the revolution 's collapse into the Terror in which , he argued , individuals were sacrificed to the ill - conceived pursuit of abstract freedoms .
Sarkozy is thus a modern - day Robespierre , proposing some women – whom he presumes to have been silenced by patriarchal society and whose voices he does n't want to hear –be terrorised in the name of the kind abstract freedoms France has venerated for 210 years .
Let 's see if he succeeds .

Copyright Communism ?
In a 2005 interview , Bill Gates dismissed the free culture / open source movement as “ some new modern - day sort of communists who want to get rid of the incentive for musicians and moviemakers and software makers under various guises . ”
Never mind Gates ’ own hypocrisy on the subject .
Never mind that he developed Microsoft ’s BASIC compiler by a classic open source method : “ The best way to prepare is to write programs , and to study great programs that other people have written .
In my case , I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating systems . ”
Never mind that this enthusiastic dumpster diver had the nerve to write a letter to the Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter in 1976 , whining that the widespread infringment of BASIC was taking food out of his mouth ( “ most of you steal your software ” ) — despite being a multi-million dollar trust fund baby from birth .
Never mind what Gates practiced .
Many a fortune founded in robbery has been sanctified by time .
What matters , rather , is what he preaches : if you do n’t believe a return on effort should be guaranteed by the state , you ’re a communist .
But as the American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker observed more than a century ago , removing privilege and monopoly means that free market competition will cause the benefits of innovation to be “ socialized . ”
The normal process , in a free market without entry barriers , is for an innovator to derive short - term economic rents from being the first on the market , and for those rents then to decline to nothing as competitors adopt the innovation and drive price down to production cost .
So anyone who believes in genuinely free markets is a “ communist . ”
As many critics of “ intellectual property ” have pointed out , the term is inherently self - contradictory .
“ Intellectual property ” is fundamentally at war with the principles of genuine private property .
“ Intellectual property ” can only exist by infringing the rights of genuine , tangible property .
Copyrights and patents give the holder a de facto ownership right in other people ’s physical property , and prevents prohibits them from using their own property in ways that the copyright or patent holder has been granted a monopoly on .
And the reason for this , if you examine the assumptions behind IP law , is that the “ artist ” or “ innovator ” has a right to state - guaranteed returns on his investment or effort .
So if we ’re Copyright Communists , then Bill Gates and his good buddies at the RIAA and MPAA are Copyright Nazis .
Fascism is a system in which government guarantees a profit to favored business interests by protecting them — at gunpoint — from market competition .
The Copyright Nazis believe the creator ’s right to a profit trumps the right of people to enter the market freely and use their own property as they see fit .
We Copyright Communists believe everyone has the right to do what he wants with his own property , and that nobody is entitled to a profit from the state .
Copyright Nazism , on the other hand , is “ socialism ” of the perverse kind described by Noam Chomsky : socialized cost and privatized profit .
The real and genuine property of the many — their property in the fruits of their own labor , and their right to do with it as they will — is “ socialized ” for the benefit of the privileged .
Bill Gates ’ watchword , in short is Adam Smith ’s “ vile maxim of the masters of mankind , ” frequently quoted by Chomsky : “ all for ourselves .. and nothing for other people . ”
Another Adam Smith quote that ’s relevant to the Copyright Nazis : “ ‘ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”
I declare myself the enemy of Gates , the MPAA and RIAA , and a friend of Adam Smith .
If this be communism , then make the most of it .

So your garden ’s all planted , and your rows are marked .
Maybe you ’ve got some upside - down tomatoes going , and your compost bin is chugging right along .
You ’ve probably got quite a few thirsty plants to take care of !
Rainwater collection is controversial in certain parts of the U.S. .
If rainwater harvesting is allowed in your area , though , it ’s a great way to water your garden without drawing from the municipal water supply !
Store bought rain barrels can run you upwards of $ 100 .
Instead of dropping a ton of cash at the garden center , though , you can make your very own !
Some restaurants will even give you their used 55 gallon food grade containers for free , which are perfect for making a rain barrel .
Ask around … you might just be surprised !
Here ’s a great video from HGTV on how to build your own rain barrel , complete with a spigot :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/MGFDlkJOdaM&hl=en&fs=1&]
Those cinder blocks they ’re talking about are no joke .
Gravity is your friend , and it makes a big difference in terms of water pressure !
When we first installed our rain barrels , they were n’t up on blocks , and we had practically zero water coming out of the hose .
Those things are a hassle to move once they ’re installed , I promise , especially if you ’ve moved your gutter ’s downspout to accommodate the barrel .
If you ca n’t find a bucket with a top like they have in the video , no problem !
Just get a piece of screen that ’s large enough to fit over the top of your barrel and secure it with a gigantic rubber band , like this :

So here is my question for you guys :
Do you have a rain barrel that you ’ve decorated ?
Plain white or blue is fine , but our barrels sort of stand out in our garden , you know ?
I ’ve thought about planting some bushes in front of them , but it might be nice to incorporate the barrels rather than try to hide them .
What do you think ?
How do you say : “ Game , set , match ” in southern California ?
Here ’s how :
High court wo n’t hear county ’s marijuana challenge
via SignOnSanDiego.com
The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up San Diego County ’s challenge to state medical marijuana laws .
For more than three years the county has been fighting in court to overturn state laws that require counties to issue medical marijuana identification cards .
The county contends federal law , which does not recognize medical marijuana usage , trumps the state law .
The county has lost that argument in state trial and appellate courts , and the state Supreme Court declined to take up the case , too .
The county ’s last , long - shot chance was to have the U.S. Supreme Court take up the case .
San Bernardino and Merced counties initially joined the suit , but Merced eventually dropped out .
The high court also rejected San Bernardino ’s petition to take up the case .
In other words , the oft - heard prohibitionist refrain that federal law trumps state medical marijuana laws has no legal merit .
None . Nada .
Zero .
To anyone who has followed the unethical actions of the San Diego and San Bernardino Supervisors over the past three years , the Supreme Court ’s refusal to hear their appeal should n’t come as a surprise .
After all , the counties ’ vapid arguments had previously been struck down — unanimously — by the Superior Court of the state of California the 4th District Court of Appeals .
In addition , the Legislative Counsel of California , the state Attorney General ’s Office , and a majority of the California legislature had also previously determined that local politicians and law enforcement were obligated to uphold the provisions of California ’s medical marijuana laws .
Finally , California ’s constitution is also quite clear on this point — mandating that police have a sworn duty to uphold state law , not to enforce federal statutes .
Let ’s be blunt : San Diego and San Bernardino ’s protracted lawsuits — lawsuits that arguably cost county taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and jeopardized the health and safety of thousands ( if not tens of thousands ) of citizens — were never about resolving legal ambiguity .
Rather , it was about the arrogance and recalcitrance of those who willfully chose to abuse their power and position to hamstring the will of the voters , the legislature , and the courts .
And while this particular legal battle is now over , our outrage should n’t be .

Georgia and Alabama are now storing more than 1000 tons of the fly ash that leaked from a Tennessee coal fired power plant in December .
[ Creative Commons photo by Jim Combs ]
The spill , which dumped over 5.4 million cubic yards of toxic sludge in the area around the Kingston coal plant , was over 120 times larger than the Exxon Valdez .
It destroyed homes in the area and contaminated local water supplies .
Cleanup is still underway from the disaster six months later .
So why is the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) shipping tons of this toxic substance from Tennessee to Georgia and Alabama ?
There are two loads of the ash headed out of Tennessee : one to Taylor County in Georgia and the other to Perry County , Alabama .
They ’re using area landfills as testing sites for transporting and disposing of this dangerous substance , experimenting with different sorts of rail cars and storage .
The idea is to test for the safest way to dispose of the ash .
TVA authorities are saying that they ’re taking safety into account , but according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press :
The ash waste was stored in what Tennessee classifies as a Class II or industrial waste landfill behind TVA ’s Kingston Steam plant near Harriman [ … ] the spilled ash now will be taken to Class I municipal garbage landfills .
Georgia and Alabama solid waste officials confirmed [ this ]
Friday afternoon , but they said their landfills are double - lined with both clay and a synthetic barrier material .
They ’re sending the ash from an industrial dump site to nonhazardous landfills .
It just feels like the TVA still is n’t taking the risks from fly ash seriously , barrier material or not .
There was barrier material at Kingston , and we saw what happened there .
Coal ash is a highly toxic by - product of coal fired power plants .
It contains contaminants like lead and arsenic , and according to Scientific American , is more radioactive than nuclear waste .
Kingston - area residents have filed a $ 5 million class action lawsuit against the TVA for damages from the December spill .

Ok .
This again !
Naturally i do not know if Larry Silverstain ate breakfast every single day in WTC .
You do not know it too .
Who were his friends is hardly relevant .
Who ran security at WTC is also irrelevent since no security guard can stop aircraft diving into his building .
Or you say that there was no aircraft ?
Then who runs airport security is irelevent .
Odigo company issue is not true either .
There was a message recieved by two workers in office in Israel , it did not say anything about where / how something would happen , and it contained what is described as " anti-semitic " slur .
Immidietly after attack Israeli authorities and FBI were notified .
Now the true gem , which shows how good is this " research " - 4000 Israeli Jews working in WTC ?
Think about it for a second and you would realize how insane it is .
Even if there were 40000 workers in WTC , every tenth is Israeli Jew ?
And this is attacked by Mossad ???
The number 4000 comes because A ) There were about 4000 Israelis living in Manhatten area .
B ) People who did the same " research " either did not care , since it was good for their , completely innocent , point or simply did not know that Manhatten area and WTC area is not the same .
In 9/11 5 Israeli Jews were killed , and a lot of American Jews .
And ZIM pulling out was announced half a year earlier .
They lost 50000 $ ?
Wow , for multi-million company it was serious blow .
So for Jew to lease WTC area before 9/11 is suspicious .
For 49 percent Israeli - owned company to leave prior to 9/11 is suspicious .
What about Israeli Clearforest company that remained .
Is it also suspicious ?
About five dancing Israelis issue - there were three dancing .
Two set in the car .
Their got caught in one location - where they filmed and danced .
I did not find about cameras set up time , but there were numerous other films that caught the first plane , they were clearly set up before the attack .
There are rumors of truck with explosive traces , there is nothing that claims it was driven by Mossad agents and it clearly did not explode .
Do you know anybody in crowded NY that noticed truck exploding near him ?
Or tracks crashed into the buildings ?
Orthodox Jew owns a high - tech avionics company .
Wow .
And ?
It is the only company in the world that could convert a plane into drone ?
It had something to do with those Boings ?
How does it prove anything exept that Jew owns a high - tech avionic company ?
Remains of the buildings were sold by Jew .
Wow .
They should lie there until now , of course .
They arrived at China 5 months after attack .
Say , month to sail .
4 months is certainly not enough to take samples for explosives .
By the way , who sold this steel to Ratner ?
Since there is no name mentioned , it was not a Jew .
And clearly someone selling all this scraped steel to Ratner is not suspicious .
Someone buying it from X and reselling is guilty because he is a Jew .
How do you know that Philip Zelikow is a Israeli citizen ?
Was he born in Israel or do you know that he got Israeli citizenship later ?
What is wrong in Jew being had of 9/11 research team , he clearly is better researcher then " 4000 Israeli Jews working at WTC " people are - because you can not be worse .
Also , what are those 5 judges got to do with investigation in 9/11 ?
I do not get it .
Can you explain what they did to make / hide 9/11 ?
And the only results of 9/11 are NATO forces in Iraq ( which was enemy of Israel , but clearly not most important due to no border between the two ) and
NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Since if it was Israeli ( sorry , Jewish mafia ) plan - it was planned like evil murderous genius , executed like evil murderous genius , but results are no where to be seen .
I mean , 8 years later Obama is telling Israel no no on settlements .
What this plan then succeded to do ???
And naturally , there are no ?
Muslim fanatical terrorists , it is Israeli Mossad blowing up civilians in Iraq .
Very poor research in my opinion .
Except for 5 ( 3 ) dancing Israelis and moving firm in general - which is suspicious even to me - the only connection of other points is that people are Jewish .

Back in April , I mentioned a story about BTA , a bank in Kazakhstan that had been nationalized by the state in February .
The interesting bit about the story was that interested parties from abroad ( including Morgan Stanley ) had significant Credit Default Swap contracts ( CDS ) written against losses in the banks bonds .
In essence , foreign investors would be better off if BTA failed than if it had not been seized by the State .
And this interest in the bank ’s failure created a self - fulfilling prophecy .
See my post “ CDS contracts and the implosion of several Eastern European economies ” for more details .
Fast forward to today and now we learn of a gargantuan $ 7.9 billion loss at BTA .
DealBook reports :
BTA , the largest Kazakhstani bank , confirmed losses and write - downs for 2008 of $ 7.9 billion in a financial statement issued Monday , even as it pursues the restructuring of its debt .
According to the bank ’s financial statement , actions by previous management led its portfolio to deteriorate for the year , resulting in the loss of 1.188 trillion tenge , the Kazakh currency .
Explaining the causes of the loss , the bank said : Certain loan documentation , including collateral and associated additional agreements , primarily relating to financing of projects outside Kazakhstan , is no longer available .
In addition , many loans were transferred to new borrowers that do not have adequate sources of repayment .
Moreover , no collateral was provided by these new borrowers .
Consequently all transferred loans are unsecured .
A number of significant borrowers , primarily registered outside Kazakhstan , have ceased servicing their loans , have not allowed the Bank to monitor collateral or failed to provide information about their financial performance .
BTA spokespersons were not immediately available for comment .
Fraud is an issue and the bank is now being sued by shareholders .
But , I do want to concentrate on the CDS issue and its role in forcing the bank ’s hand .
In my view , CDS contracts should be seen as a major change in how parties to a bankruptcies react .
They distort incentives for interested parties , and create a whole new group of ‘ stakeholders ’ through naked CDS ( i.e. where the holders of the CDS have no underlying interest in the bonds ) .
In situations of systemic stress as we have just witnessed , CDS have the potential of increasing the number of bankruptcies and volatility in the financial system .
In my view , that is why they must be regulated – and not just in the United States , but globally , as this case in Kazakhstan attests .
If CDS contracts could help drive a major foreign company into bankruptcy and an American finance firm could suffer massive losses as a result ( not the case for Morgan Stanley here ) , I imagine this is something that U.S. regulators would want to know and prepare for .

Kazakh Bank Confirms $ 7.9 Billion in Losses – DealBook
Last week , the Obama administration released the Bush administration ’s legal memos , which authorized torture .
This week , we ’ve got a new Senate report on the subject of torture .
It ’s still somewhat sad and extremely disturbing that we ’re talking about the United States of America permitting torture .
But , that ’s what George Bush did to our country .
My initial take on the Senate report on torture is that it confrms the Bush crew was hellbent on torturing any suspected terrorist — even if it was n’t legal and did n’t work .
From the Washington Post :
Intelligence and military officials under the Bush administration began preparing to conduct harsh interrogations long before they were granted legal approval to use such methods — and weeks before the CIA captured its first high - ranking terrorism suspect , Senate investigators have concluded .
Previously secret memos and interviews show CIA and Pentagon officials exploring ways to break Taliban and al - Qaeda detainees in early 2002 , up to eight months before Justice Department lawyers approved the use of waterboarding and nine other harsh methods , investigators found .
The findings are contained in a Senate Armed Services Committee report scheduled for release today that also documents multiple warnings — from legal and trained interrogation experts — that the techniques could backfire and might violate U.S. and international law .
One Army lieutenant colonel who reviewed the program warned in 2002 that coercion “ usually decreases the reliability of the information because the person will say whatever he believes will stop the pain , ” according to the Senate report .
A second official , briefed on plans to use aggressive techniques on detainees , was quoted the same year as asking : “ Would n’t that be illegal ? ”
So , would n’t work and was illegal .
That should have thrown up a few red flags , but it did n’t stop the torture program from moving forward .
This report does indeed add momentum to the push for an investigation of what happened and how .
This is about the reputation of the United States .
We ca n’t let torturers go unpunished :
The new findings are expected to add further pressure on the White House to authorize an independent investigation of the Bush - era interrogation policies .
President Obama for the first time yesterday refused to rule out the possibility of a probe to determine whether government lawyers acted illegally in approving interrogation practices .
Obama said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. should determine whether they broke the law .
The government lawyers who broke the law would be a good start .
One of those lawyers , Jay Bybee , is now sitting as a federal appeals judge in the Ninth Circuit .
There are growing calls for his impeachment .
Yesterday , Senator Feingold said there are “ grouds for impeachment can be made . ”
Rep. Jerry Nadler is on board .
And , he chairs the House Judiciary Committee ’s subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties .
Whales , dolphins , seals and other marine mammals can generate their own heat and maintain a stable body temperature despite fluctuating environmental conditions .
Like people , they are endothermic homeotherms — or more colloquially , " warm - blooded . "
But these animals take thermoregulation to an extreme , enduring water temperatures as low as – 2 degrees Celsius ( 28.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) and air temperatures reaching – 40 degrees C ( – 40 degrees F ) .
How do they pull it off ?
And do n't they ever feel cold ?
Disputatore , one of ScientificAmerican.com 's fellow Twitterers recently asked , prompting us to investigate .
We talked to Ann Pabst , a marine zoologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington , who helped us understand how marine mammals survive the bitter cold .
[ An edited transcript of the interview follows . ]
How cold can liquid seawater get ?
Polar oceanic water can get as cold as about – 2 degrees C. Even seawater in temperate or tropical regions might drop as low as – 1 degree C [ 30.2 degrees F ] if you go deep enough below the surface .
[ You may be wondering why water at - 1 or - 2 degrees C is not ice .
Because seawater contains salt , it freezes at a slightly lower temperature than freshwater , which turns to ice at 0 degree C ( 32 degrees F ) .
This is because the sodium and chloride in salt actually interfere with the water molecules ' ability to come together and form ice crystals .
— Editor 's Note ]
Can whales , dolphins and other marine mammals thrive in these frigid waters ?
Certain species of pinnipeds — which include walruses , seals and sea lions — and some whales , dolphins and porpoises thrive in these conditions .
Specific examples include humpback whales , blue whales — the largest animals on Earth — killer whales , Weddell seals and elephant seals .
Is there any evidence they can " feel " the cold like humans do ?
Their skin is innervated with temperature - sensing nerve cells just as is the skin of any mammal . *
They certainly have the ability to sense temperature , but how that translates to what they feel [ whether they experience discomfort , for example ] is a hard question to answer .
But they certainly respond to temperature stimuli .
Whales and other marine mammals maintain a core body temperature similar to ours — about 37 degrees C ( 99 degrees F ) .
How do they manage to do this under such extreme conditions ?
They have two general types of responses : behavioral and physiological .
A typical behavior response is migration .
In the winter , pregnant right whales — which are endangered , partly a consequence of being entangled in fishing gear or being struck by boats — migrate from waters off Canada and New England to the coastal waters of Georgia and Florida to birth their young .
What are the physiological adaptations ?
One way of minimizing heat loss is to have a relatively low surface area–to - volume ratio : a small amount of skin — across which heat is exchanged with the environment — compared to a large volume of body tissue — which generates heat .
Large animals tend to have lower surface area–to - volume ratios , and most marine mammals are pretty big .
Among the smallest : otters , which are roughly equal in size to large house cats .
Marine mammals also have excellent insulation in the form of fur or blubber .
The sea otter has the densest hair of any mammal known : 130,000 hairs per square centimeter of skin [ That 's about as many hairs on an entire human head ! ] .
Fur insulates most efficiently when it 's dry because it traps air , a good insulator .
Water , in contrast , is a pretty efficient heat conductor ; it transfers heat away from a body some 25 times faster than air .
The otter 's hair is so dense it manages to trap a layer of air just above the skin even when the animal is swimming .
Animals that spend most of their time in water rely more on blubber , a layer of tissue containing fat , collagen and elastin that provides , among other things , insulation and energy storage like human fat .
The amount of blubber varies from one animal to the next .
Newborn harbor porpoises pack the most ; some 43 percent of their total body mass is blubber .
Do marine mammals ever die as a result of being exposed to extreme temperatures ?
Animals suffering from poor nutrition or health status might have trouble maintaining a healthy blubber supply , both in terms of quantity and quality — as measured by fat content — and thus could die from exposure to extreme temperatures .
Or , if they find themselves displaced from their natural habitats , they might succumb to extreme temperatures .
But it is unlikely this would occur among healthy wild animals .

Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Dr. George Tiller , who was murdered at his church in Kansas this week .
Dr. Tiller demonstrated remarkable courage by refusing to be intimidated by bullets , arson and years of harassment , instead providing the reproductive health services that women urgently needed .
The women who sought his care often had no other place to turn , and he did not let them down .
He will be remembered as a man of real courage and deep compassion .
This terrible tragedy is a chilling reminder of what can happen when the debate over women 's reproductive health is conducted without responsible bounds and without recognition that people of conscience can hold different views .
We condemn the unspeakable murder of Dr. Tiller and urge vigorous prosecution of his killer .
We hope that other doctors and other health care providers will refuse to be intimidated and instead provide the abortion and other reproductive health services that women need .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : hyena
I am pleased to announce the first release of hyena , a library for building web servers , based on the work on iteratee style I/O by Oleg Kiselyov .
The library allows you to create web servers that consume their input incrementally , without resorting to lazy I /O .
This should lead to more predictable resource usage .
This is an early alpha release so expect the API to change in the future .
In particular , I 'm working on converting the current definition of iteratees / enumerators used to the one in the iteratee package [ 1 ] .
I decided to release this version , based on a simple left fold , due to requests by several people who already started using hyena .
Get it : cabal install hyena And on Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org//package/hyena

Google Chrome is moving fast .
Version 2.0 was stabilized just six months after 1.0 , and auto - updates have ensured that nearly all users are using the newest version of the browser within days of a release .
As a web developer , it can be a bit daunting that the browser version changes so fast :
What if the new version breaks something ?
How can I be prepared for changes that will affect my sites ?
To answer these questions , it 's helpful to know how Google Chrome releases are made , the relationship between " dev , " " beta , " and " stable " update channels , and how you can test new versions .
In this post , we 'll be expanding on Mark Larson 's earlier explanation of the update channel system
Stable channel .
As Mark outlines , the Stable channel is , well , stable .
As a web developer , that means that as long as the major version — the " 2 " in " version 2.0.181.1 " — does n't change , you can count on Stable channel builds to use the same versions of WebKit ( CSS , layout , etc. ) , V8 ( JavaScript ) , and other components that might affect how a page loads or renders .
Stable updates between major version releases are generally focused on addressing security issues , fixing egregious bugs , and improving stability .
The big developer - facing bits of the browser wo n't change on the Stable channel until the next major version is released , and you can always preview upcoming changes using the Beta channel .
Beta channel .
As a web developer , being on the Beta channel will ensure that you can test your sites with the next version of Google Chrome 's rendering behavior before it 's sent to the Stable channel and into the hands of most users .
Whenever a major version lands in the Beta channel , the versions of WebKit , V8 , networking , and the other systems that affect how web pages load and render generally become fixed .
These versions may change during the major version 's beta cycle , but changes are usually incremental fixes to help stabilize a feature rather than changes in behavior .
New versions of WebKit may be introduced during a beta period , but those versions are always accompanied by a new build number ( e.g. 2.0.169.xx vs. 2.0.172.xx ) and are unlikely to differ drastically .
As this major version moves closer to a stable release , these kinds of changes become more and more infrequent .
Since Google Chrome development moves so quickly , you should stay on the Beta channel to catch compatibility issues ahead of time .

Since Google Chrome development moves so quickly , you should stay on the Beta channel to catch compatibility issues ahead of time .
Dev channel .
The Dev channel is where the sausage gets made .
Dev releases happen frequently , and they track what 's happening upstream in WebKit , V8 , and other relevant systems very closely .
This means that changes that might affect rendering , performance , and layout are likely to occur on the Dev channel on a regular basis .
We do n't recommend that you install the Dev channel if you 're looking to maintain site compatibility , since tracking breaking changes as they happen can be a major headache .
You should be able to spot any problems early enough via the Beta channel .
Users are on the Stable channel by default .
To get onto the Beta or Dev channel , follow these instructions .
Once you change to a less stable channel , e.g. from Stable to Dev , there is n't a supported " downgrade " path .
If you change from the less stable channel back to a more stable one , Google Chrome will simply stop updating until your new channel " catches up " with the installed build .
To force an immediate downgrade , uninstall and reinstall using an appropriate installer .
This may occasionally cause errors when your more stable ( older ) version tries to read the newer user data left over from the previous installation .
< object > and < embed > parameters ; check for illegal markup ; and avoid browser - specific CSS .
Once you have a copy of Google Chrome , you can test your site 's compatibility .
Google Doctype has a helpful FAQ on best practices for Google Chrome compatibility .
In short , prefer object detection over userAgent string parsing ; do n't rely on pixel - accurate font and element sizes ; declare your pages ' encodings correctly ; double checkandparameters ; check for illegal markup ; and avoid browser - specific CSS .

Changes in 1.6.0_14 ( 6u14 )
The full internal version number for this update release is 1.6.0_14-b08 ( where " b " means " build " ) .
The external version number is 6u14 .
OlsonData 2009g
6u14 contains Olson time zone data version 2009g .
For more information , refer to Timezone Data Versions in the JRE Software .
Security Baseline
6u14 specifies the following security baselines for use with Java Plug - in technology :
JRE Family Version Java SE Security Baseline Java SE for Business Security Baseline 5.0 1.5.0_18 1.5.0_18 1.4.2 1.4.2_19 1.4.2_20
On October 30 , 2008 , Java SE 1.4.2 reached its end of service life with the release of 1.4.2_19 .
Future revisions of Java SE 1.4.2 ( 1.4.2_20 and above ) include the Access Only option and are available to Java SE for Business subscribers .
For more information about the security baseline , see Deploying Java Applets With Family JRE Versions in Java Plug - in for Internet Explorer .
Additional Supported System Configurations
For 6u14 , support has been added for the following system configurations :
Windows Server 2008 SP2
Windows Vista with SP2
Refer to the Supported System Configurations page .
Service Tag Support
Service Tag support on Solaris and Linux was added in version 1.6.0_04 .
JRE 1.6.0_14 extends Service Tag support to Windows .
If Service Tag software has been installed on a system where JRE 1.6.0_14 is being installed , a unique service tag is automatically created for that particular JRE instance .
There is no change in the JDK / JRE installation instruction , and there is no change in the Java runtime .
Blacklist Jar Feature
Support for blacklisting signed jar files has been added to 6u14 .
A blacklist is a list of signed jars that contain serious security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by untrusted applets or applications .
A system - wide blacklist will be distributed with each JRE release .
Java Plugin and Web Start will consult this blacklist and refuse to load any class or resource contained in a jar file that 's on the blacklist .
By default , blacklist checking is enabled .
The deployment.security.blacklist.check deployment configuration property can be used to toggle this behavior .
The blacklist entries are the union of the blacklist files pointed to by the deployment.system.security.blacklist and deployment.user.security .blacklist properties .
By default , deployment.system.security .
blacklist points to the blacklist file in the jre / lib / security directory , and deployment.user .security .
blacklist points to a blacklist file that contains additional entries added by a user .
The blacklist is a text file with the following format :
attribute : value
Each jar file on the blacklist is identified by the x -Digest - Manifest attribute where x is the name of the MessageDigest algorithm , and the value is the base64 encoded hash value of the Manifest .
Comments are denoted by lines starting with the # ( number ) symbol .
Here is an example :
Copy # Buggy Utilities , version 1.0 SHA1 - Digest - Manifest : QONXbQg+EtNOguIOAgpUUOadhv8= # Malware Inc. , version 99.99 SHA - 256 - Digest - Manifest : SewaudBCZ3iXt1KX0BeFHpQiiM1xYLtvLw3Ow2RJfcs=
Java HotSpot VM 14.0
6u14 includes version 14.0 of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine , which provides improved reliability , serviceability and performance .
Contributing to increased performance in this release are numerous enhancements to HotSpot 's optimizing compiler , more efficient SoftReference processing and improvements to Parallel Compacting garbage collection .
Optionally available are two new features - escape analysis and compressed object pointers .
A preliminary version of the new Garbage First ( G1 ) garbage collector is also included .
Optimization Using Escape Analysis The -XX : +DoEscapeAnalysis option directs HotSpot to look for objects that are created and referenced by a single thread within the scope of a method compilation .
Allocation is omitted for such non-escaping objects , and their fields are treated as local variables , often residing in machine registers .
Synchronization on non-escaping objects is also elided .
Compressed Object Pointers
The -XX : +UseCompressedOops option can improve performance of the 64 - bit JRE when the Java object heap is less than 32 gigabytes in size .
In this case , HotSpot compresses object references to 32 bits , reducing the amount of data that it must process .
Garbage First ( G1 ) Garbage Collector Garbage First , or G1 , is a low pause , server style collector .
G1 's primary advantages over the Concurrent Mark - Sweep ( CMS ) collector include incremental compaction , better predictability and ease of use .
G1 is available as early access in this release , please try it and give us feedback .
Usage in production settings without a Java SE for Business support contract is not recommended .
To try G1 , specify these command line options : -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX : +UseG1GC
In addition , the following options can be used to affect G1's behaviour :
To set the max GC pause time goal in milliseconds that G1 will attempt to meet : -XX: MaxGCPauseMillis=<X >
To set the time interval over which GC pauses totaling up to MaxGCPauseMillis may take place : -XX:GCPauseIntervalMillis=<X >
Improvement TreeMap Iteration
6u14 includes an experimental implementation of java.util .
TreeMap that can improve the performance of applications that iterate over TreeMaps very frequently .
This implementation is used when running with the - XX : + AggressiveOpts option .
JAX WS 2.1.6 and JAXB 2.1.10
JAX - WS 2.1.6 and JAXB 2.1.10 are integrated into JDK 6u14 .
Refer also to CR 6803688 .
JavaDB 10.4.2.1
6u14 contains the new 10.4.2.1 version of Java DB .
Java VisualVM
Updates
6u14 contains the following updates to Java VisualVM :
CPU usage and GC activity graph in the Monitor tab
Table view in the Threads tab
Command line options : -- openpid , --openjmx , --openfile
Compare Memory Snapshots action in the context menu
Copy To Clipboard / Save To File buttons in the About dialog
Monitoring IBM JVM via JMX connection
Based on NetBeans Platform 6.5 and NetBeans Profiler 6.5
Faster computation of references , and improved readability of path to GC root in HeapWalker
Improved integration of the Visual GC tool
Click for a list of Java VisualVM bug fixes related to this release .
Debug Issue
Java ™ Virtual Machine Tool Interface ( JVM TI ) breakpoints are reliable only when either the Parallel Scavenge garbage collector ( - XX : +UseParallelGC ) or the Parallel Compacting garbage collector ( - XX : +UseParallelOldGC ) is used .
When other collectors are used , breakpoints may stop functioning , and JVM TI object tags may become unusable after a full GC operation is performed .
Java ™ Debug Interface ( JDI ) ThreadReferences have an embedded thread ID that depends on JVM TI object tags , thus the embedded thread ID may change unexpectedly .
This may cause confusion in thread based JDI events .
Note that the Serial garbage collector ( - XX : + UseSerialGC ) is vulnerable to this problem and is selected by default on some platforms .
The work around is to explicitly select the Parallel Scavenge collector using the command line option - XX : +UseParallelGC .
( Refer to 6862295 . )
Issue with JDK Silent Installation
Prior to 6u14 , the JDK installer was never fully supported silently .
One of the side effects of silent JDK installation is that it does not install the public JRE .
It used to cache / install a jre.msi file .
Apparently some users have been using the jre.msi without our documentation or approval .
As of 6u14 , we no longer cache the file .
As a workaround to the JDK not installing the public JRE when in silent mode , we recommend also bundling up and launching the stand - alone JRE installer from the JSC download site .
We intend to provide full silent JDK installer support in 6u15 , under the following CR : 6845077 - silent JDK should install JRE / Java DB silently
Possible Issue for Java Web Start Applications
In 6u14 Java Web Start , if you specify an insecure Java system property in a sandbox JNLP file , Java Web Start fails to launch and notifies that JARs in the sandbox JNLP file are not signed .
A workaround is to remove the insecure property ( which was ignored by all previous versions of Java Web Start ) .

There was some sort of trend at E3 2009 towards getting gamers off their collective ass - flesh .
Microsoft debuted it ’s full body / no controller Project Natal while Sony offered their magic wand / raver glow stick hybrid dubbed the… well , nothing .
They ’re just calling it the PS3 motion controller .
I ’m sure by the time it ’s released they ’ll be calling it the “ Cyber Lance ” or “ Excitement Bulb ” or something .
Not being an active gamer , these products hold little promise for me for future entertainment , but I am quite intrigued by the technology involved .
Microsoft has opted to do away with the controller completely ( a ballsy yet foolish movie IMO ) so that you can swipe furiously at menus , roundhouse kick your gamer tag to log in and scream movie preferences at your TV with all the fervor and zeal of someone who ’s been on the phone with a Discover card voice - robot for 45 minutes ( I think you said “ Cock Shitting Fuck Mouthed Piece of Shit …
If that is correct say “ Yes ” or Press 1 ) .
Their tech - demo was impressive but I really do n’t see it translating well into an actual living room gaming experience .
Although , finale getting to act out a “ Hadouken ” and having it actually accomplish something other than confused stares from the cats would be pretty sweet .
I think Sony actually came a lot closer to creating something people can actually use to play games .
Their “ web cam tracks the glowing orb in 3d space ” tech makes a lot more sense to me than the Wii ’s clumsier set up .
Plus , you need buttons .
That ’s just how it is .
Why would anyone think it ’s easier to cartwheel across your living room than to hit A or X ?
Unfortunately , everyone already has an X - Box 360 ( I do n’t even have one and I HAVE ONE ) so their arm flapping , high kicking back injury inducing system will probably prevail ( if any of them do ) .
Oh , and Nintendo ( Intenda to you Grandma ’s in 1988 ) made a heart monitor that you ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CLIP ON YOUR PENIS .
Big deal .
Do any of these new control schemes excite you ?
Would you buy a system you did n’t already have to take adantage of one ?
Anything else from E3 that got your geek juices flowing ?
Why am I doing a gaming comic ?
UPDATE : Lots of FB E3 09 talk on the Forum
The EFF 's recent amicus filing in the case of Warshak v. United States got quite a bit of mileage out of a nice quote from the Department of Justice 's surveillance manual , which contains language that appears to clearly forbid the kind of " back door wiretap " of the plaintiff 's e-mail that got the FBI in hot water with civil liberties groups over the course of this long - running and important case .
Now the EFF appears to be looking to get its hands on a copy of the equivalent manual for the FBI — the agency 's Domestic Investigative Operational Guidelines , which details the rules of the road for FBI - run domestic surveillance .
The only problem is that its contents are a secret .
So , the EFF is filing suit to have the manual 's contents released to the public .
" The Attorney General 's Guidelines are troubling , allowing for open investigative ' assessments ' of any American without factual basis or reasonable suspicion , " said EFF Senior Counsel David Sobel in an EFF statement .
" The withholding of the Operational Guidelines compounds our concerns .
Americans have the right to know the basic surveillance policies used by federal investigators and how their privacy is — or is not — being protected . "
But maybe you prefer to trust the DBI to police itself and to follow its own ( secret ) guidelines for surveillance in a way that respects the constitution .
In this case , I point you to Tim Lee 's account of the FBI 's long - running struggle to stop its rampant , well - documented abuse of the controversial National Security Letters , which act as a sort of subpoena , but without the judge .
Lee quotes the Office of the Inspector General report that brought the whole sorry mess to light in 2007 , which describes the FBI not only misused NSLs , but on many occasions did n't even bother with the NSL fig leaf :
On over 700 occasions the FBI obtained telephone billing records or subscriber information from 3 telephone companies without first issuing NSLs or grand jury subpoenas .
Instead , the FBI issued so - called " exigent letters " signed by FBI Headquarters Counterterrorism Division personnel who were not authorized to sign NSLs .
The letters stated that the records were requested due to " exigent circumstances " and that subpoenas requesting the information had been submitted .
Since the passage of the Patriot Act , the FBI has been busted time and time again for a combination of incompetence , secrecy , and disregard for the rule of law .
So let 's hope that the EFF can at least get its hands on the document that lays out the agency 's own internal rules for domestic surveillance , so that the public can at least have a fighting chance of knowing if the agency follows its own guidelines .
The recipe described in this post demonstrates how to write foreground and background colored text in a Windows Command Line with Python and ctypes .
I originally wrote this recipe in the , now defunct , ctypes wiki .
The wiki exists only as a read only archive as it has been " spammed to death " .
I decided to update the corresponding code and to publish it on my personal web site .
ctypes is a foreign function library for Python written by Thomas Heller .
It is part of the Python standard library since Python 2.5 , but works also with Python 2.3 and 2.4 provided that you download the corresponding libraries available from SourceForge .
Often overlooked on Windows , command line programs are very powerful , but at times , a little boring or simply overwhelming when too much information is displayed at once .
Having the ability to change the color and intensity of the text allows to bring contrast to the information output on the screen .
for example , UPX ( the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables ) takes advantage of this concept and it inspired me to introduce this feature into my Python command line programs .
Coloring text in a command line window is not available by default in Python .
Using ctypes allows to call the appropriate Win32 library functions , in particular SetConsoleTextAttributes and GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo ( see resources for more information on these functions ) .
Here is a code example showing a simple approach to wrap the SetConsoleTextAttributes and GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo functions :
color_console.py
" " " Colors text in console mode application ( win32 ) .
Uses ctypes and Win32 methods SetConsoleTextAttribute and GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo .
$ Id : color_console.py 534 2009-05-10 04:00:59Z andre $ " " " from ctypes import windll , Structure , c_short , c_ushort , byref SHORT = c_short WORD = c_ushort class COORD ( Structure ) : " " " struct in wincon.h .

= 0x0060 BACKGROUND_GREY = 0x0070 BACKGROUND_INTENSITY
= 0x0080 # background color is intensified .
stdout_handle = windll.kernel32.GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE ) SetConsoleTextAttribute = windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTextAttribute GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo = windll.kernel32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo def get_text_attr ( ) : " " " Returns the character attributes ( colors ) of the console screen buffer . " " " csbi = CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO ( ) GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo(stdout_handle , byref ( csbi ) ) return csbi.wAttributes def set_text_attr( color ) : " " " Sets the character attributes ( colors ) of the console screen buffer .
Color is a combination of foreground and background color , foreground and background intensity . " " "
SetConsoleTextAttribute ( stdout_handle , color )
Using the module above to bring some colors to the Windows console can be achieved in Python 2.6 with the following code :
test_color.py ( Python 2.6 )
" " " Test module color_console ( Python 2.6 ) .
Does not work with Python 3.0 ( mainly due to the usage of print .
In Python 3.0 print is a builtin function and no more a statement . " " " import color_console as cons def test ( ) : " " " Simple test for color_console . " " " default_colors = cons.get_text_attr ( ) default_bg = default_colors & 0x0070 cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_BLUE
| default_bg | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY ) print '=========================================== ' cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_BLUE
| cons.BACKGROUND_GREY | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY | cons.BACKGROUND_INTENSITY ) print ' And Now for Something ' , cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_RED
| cons.BACKGROUND_GREY | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY | cons.BACKGROUND_INTENSITY ) print ' Completely Different ! ' , cons.set_text_attr(default_colors ) print cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_RED
| default_bg | cons.
FOREGROUND_INTENSITY ) print '===========================================' cons.set_text_attr( default_colors ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : test ( )
In Python 3.0 , some slight changes are necessary and we obtain :
test_color.py ( Python 3 )
" " " Test module color_console ( Python 3.0 ) .
Does not work with Python 2.6 . " " " import color_console as cons import sys def test ( ) : " " " Simple Pyton 3.0 test for color_console . " " " default_colors = cons.get_text_attr ( ) default_bg = default_colors & 0x0070 default_fg = default_colors & 0x0007 cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_BLUE
| default_bg | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY ) print( '===========================================') cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_BLUE
| cons.BACKGROUND_GREY | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY | cons.BACKGROUND_INTENSITY ) print ( ' And Now for Something ' , end= ' ') sys.stdout.flush ( ) #
Force writing first part of the line in blue cons.set_text_attr( cons .FOREGROUND_RED
| cons.BACKGROUND_GREY | cons.FOREGROUND_INTENSITY | cons.BACKGROUND_INTENSITY ) print ( ' Completely Different !' ) cons.set_text_attr(default_colors ) cons.set_text_attr(cons.FOREGROUND_RED
| default_bg | cons.
FOREGROUND_INTENSITY ) print( '===========================================' ) cons.set_text_attr( default_colors ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : test ( )
It is possible to write the test code compliant with both Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 , but I like to use the natural " Python way " and as such prefer to use the new Python 3.0 features where they are and how they are .

Russia 's energy giant Gazprom has signed a $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.53 bn ) deal with Nigeria 's state operated NNPC , to invest in a new joint venture .
The new firm , to be called Nigaz , is set to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations in Nigeria .
***
As well as forming Nigaz , Russia is keen on developing a trans -African pipeline to transport Nigerian gas to Europe .
***
Sergei Novikov , a spokesman for Rosatom , Russia 's state - run civil nuclear energy agency , said the Nigaz deal would lay the foundations for building nuclear power reactors in Nigeria .

Natural property rights reflect scarcity , while artificial property rights create it
Artificial property rights in land give the proprietor property rights in the labour of others .
Capitalism could not exist without artificial property rights .
if this is a point for the market system against state planning , it is also a point for the market system against the internal hierarchy of the corporation .
have the courage to tell the masses what no politician tells them ;
You are inferior and all the improvements in your conditions ... you owe to the effort of men who are better than you .
hierarchy is a primitive mechanism for getting people to perform tasks which they have no rational interest in performing .
in favour of complex technologies that can be safely wielded by a priesthood
massive state intervention might also have tipped the balance between alternative forms of productive technology
Evaluating the functions of the state in terms of the class purpose they serve makes it easier to understand the importance of dismantling them in the proper order .
This latest work by Kevin Carson , expands many of the themes found in his groundbreaking STUDIES IN MUTUALIST POLITICAL ECONOMY published in 2004 .
In ORGANIZATION THEORY Carson first examines the literature on the economics of scale and finds the giant corporation to be highly inefficient .
State intervention is the factor that allows the corporation to overcome this disadvantage .
He next exposes the different variety of government policies which gave rise to and aided the growth of economic centralization and giantism .
In Part Two he examines the systemic effects and in Part Three examines the internal effects of top - down organization and centralization .
There are three major problems , 1 . the problem of having accurate knowledge 2 . the problem of economic calculation given inaccurate knowledge 3 . authoritarian irrationality and internal crises .
He also tears into management fads and other attempts to reform the managerial system .
Decentralist alternatives to capitalism and authoritarian management are discussed in Part Four .
These involve the abolition of state - granted privilege and the dissolution of the state into society .
The potential for a libertarian economy that lies within the coming Peak Oil crisis and the new technologies and systems that make capitalism obsolete are examined , as are worker cooperatives and the provision of social services without the state .
Carson comes from a Mutualist anarchist perspective .
But his critique of capitalism and the alternatives he presents are useful and applicable to the entire spectrum of anarchist and libertarian socialist thought .
It is a devastating examination of the arguments put forth by capitalism 's “ libertarian ” , liberal and neo-liberal apologists .
This is truly a book that no anarchist or socialist should be without .
Some highlights from ORGANIZATION THEORY : Mass production flooded America with goods , destroying local manufacturing , and creating a problem of over - production .
To sell all these products , the " push model " of marketing with advertising , packaging and branding was created .
The Sloan System of management at GM adopted in the 1920's , put manufacturing second , marketing first .
Thus production was subservient to a marketing plan or strategy .
Hence , contrary to the apologists of corporatism , the corporate economy is a planned economy .
The plutocratic system developed originally as the new capitalist class amalgamated with the land owners .
Its legal basis lies with the creation of " artificial property rights " created by government .
Natural property rights involve use – working vacant land , for example ..
Since land had been expropriated by landlords , it is very difficult for workers to create wealth on their own .
The guru of neo-liberalism , Friedrich Von Hayek , claimed that central state planning cannot work well due to problems of knowledge .
Carson responds , Ludwig Von Mises , believed that double entry book keeping solved all managerial problems .
So why not a centrally planned economy , if all managerial problems are solved ?
asks Carson .
The highly authoritarian nature of Mise 's " libertarianism " , is revealed in the following quote .
[ Corporate managers ]... If hierarchy works so well , why not put the CEO 's in charge of a centrally planned economy ?
But in the real world that exists outside of the brain farts of economists and management gurus , Steam and water power concentrated industry for obvious reasons .
Electricity sent by power lines could be used anywhere and thus allowed for decentralized and small scale production .
According to Carson , 10,000 people could be self - sufficient with no factory larger than 100 employees .
But the corporate structure refused to go that route .
The system selects against simple technologies ....
Furthermore , Apologists for corporate capitalism reject small scale and worker - managed production .
They claim workers have shorter time horizons than capitalists , which must be the bad joke of the century , coming from people whose time horizon is the next quarterly profit statement .
Small farming is stawmanned as being like subsistence farming as it was , not how it would have been minus rents , enclosures and state support for agribusiness , not to mention innovations like intensive gardening , composting , hydroponics etc .
What hinders the development of human - scale and anti-authoritarian alternatives is not a lack of organizations , but an overabundance of them .
A way to overcome capitalist hegemony in the cooperative / social economy is to create linkages between the organizations – a need to start functioning as a cohesive counter - economy .
In spite of the problems of realization , it is increasingly impossible for capitalism to prevent people turning to small scale and household production .
Ever more people are living unplugged and off the grid .
The present economy is fundamentally state capitalist , and as libertarians it is our objective to dismantle the state , and with it , the corporatist economy .
But attacking any aspect of the state must not be our goal .
Dismantle first the structures that facilitate exploitation .
When the working population is free from exploitation , then the existing social welfare measures can be converted into forms of non-governmental mutual aid .

A galaxy of luminaries from the disparate worlds of science , comedy , the arts and humanities – from Ricky Gervais to the president of the Royal Society – have come out in support of a science writer who is being sued by chiropractors for saying they practise " bogus treatments " .
Dr Simon Singh allegedly libelled the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) in an article claiming the association is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes " bogus " therapies .
The BCA demanded an apology and a retraction , and in its libel action won a preliminary court ruling against Dr Singh last month .
In it , Mr Justice Eady ruled that Dr Singh 's use of the word " bogus " meant he was accusing the BCA of being dishonest and backing treatments it knew did not work .
He refutes this , saying that " alternative therapists who offer treatments unsupported by reasonable evidence are deluded rather than deliberately dishonest " .
Dr Singh announced yesterday that he intends to appeal against the ruling , which has already cost him about £ 100,000 in legal fees but won him the backing of more than 100 prominent figures – including a Nobel laureate .

The signatories to the statement in support of Dr Singh include Gervais , the actor Stephen Fry , the scientist Richard Dawkins , Lord Rees of Ludlow , president of the Royal Society , former government chief scientist Sir David King , the novelist Martin Amis and the comedian and doctor Harry Hill .
" We , the undersigned , believe that it is inappropriate to use the English libel laws to silence critical discussion of medical practice and scientific evidence , " the statement reads .
" The English law of libel has no place in scientific disputes about evidence .
The BCA should discuss the evidence outside of a courtroom . "
Yesterday , Dr Singh 's supporters spoke out against the BCA 's decision to launch legal action against an individual with no financial support .
" When a powerful organisation tries to silence a man of Simon Singh 's reputation [ he was made an MBE in 2003 for services to science ] then anyone who believes in science , fairness and truth should rise in indignation , " Mr Fry said .
Professor Dawkins added : " The English libel laws are an international laughing stock , and the effects are especially pernicious where science is concerned . "
While Sir David said : " It is ridiculous that a legal and outmoded definition of a word has been used to hinder and discourage scientific debate .
We must be able to fairly and reasonably challenge ideas without fear of legal intimidation .
This sort of thing only brings the law into disrepute . "
Chiropractice is the quasi- scientific treatment of medical problems by manipulating the spine , although many disorders treated by chiropractors are not normally associated with a bad back .
One of its information leaflets , entitled Happy Families , says : " There is evidence to show that chiropractic care has helped children with asthma , prolonged crying , breathing difficulties , bed - wetting , colic , sleep and feeding problems , hyperactivity [ and ] frequent infections , especially in the ears . "
Dr Singh 's article questioned the scientific evidence to support such a statement , saying that he can confidently label the treatments as " bogus " because he has researched them while working on a book on alternative medicine with Professor Edzard Ernst of Exeter University , the world 's first professor of complementary medicine .
The BCA said that it intends to pursue its claim against Dr Singh , who replied by saying that if his attempt to appeal against the preliminary ruling fails , he will take his case to the European Court of Human Rights .

Strange world of the father of chiropractice
* Chiropractice is the manipulation of the spine to treat a range of problems not associated with a bad back .
It was invented by Daniel David Palmer of Davenport , Iowa , at the turn of the 20th century after he claimed to have cured an office janitor , Harvey Lillard , of deafness by " racking " his back .
Palmer , known as " DD " , said that Lillard had been deaf for 17 years after he had strained his back .
" I reasoned that if that vertebra was replaced , the man 's hearing should be restored , " he said .
" I racked it into position by using the spinous process as a lever and soon the man could hear as before . "
* After an unsuccessful earlier career in " magnetic healing " , Palmer switched to spine manipulation , which his close friend the Rev Samuel H Weed called chiropractice after the Greek words for " hand " and " practice " , meaning " done by hand " .
* Palmer wanted to turn chiropractice into a new religion , with himself at the helm , and openly likened himself to Martin Luther , Mohamed and Christ : " I am the fountainhead .
I am the founder of chiropractice in its science , in its art , in its philosophy and in its religious phase . "
* He practised racking the spines on his many children – he was married six times – and his over - enthusiasm with physical punishment sometimes landed him in trouble with the police .
* Palmer died in 1913 after being run over by a car allegedly driven by one of his sons , Bartlett .
According to a mag called Netbook Italia ( which might have something to do with computers )
Samsung is developing a new NVIDIA Ion - powered netbook platform , with the first such device making the scene in Europe as early as July .
The N510 boasts a 1.66 GHz N280 processor , 11.6 - inch WXGA display , 1GB RAM , 160GB hard drive , WiFi , Bluetooth , 3 - in - 1 card reader , and a 6 - cell battery .
The addition of a GPU should help out quite a bit when viewing HD video , although we 're guessing this could take its toll on battery life .
Either way , we 'll find out soon enough .
According to CNET , Samsung has confirmed the N510 ( with the above specs ) for a July release .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is on the verge of declaring the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years , but wants to ensure countries are well prepared to prevent a panic , its top flu expert said on Tuesday .

Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director - general , voiced concern at the sustained spread of the new H1N1 strain -- including more than 1,000 cases in Australia -- following major outbreaks in North America , where it emerged in April .
Confirmed community spread in a second region beyond North America would trigger moving to phase 6 -- signifying a full - blown pandemic -- from the current phase 5 on the WHO ’s 6 - level pandemic alert scale .
“ The situation has really evolved a lot over the past several days .
We are getting really very close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , or I think , declaring that we are in a pandemic situation , ” Fukuda told a teleconference .
Fukuda said a move to phase 6 would reflect the geographic spread of the new disease .
“ It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased or that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now , ” he said .
A decision to declare a pandemic involved more than simply making an announcement , he said .
The United Nations agency had to ensure that countries were able to deal with the new situation and also handle any public reaction .
“ One of the critical issues is that we do not want people to ‘ over - panic ’ if they hear that we are in a pandemic situation .
That they understand , for example , that the current assessment of the situation is that this is a moderate level , ” Fukuda said .
The WHO and its 193 member states are working hard to prepare for a pandemic , for instance developing vaccines and building up supplies of anti-viral drugs , he said .
The disease , which has infected over 26,500 people in 73 countries , with 140 deaths , has been most severe in Mexico , which has reported the highest number of fatalities , more than 100 .
These include infections in otherwise healthy young people .
PRESSURE ON HOSPITALS
A very real danger after declaring a pandemic was that hospitals could be overwhelmed by people seeking help when they did not really need it , while other patients requiring emergency treatment risked being neglected , according to Fukuda .
“ In earlier pandemics , in earlier outbreaks , we have often seen that people who are in the category of being worried but who are not particularly sick , have overrun hospitals , ” he said .
Since the new flu strain first appeared , many people have stopped eating pork , pigs have been culled in some countries , trade bans on meat imposed , travelers quarantined , and some countries have discussed closing borders .
“ These are the kinds of potential adverse effects that you can have if you go out without making sure people understand the situation as well as possible , ” Fukuda said .
Combining human , avian and swine viruses , the new strain has been dubbed ‘ swine flu ’ , although scientists say this is misleading and stress there is no risk from eating pig meat .
The world is better prepared but also more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a flu pandemic since the last one occurred in 1968 , due to the speed and volume of international travel .
An H3N2 virus caused an estimated 1 - 4 million deaths at the time , and became known as Hong Kong flu .
But Fukuda said the WHO would not name the new disease after a country or animal to avoid misleading stigmas .
He voiced concern that Canadian Inuits had suffered disproportionately in the current outbreak , often needing hospitalization .
It was not clear if this was due to higher levels of underlying chronic disease , genetics or poverty .
“ Inuit populations were very severely hit in some of the earlier pandemics .
This is why these reports raise such concerns to us , ” he said .

It 's rare that an off - campus job can get a student kicked out of school .
But it can happen when the job is in porn and the school is conservatively Christian .
Grove City College suspended John Gechter of Reading , Pa. after it was revealed that he starred in gay porn under the alias of Vincent DeSalvo , according to reports .
Gechter 's profession was discovered after a fellow student ratted him out to school officials , according to the Sharon Herald .
He was working as a model and porn star to pay for college , Gechter told the area paper .
Grove City College , a small University in Western Pa. , claims to be an " authentically Christian " on its Web site .
Gechter 's job choice did n't mix with that conservative ideal .
The college suspended Gechter for violating the school 's code of conduct , said Amy Clingensmith , Senior Director of Communications for Grove City College .
The 22 - year - old admitted his role in the porn industry , according to the school .
The school deflected any criticism that Gechter 's sexual orientation had anything to do with the suspension .
" Throughout this process , his sexual orientation was not a factor in the decision , " said Clingensmith in a statement .
" The student 's suspension resulted from his involvement in the adult pornography industry . " she said .
Gechter choose to voluntarily leave the school , said Clingensmith Thursday .
No word yet from Gechter about why he chose to leave school .
" We hunger for communities of meaning that can transcend the individualism and selfishness that we see around us and that will provide an ethical and spiritual framework that gives our lives some higher purpose . " -- Michael Lerner , The Politics of Meaning

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
If progressives , whether in unions , activist groups or political parties , do n't soon begin doing politics differently -- radically differently -- they will fail to show that " a better world is possible . "
And the price of failure will be catastrophic .
We have known for years that our consumer culture is out of control and our obsession with having more and more stuff has reached the status of a virus .
Our consumer - driven global economy is a lethal threat to the planet and every one of its eco-systems .
The lock that consumerism has on Western so - called civilization is formidable -- a virtual death - grip on our culture and our future as a species .
It is a kind of madness but one which we can apparently adapt to .
This manufactured addiction to more and more stuff undermines community , threatens the planet and does n't even make us happy .
Consumerism , driven by the most sophisticated and manipulative psychology the advertising industry can buy , has had the effect of atomizing us .
We are defined more and more by what we have , less and less by our relationships to family , friends , colleagues and community .
One anecdote has stuck in my mind for over 20 years .
A friend attending an international peace conference in Edmonton accompanied a group of Filipino women -- all from rural areas of the Philippines -- to the West Edmonton Mall as a " tourist " outing for the visitors .
Twenty minutes into the tour the women burst into tears and pleaded with their hosts to get them out .
The insanity , the grotesque over - stimulation of the place , no longer obvious to the Canadian women who had grown up with these monstrosities , was grimly apparent to the village activists .
They were right .
We should all burst into tears after 20 minutes in a giant mall -- it would be a test of our mental and spiritual health .
Secular fundamentalism and its limits
It 's not as if we do n't know what the Filipinas knew .
It 's just that we have adapted to it -- like we might adapt to some physical disability .
Yet if we all know this , why is it that we are unable to incorporate our understanding of this all - important cultural disability into our progressive politics -- into the ways in which we try to engage people in the struggle for a better , sustainable , world ?
American rabbi and radical Michael Lerner blames what he calls " secular fundamentalism " -- the tendency amongst mainstream activists to stick rigidly to a rationalist and technocratic interpretation of both politics and culture .
He calls for a politics of meaning which " posits a new bottom line .
An institution or social practice is to be considered efficient or productive to the extent that it fosters ethically , spiritually , ecologically , and psychologically sensitive and caring human beings who can maintain long - term , loving personal and social relationships .
While this new definition of productivity does not reject the importance of material well - being , it subsumes that concern within an expanded view of ' the good life ' : one that insists on the primacy of spiritual harmony , loving relationships , mutual recognition , and work that contributes to the common good . "
Secular fundamentalists find talk of spiritualism intensely uncomfortable , probably because they draw immediate connections to either organized ' God ' religion and its patriarchal authoritarianism or vaguely to some mushy " self - improvement " sub-culture .
Spiritualism seems to fly in the face of the kind of rationalism that has been at the core of socialist and social democratic theory for nearly two centuries .
But organizers for social change face a critical problem .
Trying to mobilize people strictly on a rational basis , and in particular with uncritical acceptance of the assumptions of a consumer driven economy , is proving increasingly difficult .
On paper it should be working .
Intensive values surveys of Canadians consistently reveal that they are progressive in their views about the role of government and the value of community .
On the basis of such surveys , over 60 per cent of Canadians could be described politically as social democratic .
And yet we see two neo-liberal federal leaders and their parties garnering two thirds of Canadians ' voting intentions .
Something is very wrong here .
What makes people identify ?
It raises the question of why people get engaged .
Why is that tens of millions get into an emotional frenzy over the death of a pop star or identify their lives with a professional sports team but can't be convinced to fight for social programs that would increase the quality of life of their communities ?
Why do further millions identify with right - wing evangelical religion rather than the call for secular social justice ?
According to Lerner , they are in a search for meaning and in the context of the destruction of community of the past 30 years , they find in sports and Michael Jackson 's fandom pseudo - communities they can identify with .
In their quest for community they pass by the door that says left - wing politics .
Why ?
You need not search much further than the typical political meeting -- overly earnest , boring , economistic , gloom and doom and , except on rare occasions , distinctly unwelcoming to the newcomers who have braved their first tentative outing .
And after the meeting ?
Nothing .
No nurturing .
No ongoing connection .
No community .
While the U.S. example does not apply as clearly here , Lerner 's analysis of why the Christian right in the U.S. has been so successful has lessons for Canadian activists .
" We find thousands of Americans -- from every walk of life , ethnic and religious background , political persuasion and lifestyle -- with lives of pain and self - blame , and turning to the political Right because the Right speaks about the collapse of families , the difficulty of teaching good values to children , the fear of crime , and the absence of spirituality in their lives .
The Right seems to understand their hunger for community and connection . "
Lerner clearly acknowledges the destructive and often vicious politics of the right but argues most people vote for the Christian right because they feel understood and cared for by it , not because of its policies .
Nothing exciting here , move on
The left , on the other hand , fears that the people it is trying to persuade and mobilize are n't capable of imagining or accepting a truly radical vision of the future .
So the NDP , instead of developing and presenting such a vision ( assuming it is still capable of imagining it ) that addresses people 's need for a broader meaning , reduces that vision to a package of disconnected , minor reforms that does n't offend the media power brokers .
Of course , it does n't inspire anyone either , as evidenced by its inability to get beyond 20 per cent support .
Social movement organizations are in some ways even more trapped in the single issue incrementalism that fails to inspire all but a relative handful of politically conscious followers .
Convinced that " ordinary " people are incapable of radical change , says Lerner , too many left activists themselves retreat into a middle - class , consumer existence that they know deep down is not only unsustainable but deeply unsatisfying .
We fight the good fight -- and then drive home , turn on the TV and watch the news report on a world that does not acknowledge our existence .
' These are radical needs '
Lerner 's call for a politics of meaning is truly revolutionary given the extent to which consumerism is embedded in our lives and our culture , and the failure of our organizations to address the coming catastrophe .
Who will be amongst the first revolutionaries to challenge the system ?
We will -- the activists who are now exhausted , demoralized and convinced there is nothing new they can do to make change .
Says Lerner , " Having been burnt by past failures , these former activists will not quickly jump into new political movements .
Yet , as a meaning - oriented movement gains momentum many of them will feel a homecoming that reconnects to their deepest hopes .
They will become the transformative agents who move these ideas into the mainstream ...
These people respond out of a real inner need , not from a commitment to an abstract idea , nor out of a sense that someone else ought to be treated differently ... "
" These are radical needs , " writes Lerner .
" Unlike needs for economic well - being or political rights , these cannot be fulfilled inside our society as it currently is constructed . "
It 's time for reconstruction .
The economic and climate change crises can serve as an enforced breathing space : an obligatory opportunity to get off the consumer / wealth accumulation / hyper- individualism tread mill for long enough to realize it was taking us over a cliff .

June has seen hunger strikes and rioting by immigration prisoners at Brook House , the new immigration prison at Gatwick airport , and Yarl ’s Wood , the prison which has been at the centre of numerous claims of abuse and struggles by detainees since it opened in 2000 .
On June 12th , a group of detainees at Brook House immigration prison began resisting lockdown and rioting broke out .
Guards – who are employees of private contractors G4S – fled the wing , which was taken over by the prisoners .
Detainees took about damaging the contents of the administration wing and cells .
A large fire was set in the courtyard .
The riot was put down the following morning by specialist ‘ tornado team ’ riot officers .
During the disturbances , which were confined to the A Wing , many detainees throughout the centre were locked down for 24 hours and given only an apple and a KitKat to eat during that period .
Two days later , the detainees at Yarl ’s Wood immigration prison went on hunger strike , refusing to go to the cafeteria .
This action was taken in response to the inhumane and humiliating conditions being imposed on prisoners , who include young children and those with medical conditions , at the Serco - run detention centre .
The following day , detainees prevented the deportation of a family , and on the Wednesday they began occupying corridors .
Serco responded by bringing in over 30 guards to violently remove the detainees , and stripped naked two of the female hunger strikers in the process .
Detainees report that a prison guard humiliated one of the women by filming her on his camera phone .
One of the woman detainees told a supporter " I have never ever seen such violence .
They were beating the men like they were animals .
They say if we dare to go back into the corridor they will spray us all over [ with pepper spray ] .
We need your help from outside .
We do n't have any rights in here .
We need your support from outside . "
Though there are guidelines outlining that children and those with mental health issues should not be detained in such facilities , they are routinely ignored .
Earlier in the year the Childrens ’ commissioner reported that young children , many with health problems , are being locked up with " scant regard to basic welfare needs . "
The report found that children with serious health conditions were denied treatment , and many have been delayed emergency medical attention , including a baby with pneumonia .
Yarl ’s wood has been subject to controversy since it opened , with investigations by newspapers and reports by official investigators finding institutional racism , humiliation of detainees and racist attacks .
In 2006 Legal Action for Women reported that many female detainees had no access to lawyers , and were subject to sexual and racial intimidation by guards .
Booklets detailing prisoners ’ legal rights have been confiscated by Serco guards .
Hunger strikers ' statement :
1. Children , some as young as five months old , are sick in this detention centre .
Most were struck down with a virus , they are not eating properly since they are not used to the food here , not sleeping properly , restless and suffer other psychological manifestations including nightmares , bedwetting , screaming at night , violent behaviours and other emotional outbursts like crying etc .
2 . A recently bereaved family of three , who lost their twins and buried [ them ] just about a month ago , [ are ] being detained and [ have been ] given removal directions without even a chance to say farewell to the grave at Everton cemetery , where three of their children are buried .
3. Pregnant women , some with complications , are detained with total disregard of their well - being , including a pregnant lady , who is also suffering from depression and anxiety .
4 . A lady recently went through a major life - threatening operation for ectopic pregnancy a couple of months ago , and is now detained without even sufficient time to recover .
5 . An epileptic lady who suffers multiple seizures , up to six times in a twenty - four hour period , with only a 14 - year - old son to look after her .
The occupants tried to assist in such distressing times .
6. Families in considerable distress [ are ] being plucked out of their beds early in the morning and transported in mobile prisons for long hours to the airport .
7 . The continuing detention has placed considerable stress on families and , as such , we have decided to rise with a single voice and say no to detention of innocent people .
8 . Hence , this is the second day of a continuing hunger - strike .
Also tonight [ Tuesday , 16th June ] , all occupants here , with the children , have decided to spend the night protesting outside [ in the court yard ] .
9 . We will appreciate any help and advice we can get from you .
Emma was the most popular baby girl name of 2008 , the Social Security Administration announced today , supplanting Emily , which had held the slot for the past 12 years .
Both names , though , reflect a much deeper and largely unnoticed naming trend , which has played out over decades .
At the beginning of the last century , names beginning with vowels , like Amanda , dominated the name popularity charts .
But slowly their usage fell , bottoming out in the middle of the century as the consonant names , like David or Donna , rose to prominence .
Recently , the vowels have been creeping back up to dominance .
Looking at the Baby Name Wizard Voyager charts , we had to wonder :
What happened ?
Theories leapt to mind .
Perhaps names beginning with consonants were " stronger " sounding ?
Perhaps it had something to do with the civil rights movement or immigration or biblical names or something that had some obscure connection to the Soviets ?
Surely , this pattern had to mean something , this mid-century preference for Bill ( and Biff ) and Sally over Ethan and Allison .
Maybe not , say sociologists and psychologists .
In aggregate , the popularity of baby names are merely driven by the rules of fashion .
By a process known as the " ratchet effect , " the names change slowly , as millions of individuals just happen to like names that sound kind of , but not too much , like ones they know .
" Parents are really bad at knowing why we like certain names , " said Laura Wattenberg , who built The Baby Name Wizard , which allows users to visually manipulate Social Security Administration name data .
" I 've never heard a parent say , ' I 'm looking for a name that starts with a vowel . ' "
Yet , unbeknownst to them , the naming zeitgeist seeps into their minds .
Even culturally linked naming changes , like the terrifying rise of the name Miley ( after the Disney star Miley Cyrus ) , occur within the framework of the larger cultural preferences for certain types of names , said Cleveland Evans , an expert in onomastics ( the study of naming ) at Bellevue University in Nebraska .
" You can see individual names that a pop culture thing did , but they are able to do these things because it fit into the ratchet effect already , " Evans said .
" If a celebrity has a name that fits in with the ' different , but not too different ' thing , then it booms . "
And the name 's internal poetics , the way it sounds — the toughness of Tommy versus the rounded Owen , the music of Marissa versus the Betty 's bounciness ?
" It has no meaning , " says Harvard sociologist , Stanley Lieberson , who authored an authoritative work on the subject , A Matter of Taste : How Names , Fashions , and Culture Change .
" It 's a chance factor . "
Lieberson 's data shows that real substantive changes occur , but simply as a function of varying parental preference for just how different their children 's names should be .
Over time that preference has shifted toward more novel names .
Fewer and fewer people are picking the very most popular names .
In the early part of the century , one in four babies were given one of the top 10 most popular names .
Now , the most popular name ( Emma ) will be attached to barely one percent of the year 's babies .
Whether or not this basic variable in the ratchet effect has a cultural basis or is yet another chance variation in American naming conventions is a matter of debate .
Psychiatrists Jean Twenge and W. Keith Campbell argue in their recent book , The Narcissism Epidemic , that the decrease in preference of the most popular names " says a lot about our culture . "
" Naming rituals are central to cultures around the world and always have been .
The names we choose for our children reveal our deepest wishes and desires , " they write .
" We now wish so fervently that our children will stand out from the crowd that we equip them with unique labels from birth . "
While that 's a compelling narrative , Evans says it could just be that , thanks to sites like Wattenberg 's , parents know what the most popular names are now .
Perhaps parents of the past thought they were picking less popular names , but were , in fact , unintentionally following the fashions of the time .
Now that everyone relentlessly Googles baby names , parents have no excuse if they saddle their kids with the most popular names .
But Wattenberg says they still want names that sound popular , so they end up choosing endless variations on phonetic schemes that happen to be popular : Ava , Emma , Ella , Bella .
" What 's hard for parents is that what feels like your own personal taste , it 's everybody 's taste , " Wattenberg says .
" It 's a no win situation - if you pick a name you like , probably everybody else will like it too . "
And that 's what 's fascinating about watching the nation - level trends in baby naming .
The national nomenclature is transformed living room by living room as one frazzled couple after another makes a seemingly personal decision for underlying phonetic reasons they have n't considered .
" People may think they named a child after great , great grandma Olivia , but they have a lot of great , great grandmas , and they picked Olivia because it fits the popular sounds , " Wattenberg says .
And that 's how a country 's culture changes :
People cherry - picking from the past as they look for a name to call the future .

The Doctor Who story " Robots Of Death " is a murder mystery , even though it 's obvious right away who 's killing tons of people on board a claustrophobic mining vessel picking its away across the ore - rich sands of the planet Kaldor .
The identity of the murderer is right there in the story 's title .
The whodunnit aspect is much more about what 's making these robots kill people , and what does it mean for a society that 's utterly dependent on robots ?
The first question has an utterly , delightfully demented answer .
The second one , you 'll be pondering for hours after you watch it .

Let 's take the second question first .
Kaldor 's relationship to its robot workforce is akin to our society 's relationship to the automobile .
Over the course of the 90 - minute story , we learn a lot about Kaldor 's culture and history , without anyone ever pausing to lecture us - the worldbuilding in " Robots Of Death " is so rich and clever , writer Chris Boucher felt the need to return to it in a sequel novel , Corpse Marker .
And there 's been a whole series of audiodramas based in the capital , Kaldor City .
( The novel 's underwhelming , and I tried to get into the audios , but could n't . )
In any case , we learn that Kaldor was colonized by humans within fairly recent memory , and there 's a lingering class system that puts the earliest settlers ( the " founding families " ) at the top .
( The sandminer 's captain , Uvanov , is lower class and deeply resents his upper class crewmember , Zilda , who he thinks looks down on him .
She , in turn , blames him for the death of her brother on a previous tour .
More on that later . )
A good deal ( possibly all ) of the planet 's surface is covered with ugly , windswept desert , prone to horrible sandstorms which can cut you to shreds in seconds .
( As the Doctor nearly learns first - hand . )
And those sandstorms stir things up enough to bring precious ores ( yes , even lucanol ! ) to the surface , where a squat , lumbering sandminer can suck them in and refine them .
The work is grindingly awful and stressful , because you have to jump on sandstorms the moment you find them , if you want to meet your quota .
So you need the robots to help you manage .

But Kaldor does n't just depend on the robots for the sandmining that ( apparently ) fuels its economy .
Every aspect of life back in Kaldor City is robot - centric : they 're the masseurs , the nannies , even the cops in some cases .
Perhaps in a reflection of the rigid class system among Kaldor 's humans , the robots are divided into three classes as well : the Dums ( who ca n't speak ) , the Vocs ( who can ) , and the rarer Super - Vocs ( who are intelligent . )
Like our cars , those robots are beautiful : shiny , sleek , stylized .
The design in " Robots Of Death " is totally stunning , with lots of weird art deco elements everywhere , and it's all pointed at telling us something about the relationship between the humans and the robots .
All the humans have makeup on their faces that resembles the stark lines of the robots ' faces , and we 're never sure if the humans are deliberately trying to look like the robots , or vice versa .
And yet , as beautiful as the robots are , they 're also disturbing and just wrong .
" Creepy mechanical men , " the Doctor 's companion Leela calls them .
They sit squarely in the middle of the uncanny valley — too human to be a mere appliance , too robotic to be people .
So the humans of Kaldor are terrified of their robot servants , deep down , even though they depend on them .
( Or maybe partly because they depend on them so much . )
This affects everyone , to some extent — there 's a great scene early on , where someone is getting a massage from a robot , while a guy sitting nearby talks about how a robot masseur once went wrong and ripped a client 's arm off .
But some people suffer from it most keenly than others — one guy , Poul , suffers from " robo - phobia , " an unnatural ( but understandable , it turns out ) fear of robots .
When he finds a robot with human blood dripping down its sleeve , Poul starts to lose his marbles .
Too bad he 's the guy sent to investigate the murders in the first place .
We also learn that Zilda 's brother did n't die due to Uvanov 's negligence — he suffered an attack of robophobia and ran outside the sandminer to escape the robots , dying instantly .
Really , there 's an undercurrent of robophobia running through this entire society , which desperately needs robots to survive but can't trust them .
In one fantastic scene , Leela asks the Doctor what will happen if it does turn out that robots are murdering people .
In his wonderfully casual / brutal way , the Doctor says " I should think it 's the end of this civilization . "
Ooh , snap !

Of course , the robots have all the usual Asimov-ian safeguards , about obeying humans and never harming them .
It just turns out that if you 're smart enough — and willing to jam a laser probe into a robot 's brain — you can overcome those .
Which brings us to the answer to our first question :
Who is making the robots kill ?
It turns out that one of the people on the Sandminer is secretly Taren Capel , a weird robot supremacist who believes that robots should be free of humans ( and humans should be dead . )
A major robotics genius , Capel lost his parents when he was very young , and he was raised entirely by robots .
Ever since then , Capel has been robot - identified , and regards the oppressed robots as his " brothers . "
Towards the end of the story , he even paints his face to look more like a robot .
( All the humans have makeup that sort of resembles the robots , but Capel takes it a step further . )

As Fiona Moore points out , the robophobic Poul and the robot - loving Capel are just two sides of the same coin :
Both Poul and Capel ( who are interestingly both named after science - fiction writers ) are outsiders in disguise ; their true " identities " are also both tied up with a secret held by one or more of the robots on the Mine .
Visually , Capel 's death echoes
Poul 's descent into madness an episode earlier ; like Poul , Capel falls to his knees before a robot , screaming senseless phrases in his terror .
Poul 's quick denial that a robot could be responsible for Chub 's death also finds a parallel later in Capel 's quick denial that robots are dependent on humans for their existence .
The two characters thus have more in common than simple madness .
Taren Capel ?
Never heard of him .
Capel 's madness , like Poul's , is therefore not innate , but imposed from the outside .
In the scene in which Leela finds Poul hiding in the robot morgue , Poul in his terrified delirium attempts to betray her to the robots , believing that if he lets her help him the robots will view him as an enemy .
Poul also implies that he believes himself to be immune from attack by the robots as long as he keeps still and hidden .
Similarly , Capel 's behaviour could almost be seen as an attempt to ingratiate himself with the robots ; he dresses himself like them , repeatedly calls them " my brothers " and offers them a help they do not request .
At the end of the story , as a robot 's hands close on his throat , he cries out , not " I am your brother , " but " I am the master , " again implying a terrified attempt to assert control over an unstoppable force .
His murder at the hands of a robot parroting the phrase " kill the humans " must be for Capel the most frightening and humiliating death imaginable .
One of the few things we know about Capel is that he was raised by robots ; for most people , our images of strength and control are drawn from our early experiences with the people who raised us ( again , the Doctor 's remark about Dask not being half the robot his father was recalls this ) .
By drawing parallels between Poul and his quarry , Boucher has thus hidden the key to Capel 's madness in plain sight : it is not Capel 's megalomania , but his robophobia , which causes the unfolding of the events on Storm Mine Four .

I had n't actually thought about the idea that Capel , the robot supremacist , is actually just displacing his own internalized robophobia , but it does make a kind of sense .
Especially in his disguise as Dask , the sandminer 's robot expert , Capel is so keen to argue that robots can't kill — while he 's actually proving they can .
But to me , the really interesting thing about Capel 's robot revolution is that it 's doomed from the start .
Capel wants to see robots break free from their human masters , but he never asks the robots what they want .
In fact , the robots in the story never seem to express any particular desires — even the hyper - intelligent ones like Super - Voc 7 and the undercover robot agent D - 84 .
They want to do a good job , and they want to fulfill their function , but there 's never any hint that the robots are cherishing unfulfilled desires .
Advertisement
So Capel does n't empower the robots to kill — he programs them to .
They have as little choice about that instruction as they do about any other .
And he 's only able to get them to do this ( as I mentioned ) by jamming a laser probe into their heads , thus committing violence on them in the name of getting them to commit violence .
And the robots , the ones who have joined Capel 's little uprising , have no particular loyalty to him , as the Doctor proves at the end of the story .
The way the Doctor defeats Capel is especially clever — he gets his companion , Leela , to hide and open a tank of helium .
As Capel 's voice gets higher and higher , the robots stop recognizing his voiceprint , and he becomes just another one of the humans they 're programmed to kill .
His ultimate goal may have been to become one of the robots , but they never recognize him as such — and he maintains the master / slave relationship by ordering them to kill .

Is " Robots Of Death " really the greatest killer - robot story of all time , as I cheekily claimed in the headline ?
Actually , it really is possible — it does what the greatest killer - robot stories do , which is to tell us something new about our codependent relationship with technology .
All of the humans in the story are painted to look like robots , like Capel , just in a lesser way .
And they 're all terrified of robots , like Poul , just in a lesser way .
In the end , " Robots Of Death " tells us that the more powerful our technology becomes , the more we 'll fear it — and the more we 'll shape ourselves to become like it .
Luckily , " Robots Of Death " was one of the first Who stories to come out on DVD , and I 'm pretty sure you can find a used copy cheap .

Apple senior vice president of iPhone software Scott Forstall used Monday 's WWDC keynote to deliver the news that iPhone users have waited months to hear :
The new iPhone 3.0 OS will be released on June 17 , 2009 .
i Phone 3.0 will be a free release for all iPhone customers -- both original iPhone users and iPhone 3G users will be able to download it at no charge once it 's released .
iPod touch customers can download the new release for $ 10 , and it will work on first - and second - generation iPod touch models .
And iPhone software developers will be able to download the new release on Monday -- it 's gone " golden master " today .
Forstall used most of his time to talk about and show off some of the 100 new features in iPhone OS 3.0 , many of which were first discussed at a press event in Cupertino last March .
He was aided by a long parade of iPhone developers who showed off their latest wares .
Many of the new features in iPhone 3.0 have been talked about before : Cut , Copy , and Paste , for example ; landscape mode in all key applications , including Mail , Notes and Messages ; spotlight support across the entire device ; and ubiquitous searching .
Peer - to - peer Bluetooth - based multiplayer gaming , push notification , in - app store support and other capabilities factored into demonstrations showing off iPhone 3.0's new features , as well .
Forstall also delved deeper into some capabilities in the new operating system , and took a couple of digs at Apple 's United States cellular partner , AT&T , in the process .
Multimedia Messaging Support ( MMS ) has been , since the iPhone 's first release , a common request from iPhone users and people considering a switch to an iPhone -- it 's a capability many cell phone users take for granted .
Unfortunately , it appears that iPhone users in the United States will be waiting a while longer for MMS .
Forstall noted that while iPhone OS 3.0 is capable of MMS , it requires carrier support to implement .
Twenty - nine carriers in 76 countries will support MMS at the time of iPhone 3.0's launch , according to Forstall .
AT&T , Apple 's U.S. carrier partner , is n't among them , at least not initially .
AT&T will be ready to support MMS " later this summer , " according to Forstall .
That news elicited boos from the crowd .
Tethering -- the ability for a Mac or PC to share the iPhone 's Internet connection -- is another feature AT&T wo n't be supporting at launch .
This feature is especially handy for mobile travelers who do n't want to be tied to the limited range of a Wi -Fi hotspot , and who have n't purchased a 3G data card for their laptop .
Especially given the absence of ExpressCard expansion slots on Apple 's refreshed 15 - inch MacBook Pro line , this will be a bone of contention for some users .
i Phone 3.0 's tethering works over USB or Bluetooth , and works on Mac OS X and Windows .
But in another slight to AT&T , Apple listed dozens of carriers that will support this feature , and AT&T was notably absent from the list .
" Find My Phone " is a new feature in iPhone 3.0 that helps you locate your iPhone if you 've misplaced it .
It 's specifically for MobileMe customers -- you can log in to MobileMe and it will show you where you left your phone .
You can send a message to the phone , and will play an alert , even if you left the phone in silent mode .
What 's more , remote wipe is n't a feature just for system administrators anymore -- " Find My Phone " will erase all your data if your iPhone falls into the wrong hands .
The new iPhone OS supports HTTP - based streaming audio and video that will pick the right bit - rate depending on your phone 's data connection quality .
Autofill has been added for the Mobile Safari software , to save you from having to fill out forms manually .
Another hotly anticipated capability for the iPhone is turn - by - turn GPS - based directions .
To that end , TomTom demonstrated an iPhone 3.0 application that delivers real TomTom navigation on the iPhone .
What 's more , the software also works with a cradle device that suction - cups to your vehicle 's window .
It 's more than just a holder -- it securely docks the iPhone , can enhance the iPhone 's GPS capabilities , and give you hands - free calling capabilities , power and a loudspeaker .
TomTom plans to release both this summer , with a range of maps .
This story , " iPhone OS 3.0 Coming on June 17 " was originally published by Macworld .
Babies have lots of brown fat to help keep warm .
Until April 2009 , biologists believed that the brown fat quickly disappeared and was not found in adults .
Dr. Sven Enerback of the University of Goteborg in Sweden and others then reported that some brown fat tissue persisted in adults , raising the possibility that if the cells could be made more active , a person might burn off more fat .
In a parallel line of research that has now converged with the brown fat discovery , Dr. Spiegelman has long been studying the body ’s white fat cells and how they are controlled .
In 1994 he found the body ’s master regulator of white fat cells .
Turning to brown fat cells , he followed the general assumption that they were derived from white fat cells .
A key element in making brown fat cells seemed to be a kind of protein called a zinc finger ( because it reaches into the spiral of a DNA molecule to switch on particular genes ) .
Dr. Spiegelman figured that if he inactivated all the relevant zinc finger proteins in brown fat cells , they should turn back into their precursors , the white fat cells .
The experiment worked .
The brown fat cells did revert , but not into white fat cells .
They turned into muscle cells .
“ It was the most bizarre experiment my lab ever did , ” Dr. Spiegelman said Wednesday .
His discovery that muscle cells are the natural precursors of brown fat cells was made last year .
Dr. Spiegelman has now found that the zinc finger protein , in combination with a second protein produced in muscle cells , is the master switch for brown fat cells and will also convert skin cells into brown fat , even though this is not the process nature intended .

If the World Health Organization ( WHO ) raises the pandemic threat alert to Level 6 — it ’s already just one notch below that at Level 5 — companies that are now scrambling to figure out business continuity issues will have to do more than tell sick employees to stay home and healthy ones to wash their hands .
A Level 6 alert means that company officials will be asked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to undertake a number of efforts to fight any pandemic — including the appointment of a workplace pandemic coordinator or team .
The coordinator would be responsible for monitoring employees to ensure they follow basic rules of hygiene , such as washing hands , and to make sure that breathing masks are available .
And if a worker becomes sick , the pandemic monitor is supposed to ensure they go home , according to Jack Sotallaro , director of education at DRI International Inc. in Conway , Ark .

Vicar is sacked over sex texts to girl of 16 after suffering ' crisis of faith '
A vicar has been sacked after he sent ' sexual and intimate ' text messages to a 16 - year - old girl in his parish .
Reverend David Waters , 61 , targeted the schoolgirl after he claimed to have suffered a ' crisis of faith ' .
The unmarried clergyman has now been banned from taking church services after being stripped of his licence by a church disciplinary tribunal .
The Rev David Waters has been banned from the clergy after sending sexual text messages to a teenage parishioner
Mr Waters admitted sending ' inappropriate text messages , in that they contained words or phrases that were unseemly and of a sexual and intimate nature ' .
Their precise content has not been revealed .
Church leaders were tipped off about his behaviour by a member of the girl 's family , but the tribunal was told that the teenager , now 18 , did not want the vicar to be punished further .
Mr Waters made a full confession , admitting that on various occasions before May 2007 he sent sexual messages to her - behaviour which he later accepted was ' scandalous and offensive ' .
He was suspended from his position as rector of St Catwg's Church in Gelligaer , South Wales , in June 2007 , but as the girl , understood to be a regular member of his congregation , was 16 at the time , police did not investigate .
The tribunal ruled that the appropriate penalty would be to bar the vicar from holding a licence or obtaining permission to officiate in any church in Wales .
To parishioners , the vicar later likened his situation to that of a surgeon who started shaking .
He partly blamed his actions on being in charge of a huge parish and tending to the demands of his parishioners .
One of them said : ' He was a person you could go to and he would always try and help you - he never turned anyone away .
I think it all got too much for him in the end . '
Mr Waters has now left the parish , having previously spoken of feeling ' burnt out ' by his role in the community .
He said : ' The demands have been incredible .
I love this parish , I love every single person in this village . '
He added : ' I began going through weird experiences and the doctors think I had a breakdown .
' I was going through a crisis of faith .
I felt I was unworthy to be at the altar , that I was letting God down and letting the congregation down .
I 'm so ashamed . '
Although he has not been defrocked , the ban means if he wishes to apply for a licence or obtain permission to officiate again , he must provide written medical evidence that he is not at risk of repeat behaviour .
It will then be up to the relevant bishop to decide whether to grant such a licence or permission .
A Church In Wales spokesman said : ' The Reverend David Waters was referred to the tribunal in respect of an allegation of conduct giving just cause for scandal or offence .
' Having admitted the offence , Mr Waters has been inhibited from holding a licence or obtaining permission to officiate in any diocese in the Church In Wales .
' The tribunal recognised that at the time of the offences the Reverend David Waters was suffering from a form of mental illness . '
Another parishioner said : ' He told us he was going through a crisis of faith and simply felt burnt out . '
I ’ve been receiving a steady stream of favorable emails from Iranian - Americans regarding my appearance on Larry King last night .
They ’re delighted that I made it clear that Iran is different from the other countries in the region–better educated , more sophisticated , with far greater rights for women ( although not nearly enough ) .
And they also appreciated the fact that when King asked me what John McCain should do right now , I said , “ Be quiet . ”
The Washington Post has a piece today about the efforts of some Republicans to make hay out of the situation in Iran .
McCain , who spent the entire 2008 election making misleading statements about the nature of the Iranian government ( I wonder if he still thinks Ahmadinejad is more powerful than the Supreme Leader ) , has been at the forefront of this .
It is very unseemly .
I have yet to hear what possible good it would do for the President of the United States to encourage the protesters , except to give the Iranian regime a better excuse for killing more of them .
McCain ’s bleatings are either for domestic political consumption or self - satisfaction , a form of hip - shooting onanism that demonstrates why he would have been a foreign policy disaster had he been elected .
To put it as simply as possible , McCain–and his cohorts–are trying to score political points against the President in the midst of an international crisis .
It is the sort of behavior that Republicans routinely call “ unpatriotic ” when Democrats are doing it .
I would never question John McCain ’s patriotism , no matter how misguided his sense of the country ’s best interests sometimes seems .
His behavior has nothing to do with love of country ; it has everything to do with love of self .
Again , the crucial fact about the protesters is this : they may hate the Khamenei - Ahmadinejad regime–who would n’t ? – but that does n’t make them particular fans of the United States .
I have yet to meet an Iranian who does not believe that the United States gave poison gas to Saddam Hussein during the Iran - Iraq war , gas which injured thousands upon thousands of Iranian men , who still live , incapacitated , in the shadows of that society .
( Indeed , the attention Ahmadinejad has paid to the Iran - Iraq war veterans and their families is a major source of his extensive support among the Iranian working class . )
The protesters admire our freedom , but they are appalled–and insulted–by our neocolonialist condescension over the past 50 years .
The reformers , and even some conservatives , consider Ahmadinejad the George W. Bush of Iran–a crude , unsophisticated demagogue , who puts a strong Potemkin face to the world without very much knowledge of what the rest of the world is about .
This was an anology that came up in interview after interview , with reformers and conservatives alike .
Certainly , Bush the Younger , McCain and the rest of that crowd have absolutely no idea who the Iranian people are .
The are not Hungarians in 1956 .
They do not believe they live in an Evil Empire .
They still support their revolution .
They shout “ Allahu Akbar ” in the streets , which was the rallying cry of 1979 .
They are proud of their nuclear program , even if many have doubts about the efficacy of weaponizing the enriched uraniam that is being produced .
They want greater freedom , to be sure .
And they believe that the Khamenei - Ahmadinejad forces–and the militarized regime they have empowered , the millions of basiji and revolutionary guards –is a profound perversion of that revolution .
They are right .
They deserve our prayers and support .
But they do n’t need grandstanding from an American President , and they certainly do n’t need histrionics from blustery old John McCain .
Update :
The wingnuts over at National Review think I ’d oppose John McCain ’s tribute to the martyred Neda on the floor of the Senate .
This , of course , is bull pucky .
McCain and anyone else can publicly mourn this terrible act of brutality .
What is objectionable about McCain ’s statements is not his support for the protesters , but his untoward belief that the President should be more outspoken and bellicose .
Neda ’s death–and the beatings of the other protesters and journalists , some of which I witnessed –should disgust all of us , should disgust the world .
The posturing of neoconservative extremists , looking to score political points , is also disgusting , if decidedly more trivial .
San Francisco , CA - Recent job postings by the microblogging service Twitter reveal the company 's plans to hire a guerrilla
Tweeting force to bring down repressive governments around the globe , and have been confirmed by the company .
Fresh from their success of helping protesters of the presidential election in Iran communicate , the company posted several openings on their corporate site for " Global Political Consultants " with experience as " covert CIA operatives . "
Skills required include " government destabilization , mob mobilization and good writing skills . "
Fluency in other languages an asset , but not required .
Twitter CEO Evan Williams confirmed the formation of the Covert Twops division in a phone interview .
He said , " We see this as a business model that people can get behind .
We 'll make our covert twoperatives available to dissidents and rebels for a fee .
Once hired they can be summoned with the reserved # twoperatives tag . "
Williams denied working with the US Government to organize the force .
" We do n't take directives from the US government .
In fact , for the right price we 'll bring them down too . "
Social media experts declared this a new era in social media .
" The move by Twitter shows we are ready to embark on the era of geopolitical domination by Twitter , " said Steve Trasker who follows over 25,000 people on Twitter but not Ashton Kutcher .
Many Twitterers expressed support of the idea .
" It 's good that Twitter will be used as a force of good in the world , but I 'm more pleased with the fact that they wo n't be resorting to intrusive ads in my Twitter stream , " said @therevolutionwillnotbeadvertised .

Body mass index ( BMI ) is a strong predictor of death , finds an analysis of 57 studies involving nearly 900,000 adults that appeared in the March 28 Lancet .
Overall death rates were lowest at BMIs of 22.5 to 25 ( a BMI of 25 is considered overweight ; greater than 30 is obese ) .
Each 5 - unit increase in BMI above this range raised the death rate by 30 % .
Increased death rates at BMIs above 25 are largely because of vascular disease , whereas smoking - related illnesses are the main cause of the rise in death rates at BMIs below 22.5 .
Current BMI cutoffs , however , may not fit all ethnic groups .
Using dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry to measure body fat , researchers reported in the April 16 British Journal of Nutrition that blacks have 2 % to 5 % less fat than whites , whereas Asians and Hispanics have significantly more fat .
The authors suggest that BMI cutoffs should be higher in blacks but lower in Asians and Hispanics .
According to a study of 8,550 children in the April Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , obesity is evident in U.S. children as young as four years of age .
Based on BMI , 31 % of American Indian or Native Alaskan , 22 % of Hispanic , 21 % of black , 16 % of white , and 13 % of Asian children are obese .
The file - sharing retrial of Jammie Thomas - Rasset began at 9 am Monday morning on the 15th floor of the gleaming Minnesota District Court .
The first rows in the gallery were reserved for the press " and bloggers " — this is a court aware of the public interest in this case , as evidenced by a comment from Judge Michael J. Davis .
" Even though we 're out in provincial Minnesota , " he told the out - of - state lawyers on both sides , " people are going online " to view case materials , and he wanted even banal housekeeping motions filed electronically for that reason .
The majesty of the law was present in the polished wood and flat panel TVs of the courtroom , but the retrial itself began without much in the way of " majestic " proceedings .
First up was the record labels .
Attorney Matt Oppenheim — who might well work a side gig as a Rick Warren body double — confirmed to the court what we learned from the RIAA last week : the recording industry did in fact manage to obtain " certified " copies of its " true and correct " copyright registration forms from the Copyright Office in Washington .
Or , as Oppenheim put it , " Now we have them on the fancy paper the Copyright Office provides . "
Not that Thomas - Rasset 's legal team will let the registrations go unchallenged ; if they can find some way to invalidate them , the whole case falls apart , and lead attorney Kiwi Camara told the judge that he does intend to object to introducing the " new " documents at this late stage in the case .
Oppenheim pointedly indicated that the " new " documents were in fact identical to those the industry has provided for years .
The issue will be decided during trial .
Meet your jurors
The rest of the morning was taken up with jury selection , a tedious procedure that appeared to confirm Minnesota 's reputation as a place of Lutheran virtue and hard work .
Of the 19 people called up for questioning , no one admitted to having used Napster , KaZaA , or a P2P file - sharing program — and this despite the presence of several college students and recent grads .
One juror said that his friend was a heavy user and that he had downloaded a couple songs from his friend 's account , but he had stopped because he " did n't want to get caught and go be ... here . "
( Laughter from court . )
Another juror also said that a friend used LimeWire and had given him " a couple CDs " filled with songs .
He did n't know much about the process beyond the fact that " everybody does it . "
Finally , one man had a son with a new iPod who had allowed a friend to load it up with some songs from the friend 's collection .
Most responses to these sorts of questions sounded like something right out of a Cupertino PR campaign , though .
Apart from one guy with a Sandisk player , the personal music player of choice was the iPod .
Just about everyone claimed to get their music from iTunes , though the Sandisk guy actually used Amazon instead .
When the entire jury pool was asked if they had any opinion on the recording industry , even if it was just about the price of CDs , not a single hand went up .
Throughout it all , Jammie Thomas - Rasset sat quietly , flanked by her three lawyers .
The recording industry 's five - person legal team sat across the courtroom wearing arguably better ties than the defense team .
( The recording industry legal team includes two women , who were not wearing ties , including Jennifer Pariser of the RIAA who is overseeing the case for the trade group . )
After tossing out four jurors ( the ones who had the most experience with file - sharing friends ) , the court was left with a 12 - person jury : five men and seven women , all white , ranging in age from college students to retirees .
The judge then gave some instructions .
Jurors were not to blog during the trial .
They were not to put anything " on your Facebook . "
And under no circumstances were they to " tweet " — an expression that clearly pleased the judge , who used it three or four times .
He displayed a list of songs that Thomas - Rasset was alleged to have shared online , which was the morning 's most unintentionally poignant moment .
Thomas - Rasset had earlier been ordered to pay $ 222,000 for such aural splendors as " Pour Some Sugar on Me , " " Now and Forever , " " Hella Good , " " Bills , Bills , Bills , " and " Do n't Stop Believin ' " — which may have been the real crime in the first trial .
( OK , " Do n't Stop Believin ' " may in fact have deserved the almost $ 10,000 in damages . )
The case , which is expected to stretch into next week , resumes this afternoon with a full jury , opening statements , and the first witnesses for the recording industry .
Stay tuned for further reports .

Muslimahs who work hard in shaping the depiction of themselves and their sisters in the media , and who are engaged in Islamic feminist discourse to dispel cultural and literalist concepts unjustly attributed to them , are often left flattened under the heavy heap of misrepresentations and stereotypes by both Muslim and non-Muslim agencies .
I would like to dedicate my post for the week to one such South African woman , who
fought against all types of oppression , especially against the oppression of Apartheid , Zionism and misogyny .
Shamima Shaikh ( 1960 - 1998 ) was a journalist , media activist and Islamic feminist .
Both her life and her death were symbols of struggle for the rights of Muslim women .
I found it very difficult to articulate the magnanimity of Shamima ’s life , so I turned to her husband , Na’eem Jeenah , for insight :
Shamima ’s mission in life was to struggle for justice ; whether against white racists propping up apartheid or Muslim misogynists who wanted to ‘ keep women in their place ’ .
Deeply committed to the message of the Qur’an concerning justice and fighting oppression , she lived her life fighting for the right of all people to be treated equally as human beings , and for women , in particular , to be accorded their rights .
She was inspired in all of this by the words of Allah .
She was also one of the most compassionate people I know – towards everyone .
She tirelessly worked for this message of this justice , including speaking , and writing .
Shamima wrote for student publications , newspapers , and became the editor of al - Qalam , a South African Muslim community newspaper , and was the founder chairperson of the Muslim Community Broadcasting Trust , which owned The Voice , a Muslim community radio station .
All these media she shaped in order to deliver that singular message .
Her persistence , her love , her conviction that Allah ’s justice would prevail endeared her to many , including some of her ideological opponents .
Whilst browsing through the memorial website set up for Shamima by her husband and friends , I read the messages of condolences on her death ; I became overwhelmed , in awe at her personality and felt sadness that I never had the privilege to meet Shamima .
One obituary that made every tiny hair on my body stand is :
Shamima was an extraordinary human being .
In knowing her as a friend and organisational colleague there were many aspects of her personality that moved me very deeply : her passionate commitment and idealism which translated into a continuous activism for social justice , her constant transgression of religious and cultural traditions in critically constructive ways , her fundamental refusal to be taken as a second - class Muslim because of being a woman , her openness in engaging even the thorniest aspects of the women ’s struggle and her capacity to extend sisterhood to women very different in beliefs from herself , her wonderful laughter , generosity and hospitality ( Shamima and Na ’eem ’s home was an “ open - house ” , always full of people talking , eating , laughing , arguing ) , her inexhaustible energy in both juggling motherhood , work , numerous political commitments and an active social life .
All of these things are what defined Shamima , but most distinctive for me were her incredible qualities of courage and spunkiness and it is with a multitude of both that she faced her meeting with Allah – she never faltered in the face of death , remaining true to her life commitments to the every end .
Even in her death she made this manifest – she requested that her janaza ( funeral ) prayers be lead by a woman .
Very few of us can , at the age of 37 , be able to stand before our Creator and be sure that we have fulfilled our vicegerency in this world with the totality of who we are .
I believe that Shamima will be able to do so .
Dearest Sister Shamima , aluta continua .
Go with the knowledge that you have touched this temporal world in the profoundest way .
Salaam - u - alaykum wa rahmat - ul - allah wa barakatu .
Sa’diyya Shaikh
A small collection of her articles can be found here .
She was also the subject of many a written work .
Farid Essack , in his book , “ On Being a Muslim ” wrote
When other co-religionists were denying women the right to be on air , she served as chairperson of the Muslim Community Broadcasting Trust …
In the same way that for anyone committed to gender justice a woman ’s place cannot be confined to bedrooms and kitchens , she ultimately became frustrated at being an “ upstairs ” woman .
In a little - known move , unprecedented in the world of Islam , she and a number of comrades –male and female – started an alternative congregation where gender equality and all its implications for Islamic thought and practice were the norm .
Shamima , we do not have to pledge that we will pick up the battles where you left off .
About that you have no doubt .
We can pledge to try to do so with the gentleness and love with you fought them .
What a life !
What a way of passing on !
What a death .
Amina Wadud also writes about Shamima in her book , “ Inside the Gender Jihad ”
I liked her right away ; she had no airs , no fan fares , and no feminine vanities .
She impressed me a person who worked with a cause , and found meaning in doing .
Just what was Shamima ’s message about Muslim women in the media ?
In a paper she presented a few days before her death at the Durban Conference , she said :
Another problem is that men write women into their experiences , For a long time men have been writing about women , men have been writing the interpretations .
Even if a progressive man writes about women , it ’s from a male perspective .
They write us into their experiences .
Ebrahim Moosa ( a leading South African and international progressive Muslim theologian and scholar ) experiences life much differently than I do .
He ’s progressive , fine !
But I ’d rather Firdousa ( the MYM Gender Desk co-ordinator ) wrote it .
It would be more real .
Our experiences are different because we ’re in an oppressive situation .
Shamima ’s role and impact on the media was immense .
Not only was she a journalist , but her activities were constantly in the public eye , for marches , demonstrations , mass rallies and solidarity campaigns against the apartheid government and especially for her famous “ women in the mosque campaign ” , when she mobilized a number of Muslim women to attend Ramadan prayers in a male only mosque in Johannesburg .
Shaikh also became the first National Co-ordinator of the Muslim Youth Movement Gender Desk , a position that again put her on the MYM ’s National Executive .
Under Shaikh ’s leadership , the MYM Gender Desk rapidly became the most outspoken Muslim organization on the question of Muslim women ’s rights and gender within the Muslim community and the leading organization in the South African articulation of Islamic feminism .
She was also involved with the founding and establishment of the Muslim Personal Law Board of South Africa and was a member of the Board until it was unilaterally shut down by the United Ulama Council of South Africa .
She also co-authored a book with her husband Na’eem about their spiritual journey on the Hajj .
The book features their personal analysis of the pilgrimage , anecdotes and observations highlighting racism , inequalities and misogyny within the Muslim world as experienced by the couple on their trip .
It was published only after her death , and serves as a mini memoir and inspiration to thousands of South African pilgrims .
Shamima learned of her cancer in 1997 .
She continued her social struggle in the face of her physical struggle against illness , and most would say , with even more zest than before .
Her last public engagement in the media was the deliverance of a paper “ Women & Islam – The Gender Struggle in South Africa ” , in Durban , with great difficulty due to her condition .
Just seventeen days later , on January 8 , 1998 / 9 Ramadan 1418 , Shamima passed away .
She left behind her husband Na’eem and two sons Minhaj and Shir’a .
May Allah grant her peace and paradise .
In life , as in death , Shamima fought against what she precieved as injuctice , to people of colour , and to women .
Numerous funeral prayers were said for her , most notably the funeral prayer led by a woman , her close friend , Farhana Ismail , as per Shamima ’s request .
Shamima was often referred to by her opposition as “ that mad Shaikh women . ”
At another funeral service in a Johannesburg masjid , led by her husband Na’eem , he prayed , “ If this be madness God , give us all the courage to be mad . ”
Microchemists say 1988 dating of Shroud tested a newer patch , not the " much older " original
Continuing good news for those who believe in the authenticity of the Shroud of Turina retired chemist from the Los Alamos National Laboratory has published a peer - reviewed study declaring invalid the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the cloth ( which dated it between 1260 and 1390 ) .
The problem , writes Raymond N. Rogers , in the January 20 issue of Thermochimica Acta , is that the 1988 study tested a sample from a medieval patch , not the shroud itself .
" The radiocarbon sample had been dyed , most likely to match the color of the older , sepia - colored cloth , " Rogers told Discovery News .
" The sample was dyed using a technology that began to appear in Italy about the time the Crusaders ' last bastion fell to the Mameluke Turks in 1291 .
The radiocarbon sample cannot be older than about 1290 , agreeing with the age determined by carbon - 14 dating in 1988 .
However , the shroud itself is actually much older . "
How much older ?
That 's hard to tell , Rogers wrote .
The fact that vanillin can not be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers , Dead Sea scrolls linen , and other very old linens indicates that the shroud is quite old .
A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggests that the shroud is between 1,300 and 3,000 years old .
Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions , the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years .
" The presence of a patch on the shroud does n't come as a surprise , " says Discovery News .
" The linen cloth has survived several blazes since its existence was first recorded in France in 1357 , including a church fire in 1532 .
Badly damaged , it was then restored by nuns who patched burn ...

The vast majority of cancer deaths are due to metastasis , the spread of cancer cells from its primary site to other parts of the body .
These metastatic cells tend to move more than their non-metastatic variants but this movement is poorly understood .
Scientists are studying cancer cells intently with the hope they can learn to control the movements of the dangerous cells .
Northwestern University researchers now have demonstrated a novel and simple method that can direct and separate cancer cells from normal cells .
Based on this method , they have proposed that cancer cells possibly could be sequestered permanently in a sort of " cancer trap " made of implantable and biodegradable materials .
The demonstrated device , which takes advantage of a physical principle called ratcheting , is a very tiny system of channels for cell locomotion .
Each channel is less than a tenth of a millimeter wide .
The asymmetric obstacles inside these channels direct cell movement along a preferred direction .
Details are published online by the journal Nature Physics .
" We have demonstrated a principle that offers an unconventional way to fight metastasis , a very different approach from other methods , such as chemotherapy , " said Bartosz Grzybowski , the paper 's senior author .
" These are fundamental studies so the method needs to be optimized , but the idea has promise for a new approach to cancer therapy . "
Grzybowski is associate professor of chemical and biological engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and associate professor of chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences .
The researchers first discovered they could design channels of different geometries -- some a series of connected triangles -- through which cells can move in a single direction .
( Live mammalian melanoma , breast cancer and normal cells were studied . )
To create the channels , the researchers patterned cell - adhesive and cell - repellant chemical compounds onto a substrate .
The cells stayed out of the repellant areas and localized onto the " ratchet " channels , which then directed the cells ' movements .
Grzybowski and his colleagues took this knowledge one critical step farther : they designed channels that successfully moved the cells of two types -- notably , cancerous and non-cancerous -- in opposite directions and thus partly sorted them out .
To sort the cells , they took advantage of the cells ' different shapes and mobility characteristics .
Migrating cancer cells tend to be more round and broad while normal , epithelial cells are long and thin with long protrusions on the ends .
The researchers designed a channel with " spikes " coming out at 45 - degree angles from the walls , alternating on opposite sides of the channel .
This pattern funnels cancer cells in one direction while at the same time directing the normal cells in the opposite direction , as those cells " grab " the spikes and pull themselves through .
The researchers showed that a device with a number of these channels leading to a central reservoir , like spokes on a wheel , worked just as well separating cancer and non-cancerous cells .
A stack of these radially arranged ratchet channels could be used to create a " cancer trap . "
" When implanted next to a tumor the particles would guide cancer cells , but not normal cells , inward to the reservoir , where they would be trapped , " said Grzybowski .
" The particles could also be part of the sutures used during surgical procedures . "
Highly sensitive details of a key US missile defence system have been found on the hard drive of a computer that was disposed of in California .
The information about defence contractor Lockheed Martin included a document detailing test launch procedures , blueprints of facilities and photos and personal daat about employees – including their social security numbers .
Access to such data could allow identity theft or industrial espionage against Lockheed Martin , which is working on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence ( THAAD ) system – a project begun under president Ronald Reagan 's " Star Wars " Strategic Defence Initiative in the 1980s .
The computer , which has been turned over to the FBI , was bought online as part of a global research project conducted by three universities – Longwood University in the US , Glamorgan University in the UK and Edith Cowan University in Australia – along with BT and Sims Recycling Solutions .
The annual hard drive survey , now in its fourth year , is designed to bring to public attention the risk to personal data posed by carelessly discarded computer equipment which often contains huge amounts of personal and commercial data .
The universities involved in the study use techniques and tools that are readily available from the internet and can be used by someone with a basic knowledge of technology to recover the data left on the drives , often this is not necessary as many are not even wiped .
One of the men who analysed the drive – Glenn Dardick , assistant professor of information systems at Longwood University in Virginia – described it as " manna from heaven to hackers " .
He said : " If this is out there , then it does beg the question : what else is out there ? "
Capable of destroying an incoming missile at around 93 miles above the Earth , THAAD is a " hit to kill " system without a warhead that homes in on its target and collides with it " like a bullet hitting a bullet " .
At that height , according to experts on the website missilethreat.com , the subsequent impact will safely diffuse " any nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons , thus minimising the risk of missile debris raining down on civilian or military populations " .
When the Guardian told Lockheed Martin 's press office of the discovery , a spokeswoman commented " it never pours but it rains " as she replaced the phone .
Later , a spokesman for the company said : " Lockheed Martin is not aware of any compromise of data related to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense program .
In addition , no governmental or law enforcement agency has notified us of any such data loss . "
Lockheed Martin had not responded to repeated requests for clarification about the drive by the time of publication .
News of the drive 's loss has provoked concern among experts .
" From the point of view of espionage , knowing who is working on a project is tremendously useful , " said Peter Zimmerman , emeritus professor of science and security at the Department of War Studies at London 's King 's College .
" This is a horrible violation of privacy .
If it fell into the wrong hands , then it opens up the possibility of a range of blackmail options .
You could use this to glean a lot of intelligence .
I would not be happy if this fell into anyone 's hands . "
The current view among computer security professionals is that the odds on someone buying a drive who has the contacts to be able to dispose of it to someone who is willing to buy it are so great that the data on discarded drives does not constitute a threat .
However in Nigeria it has recently emerged that discarded phones now sell for 50 % more if they have data left on them .
According to Jon Godfrey , a director for Sims , which runs the largest electrical recycling plant in Europe , 90 % of the PCs sent to it for recycling had had their hard drives removed first – but possibly not by the original owners .
" We are fairly certain that the drives are not being removed by those disposing of the PCs because the drives being rejected are the smaller and older ones , which would have less value as spares and less recent data on them .
" Over a third of devices discarded contain data which has its highest value in the wrong hands . "
• Careless disposal of confidential data is on the rise , says study
Many of the families have decided to leave Northern Ireland One hundred Romanians who fled their homes in Belfast after a spate of recent attacks have decided to leave Northern Ireland and return to Romania .
Social Development Minister Margaret Ritchie said 25 people had already left and 75 were going to leave as soon as they could , 14 will stay in NI .
Meanwhile , a man has been remanded in custody charged with intimidating Romanian people in Belfast .
Shane Murphy , 21 , of Donegall Road in the city , denies the charge .
His solicitor , who had applied for bail on his client 's behalf , said Mr Murphy also denied a further charge of acting provocatively by shouting racist comments at a rally held on Lisburn Road in the city last week .
The judge , sitting at Belfast Magistrates Court , refused a bail application because he said there was a danger Mr Murphy could interfere with witnesses .
On Monday , a 15 - year - old boy appeared in court charged in connection with the same incidents .
A 16 - year - old boy appeared alongside him accused of provocative behaviour at the anti-racism rally .
The Housing Executive is paying for the families , members of the Roma ethnic group , to return to Romania using emergency funds .
A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities said it was likely the remaining families would leave before the end of the week .
" We have all spoken to the the Romanian families and the majority of them want to go home , " he said .
City Church , which last week provided temporary overnight shelter for the ethnic Roma , was targeted by vandals on Monday night .
Three men , all aged 20 , were arrested in connection with the attack but later released .
Police are not linking this incident to the ongoing investigation into the attacks on Romanian families in south Belfast .
They said there was no indication that the attack on the church was hate or racially motivated Pastor Malcolm Morgan said the church was covered in broken glass .
" I arrived this morning to find windows smashed at the front of our church and our main glass doorway smashed as well , " he said .
" Stones were lying scattered on the floor inside and outside and obviously broken glass was everywhere . "
The church provided shelter for about 20 Romanian familes On Monday night , another two youths , aged 16 and 17 , were arrested in connection with alleged provocative conduct and intimidation .
They were released on Tuesday .
Police do not believe paramilitaries were involved in last week 's attacks , which were condemned by all political parties .

BINGHAMTON , New York ( Reuters ) - A man armed with two handguns killed 13 people at an immigration services center before apparently turning the gun on himself , authorities in Binghamton , New York , said on Friday .
Police Chief Joseph Zikuski told a news conference the gunman blocked the back entrance of the building with a car , walked in the front door and shot two receptionists , one of whom died , before entering a classroom and killing 12 more people and then apparently committing suicide .
He said that four other people were critically wounded in the latest U.S. shooting incident with multiple casualties .
One of the receptionists survived , pretending to be dead before crawling under a desk where she managed to call police , Zikuski said .
She was in critical condition in a hospital .
“ We have no idea what the motive is , ” Zikuski said , adding that the man was no stranger to the center .
Representative Maurice Hinchey , whose district includes Binghamton , told The New York Times that indications are the gunman was an immigrant from Vietnam and the car he used was registered to his father .
Local media reported the man was in his early 40s .
“ It was definitely premeditated .
He barricaded the back door -- put his car right against the door so nobody could escape , ” Zikuski said .
Zikuski said 37 people were evacuated safely from the building , 26 of whom had sought refuge in the basement .

All the shots were fired before police reached the scene on a main street in Binghamton , a town of some 45,000 people about 150 miles northwest of New York City .
President Barack Obama , in France and Germany for a NATO meeting , said in a statement he was “ shocked and deeply saddened ” by the shooting .
TARGETS ‘AMERICAN DREAM ’
The American Civic Association building is used to teach English and provide other services to recent immigrants to the United States who are preparing for U.S. citizenship .
New York Governor David Paterson said it was a “ senseless act of violence ” that targeted people “ who wanted to be part of the American dream . ”
Zikuski said police believed the gunman was among the dead because the body of a man wearing a satchel holding ammunition was found , as well as two handguns .
Police also tracked down the owner of the car who had lent it to the suspect .
Local media reports said authorities requested a Vietnamese translator to speak with the gunman .
Vice President Joe Biden told a civil rights meeting in New York City the victims were in the process of taking exams to become citizens when the shooting started .

“ We ’ve got to figure a way to deal with this senseless , senseless violence , ” Biden said .
There have been several mass shootings in recent years in the United States , where guns are widely available for purchase and the right to own weapons is enshrined in the Constitution .
Last month , a man killed 10 people , many of them family members , in a shooting rampage in Alabama .
On April 16 , 2007 , Virginia Tech , a university in Blacksburg , Virginia , became the site of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history when a student gunman killed 32 people and himself .
“ When are we going to be able to curb the kind of violence that is so fraught and so rapid we ca n’t even keep track of the incidents ? ”
Paterson asked at a news conference .

THE twin Viking landers that defied the odds to land on Mars in 1976 and 1977 had one primary goal : to find life .
To the disappointment of nearly all concerned , the data they sent back was a sharp dash of cold water .
The Martian surface was harsh and antibiotic and there was no sign of life .
To two NASA scientists , James Lovelock and Dian Hitchcock , this came as no surprise – in fact , they would have been amazed to see any evidence of life on Mars .
A decade before Viking , Lovelock and Hitchcock , both atmospheric scientists , had used observations of the Martian atmosphere to deduce that there could be no life on the planet .
From their research arose one of the most influential , ground - breaking scientific ideas of the 20th century – the Gaia hypothesis , named after the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth , a nurturing “ mother ” of life .
But is it correct ?
New scientific findings suggest that the nature of life on Earth is not at all like Gaia .
If we were to choose a mythical mother figure to characterise the biosphere , it would more accurately be Medea , the murderous wife of Jason of the Argonauts .
She was a sorceress , a princess – and a killer of her own children .
The Gaia story starts in the 1960s , when Lovelock and Hitchcock showed that the Martian atmosphere was in a state of chemical equilibrium – a stagnant pool of carbon dioxide with a dash of nitrogen but very little oxygen , methane or hydrogen . …
Watch your heads !
The punditry pendulum is swinging again .
For a while there , everyone was saying that global capitalism was dead , or at least fatally discredited .
Then came the European Parliament elections .
In votes held from June 4 through June 7 in 27 European Union countries , an impressive percentage of conservative parties , whether currently in government or in opposition , routed their counterparts on the left .
Hence the instant analysis across the continent : Capitalism rocks !
The Right has might !
If the Left is losing now , when on earth can it win ?
As an enthusiastic critic of welfare - state socialism , I wish that it were all that clear .
But it is n't .
First , consider the pure protest factor .
In places like Greece and Spain , it was n't ideology that moved voters , it was incumbency .
Here in Ireland , the left - leaning Green Party has been decimated by the fact that it is part of the governing coalition headed by the ragingly unpopular Fianna Fail party .
The equally left - leaning Labor Party has been rejuvenated by the fact that it is n't .
End of story .
In Britain , Labor 's problems seem to be far less a matter of ideology than personality .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown , whose popularity began sinking almost from the moment he took office , was actually gaining ground as a result of the economic meltdown , which the public seemed to feel he was handling capably .
Then came achingly ill - timed revelations that parliamentarians had taken absurd expense - account reimbursements .
( The politically worst — and anecdotally best — case was perhaps that of the ironically named Douglas Hogg , who handed taxpayers the bill for cleaning his moat . )
All political parties were embarrassed — Hogg , for one , is a Conservative — but Tory leader David Cameron responded deftly .
Brown responded dully .
For this and other reasons , he finds himself facing a public mutiny in his own ranks .
Last week , Labor lost big in elections for local councils and for seats in the European Parliament — but the reason was scandal , not socialism .
Then there are all the places where the Left , quite apart from any intellectual lunacy , is in even more abject functional disarray than usual .
In France , the only thing that President Nicolas Sarkozy may find more beautiful than his supermodel wife is his stunningly inept opposition .
Back in November , Lille Mayor Martine Aubry was barely and bitterly elected leader of the Socialist Party over Ségolène Royal , who had lost to Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential race .
The best that can be said of the two women 's resilient personal rivalry is that it has been of no help in resolving the questions of how the French Left should define , let alone rebuild , itself .
Still , the Left is n't dead , it 's just dithering .
And do n't forget , since the global financial crisis hit , the European Right has gone pretty darn leftward .
Angela Merkel may have genuinely intended to reform the German welfare state — a task that even her socialist predecessor , Gerhard Schroeder , recognized as overdue .
But what has actually happened under Merkel ?
Among other things , taxes have increased .
The power of industrial unions has expanded .
Pensions have been protected .
With support from its coalition partners , Merkel 's party has passed a stimulus package and a bank bailout .
Despite their current economic plight , the citizens of major European democracies have shown no desire to dive under the big- spending skirts of the Left .
But maybe that 's because they can now dive under the big- spending skirts of the Right .
In the end , though , no matter how and why Europeans voted last week , they appear convinced that their economic fate will not be decided in Paris or Berlin — let alone in Brussels or Strasbourg — but in Washington , D.C.
For good or ill , what 's happening in Washington is a lot of plain old - fashioned government spending .
Europeans , like Americans , are divided on whether the Obama stimulus package is smart policy .
But make no mistake :
The whole of Europe — right , left , and center — is praying that it turns out to be bloody brilliant .
The score was Pirates 1 , Microsoft 0 , but Redmond has tied it up .
Microsoft has blacklisted the Lenovo OEM master key that leaked earlier this week , explaining that " Windows 7 already includes an improved ability to detect hacks , also known as activation exploits , and alert customers who are using a pirated copy " and that " Windows Activation Technologies included in Windows 7 are designed to handle situations such as this one , and customers using these tools and methods should expect Windows to detect them . "
Microsoft and Lenovo worked together to solve the issue , according to the Genuine Windows Blog :
We 've worked with that manufacturer so that customers who purchase genuine copies of Windows 7 from this manufacturer will experience no issues validating their copy of Windows 7 .
At the same time we will seek to alert customers who are using the leaked key that they are running a non-genuine copy of Windows .
It 's important to note that no PCs will be sold that will use this key .
The reason Microsoft could simply blacklist Lenovo 's OEM master key was because it has n't been used yet to generate keys for copies of Windows 7 that have already shipped .
Once master keys have been used to create keys that have been sold to customers and they make it into the hands of pirates , the solution wo n't be as simple .
At that point , Windows 7's new antipiracy systems will be put to the test .
Two days ago , pirates cracked the activation for Windows 7 Ultimate by using OEM instant offline activation .
Other editions of the operating system were not cracked because the key that leaked was only for the Ultimate edition .
Piracy is an ongoing battle for Microsoft and this is just the first of many future cracks by pirates — and counters from Microsoft .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran 's government Tuesday banned international media from covering rallies in Tehran being held in the wake of last week 's disputed presidential election .
Supporters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi protest Monday in Tehran .

The decision comes after video footage emerged showing violence at demonstrations in support of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi .
Moussavi has contested the results of Friday 's election , which showed an overwhelming victory for hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Moussavi 's supporters have taken to the streets , often clashing with police and Ahmadinejad 's backers .
Iran 's government had criticized some of the media coverage and images , describing them as biased .
International news outlets , including CNN , can talk about rallies in their live reports , but they are not allowed to leave their hotel rooms and offices .
Iranian government - run television , which was not affected by the restrictions , aired live coverage of Tuesday 's rally in support of Ahmadinejad , whose supporters crowded the streets of central Tehran .
Watch CNN 's Christiane Amanpour report on the earlier protest »
Moussavi asked his backers to forego a planned rally Tuesday in the same area as the pro-Ahmadinejad gathering at Vali Asr Square in Tehran .
Instead , his supporters gathered at a different location in the capital , according to video footage of the rally .
In addition to restricting international journalists , Iran also blocked access to certain online communication tools -- text and video -- but many Iranians were able to find a way around the restrictions .
Seven people were killed Monday night in Tehran , government - funded Press TV said .
Iran 's election authority has agreed to recount some votes in the disputed election , but Moussavi has rejected the idea , asking instead for fresh elections .
CNN 's Reza Sayah and Samson Desta in Tehran contributed to this report .

At least thirty villages have been raided by an armed Christian group in the northeast region of the Democratic Republic of Congo , according to Congo News Channel .
It says the Uganda ’s Lord Resistance Army ( LRA ) kidnapped sixteen people including four children during its raid in the Orientale province .
And that the Army has raised the Congolese death toll to over one thousand since December .
The LRA has brutally raped , maimed , massacred , and tortured thousands of civilians .
And 90 % of LRA soldiers are abducted children according to non governmental organization Amnesty International .
insight 3d - opensource image based 3d modeling software
Whoa !
Looks like you do n't have Flash or something .
insight3d lets you create 3D models from photographs .
You give it a series of photos of a real scene ( e.g. , of a building ) , it automatically matches them and then calculates positions in space from which each photo has been taken ( plus camera ’s optical parameters ) along with a 3D pointcloud of the scene .
You can then use insight3d ’s modeling tools to create textured polygonal model .
It is free and opensource ( GNU AGPL 3 ) .
Source codes for a new 64 - bit version of insight3d are located at : http://github.com/lukasmach/insight3d.
At this moment , we only provide an installer for an older 32 - bit Windows version of insight3d ( version 0.3.2 ) .
This version is unlikely to work on datasets containing large numbers of images .
This is due to the fact that for calibration , the application needs to store all detected features from all images at the same time in memory .
One way to mitigate this is to use a lower resolution images for calibration ( this is done by a single click in the calibration settings , you do n't have to actually resize the photos ) .
We are working hard towards a user - friendly release of a new version .
Windows Installer ( .msi ) – in some cases ( probably not ) , it might be necessary to update your system by installing this
– in some cases ( probably not ) , it might be necessary to update your system by installing this The app works on Linux , but unfortunately needs to be compiled from sources .
I would recommend starting with the new sources on GitHub .
Be sure to read the tutorial !
Also note that some good people have forked insight3d and started the insight3dng project .

It would be great if you could send me datasets you tried to feed into insight3d .
Both the ones that worked and the ones that did n't are imporant !
If you want , download the app , read the tutorial ( there 's important info on what photos should be used and where to eventually send them ! ) , take some photos , have fun with it and please send it to me .
Hope that it 'll work for you , but do n't hold your breath .
( The Frisky ) --
Recently , I discovered that one of my best friends had ditched me after I logged onto Facebook and found her profile had disappeared from my page .
When you break up with a best friend online , things can get murky .
We 'd been having problems that had culminated in a huge argument the day before , but I figured we'd get through it .
I figured wrong .
Still , being given the heave - ho by way of a social networking site ?
My first reaction was to laugh .
I mean , we 're adults .
Unfriending me seemed tantamount to toilet - papering my locker or scribbling my phone number on the boy 's locker room wall .
We had been close for well over a decade .
We supported each other through parental deaths , and together we 'd bitched and moaned about men for untold hours .
I loved her amazing daughter -- buying that little girl Christmas presents was the highlight of my holidays .
Suddenly , that was all gone .
Suddenly , I was n't laughing .
I was crying .
We know what to do when boyfriends dump us : sob .
We eat everything in the house or take to our beds and refuse all sustenance .
Usually , there 's yelling -- at least at my house .
The Frisky : How NOT to help heal a broken heart
We purge them from our lives .
We delete all their emails and erase their number from every electronic device we own .
But when you break up with a girlfriend , things are murkier .
For one thing , people do n't feel sorry for you the way they do when a romantic relationship bites the dust .
You can't blame them ; it 's not like you were in love or planning a future with your friend .
( Even though you assumed she 'd be part of it . )
So , getting wound up about the loss seems somehow , I do n't know , less legit .
Is it ?
It hurts as much as any other heartbreak .
Victoria Clark made a short film on the subject : " Ruminations on You and Me . " I asked her about the process of grieving a dead friendship .
" As a woman , I expect men to come and go because of the nature of love , " she explained .
" But your girls are supposed to be on your side , no matter what ...
That 's what I wanted to believe for a long time , but now I know that that 's not always reality . "
The Frisky : What are your rules for friendship on Facebook ?
A friend of mine was saddened when her BFF excised my friend from her life after landing a boyfriend .
" She hated being single , so if there was a man anywhere in the vicinity , you'd be kicked to the curb , " my pal explained wistfully .
Even forewarned with this knowledge , it stung when she was dismissed from her friend 's life .
The Frisky : Five ways to unfriend a friend
Unlike my breakup , there was no dramatic defriending .
This woman utilized the passive - aggressive method of choice : the slow fade .
" I remember buying her a birthday gift , but somehow she just never had the time to come collect it . "
The Frisky : Ten songs about friendship
Like any other kind of relationship , friendships end .
It 's not like I 've never dumped a pal .
I 've gotten back together with a few .
Because I miss her and love her , I gave making up a shot with this one .
A few weeks after I was banished from her Facebook page , I emailed her an apologetic note .
I never heard back .

I got several requests for a T - shirt based on the last comic ; so KA - POW !!!
If I keep selling my tees at this rate , I will soon be able to retire in
luxury on my own private island ( on Second Life ) .
Photo by : ellievanhoutte
Laying some groundwork for a future post , I wanted to have a quick discussion about a topic that amazes me as a complete disconnect between reality and policy .
Price controls have been suggested as solutions for everything from food shortages , to black markets during sieges ; but they have an amazing history of achieving the exact opposite of their intent .
In a recent example , Hugo Chavez has attempted price controls in Venezuela , with disastrous results .
Before I start talking about some other policy issues , I want to make sure that we all agree that price controls simply do not work .
What are Price Controls ?
Price controls are when some entity , typically a government , tries to externally set the price of something .
We most often see this in the form of price ceilings where the government tries to set the maximum price producers can charge for something .
One very common example of this is rent control .
The government does n’t want property owners “ gouging ” their tenants , so they set a variety of rules on what the landlord can charge .
As we will see , this never has the desired effect .
Keeping It Simple
What price controls advocates never seem to accept is that changing the price of something does n’t affect the supply of that thing .
The government can say that all Ferraris only cost $ 50 , but that does n’t mean everyone can have a Ferrari .
In fact , Ferrari will immediately stop producing them .
The purpose of markets is to make sure that resources get to the people who want them the most .
Keeping prices low leads to overconsumption , inefficient allocation of resources , discrimination , and disincentive to increase supply .
Let ’s look at some simple examples :
Overconsumption
Imagine that there is a shortage of milk .
If prices escalate to high levels , people will only use milk when they very much need it and ca n’t find alternatives .
If prices are kept artificially low , people will consume it in cases where it is not absolutely necessary .
Obviously this will only exacerbate the problem of the shortage .
Inefficient Allocation
Suppose we have a copper shortage in this country and copper producers are charging what the government deems an unfair price .
We have two factories who want to use the copper to make wire .
One is much more efficient than the other and can produce more wire with the same amount of copper .
Obviously since Factory A can make more wire with the same amount of the scarce copper , it ’s good for everyone except the owners of Factory B if all the copper goes to Factory A .
But if someone intervenes and keeps copper prices low , Factory B can stay in business and now we have copper being wasted , because Factory B can afford to keep wasting it .
Discrimination
If I can only sell my products at a given maximum price , then I ’m going to use other characteristics to decide to whom I sell .
Since I ’m not determining on price , I can choose based on race , gender , nepotism , or whatever other unsavory criteria I wish to apply .
This may also include under the counter payments or other things that subvert the intention to begin with .
Disincentive to Increase Supply
In our example with copper , price controls also create situations where we wo n’t extract copper that would be more profitable without price controls .
If the prices are kept at lower levels then people wo n’t build new mines , which will keep supply down and prices up .
If copper costs $ 25 per ton to extract and I can only sell it for $ 20 , I wo n’t bother mining it .
Rent Control – A Prevalent Example
Rent control is a particularly galling example of these issues .
With a bit of thought you can see all the examples of the problems of price ceilings .
There is obvious overconsumption – if someone who earns less money wants to live in a certain neighborhood , they get roommates because they ca n’t afford to live there .
Thus two people are making use of the same dwelling .
If the prices are kept unnaturally low , they do n’t have to get roommates and the same amount of people are consuming more available housing .
This also leads to inefficient allocation where people are unable to live in their ideal locations due to overconsumption .
Rent control obviously makes it less appealing to own rental properties where you are not allowed to charge what you like for use of your property .
It makes it less appealing to build new properties as well , so the supply of property will stay low , keeping rents high .
There are also many cases of discrimination and abuse , where landlords who ca n’t get additional money for their apartments choose instead to rent to celebrities .
The Moral Issue
The debate about price controls always gets high jacked by those who advocate for it .
I am not suggesting that the aim of affordable housing is undesirable ; I ’m suggesting that rent control achieves the exact opposite of its intended goal .
Somehow this suggestion always gets painted as callousness towards those with lower incomes , when in fact it is the exact opposite .
The usual intended goal is to increase diversity in these areas by keeping rents affordable , as if people ca n’t get roommates or find other ways to live where they want .
Even if you accept that rent control works , which it does not , there is still a further moral issue .
You are essentially deciding that you as the government want diversity and that property owners should pay for it .
If the government wants diversity , why not subsidize it with government money instead of appropriating a land owner ’s property .
The subsidy will increase spending on rents , making it more profitable to own property , which will have the opposite effects of those of rent controls .
Assar Lindbeck , a Socialist mind you , once said , “ In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city - except for bombing . ” )
While obviously that ’s hyperbole , it speaks to the oddity of continuation of the policy with no substantive evidence that it works .
Ultimately I am patiently waiting for someone to explain to me the examples of price controls that have worked .

Lord Carter 's Digital Britain review has been the most comprehensive examination of the media and telecoms landscape in the UK in recent memory .
Its impact will reverberate across the industry for some time – regardless of how long the communications minister himself remains in government .
January 's interim report set out five objectives : upgrading and modernising the UK 's digital networks ; encouraging investment in the digital economy ; ensuring " UK content for UK users " ; providing access for all to new digital technologies ; and developing the skills needed to enable widespread take - up of public services online .
It also had 22 so - called action points ;
Carter 's final report tomorrow will have twice that number , spanning everything from digital literacy and protecting children on the internet , to solving Channel 4's funding crisis and combating online piracy .
Here are some of the main areas …
Broadband
Carter called for a new universal broadband commitment in his interim report : by 2012 he wants everyone in the UK to have internet access at the speed necessary for watching live TV .
Currently almost 4 m homes cannot get broadband at the 2 Mb / sec speed he envisaged .
Who wants what :
Carter focused on the possibility of using the UK's five mobile phone networks to provide broadband in more remote parts of the UK , assuming that upgrading BT 's existing lines would be too expensive .
The mobile operators want him to free - up part of the so - called digital dividend – the part of the airwaves released when the analogue TV signal is switched off in 2012 – so it can be used for mobile broadband .
Two of them – O2 and Vodafone – want to be able to use the spectrum that was were granted by Margaret Thatcher back in the 1980s for mobile broadband as soon as possible .
Their rivals , however , see this as giving them an unfair advantage .
BT has been lobbying hard for government money to improve the nation 's millions of miles of copper wire , arguing that the fixed - line network is the best long - term option for broadband .
The company wants to use the digital switchover surplus from the BBC licence fee – the cash currently used by the corporation to help people migrate to digital television , which will be no longer needed when the analogue signal is switched off – to be freed up to pay for a universal broadband service commitment .
Getting either mobile or fixed - line broadband to every UK household , including the final 1 - 2 % of homes in very remote areas , would cost billions , however .
The satellite broadband industry thinks it could plug the gap but needs the government to underwrite funding for the launch of new satellites such as the planned Hercules satellite – which is due to go into orbit in 2011 , at a cost of £ 500 m .
The actual kit may also have to be subsidised to bring it within the reach of consumers .
Likely result :
Carter is expected to use the digital switchover surplus to bring universal broadband access .
However Kip Meek , the Digital Britain consultant charged with doing a deal with the five mobile phone networks in order to push 3G mobile broadband services beyond the 80 % of the population already reached , has not yet managed to get a consensus .
There are still sticking points about which operator can use which part of the airwaves and when Vodafone and O2 can launch their service – but a deal is expected within weeks .
Part of the digital dividend – the spectrum left over when the analogue TV signal is switched off – will be freed - up for the mobile phone companies .
It will be sliced into three blocks with the mobile companies expected to gang together to buy up the spare capacity .
Regional coverage targets will ensure that particular areas get a signal for the first time , allowing Carter to proclaim that he is bringing mobile phone services to every part of the UK .
With regard to universal broadband , BT is expected to be given the go - ahead to improve customer lines and will get the majority of the digital switchover money to push its fixed - line network into more remote areas .
The universal broadband service , however , will only reach about 98 % of the population – Carter is expected to say that satellite broadband can be used to reach 100 % coverage , with the government and regional development agencies working in partnership to try and reduce the cost of such services .
It is unlikely , however , that he will call for direct government funding of satellite broadband .
Carter 's final report will also address the issue of so - called next - generation broadband networks .
Virgin Media is already offering services at 50 Mb / sec , while BT will next month start trials of its 40 Mb / sec fibre - optic network with its ISP customers in North London .
A range of technical changes is expected to be introduced that make it easier and cheaper to build next - generation networks , including opening up public infrastructure such as tunnels and ducts – and Carter will also clarify the complex rules that govern how fibre - optic networks are taxed under the business rates regime .
There is not expected to be any massive injection of public funds in the creation of next - generation access networks , not least because BT recently announced it is speeding up the roll - out of its new network so it will reach a million homes by next year .
But changes to the way that Ofcom operates – so that its remit includes encouraging investment – will be used to ensure heavy - handed regulation does not hinder the market 's ability to develop next - generation networks .
Online piracy
Protecting the UK's creative industries from piracy was a main aim of the interim report – although Carter admitted at the time that this area of his thinking was the least well - formed .
Since January he has been locked in talks with ISPs and the content industry , and has released a further consultation document which set out the possible role for a " rights agency " that would bring the two warring factions together .
Who wants what :
Put bluntly , the content industry , and especially the music companies , wanted blood .
They were deeply heartened by France 's introduction of the Hadopi law – a so - called three strikes system of warning letters before disconnection from the internet for up to a year – and wanted a similar system in the UK .
That law , however , has since fallen foul of the French legal system and more recently the content industry , particularly film and television companies , has been calling for " technical measures " .
Consumers believed to be illegally sharing copyrighted material would receive warning letters , but then would have their connection speeds slowed , rather than facing outright disconnection .
Several of the ISPs , however , do not want to have to police the internet .
They believe that responsibility lies with the owners of copyrighted material , who should defend their own property rather than turn ISPs into collection agencies for big business .
If internet companies are forced into policing the web , they have argued , then the content industry needs to pick up the tab through some form of levy .
The ISPs would prefer to see the creation of compelling legitimate downloading and streaming services backed by major content companies , providing consumers with an easy – and , most importantly , cheap – alternative to piracy .
The videogames industry , meanwhile , just wants Lord Carter to acknowledge that it exists – something he failed to do in the interim report .
It has been lobbying for the government to introduce a more favourable tax regime to help counter a brain drain which has seen developers quit the UK for countries such as Canada .
The games industry thinks piracy can be defeated through the introduction of online services and games that can only be played when connected to a central server which checks the authenticity of the product .
Likely result :
The government sees nothing to be gained this close to an election from making criminals , with no trial , of the estimated six to seven million people who have downloaded illegally copied material .
Carter will not introduce a so - called " three strikes " system which results in people being summarily disconnected – instead he is expected to codify in legislation last year 's memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) between several ISPs and the content industry , which resulted in warning letters being sent out to persistent illegal file - sharers .
All ISPs will have to sign - up to a new warning letter regime which will be backed up by " technical measures " that will see the worst offenders have their connection speeds reduced sharply .
Exactly how those measures will work and what standard of proof and appeals procedure will be needed , will be the job of the ISPs and content players to work out through the auspices of the " rights agency " – although that will not , however , be its name .
Funding for the new body and regime will come from industry , although Carter is not understood to be in favour of industry levies on computer or internet equipment .
But it will still be the responsibility of content owners – either individually or through their own trade bodies – to take any legal action against persistent offenders on whom " technical measures " fail to make any impression .
The new regime , however , should deal with all but the most hardened file - sharer .
In parallel , Carter will also make another plea for content companies to create compelling legitimate online services .
This summer will see , for instance , the introduction of subscription - based streaming music services from Sky and Virgin Media – and Channel 4 recently announced plans to put much more content on its 4 oD platform .
As for the videogames industry , the government is looking at changes to the tax regime in the UK to prevent the brain drain of developers out of the country .
Lord Carter 's report is expected to say that the Treasury will introduce tax changes later this year .
" We do recognise the importance of the videogames industry to the British economy .
Research and development tax credits are available for the industry , and we are looking at introducing further tax breaks , " the new culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said in the House of Commons last week .
The report will also look at the way that videogames are classified and how effectively age ratings are enforced by retailers .
Media Ownership :
The local and regional media industry is in turmoil .
Newspapers are being shut , jobs are being lost and the provision of local news is in a dire state as advertising migrates to the internet and the recession bites .
In January , Carter announced plans to discuss potential changes to the rules governing the merger of local and regional media companies with the Office of Fair Trading , Ofcom and media companies in order to see whether the industry can be saved by a spate of mergers and consolidation .
Who wants what :
Local and regional newspaper groups believe scale is the only way to survive the recession – and they want to be able to swap assets as well as merge their businesses .
Deals being considered include merging DMGT 's Northcliffe with some of Trinity Mirror 's titles in the Midlands , while Johnston Press could pick up some of its Yorkshire titles .
Guardian Media Group , owner of MediaGuardian , is seen as an obvious ultimate home for other Trinity titles such as the Liverpool Echo .
Newspaper groups are also expected to move daily publications onto a weekly print run to save costs .
In fact tomorrow morning , Christopher Thomson , chief executive of DC Thomson & Co , Johnston Press chief executive John Fry , Carolyn McCall , head of Guardian Media Group and Trinity Mirror 's Sly Bailey will appear before the culture , media and sport select committee to discuss " the future for local and regional media " .
MPs want reassurance that consolidation will not lead to a reduction in local news provision , with newspaper proprietors aggregating their teams into central locations and ignoring outlying regions .
Investment bankers in the City , meanwhile , are licking their lips at the prospect of the advisory fees that can be garnered from knocking the UK 's four key regional news players into just two .
Likely result :
The Digital Economy Bill , which will be set before parliament later this year in order to implement Carter 's proposals , will include a relaxation of the rules governing local and regional newspaper ownership .
Some newspaper owners , however , will be disappointed by the final Digital Britain report .
They had hoped that Carter would look at the issue of online aggregators , such as Google news , who do not always give them the opportunity to monetise the traffic around their content .
Channel 4 / BBC
Worldwide
January 's interim report threw its weight behind a tie - up between Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide , instead of a merger with Channel Five , and the creation of a " new entity " with public service broadcasting at its heart .
C4 had argued that its long - term survival was in serious doubt and that it faced an annual funding gap of £ 150 m from 2012 .
The door was , however , left ajar for a potential Five deal .
Who wants what ?
The idea of a complete merger between BBC Worldwide and C4 was raised early but the plan was considered wholly unacceptable to the BBC .
The focus then moved to thrashing out a blueprint for some form of joint venture tie - up of assets .
Five , which has experienced a 30 % drop in advertising revenues year - on - year , is desperate not to be left out of the latest round of consolidation ; Dawn Airey , the chairman and chief executive of Five , has vigorously promoted a tie - up with C4 , an idea that failed to gain traction several years ago .
Five 's argument is that , with adequate protections around public service broadcasting , a merged entity could fit the requirements of Digital Britain .
John Smith , the chief executive of BBC Worldwide , told the House of Lords communications committee earlier this month that the partnership would include his business 's UK assets , including its 50 % stake in the UKTV pay - TV channels business , that includes Gold and Dave , and its 60 % stake in the DVD business 2 Entertain .
The venture could also include the remaining 50 % in UKTV held by Virgin Media , which BBC Worldwide is keen to acquire , and the 40 % of 2 Entertain owned by Woolworths .
The venture has focused primarily around leveraging " TV / screen - based assets " , which might mean that assets such as the BBC 's magazine operations are out of bounds .
The door has been left open to include areas that fall under the nebulous category of " special interest " , however .
Ofcom , in its report on the future of public service broadcasting which fed into Digital Britain , also said that C4 could potentially benefit from a " one-off allocation " from the BBC 's so - called switchover surplus to help shore up its finances to do deals .
Likely result ?
Carter and the former culture secretary , Andy Burnham , have already begun managing expectations around tomorrow 's report .
Burnham has said not to expect a " tablet of stone " but " powerful seeds and ideas " from which the future of public service broadcasting might be shaped .
It is understood that BBC Worldwide and C4 do not have a done deal on the structure of the new entity , and observers do not believe Carter will unveil a final blueprint .
Carter is stuck between a rock and hard place , with any BBC asset - sharing that resembles state aid likely to lead to official complaints .
This makes it likely that Carter will , again , give the go ahead to a C4 / BBC Worldwide tie - up with a potential focus on how governance and ownership issues will be tackled .
Provision of regional news
ITV intends to pull out of providing the programming for a regional news service from 2012 .
What happens next could depend on what Carter 's report says about the use – or not – of the £ 130 m - a - year " digital switchover surplus " from the licence fee .
Who wants what ?
The idea that regional news could be run by various independent news consortia was raised in Ofcom 's public service broadcasting report .
The consortia , which could see media companies such as STV , Reuters , ITN , PA or the Guardian Media Group deliver regional news , would be funded by between £ 40 m to £ 60 m annually from the licence - fee switchover surplus .
There has been a tug - of - war of sorts over how this potential sum , which could be £ 250 m - plus , might be used .
Carter has indicated that it could help fund plans to achieve universal broadband targets .
The BBC has aggressively defended attempts to " top slice " the licence fee .
Michael Lyons , chairman of the BBC Trust , has said that using these funds for projects beyond the BBC 's public purpose would be an " act of bad faith " and " tantamount to breaking a contract " .
Likely result ?
The debate over what the switchover surplus should , or should n't , be used for is arguably less thorny than discussions over how it can be used .
It has been argued in some quarters that for the switchover surplus to be used , Carter would need to look at somehow formalising a new governance and funding structure to allow it to be tapped .
In terms of where the money might be used , if it is freed up , lobbying for funding for the independent consortia plan has made headway against proposals to use the cash solely for broadband .
Early indications suggested that the switchover funding could be split between the two plans , although some more recent estimates of the cost of a regional news service cast doubt over the ability to do this .
Seeing Through All the Propaganda About Iran
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
WASHINGTON — Iran ’s political crisis continues to blaze .
It ’s still impossible to say which leaders or factions will emerge victorious , but one thing is certain : the earthquake in the Islamic Republic is shaking the Mideast and deeply confusing everyone , including the US government .
Highlighting the complexity of this crisis , Meir Dagan , the head of Israel ’s intelligence agency , Mossad , reportedly voiced his hope that Iran ’s embattled president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , would remain in office .
On the surface , that sounds absurd , since Ahmadinejad is Israel ’s Great Satan .
But , according to Dagan , if Ahmadinejad ’s supposedly " moderate " rival , Mir Hossein Mousavi , came to power , it would be harder for Israel to keep up its propaganda war against Iran over Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Besides , added the Mossad chief , the devil you know is better .
Meanwhile , we have been watching an intensifying western propaganda campaign against Iran , mounted by the US and British governments .
What we hear is commentary and analysis that comes from bitterly anti-regime Iranian exiles , " experts " with an ax to grind , and US pro-Israel neocons yearning for war with Iran .
In viewing the Muslim world , Westerners keep listening to those who tell them what they want to hear , rather than the facts .
We are at it again in Iran .
President Barack Obama ’s properly stated he would refrain from being seen to " meddle " in Iran ’s internal affairs in spite of calls by hard - line Republicans for American action — whatever that might be .
Obama did the right thing by apologizing for the US / British coup that overthrew Iran ’s democratic Mossadegh government in 1953 .
But that was not the whole story .
Washington has been attempting to overthrow Iran ’s Islamic government since the 1979 revolution and continues to do so in spite of pledges of neutrality in the current crisis .
The US has laid economic siege to Iran for 30 years , blocking desperately needed foreign investment , preventing technology transfers , and disrupting Iranian trade .
In recent years , the US Congress voted $ 120 million for anti-regime media broadcasts into Iran , and $ 60 - 75 million funding opposition parties , violent underground Marxists like the Mujahidin - i- Khalq , and restive ethnic groups like Azeris , Kurds , and Arabs under the so - called " Iran Democracy Program . "
The arm of Iran ’s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , remains withered from a bomb planted by the US - backed Mujahidin - i- Khalq , who were once on the US terrorist list .
Pakistani intelligence sources put CIA ’s recent spending on " black operations " to subvert Iran ’s government at $ 400 million .
According to an ABC News investigation , President George Bush signed a " finding " that authorized an accelerated campaign of subversion against the Islamic Republic .
Washington ’s goal was " regime change " in Tehran and installation of a pro-US regime of former Iranian royalist exiles .
While the majority of protests we see in Tehran are genuine and spontaneous , Western intelligence agencies and media are playing a key role in sustaining the uprising and providing communications , including the newest electronic method , via Twitter .
These are covert techniques developed by the US during recent revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia that brought pro-US governments to power .
The Tehran government made things worse by limiting foreign news reports and arresting prominent politicians .
Its leadership is increasingly — and dangerously — split over how to handle the protests .
We also hear lot of hypocrisy from Western capitals .
Washington , Ottawa , London and Paris piously accused Iran of improper electoral procedures while utterly ignoring the total lack of democracy in their authoritarian Mideast allies such as Egypt , Morocco , and Saudi Arabia , that never hold elections and throw political opponents into prison and torture them .
Compared to them , Iran , for all its faults , is almost a model of democratic governance .
The US , France and Saudi Arabia just cooperated to rig Lebanon ’s recent elections , dishing out millions in bribe money to ensure victory of the pro-US faction .
France ’s President Nicholas Sarkozy had the chutzpah to rebuke Iran for improper election procedures after returning from the funeral of Gabon ’s dictator , Omar Bongo , who had ruled for 41 years and supplied France with cheap oil .
When Hamas won a fair and square democratic election in Gaza , the US and Israel swiftly moved to mount a coup against the new Palestinian government .
US senators , led by John McCain , blasted Iran for not respecting human rights .
That ’s pretty rich after they just voted to bar the public release of ghastly torture photos from US prisons in Iraq , want secret US prisons kept open , and champion torture .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , one of the dimmest bulbs in the weak - wattage Republican ranks , called for US intervention in Iran .
Graham was an architect of the Iraq fiasco .
Let ’s air assault the warlike senator into downtown Tehran .
ber-moral Canada , which backed Pakistan ’s military dictatorship under Gen. Pervez Musharraf , accused Tehran of unfair elections .
There are many questions about Iran ’s vote , of which incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won by 60 % .
Voter turnout was an amazing 84 % , putting to shame the US and Europe , where less than half of voters exercise their right .
Pre-election polls that showed Ahmadinejad headed for a big win were right .
All those foreigners praying for his defeat and the collapse of the Islamic government may be deeply disappointed .
But it also appears there were significant — though as far as we know now — not decisive irregularities .
Iran ’s government has admitted that some ballot boxes were stuffed , and the speaker of the Majils ( parliament ) , the capable Ali Larijani , rebuked certain unnamed clerics for trying to rig results .
This was extremely stupid , as Ahmadinejad was way ahead in pre-election polls anyway , and very popular .
This leaves Washington in a quandary .
President Obama sincerely wants to enter into talks with Iran over its nuclear program and try to convince Tehran to give up enrichment .
But hardliners in his cabinet and Congress are urging Obama to seize the opportunity to further destabilize Iran .
Bad idea .
A stable Iran is essential to a stable Mideast .
Mossad chief Dagan knows what he ’s talking about .
US and British efforts to subvert Iran ’s government could yet blow up in our faces .
And do we really need another monster crisis after Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq and Palestine ?
Meanwhile , other Mideast nations allied to the US will look at Iran and conclude that giving any democratic rights can be downright dangerous and must be avoided at all costs .

When your company starts to develop and even has a branch office , of course , the most appropriate business strategy is …
Last weekend I visited the SPEZI and met the guys from SIMPLE.ch.
SIMPLE is a swiss bicycle manufacturer who developed a carbon belt driven premium bicycle .
The SIMPLE bicycles are designed to reduce the maintenance level to a minimum .
So it´s a logical approach to use the carbon belt instead of a standard chain .
The advantages for city cyclist are :
– No dirty trousers anymore because of chain oil !
– No need to oil the chain .
Less maintenance !
– New design possibilities .
The chain case is reduced to a stylish spoiler !
The modifications on the bicycle frame are minimal .
A srew on the rear chainstay allows you to open the frame and to put the carbon belt inside the frame triangel .
The SIMPLE bicycle has a mechanical sled on both sides of the dropout to adapt the distance between bottom bracket and rear dropout .
This makes it easy to fit in the belt the first time .
In case of a flat tire the sled is not needed because there is no big tension on the belt .
The depth of the tooth is so high that it accepts a low tensioned belt .
Here you see how powerfull this drivetrain is :
The optional hubs are the Speedhub from Rohloff and the SHIMANO Alfine .
During the testride I noticed via my legs a smooth feeling !
Let ´s see how the longterm behavior ot the belt will be !
The days of the steel chain are numbered .
First we´ll see a replacement in the premium city and touring bicycles .
Because of the price and the customized frames .
But prices for the belt will fall and the bicycle mass market will absorb a new technology !
Other drivetrain alternatives are discussed in this video… ( sorry only in swiss language ! ) .
Prison officer zaps children with 50,000 - volt stun gun ' to show them what a day at work is like '
Walter Schmidt used a stun gun like this one to administer powerful electric shocks to children touring the prison
Prison officer Walter Schmidt wanted to give his colleagues ' children a taste of what their mums and dads get up to at work while showing them around a Florida jail .
So to make the youngsters ' experience all the more realistic as they toured Franklin Correctional Institution during the lock - up 's ' Take our Daughters and Sons to Work Day ' , he decided to zap them with his 50,000 - volt stun gun .
The jolt sent at least two of them sprawling to the floor , crying out in pain and clutching at agonising burns on their arms .
One child ended up in hospital .
But 37 - year - old Schmidt told officials who later fired him that he had only been trying to show the children - whose parents all work at the jail near Tallahassee - what a typical day involves while handling unruly inmates .
' It was n't intended to be malicious , but educational , ' he explained to the St Petersburg Times .
' The big shock came when I got fired . '
Sgt Schmidt , who had served as a jailer for 14 years and was in charge of the prison arsenal , claims that he had asked permission from the children 's parents for the stunt .
' When they said " Sure " I went ahead and did it , ' he shrugged .
Florida 's Secretary of Corrections , Walter McNeil , has ordered an investigation into the incident .
The stun gun Schmidt used , known as an electronic immobilisation device , delivers a shock up to 450 times stronger than the current in a household electric socket .
The stun gun used by Schmidt was different to the Taser devices ( pictured ) used by police
It must be held directly on the victim 's body to deliver a shock - unlike a Taser , which fires dart - like electrodes into the skin from a distance .
The charge disrupts a person 's nervous system , causing involuntary muscle contractions that leave them temporarily immobilised .
Duffie Harrison , the chief warden at Franklin Correctional Institution , told Schmidt in a letter that he had ' engaged in inappropriate conduct while demonstrating weapons to several kids during a special event at the institution . '
' Your retention would be detrimental to the best interests of the state , ' the letter advised .
On education policy , appeasement is about as ineffective as it is in foreign affairs .
Many proponents of school choice , especially Democrats , have tried to appease teachers unions by limiting their support to charter schools while opposing private school vouchers .
They hope that by sacrificing vouchers , the unions will spare charter schools from political destruction .
But these reformers are starting to learn that appeasement on vouchers only whets unions appetites for eliminating all meaningful types of choice .
With voucher ...
It is not often in life , or law practice for that matter , that you can say to two opposing parties :
You both win .
Yet the recent decision of the California Supreme Court upholding Proposition 8 as a valid state constitutional amendment could point the way to a solution that both supporters and opponents of same - sex marriage would embrace -- if we can stop all the shouting .
The shouting in this instance comes in the form of a lawsuit asking the federal courts to find Proposition 8 a violation of the U.S. Constitution .
The duty to represent the state -- and hence to defend Proposition 8 itself -- falls to California Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , who opposed the measure .
Conflict of interest ?
No , says Brown , hierarchy of laws .
His oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution trumps his responsibility to California .
In a legal brief filed last week , Brown made clear that he believes the same - sex couples who filed the suit are right in their assertion that Proposition 8 violates the 14th Amendment .
Showing off his Jesuit training , Brown has seemingly found the “ fingers - crossed ” exception to enforcing the controversial proposition .
The gay couples could well win this legal battle because the U.S. Constitution , as construed in Romer vs. Evans and Lawrence vs .
Texas , denies the validity of laws that have no purpose other than allowing a majority to express animus for homosexuals .

In truth , however , it would be better if the matter were resolved in state court .
The state Supreme Court ’s ruling in the case is as inconsistent as it is incomplete , and it leaves the door open for legal action .
According to the court , “ It is only the designation of marriage that has been removed by this initiative measure , ” not the guarantee of equality .
But does holding that gay and traditional couples must be treated the same by the state -- even as gays can be denied the nomenclature of marriage -- make any sense ?
A further remedial decree is needed .
You ca n’t go up and down in an elevator at the same time , and neither can gays be said to have equality when they are being treated unequally .
The federal action was brought on behalf of two gay couples who were denied marriage licenses after the ruling that upheld Proposition 8 .
If such an action were instead brought in state court , California would have an opportunity to bring equity to both sides .
The attorney general , in defending the state ’s interest , could ask for a court order enjoining the state from using the terminology of marriage altogether .
Instead , the state would give everyone -- gay or straight -- a civil union license and allow churches , synagogues , temples and mosques to say who can and cannot “ marry ” within their individual traditions .
Religious freedom , a bedrock constitutional value of like importance to equality , would also be a winner .
In its original decision legalizing same - sex marriage , the state high court established an obligation for the state to treat gays and straights equally .
But it did n’t spell out what that finding would mean for religious bodies in their dealings with the state .
In the initiative campaign , Proposition 8 proponents argued in commercials that religious bodies would be compelled to perform marriages contrary to religious doctrine .
Religious schools and charities , the ads claimed , would be subject to vexatious litigation , and non-compliant religions would have their tax exemptions snatched .

Were those concerns overstated ?
Maybe , but putting aside homophobic ugliness that deserves no respect from the law , these religious fears cannot be dismissed , and they likely account for Proposition 8 ’s margin of victory .
Having it bluntly invalidated by the feds would miss this point .
Both sides ’ concerns could be resolved if a state court directed the Assembly to conform the Family Code to the Supreme Court ’s affirmation of equality .
All it would take is using the “ find and replace ” key on the computer to replace current references to “ marriage ” in government documents with the term “ civil union . ”
This would provide equality to gay and straight couples before the law of the state and cede the marital terminology back to religious institutions .
The state constitutional protection for freedom of religion is likely adequate to ensure that religious institutions remain free to choose whether to marry same - sex couples or not , but it is prudent to add a paragraph or two to the state code to emphasize the point -- as the legislatures in Connecticut and Vermont have done .
Need drafting help ?
Write me and I ’ll send it .
Of course , the federal government by statute categorically denies all federal benefits to gay couples .
This can not be changed by California alone , but if we get our own marital house in order by our own wits without relying on federal intervention , we will have helped the cause of justice the best way we can -- by being a good example .
A 29 - year - old El Monte man has been charged with violating federal child pornography laws after disclosing on his application to become a California Highway Patrol officer that he had viewed illegal pornography on the Internet , authorities said .
CHP officials , working in conjunction with the FBI on a multiagency task force , immediately launched an investigation of Christian Hernandez after he made the disclosure while applying to the agency in October , said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller .
Hernandez also admitted having viewed illicit photos of a minor within a month of filling out the application , Eimiller said .
CHP investigators performed a consent search of the home where Hernandez was living and found child pornography on a computer he was using , including sexually explicit photos of a 5 - year - old girl .
The photos appeared to have been taken in the bedroom of the home where Hernandez now lives , Eimiller said .

Hernandez was arrested last week on state charges of suspicion of committing a lewd act with a child and booked into Los Angeles County Jail .
He was released on bail two days later .
On Tuesday , he was charged in federal court with possessing and manufacturing child pornography , authorities said .
Hernandez is being held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles .
He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday .

Chinese army nears USA 's borders
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva arrived in China for a visit .
Strange as it may seem , there can be hardly any information found about the visit , which takes place on May 18 - 20 .
It brings up the idea that South America is working on an alliance with Asia ’s largest states .
It is not ruled out that China may eventually strengthen its influence near the borders of the United States and even set up Chinese army bases in the region .
Chinese army nears USA 's borders
Brazil , the largest country of Latin America , suffered political and economic cataclysms during the 1990s just like the USSR .
The largest country of the region has never been wealthy .
Like most oligarchic countries , which are predominant in Latin America , only two percent of the population owns 97 percent of the nation ’s wealth .
Brazil ’s official language is Portuguese , whereas people in all other countries of the region speak Spanish .
This peculiarity could probably be the reason why the country failed to obtain close allies in South America .
The county has always stood alone from economic , political and military processes on the continent , although it has enormous natural resources .
China is also a lonesome state in its own region .
This huge country has problems with almost all of its neighbors .
China has been trying to find as many allies and followers as possible on remote continents .
The Chinese government realizes that it may eventually become the prime enemy for the Western world .
Brazil and China established their strategic partnership in 1993 .
China has become the largest consumer of Brazilian goods .
The Brazilian president stated prior to his visit to China that the volume of the trade turnover between the two countries could increase eleven times .
Brazil and China have a great deal of opportunities for cooperation in the energy field .
For example , China signed a deal with Brazil ’s oil giant Petrobras to deliver up to 160,000 barrels of oil a day to the petrochemical branch of China ’s Sinopec and to PetroChina .
In return , China offered Petrobras $ 10 billion for the development of its new enterprises .
The construction of Embraer Virtual Lab became Brazil ’s most landmark achievement in China ( Embraer is a Brazilian aircraft - maker , one of the world ’s leading makers of regional passenger liners ) .
The cooperation between Brazil and China is mostly based on barter agreements .
China may become Brazil ’s most reliable partner in the field of defense cooperation , experts say .
It goes without saying that China will do anything to set up its army bases in Latin America .

One week to 2009 elections
Millions in Europe sink into unemployment and poverty
By Dietmar Henning and Elizabeth Zimmermann
1 June 2009
The elections to the European parliament on June 7 take place in the midst of the deepest crisis of capitalism since the 1930s and an extremely tense social situation .
Many millions are being plunged into unemployment and poverty , while a small minority of shareholders , stock market speculators and managers have been able to acquire enormous wealth .
The gross domestic product in Europe sank in the first quarter of 2009 compared to one year previously by 4.4 percent .
The German economy , which is strongly dependant on exports , declined over the same period by 6.9 percent .
The Eastern European countries have been particularly hard hit .
In the Baltic States , GDP has plunged by between 10.9 and 18.6 percent .
Twenty years after the reestablishment of capitalism , the Eastern European member states in the European Union ( EU ) have entered an advanced stage of economic and political collapse .
Although official statistics invariably underestimate the real extent of the situation , the available figures make clear the catastrophic extent of the social decline .
Rapidly rising unemployment , increasing misery and the pauperisation of whole regions are an indictment of the antisocial policies of the European Union and its respective national states .
None of the official parties dares to address the problems afflicting millions of EU citizens .
Instead their election campaigns have concentrated on a bombastic hymn of praise for the EU institutions in Brussels .
Against this background the broad antipathy for the European elections is hardly surprising .
It is an expression of increasing opposition in the population and augurs major class struggles .
The election campaign of the Socialist Equality Party ( Partei für Soziale Gleichheit , PSG ) is based on a conscientious analysis of economic , social and political conditions in Europe , and fights on this basis for a socialist perspective .
Mass unemployment and poverty
Official unemployment rates have risen considerably across Europe .
According to Eurostat , the statistical office of the European community , unemployment in the member countries of the EU in March 2009 totalled over 20 million .
This represents an increase of 4 million compared to March 2008 .
These official figures do not accurately reflect the real situation .
First of all , no current figures are available for some countries and , secondly , all governments use various statistical tricks to exclude many millions of unemployed persons .
In Britain , nearly 1.5 million people applied for unemployment benefit in March .
This figure represents a more than 80 percent increase compared to one year previously .
In Spain , the official unemployment rate stands at 17.4 percent compared to 10.5 percent in May 2008 .
Unemployment has doubled over the same period in Ireland , while unemployment has trebled in the Baltic states of Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia in the space of one year .
In countries such as Germany and Austria , the growth in unemployment has been largely delayed by the widespread introduction of short - time working .
In April 2009 , 2 million workers were working short - time in Germany .
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) forecasts a drastic rise in unemployment in Germany to over 5 million in the coming months .
The EU and all European governments are using mass unemployment in order to implement cuts to wages and social conditions .
This applies to all governments irrespective of whether they are social - democratic or conservative .
The European Commission has become synonymous with deregulation , liberalisation and the dismantling of employee rights .
The “ Bolkenstein Guidelines ” of the EU have circumvented traditional minimum and contract wages as well as workplace standards .
The “ Flexicurity ” demanded by the EU ( a hybrid of flexibility and security ) , has given companies the possibility of imposing dismissals and wage cuts .
At the same time , this measure has been implemented to withhold financial support for the unemployed .
Allegedly this withdrawal of unemployment benefit is to encourage the unemployed to find work more quickly .
In reality , the measure is aimed at forcing the unemployed to accept cheap wage jobs and facilitating drastic cuts to general wage levels .
In an EU report released in March of this year , the authors write : “ The recent data show that 16 percent of Europeans are still threatened with poverty .
Although a good job is still the best protection against poverty , the fact that 8 percent of those in gainful employment are poor means that a job does not necessarily offer this protection . ”
The 16 percent of Europeans living in poverty — according to official figures — amounts to 80 million EU citizens .
In every EU country the main victims of unemployment and poverty are children and young people .
Another section of the EU report reads : “ In the EU children face a higher risk of poverty ( 19 percent ) than the total population .
The situation has not improved since 2000 . ”
In March 2009 the unemployment rate for under 25 - year - olds was about 18.3 percent across Europe .
In Spain , more than one third of this age group is without job .
Increasing numbers of high school graduates are unable to find adequate work and are forced to take two or three cheap wage jobs in order to survive .
These averages statistics , however , fail to describe the full extent of the social misery , which prevails in large parts of Europe .
If one examines the poverty in individual countries , individual regions and even individual cities , then an enormous geographical divide between rich and poor is evident .
In every European country there are regions that are sinking into bitter poverty : southern Spain , southern Italy , East Germany , and large regions in all other countries .
Entire regions are plagued by mass unemployment , with social welfare and poverty levels averaging 25 to 50 percent .
Entire suburbs of major cities and former industrial centres in Europe have fallen into ruin .
In cities like Paris , Athens , Warsaw or Rome , in the former workers ’ and immigrant quarters of Amsterdam , London , Berlin or the German Ruhr district , unemployment and poverty is often two or three times higher than national figures .
Wealth
While whole regions sink into poverty and misery , a small layer has been able to profit .
The figures given by Eurostat on income distribution in Europe are outdated and of limited validity .
National statistics are more reliable , even though they culminate in the year 2007 .
According to the German Institute for Economic Research ( DIW ) , in 2007 the richest 1 percent of Germans possessed 23 percent of all social assets ; the richest 10 percent possessed over 61 percent .
Half of the German population either lacks any wealth or is in debt .
This still does not reflect the entire extent of social inequality .
Within the richest 1 percent ( 82,000 citizens ) there are a handful of mega-rich .
According to one wealth distribution researcher , if wealth were measured on a chart in which € 100,000 corresponded to two centimetres , then the average annual income wealth of all adults in Germany ( i.e. , € 88,000 ) would measure a distance of 17.6 millimetres .
In contrast , the wealth of Germany ’s richest man , Karl Albrecht , owner of the Aldi retail chain , would measure exactly four kilometres on this scale .
This situation finds a similar reflection in every European country .
There are currently a total of 196 billionaires in Europe , 52 of whom reside in Germany .
The rich and their companies have been able to profit mainly from interest and shareholder dividends .
Basically they have been able to profit from the growing pauperisation of the European continent .
In particular , the big concerns use the nationalism of the trade unions to play off workers in the individual countries against one other and force through the pro-business measures passed by national governments and the EU bureaucracy .
As the crisis deepens and the assault on jobs and wages intensifies the trade unions line up even more closely with their respective governments and company managements .
When was the last time one heard the traditional slogan “ The same wages for the same work ! ” from the mouth of a union official or a works council ?
In the past few decades , the wage differential in Europe has grown enormously .
One working hour in Scandinavia , Germany , Britain and France costs between € 25 and € 30 ; in Poland , € 5 ; in the Baltic States and Slovakia , € 4 ; and in Bulgaria , which entered the EU at the beginning of 2007 , just € 1.40 .
This wage differential is to be found across a small geographical region .
From the German capital of Berlin it is only 100 km to the Polish border and slightly more than 1,000 km to the Latvian capital of Riga .
There exists a wage differential of over 90 percent over a distance of 1,000 km .
The widespread social decline has created conditions in which rightist political tendencies seek to stir up racism and win influence .
In Italy , Spain and Germany , but particularly in Eastern Europe , there is a growing wave of violence directed against foreign workers and socially disadvantaged layers .
In the new Eastern European , members of the EU , former Stalinist bureaucrats , have cooperated with major Western companies to expropriate all former socialised property and accumulated outrageous fortunes , while the population sinks into mass poverty and increasing misery .
Further attacks on democratic rights and pervasive corruption create conditions in which openly fascist forces are able to gain influence .
Socialist perspectives
The resistance against mass redundancies , plant closures and social pauperisation is increasing in all European countries .
In Lithuania , Iceland and Belgium the economic crisis has already led to the fall of national governments .
The rebellion against the European Union and national governments requires , however , an international socialist perspective .
In the European election the German Socialist Equality Party stresses : “ The PSG fights for the unity of the international working class .
In order to meet the attacks of globally operating companies workers must unite internationally .
We decisively oppose all attempts to drive a wedge between German and foreign workers or to incite German workers against their fellow workers in Eastern Europe or Asia . ”
The present crisis cannot be overcome by reforms or repairs to the nation - state system as proposed by the German Left Party , or the French NPA ( New Anti-capitalist Party ) and its European allies .
The only viable solution is a transformation of social relations and the building of a socialist society .
In Europe this requires a struggle against the European Union and its institutions , and for the United Socialist States of Europe .
This is the perspective put forward in the current European election by the International Committee of the Fourth International and its German section , the Socialist Equality Party .
Abstract
Following Staal 's program , this paper will first explain briefly how contradictions occurring in phenomenological texts can be understood .
Then the main part of the paper will be devoted to a description of phenomenological data collected during the practice of buddhist meditation .
Buddhism has been described in many ways .
It has been called a religion , a philosophy , a way of life and a psychology .
Each of these descriptions is correct and emphasizes different aspects .
Buddhism is a religion as it deals with questions of life and death and the meaning of life .
It is a philosophy as it does not need the hypothesis of a god or of life after death .
Buddhism is called a way of life as it teaches the way of non-violence and compassion .
Finally , it is called a psychology as it investigates the working of our mind and distinguishes different types of consciousness .
There is yet another way to describe buddhism , namely as a course .
The aim of this course is first the lessening and in the end the elimination of human suffering .
This goal is to be reached by using experimental phenomenology : investigation of our consciousness as it is presented to us by means of self - observation .
The method , both in theory and in practice , and some methodological considerations will be treated in this paper .
If we find ourselves in a situation that is not agreeable to us , there are essentially two different ways to attempt to overcome the resulting suffering .
On the one hand we can try to change the situation itself .
On the other hand we can try to change our consciousness of the situation in such a way that it is no longer experienced as unpleasant .
Depending on the circumstances and our possibilities , these attempts will be more or less successful .
It is clear that on the one hand science , technology and democracy have contributed considerably to the way our world can be controlled .
On the other hand , we have buddhism , in particular the `theravada ' school ( literary the `teachings of the elder ' ) that is focussed on the second possibility : eliminating suffering by changing our consciousness .
Having completed successfully the course described above implies that one is accomplished in being able to change freely one 's consciousness .
It may take many years , but the aim is worthwhile .
At one time in history the theravada buddhists found themselves in a world having poor social - economic conditions .
They were then criticized as ``thinking only about their own enlightenment , while the world is burning " .
This criticism was taken seriously .
As a result so called ` Mahayana ' ( `large vehicle ' ) buddhism developed .
The followers of this branch of buddhism worked on improving both their consciousness and the world .
To them it did not matter that the goal of overcoming suffering was going to be reached more slowly in this way : ``we should reach nirvana as the last ones " became the bodhisattva vow of Mahayana buddhism .
The Mahayana buddhists used the pejorative term ` Hinayana ' ( `small vehicle ' ) for the traditional theravada buddhism .
The difference is , however , a matter of emphasis .
A follower of theravada , too , will find it important to care for our environment .
But during the theravada buddhist course the attention is focussed on changing consciousness .
The sooner one has reached the goal the better , because with an improved state of mind , it is so much easier to create order around ourselves .
Mahayana buddhism became successful in China , Tibet , Korea and Japan , whereas the theravada school throve in Thailand , Birma and Sri Lanka .
It is tempting to explain this phenomenon by the difference in climate in the countries involved .
In the north living conditions are more difficult , therefore controlling the environment is more important and Mahayana developed .
As modern society is quite proficient in manipulating the environment , whereas the method of dealing with consciousness is little known , I expect in the future more influence of theravada buddhism .
This paper is about theory and practice as taught in this lineage .
One may wonder whether it is possible at all to overcome suffering by changing consciousness .
And if it is possible , whether it is desirable to do so .
We shall only discuss the first question .
The second one is left to the reader .
Suppose we are in a restaurant and the waiter does not come .
Even if we have plenty of time , we usually get somewhat irritated , often without noticing it .
It may happen that we suddenly realize : ``O , there is irritation in me " , and at once that irritation becomes much weaker or even disappears completely .
This phenomenon is called `néantiser ' by Sartre .
It feels like `melting away ' the emotion .
It should not be confused with suppressing the emotion .
This is the key to the end of suffering : we do not view ourselves as somebody that is irritated , but as somebody that sees irritation .
We do no longer identify with the emotion .
For a relatively light emotion as described , it is reasonably easy to apply the required detachment .
This kind of phenomenon , of melting a light emotion , is relatively well - known .
For stronger forms of irritation or of suffering in general , this method of objectification is more difficult to use .
A strong form of concentration is needed in order to do this .
Otherwise the irritation , for example , may immediately return after we have objectified it and consequently it keeps control of our consciousness .
However , concentration , albeit very essential , will not be the most important tool in reaching complete detachment .
In order to follow the buddhist course one has to develop insight in the way our mind works .
One of the fundamental statements of buddhism is that our consciousness is selfless .
Our feeling of `self ' is seen to be a form of attachment that has to be overcome in order to eliminate suffering .
It is remarkable that in order to obtain this insight one has to overcome a strong emotional resistance , the so called attachment to self .
Easier to understand forms of insight will be described in sections 2 and 3 .
For example that we are manipulated by our emotions because these consist of several components that diligently reinforce each other .
Having completed the buddhist path , or part of it , provides us with several sorts of profit .
We have already mentioned insight in the functioning of our mind .
Another effect is a considerable sharpening of our senses ( something that can be obtained also through other kinds of training ) .
Also we acquire the capacity to concentrate quickly .
However , the most important result , apart from the elimination of suffering , is freedom .
Buddha said
As the sea is pervaded by one taste , namely that of salt , in the same way my teaching is pervaded by one idea , that of freedom .
Phenomenology investigates consciousness as it is presented to us , we may say internally .
As was mentioned above , progress in the buddhist course is correlated to gaining insight in the functioning of our mind .
In fact it is necessary to have this phenomenological information in order to proceed on ` the path ' .
One may question the value of information obtained by self observation : `` Is it possible to be objective and precise ? "
The answer is affirmative .
The reason is that buddhist phenomenology derives its force from the systematic development of an essential discipline , namely meditation .
During meditation mental tools are being built that are used for experiments .
Experimental phenomenology is the principal method of meditation .
Nevertheless everything is internal , personal : with one 's own means one studies the working of one 's own consciousness .
Therefore the objectivity of buddhist phenomenology may be questioned .
The only thing that really convinces is taking part in the meditation experience .
But perhaps the following comparison is reassuring .
Mathematics is commonly recognized as a discipline of great precision and objectivity .
Yet that subject depends essentially on a notion of truth that is internal ( `intuition ' ) .
Although in mathematics one uses calculations and formal proofs , there is always a need to have an intuitive judgment that verifies the correctness of the computation or the proof .
Thus Husserl and Gödel rightly see mathematics as a part of phenomenology .
Even if mathematics is about structures that are beyond us , for example about the set of natural numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , it is nevertheless the case that our contact with these structures runs via internal processes .
Because of this phenomenological contact we are able to develop an objective mathematics concerning these natural numbers .
It is useful to compare buddhist phenomenology not only with mathematics , but also with a science , say physics .
In physics the theory is built on experimental data .
It is not true , however , that in order to study physics , one first learns all the possible experiments and then the development of the theory .
On the contrary , experiments and theory are essentially intertwined .
At first some simple theory is based on some empirical data .
Using this theory new questions may be asked and new and more refined or totally different experiments may be performed .
Then the theory is extended .
Etcetera .
The situation is analogous with buddhist phenomenology .
To the beginning student it is advised to have some confidence in the theory , but not to have blind faith .
When experience is obtained , more and more of the theory can be verified .
In this respect the theory is often compared to a map of an unknown country .
When during a trip in that country the data on the map turn out to be true , only then we start to have real confidence in it .
In chapter 2 and 3 the theory and practice of buddhist phenomenology will be described simultaneously .
Now we will explain how contradictions , which happen to occur in some buddhist texts , are possible .
Suppose some part of reality U is described using some language L. Some of the regularities observed in L are in fact physical laws , but may be confused with logical laws .
If we extend the reality U to U+ , but keep as the describing language L , then statements may result that contradict statements made about U. Although the contradictions are only apparent , because the statements are about different `worlds ' , it may seem that logical laws are violated .
An example will be helpful .
Consider a tribe living on an isolated island .
Vision of the tribesman is such that they can only see the colors black and white .
In their description of the world they say : ``Something is either black or white . "
Although we know that this is for them in fact an empirical law , the people of the island are tempted to consider this as a logical law .
Sometimes they use the words `white ' and `non - black ' interchangeably .
On some day someone has a mystical experience .
In our language we can say that that person has seen the color green .
In the language of the tribe she says : ``I have seen something very impressive .
It was neither black nor white . "
For most of the people of her tribe she was saying : `` It was neither black , nor non-black . "
Therefore on the island one may think she is speaking nonsense .
However , we know that she is not .
There are , however , stronger contradictions .
In his book Exploring Mysticism already mentioned , F. Staal discusses the following so called `tetra lemma ' occurring in buddhist texts .
It is not A ; it is not non -A ; it is both A and non -A ; and it is neither A nor non-A .
Even this contradiction may be explained .
Simply consider again the tribe seeing only black and white .
But now our mystic sees the color gray .
Indeed gray is not white , not black .
And it can be said that gray is both white and black .
But also that it is neither white nor black .
I hope that the examples show that contradictions occurring in texts of mystics are not a sign that something essential is wrong .
Nevertheless it is preferable that descriptions of altered states of consciousness are free from contradictions in the sense of logic .
I will try to fulfill this requirement in sections 2 and 3 .
In section 1 we have already indicated briefly what is the key to the elimination of suffering .
For example , by seeing in the right way that we are irritated , this irritation diminishes .
This mental act of seeing what happens to us , is called mindfulness .
The path , as the buddhist course is often called , consists of learning to become proficient in applying mindfulness .
Once one has successfully completed the course , mindfulness is total and without effort .
Then the mental formation of suffering can be fully seen and one is not touched by it anymore .
This does not imply that one becomes cold or indifferent .
In order to get a better understanding on the nature of the path , it should be compared to a course to learn to swim .
One can hear , read and speak about swimming , but progress can be made only by going into the water and doing one 's exercises .
Something similar holds for the buddhist path .
The beginning student of the buddhist course is advised to practice meditation daily , for example for a period of one hour .
However , essential progress is usually only made possible by so called intensive meditation .
` Intensive ' means more than eight hours a day ; it means engaging oneself every moment of the day with the act of mindfulness .
By meditating intensively for a period of ten days , one may make definite progress .
It is clear that for complete devotion to mindfulness one has to live for some time under special conditions that are suitable for ` the work ' .
Traditionally this happens in the monastery , the `laboratory ' for the mind .
The word `laboratory ' may sound peculiar to some readers .
Others may object to `monastery ' .
What is important are the following conditions .
Right living .
A private room in which one is not disturbed .
Right temperature .
Not too cold , not too hot .
Right food .
Not too much , not too little ; sufficiently nutritious .
Right friends .
Persons that take care of preparing food for the students should respect the meditation work that is being done .
Moreover an experienced teacher is essential .
The remainder of the paper is a description of the exercises and the resulting experience as obtained during some meditation retreats .
Although these experiences are my personal ones , the general tendency can be expected by anyone who follows the method .
There are three basic exercises : walking , sitting and prostrating ( bowing ) all with the aim of increasing mindfulness .
These exercises have to be performed with the utmost care .
To outsiders ( and many students of buddhism as well ) they will seem absurd .
Walking .
One starts by standing with the feet next to each other .
One says slowly in oneself : ``standing , standing , standing " .
Then very slowly the right foot is lifted and put forward one step .
Simultaneously one thinks : `` Right goes thus " , the thought exactly following the movement .
After this step there is a little pause .
Then one makes a step with the left foot and the thought follows : ``left goes thus " .
One continues like this for one hour .
The next time one walks , the mindfulness may be increased by naming more carefully the movements of the feet .
First ``lifting , treading " ; ``lifting " exactly when the foot leaves the floor and ``treading " exactly when the foot touches the floor again .
Then one uses consecutively ( each phrase for naming the movements is used for at least one hour ) : ``lifting , going , treading " ; ``heel up , lifting , going , treading " ; ``heel up , lifting , going , dropping , treading " ; and finally ``heel up ( extremely ) , lifting , going , dropping , treading , pressing front ( foot ) , pressing back ( foot ) " .
Sitting .
One sits on the floor on a cushion with one 's back straight and cross-legged .
For example in full or half lotus position .
The eyes are usually closed .
One does not move , even if there is pain in the legs , one has an itch or something the like .
One pays attention to one 's breathing by following the movements of the abdomen : ``raising , falling " or ``raising , rest , falling " .
Again the naming follows the body .
Sitting is done also for the period of an hour .
Prostrating .
One starts by kneeling .
One put one 's hands together with the fingers stretched upwardly .
In this position the hands are put before the breast and one thinks `purity ' .
Then the hands , still in the same position are put before the forehead and one thinks `compassion ' .
Finally one bows deeply , the elbows touching the knees and the lower arms and hands on the floor while keeping one 's legs in a straight line .
One puts the forehead in front of the hands on the floor , in this way raising one 's behind .
One thinks `wisdom ' .
This prostration exercise is done each time for twenty minutes .
It is important to consider the basic exercises not as a walking , sitting or bowing exercise , but as training in mindfulness .
During the retreat only these three exercises are done , one after the other non-stop .
The only interruptions consist of the meals , contact with the teacher , practical actions ( like washing oneself and dressing ) and sleeping .
It is important to keep the meditation in the form of mindfulness also during the meals and the practical actions .
One continuously pays attention to everything that is there , to the input of our senses .
At this moment things are becoming interesting .
It turns out to be impossible to perform the basic exercises correctly .
In ordinary life we are used to avoid discomfort as much as possible .
If our position is uncomfortable , then we move .
During meditation this is not done .
Therefore all kinds of problems arise as disturbances .
These prevent the student from paying attention to the meditation object ( like our footsteps ) .
There are five groups of `hindrances ' : lust , hatred , drowsiness , doubt and restlessness .
Each of these will be explained .
Lust .
By this we mean feelings ( or thoughts ) that we like and cause desire .
For example , the student may be thinking about the coming meal instead of paying attention to his footsteps or breathing .
Lust may arise in many different ways .
A characteristic attribute is that one is manipulated by it and cannot escape its grasp .
Hatred .
This refers to all unpleasant feelings that cause aversion .
This emotion manipulates us too .
During sitting the student may be in pain , often extremely so .
Some part of the body may itch .
Or the student may be irritated .
Because it is a rule not to move , the student is forced to confront suffering .
Drowsiness .
This is a well - known phenomenon .
After a period of being bored , the student may rather fall asleep , than pay attention .
Sometimes , during sitting , this actually happens .
The attentive student will notice that he gets drowsy not because he is tired , but because he has to do something that he does not like and that causes mental and physical resistance .
Doubt .
The continuous alternation of pain , boredom and desire for something else makes the student wonder what he is doing .
He is doubting whether he should not have spent his ten days on a nice holiday .
The reasons for coming to the monastery are questioned .
Restlessness .
Also this word is self - explanatory .
Although it is often a negative experience , it is not classified as hatred .
The reason is that restlessness may also be accompanied by lust .
As an example in daily life we know the awaiting a meeting with a new love .
In meditation restlessness is considered as a hindrance , because it prevents mindfulness .
At first the student will try to fight the hindrances .
Discipline and concentration are said to be important .
But even when trying very hard , it turns out impossible to overcome the disturbances .
Disappointed and perhaps desperate the student consults the teacher .
An important method to continue practice , in spite of the disturbances , consists of so called `switching ' .
This will turn the hindrances into something positive .
The method is as follows .
As soon as a hindrance arises in the consciousness of the student , he tries to push it away in a gentle but firm fashion .
If this succeeds , he then returns immediately to the original object of meditation , like the breathing .
In case it is not possible to avoid the influence of the disturbance , the student changes his object of meditation .
He switches to the hindrance itself and names it as `irritation ' , `lust ' or the name of one of the other hindrances .
As soon as the hindrance stops being disturbing , the student switches back immediately to the original object of meditation .
In this way it is almost always possible to exercise in mindfulness .
An exception is the hindrance of drowsiness .
If this occurs , the student may start the walking or even better the prostration exercise .
In this way he does not fall asleep and moreover , obtains new energy .
Using the method of switching the student will understand better what genuine mindfulness is .
This is not always obvious .
It may happen that the student thinks he is mindful , but in fact is not fully so : there is one thing in which the student is more involved , namely concentration .
By switching diligently between concentration and the object of meditation , the student will notice the difference between mindfulness and concentration .
Even if the method of switching helps the student with his meditation , it will not always be pleasant .
On the contrary , it is almost certain that after skillful switching the hindrances will grow stronger and start alternating rapidly .
The resulting hardship will be extreme .
Strong pain or anxiety ; restlessness .
At this point the student starts complaining to the teacher .
He wants to discontinue the retreat .
For him meditation has become like dying .
However , the teacher advises the student to continue .
`` In this life we often `die ' .
Each time when a new desire starts we are `born ' .
If the desire is strong , then we `burn ' .
Finally if it turns out to be impossible to obtain what we want , then we `die ' .
It is not that terrible .
In our meditation we are working towards cutting through this circle of birth and death , this so called `samsara ' .
Finally we will not be born anymore and then we are free . "
The student who has managed to endure the retreat so far will usually have enough discipline to continue .
He names his suffering : `` This is suffering ; this is suffering . "
But as the feeling is very strong , it does not melt away .
The student is hoping that this will happen soon .
Exactly this hope , this desire causes the discomfort to be even more strong .
The situation is constantly deteriorating .
Finally the student gives up all hope for improvement .
Even then there is extreme suffering .
At that point something unexpected happens .
Suffering remains , but suddenly it is not bothersome anymore .
The student clearly sees the following .
`` This is my body , this is my mind ; both are burning , but it does not matter . "
From that point on the method of mindfulness also works for strong forms of suffering .
This probably has been made possible as the student has developed a strong form of concentration .
This all may sound unbelievable .
Perhaps the following may relieve some doubts .
Suppose one pronounces repeatedly a particular word , for example the word `rubber ' , then it may seem that the word looses its meaning .
Or rather the sound `rubber ' and the concept `rubber ' are being separated .
Usually these two components are melded together in our consciousness .
This phenomenon is well - known and is called a `jamais vu ' or a `semantic fatigue ' .
Something similar may also happen with our suffering .
Pain is being decomposed into two components : `pain as pure feeling ' and `pain as something to run away from ' .
After this decomposition , using mindfulness , it is relatively easy to melt away the second part .
This method of splitting consciousness into various parts is characteristic for meditation as taught in theravada buddhism , the so called vipassana meditation .
As a result one is able to understand better the functioning of consciousness .
The word `vipassana ' means `insight ' .
The consciousness of the student is now getting more and more `pure ' .
The hindrances are less and less frequent .
And if they do happen to come , it is easy to use mindfulness in order to melt them away .
The student is able to see the growing of every hindrance ; and then he uses mindfulness ``as a gun to shoot it away " .
This is how it feels at least .
If the student is a `good boy ' and applies mindfulness also to feelings of lust , then a strong and stable consciousness will result .
All phenomena are the same as before and all mental faculties are the same .
But there are almost no disturbances anymore .
Pain is strong , but far away .
The hindrance of doubt seems to be conquered completely .
`` It is true indeed that it is possible to improve one 's consciousness by means of meditation " the student is thinking .
[ As the student would find out later , a remarkable aspect of the new consciousness is that some of one 's ordinary skills are impaired .
Writing is rather difficult , as if one is doing it with the wrong hand .
Reading is extremely tiresome .
Estimating distances does not work well either .
Objects seem nearer than they really are .
Sometimes one is not well - balanced while walking .
After some trial and error one quickly is able to re- establish correct estimation of distances .
The left - right aspects of the walking exercises play an important role in repairing the disturbances in one 's equilibrium . ]
The altered state of consciousness satisfies descriptions occurring in mysticism .
The student is taken by rapture and feels omnipotent .
By melting away these kind of narcissistic feelings the consciousness of the student is getting to be even more stable .
It satisfies the statement of the Hindi " Atman is Brahman " ( the self is god ) .
The student thinks he is enlightened .
However , as will turn out soon , there is still a long way to go .
The student is now continuing to meditate having a consciousness that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant , but is nevertheless very exalted .
There is almost nothing to do .
The hindrances are gone and being mindful on for example breathing is effortless .
At one moment the student notices that it becomes difficult to keep his super consciousness .
More and more pressure is growing on his mind ( or is it the head ? ) .
Even if it does not bother him , it is a threatening omen .
At any price the student wants to keep his exalted consciousness .
But most unfortunately he cannot keep his strong concentration any longer and he falls back on what used to be his old consciousness .
It turns out that this consciousness is totally neglected .
It looks like a giant abyss .
Desperately the student tries to regain his exalted consciousness .
It does not work .
Then suddenly the student looses all grip and falls in the abyss .
The experience is indescribable .
The following symptoms are some indications of what happens .
Chaos : perception is completely confused ; everything is turning .
Anxiety : there is an `infinitely ' strong anxiety ; all other anxieties seem to be derived from this basic one .
Disgust : one is extremely sick ; the stomach turns and one has to vomit .
Craziness : it feels as if one is crazy ; the mind and the body are present , but there is no ego anymore that controls everything .
Panic stricken the student goes to the teacher , who is available 24 hours a day during the intensive meditation retreat , precisely for these cases of depersonalization .
The student hopes that the teacher can perform some miracle .
But that is not what happens .
The teacher reacts in an unexpected way .
He says the following .
``Remember the theory .
Our existence has three characteristics : changeability , suffering and selflessness .
Changeability means that no phenomenon is permanent .
Even the visual image that we have of a solid object is not constant .
If we look well , we will see many small fluctuations in the image as perceived .
In this changing world we look for some hold , something that is constant .
In our ignorance we consider our ego , our self , as a fixed remaining entity .
But that is an illusion .
Why would our ego feel the need to be consolidated , if it were really permanent ?
Well , the changeability causes the circumstances in which we live to be often in conflict with the ideas of the ego and friction results .
That is suffering .
Finally , selflessness means that the phenomena out of which our consciousness is built up , are essentially beyond our control .
These three attributes of our existence , changeability , suffering and selflessness are in fact three aspects of one single truth .
Now you have experienced yourself these three characteristics .
This is important .
Just continue your practice . "
But the student is not at all interested in meditation anymore .
He just wants to stop his depersonalization .
The teacher notices this and gives specific instructions .
`` Instead of prostrating for twenty minutes , you should do it from now on each time twenty minutes longer .
That is , first twenty minutes , then forty , then sixty and so on .
Work well on your mindfulness .
Then the nausea will disappear by itself .
However , if it comes back , do not name it as `nausea ' but as `knowing ' .
Do not feed it it . "
Back in his room the student has lost all motivation and does not want to continue the practice .
However , stopping for a rest deteriorates the situation : the abyss becomes more threatening and nauseating .
In utter despair he follows the instructions of the teacher .
After a couple of hours it turns out that the exercises have a calming effect .
Especially the prostrations function well against the sickness .
Then the student wants to relax .
But each time he slackens his mindfulness , he is pushed back into the abyss .
It is like having a knife on one 's throat forcing one to meditate fully .
It is a matter of life or death .
Being tired , the prostration exercises give new energy .
After having worked for many hours like this , being exhausted , the student is not sure whether he can go to bed .
It may induce the nausea again .
The student goes to the teacher and asks whether it is possible to go to sleep .
`` All right , sleep with mindfulness " , is the answer .
The student sleeps remarkably well .
However , the next morning the emergency is still there .
Only after some days of extremely hard work , the student re-establishes a stable consciousness without nausea .
His ego feeling returns , albeit in another more light form .
The student keeps some suspicion towards the method .
Returning from the laboratory the student enters ` the world ' .
It turns out that he can function normally .
Eventually this brings back some confidence to the student .
However , sometimes there is nostalgia for the feeling of ego that he has left behind .
But the new form of ego also has its advantages .
An irritating situation can be relativized more easily .
And indeed it turns out that all anxieties are corollaries to the fundamental one .
By knowing this one , all other anxieties have become less serious .
It may take a while before the student is motivated again to join an intensive meditation retreat .
One of the possible motives is the memory of the super consciousness described in 2.6 .
Another reason may be , that on the one hand the student has gained confidence in the theory as parts of it turned out to be true , and on the other hand the theory promises much more .
A description will be given now of the work done after one has chosen to continue the practice .
The student notices that he has to start from scratch .
The technique learned at the previous retreat has been lost .
Fortunately progress is much faster now .
Again there are hindrances .
Again they can be used to increase mindfulness .
Again there is strong pain or strong suffering .
Again there arises strong concentration , making the extreme pain easy to take .
Again a stable consciousness results .
However , the teacher is not satisfied .
`` If there is strong pain , but you do not mind , then you first form the pain , while you throw it out later .
That is a waste of the energy that it all takes .
You should prevent the formation of the pain and in general of your feelings .
Then you do not need to throw away anything .
Cut through the addiction to your feeling .
Stay with the input , with the contact of your senses . "
The student is not able to do that .
He again develops a super consciousness .
Again he notices that he cannot keep it up .
When he falls this time , the nausea is less strong , as it is a known phenomenon by now .
After only an hour the consciousness of the student is stable again .
In order to proceed from here , the following facts from the theory should be known .
Our phenomenological awareness ( as always both physical and mental ) can be divided into five groups ( `skandha ' in Pali ; usually translated with `aggregate ' ) :
1. input ( of our senses ) ; 2 . feeling ; 3 . perception ; 4 . output ( conditioning , will ) ; 5 . consciousness ( state of consciousness ) .
1. Input .
Everything that we are aware of enters through one of the six senses .
These are characterized by the following verbs : to see , to hear , to taste , to smell , to feel ( to perceive by touch ) and to think .
The first four senses , namely the eyes , the ear , the tongue and the nose do not need further description .
The fifth sense , bodily feeling , has many manifestations .
For example itch , pain and cold .
There is no special location for this sense .
The sixth sense is the mind .
This is usually not considered as a separate sense , but rather as the place where all senses come together and are being processed .
There are , however , some good arguments for classifying the mind as a sense .
If we look up something in our memory , we obtain information that was not there before .
If we have some thoughts after seeing some object , then , although that thinking is a consequence of the seeing , it is a separate input for our awareness .
In the buddhist theory there is also processing of the input , but this is placed in the groups ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) .
2 . Perception .
This group will be discussed first , because group ( 2 ) is somewhat more complicated .
After the senses have delivered the input to us , perception makes recognizable units from the data .
It makes a classification ; as they say ``it distinguishes this from that " .
3 . Feeling .
This group should not be confused with sense number five , the feeling of touch , itch , cold , etcetera .
In group two we give a value judgment to our sense input .
We say `` This is pleasant , this is unpleasant and this is neutral . "
Our feeling indicates whether we like to have a phenomenon in our consciousness or whether we do n't ; or that we are indifferent to it .
Indeed , according to the theory feeling comes in three forms : positive , negative and neutral .
Because buddhism sees feeling as the direct cause of our behavior , group ( 2 ) is considered as very important .
Positive feeling is equated with lust ; negative feeling with hatred ; and finally neutral feeling with ignorance .
Lust , hatred and ignorance are seen as the three fundamental sins .
Of these three ignorance is the most persistent one , since it is hidden and can change suddenly into lust or hatred .
The reader may wonder why positive and negative feeling ( `desire and sadness ' ) are repudiated .
One may reason as follows : `` All right , one is better off not having negative feelings , but do n't the positive ones form the meaning of life ? "
To this one may reply that it is certainly the case that for example sex and good food are pleasant .
But the desire for it has a hold on us , it manipulates us .
The goal of buddhism is to be free from this desire .
The mentioned delights will remain pleasant , even after one is enlightened .
But then they are pleasant on the level of group ( 1 ) , the sensory data .
Although the following simile is not perfect , one may compare the enlightened enjoying - without - desire to listening to beautiful music .
We enjoy the music of Mozart , but we do not cry when the symphony is over .
Having `positive feeling ' , in the technical sense of buddhism , means desire that is constantly directed to the object of desire , even if it is absent .
A comparison with Calvinism is appropriate here .
In this persuasion just as in buddhism lust is considered a sin .
However , in Calvinism it is something that is given a negative value : it is something that is not allowed and one should be ashamed of it .
In buddhism lust is considered as something that is present in us .
It is considered a sin because it is the cause of suffering and bondage .
But that is all .
4 . Output ( conditioning , volition ) .
According to buddhism our behavior is conditioned .
This applies to everything we do , both with our body and with our mind .
Cybernetically this conditioning can be viewed as the output of our body - mind complex : our nerves are firing to control our movements and our thoughts .
Phenomenologically conditioning is correlated to volition : we usually have the impression that we want to do whatever we are doing .
However , this volition can be seen as a side effect .
Therefore it is adequate to describe group ( 4 ) simply as output .
5 . ( State of ) consciousness .
In the first place consciousness is the integrating factor that unifies our input and its processing .
So there is a difference between input , perception and consciousness .
Input as such is still disconnected .
( Sometimes when it is dark we may see that our visual input consists of small fluctuating parts . )
Then , perception classifies the input , but only locally so .
Finally consciousness gives a global image .
In the second place group ( 5 ) refers to our mood , to our mental state .
It will turn out that the way our consciousness unifies our awareness is strongly dependent on our feeling .
There is a strong interaction between the five groups .
Feeling results from input , but in a manner that depends on perception and consciousness .
If someone says something rude to us , then the resulting feeling depends on who has spoken to us , that is , depends on perception .
Moreover the result of the unfriendly words depends on our mood of the moment .
That is , our state of consciousness ( group ( 5 ) ) also influences our feeling .
Conversely , feeling plays a central role in perception , conditioning and consciousness .
In the next sections we will give evidence for this .
Because of its central role , feeling is therefore placed as second group , directly after input .
The views of Spinoza and Freud concerning the bondage of our behavior are related to this theory .
According to Spinoza our feeling determines our actions .
According to Freud the determining factor is our unconscious .
Buddhism reconciles these two views .
Also according to this theory feeling determines our actions ; however , large parts of that feeling are unknown .
That is another reason why our ignorance is considered to be a sin : it determines our actions without our realizing it .
And in addition we usually make rationalizations about our motives for those actions .
The student analyses his experiences in the light of the theory of the five groups .
Using strong concentration , he is able to endure strong pain , without being bothered by it .
Probably that is because the connection between feeling and conditioning is interrupted .
A drawback is , that it takes a considerable amount of energy .
If one could disconnect the link between input and feeling , then perhaps suffering could be overcome much more easily .
For this it is necessary to know exactly how feeling is formed .
Work is resumed .
As usual the pain slowly develops during sitting .
As soon as the pain becomes unbearable the student automatically switches to super consciousness : ``Ouch , now I can take it . "
But the teacher is dissatisfied : `` You should not hide your pain , but stop forming it ! "
The student is increasing his mindfulness .
As soon as a little pain arises , he sees it .
But he also notices , that directly after the pain is melted away using mindfulness , a whiff of pleasure arises because the pain is gone .
Previously he had failed to notice this .
It now becomes an exercise in swiftness of the factor mindfulness .
It runs as follows .
Pain ; melting ; pleasure ; melting ; pain ; melting ; pleasure ; melting ; etcetera .
At first the student is not well synchronized with this flux of phenomena .
Then it goes better .
Suddenly the student gains momentum .
Part of consciousness is disappearing .
Almost the student becomes nauseated again .
But using mindfulness the formation of the sickness is prevented .
And then , quite unexpectedly , he can do it : siting quietly for a long period without having pain .
It simply is not being formed .
Now things are going quite well and effortless .
Consciousness is becoming calm and stable .
Because little effort is required much more calm as before .
The consciousness described in 2.6 is now seen quite differently .
As compared to the present consciousness that previous super consciousness is thick and treacly , due to the presence of neutral feeling .
At the time it seemed to be the utmost experience .
The student enjoys his present sublime consciousness .
It is stable .
Having had previous experience with an altered state of consciousness the student wonders whether he can loose it again .
At first sight there seems nothing to loose .
Suddenly something happens .
There is new pain .
The student is unable to prevent its formation .
How come ?
The pain - pleasure method does not work .
Moreover it is not clear whether or not the student is bothered by the pain .
But it is quite strong .
The teacher is consulted .
He says : `` The pain ( and more generally the feeling ) is supported by your perception and consciousness . "
The student does not understand this remark .
The teacher continues : `` While working with the pain , you may try to notice small fluxes in your consciousness . "
The student asks : `` Should I name this and make it melt away using mindfulness ? "
The teacher : ``Yes , but only do this when you have confidence in your practice .
You will interrupt the continuity of your consciousness , of your existence .
Everything will start turning like being in a roller coaster .
Then continue your practice , even if you feel sick .
After a while - no one can say how long it will take - the turning will stop .
Do not try to step out of the roller coaster , otherwise you will fall down . "
The student , who by now has got used to strange phenomena , is quite intrigued by these words .
He continues the practice .
Walking .
Sitting .
Pain is not being formed .
After long sitting pain is being formed .
At one moment it becomes almost impossible to melt away the pain .
Then comes a strong outburst of pain .
An even stronger blast of mindfulness is able to melt away the pain .
By properly paying attention the student notices that his perception - right after the melting away of the pain - disappears locally for a short moment .
The vision of an object laying in front of the student melts away for less than a second .
It leaves a hole in his perception .
The student tries again .
Pain ; melting ; hole in perception .
Pain , hole , pain , hole , ... ; faster and faster .
Then suddenly pain is not formed anymore .
But consciousness collapses also .
There is only awareness , with every now and then a puff of perception or consciousness .
Intellect appears to be functioning normally .
The holes in consciousness are turning around quickly .
During the nausea described in 2.7 this must have happened also .
But then the student did not see any details because of lack of mindfulness .
Also perception of the body is disturbed .
During walking the room seems to be a jolting carriage .
The student does not become sick , because mindfulness watches his stomach well .
The experience is not pleasant , but not terrible either .
However , when after two hours everything still keeps turning , the student starts to worry .
Then he develops restlessness and wants to have a stable consciousness .
There is nevertheless no nausea nor anxiety .
The student decides to consult the teacher .
His room is at a different wing of the monastery .
Walking there , while developing strong mindfulness , the consciousness of the student suddenly is glued together .
It just happened , without doing anything special .
It is a new consciousness ; yet everything in it is the same as before .
The student changes his mind and starts walking back to his room .
Then his mindfulness weakens and he falls back to his broken consciousness .
This makes him decide to go to the teacher after all .
After the student has told what had happened , the teacher says : `` Your practice is going well .
Especially the way your consciousness has been glued together .
Feeling will be substituted by mindfulness .
In case your consciousness breaks again , name it as `knowing ' .
Do not identify with either the new consciousness , nor the broken old consciousness . "
After the return to his room , it takes a couple of hours for the student 's consciousness to stabilize .
Then he starts analyzing what has happened .
The functioning of consciousness is apparently analogous to that of a television screen , consisting of rapidly fluctuating images .
Normally we have the impression of continuity .
Probably the reason is that feeling works as a kind of glue for these separate fluctuating images .
By the meditation technique feeling is ( temporarily ) switched off .
Therefore there is no more glue and consciousness will show itself in its broken form .
The student does not understand well how everything works , but the phenomena are interesting .
Back to work .
The exercises are going well .
There are few disturbances and sublime consciousness results .
Pain is not being formed .
However , later pain arises again .
When this pain is being melted away , consciousness starts breaking again .
The student thinks ``O , that is all right ; I know how to depersonalize ! "
But he is wrong , it is going to be tough .
The depersonalization is different this time and as this was unexpected , the student is getting restless again .
Working hard makes consciousness stable .
It becomes sublime again , even more so than before .
After continuing the work , the student falls again in a depersonalization .
He becomes angry : `` There is no end to this ! "
This emotion of angriness has an unexpected effect .
The broken consciousness is glued together instantaneously .
But how ugly it is .
Everything exhales malignity : the walls are angry , each footstep is angry , everything is angry .
Work is continued .
Consciousness breaks and the angriness in the walls suddenly disappears .
The student tries whether consciousness can be glued together also with other feelings .
First he tries lust .
It works ; when consciousness is glued together with lust everything becomes luscious .
The student has no objection and keeps this type of consciousness .
In the dining room he notices , however , that he is taking too much food .
A habit he had overcome already at the beginning of the retreat .
When the desert comes he promises to himself not to take too much .
Nevertheless , he is taking more than he can eat comfortably .
Apparently his hands took more than his mind wanted .
Back in his room the student decides that a consciousness glued together with lust is undesirable and he gives it up .
During the resulting depersonalization the student happens to feel insecure .
This time , by accident , the broken consciousness is glued together with anxiety .
Everything exhales this emotion .
The student is walking around in the surrealistic world of a phobic .
After having made a more quiet consciousness , the student goes to the teacher for his daily interview .
The teacher is dissatisfied about these experiments .
`` You have to continue the basic exercises .
Feeling has to be substituted by mindfulness .
Do not glue with feeling , but with mindfulness .
The difference is that you are dependent on your feeling .
Mindfulness on the other hand sets you free .
Be not attached to particular forms of consciousness .
Let them come and go by themselves .
The final goal is freedom .
When you will have it , sublime consciousness may arise as often as you want .
However , if you make some type of consciousness now , then you want to do that .
As a result there is hidden feeling in it and you will not be free .
This means that for example your sublime consciousness will depend on something .
Therefore it will be impossible to keep it .
When finally you will be free , then you do not depend on anything , you have become `unconditioned ' . "
The period of intensive training is over , however .
With good feeling the student returns home .
So the work is not finished yet .
The way to the elimination of suffering is the way to eliminate attachment to self .
This means the elimination of our addiction to feeling .
Personal experience of a small part of the way is described here .
Striking occurrences were the following .
Strong pain , without minding it ;
super concentration and super consciousness ;
depersonalization ( very strong withdrawal symptoms ) ;
sublime consciousness ;
stabilization either by means of feeling or by means of mindfulness .
The path is not always pleasant , but it is quite varied and remarkable .

WASHINGTON -- Alex
Ovechkin's first playoff hat trick was cause for celebration , worthy of so many red caps that Sidney Crosby wanted fans to be told to stop throwing them .
Minutes later , Crosby notched his first postseason hat trick , a consolation prize in a loss .
Less than a half - dozen pieces of headgear made it to the ice .
It was a historic night for the NHL .
Its two biggest stars -- rivals who do n't care for each other -- had their biggest playoff performances head - to - head .
Ovechkin claimed the winning hand , breaking a tie with a pair of goals less than 3 minutes apart in the third period Monday night in the Washington Capitals ' 4 - 3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins .
" Sick game .
Sick three goals by me and Crosby , " said Ovechkin , who celebrated by bouncing his body high off the glass after both of his third - period goals .
" It 's unbelievable to see how fans react , how fans go crazy .
The atmosphere right now , it 's unbelievable in town .
You see all the red , and -- probably I 'm afraid to go home right now . "
The Eastern Conference semifinal series moves to Pittsburgh for Wednesday 's Game 3 with the Capitals leading 2 - 0 .
From 1991 - 2001 , Washington lost five series in which it blew a lead against Pittsburgh , including 2 - 0 advantages in 1992 and 1996 .
But that 's ancient history for Alex the Great and Sid the Kid , who quickly realized what a special game they had just played .
" It 's nice to score , " Crosby said .
" But it 's better to win .
... I 'm sure it 's entertaining for people to watch , if I were to look at it from a fan 's point of view .
As a player , you do n't like when the guy on the other team gets a hat trick .
That 's usually not a good sign . "
Ovechkin nailed a one - timer from the left circle that beat Marc - Andre Fleury on a power play with 7:07 left , then skated between the circles before unleashing a slap shot that sailed past Fleury 's glove with 4:38 remaining for his third goal of the game and seventh of the postseason .
After the first wave of hats came a second wave , prompting Crosby to speak to the referee about the long delay .
" People kept throwing hats , " Crosby said .
" And I was just asking if he could make an announcement to ask them to stop . "
Crosby gave the Penguins leads of 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 .
His third goal came on a power play in the final minute after Fleury was pulled for an extra attacker , giving Crosby an NHL - leading eight in the playoffs .
" When you build up hype of superstars playing against each other , and then the superstars play like superstars , it 's a neat thing , " Washington coach Bruce Boudreau said .
One star not living up to his hype is Evgeni Malkin , who led the league in points in the regular season .
He failed to score for the fifth straight game and committed the tripping penalty that gave Ovechkin the chance to score the go - ahead goal .
" I just go out and play my game , " Malkin said .
" Sure , need to play better because we 're down .
I need to score . "
David Steckel , who had eight goals in the regular season , got his second of the series and was the only goal - scorer not named Ovechkin or Crosby .
Rookie playoff phenom Simeon Varlamov made 33 saves for the Capitals , including a pair of impressive stops during a 5 - on - 3 power play in the first period .
" It 's a battle of the two best players in the league , and tonight both of them carried their teams , " Washington defenseman Mike Green said .
" We were fortunate we had Alex at the top of his game , and then had some guys like Stecks and these guys that are fourth - line guys pitch in , and that 's all it takes to win . "
There was no pretense of a loving relationship between the rival teams .
A physical first period included nine penalties and plenty of mini-tussles .
Crosby bowled over Green while advancing with the puck in the first minute .
The Capitals wasted a chance at a power play when Chris Clark decided to punch Kris Letang in the face after the whistle had stopped play for a Pittsburgh penalty .
Ovechkin got sandwiched along the boards and was shoved around whenever possible ; he and Chris Kunitz traded blows in period 's final minute .
An exchange between Washington 's Alexander Semin and Pittsburgh 's Brooks Orpik resulted in three penalties -- two of them on Semin .
The resulting power play produced the game 's first goal , when Crosby poked a rebound under Varlamov 's left pad .
The goal broke a four - game , 0 - for - 17 drought for the Penguins ' power play .
More rough stuff : Kunitz delivered what Boudreau considered a " vicious " cross-check to Varlamov in the game 's final minute .
" We hope the league takes a long look at that , " Boudreau said .
Beware of the , er ... kitten : Terrified postmen threaten to boycott house after attack by baby cat
Going postal : Elly the kitten is accused of attacking a postwoman
Swiping playfully at the camera , it 's hard to imagine she could be a danger to anything - except , perhaps , her favourite toy mouse .
But to postmen , Illy the kitten might as well be a snarling rottweiler .
They say that the six - month - old moggie once jumped up at the letterbox and delivered a painful scratch to a postwoman 's hand .
So fearful are they of a repeat performance that they have sent a strongly worded letter to Illy 's owners - warning them to discipline her or face a delivery ban .
Kenneth Ridge , 65 , and his son Bradley , 30 , yesterday spoke of their shock at receiving the note describing Illy's ' attack ' .
' Reading this letter you 'd think I had a rottweiler at home , it really was ridiculous ' , Mr Ridge Snr said .
' Illy is a kitten , she 's very small and friendly and was just playing .
' We were n't here , but it seems some mail was put through the letterbox and the postwoman 's hand was scratched .
' I would say Illy stands up for herself , but she 's never bitten me , and if she did , really could not do much damage .
' I can't believe I could have my post suspended for this .
If that happens I will be making a very strong complaint . '
Illy , who weighs in at a mere 7lb , spends most of her time playing with balls of wool , chasing her tail or exploring the neighbourhood .
Mr Ridge , who runs a greengrocer 's in Clapham , South - West London , first heard about her snappy side when he received the warning letter from an office manager at Royal Mail .
It read : ' I am writing to let you know that , on the 6th of June , our postman was attacked by your animal in your premises while delivering mail to your address .
' Animal attacks are a major cause of injury to Royal Mail staff and so I am writing to seek your co-operation in preventing a repeat of this unfortunate incident .
' I must advise you that , if any further incidents of this nature are allowed to take place , I shall have no alternative other than to consider suspending the delivery of mail to your home . '
Mr Ridge , who receives many important letters and packages related to his business , urged Royal Mail not to over - react .
How the Royal Mail warned about Illy 's ' threatening behaviour '
Who me ?
Illy looks as if butter would n't melt in her mouth as she sits in the arms of owner Ken Ridge .
She looks expectantly at the letter box , ready to swipe
' Everyone I tell finds it so amusing that our little kitten has been mistaken for some savage beast , ' he said .
' But , on a serious note , this is a very strong letter and if it was sent to an old lady with a cat I think it could be very upsetting .
I think it 's over the top , and I 'd like to know what treatment to the postwoman was required . '
A Royal Mail spokesman said it always treats animal attacks on postmen seriously , however minor they might appear .
' We record about 5,000 animal attacks on our postmen and women each year with the vast majority being dogs , ' he said .
' The member of staff suffered a very bad cut to her hand while delivering mail through the letterbox of the address . '
He said the injury was serious enough to ' require treatment ' .

We 've updated the super awesome buttons demo to include the button element and Mozilla box shadows .
Check it out !
Our original button we 'll use to show how RGBA colors rock your world .
See how the hex drop shadow works on white , but not dark ?
We 'll fix that .
. awesome { background : # 222 url(/images/alert-overlay.png ) repeat-x ; display : inline - block ; padding : 5 px 10 px 6 px ; color : # fff ; text - decoration : none ; font - weight : bold ; line - height : 1 ; - moz - border - radius : 5 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 5 px ; - moz-box - shadow : 0 1px 3px # 999 ; - webkit - box - shadow : 0 1px 3 px # 999 ; text - shadow : 0 - 1px 1px # 222 ; border - bottom : 1 px solid # 222 ; position : relative ; cursor : pointer ; }
Small Details .
Notice the shadow on the button on the dark background ?
We fixed the buttons ' shadow blending by using the RGBA colors .

And there we have it : scalable buttons with minimal CSS that work everywhere .
** We love CSS at ZURB .**
We love it so much that we 're using the new , yet - to - be released version ( CSS3 ) in some of our projects .
In the works for nearly 10 years now , CSS3 is finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel as new browsers like Firefox and Safari continue to push its implementation .
One of our favorite things about CSS3 is the addition of RGBA , a color mode that adds alpha - blending to your favorite CSS properties .
We 've kicked the tires on it a bit with our own projects and have found that it helps streamline our CSS and makes scaling things like buttons very easy .
To show you how , ** we 've cooked up an example with some super awesome , scalable buttons .**
####The Button Here 's what we 're looking at :
It 's a simple button made possible by a transparent PNG overlay ( for the gradient ) , border , border - radius , box - shadow , and text - shadow .
Here 's the CSS that we 've got so far to make this super awesome button :
Not too shabby considering it 's nearly all done with CSS .
We could use CSS3 to do the gradient as well , but currently only Safari supports that .
For a little backward compatibility , we 'll keep it as a transparent PNG .
Besides , the transparent PNG is easier to work with than setting the gradient in CSS since Safari only does CSS gradients at this point .
####Making it Scale with RGBA
Sweet , so we 've got our button styled up and looking great , but since we 're using " static " colors ( Hex value ) , this button does n't scale very well .
What if we need it to be shown on dark * and * white backgrounds ?
What about other colors ?
** Here 's where RGBA comes in .** With a little RGBA love , we 'll scale this single button to add five more colors , two more sizes , and make it work on any background color .
Check this out — all we have to do is modify three lines of CSS .
There , now we have our super awesome button with some alpha blending added in .
Still looks the same right ?
That 's because we have a 25 % black border , 50 % box - shadow , and 25 % text - shadow in place of regular hex values .
This gives us what we need to make our original button scale to various backgrounds , colors , and sizes .
With the RGBA values , ** we have layers of color instead of separate colors , ** much like what you get when doing transparent drop shadows in Photoshop .
####Adding the Colors and Sizes Now that we 've got our default button to where we need it , let 's add some colors and sizes .
Here 's the CSS to do it : ####Done Deal
And now we have six buttons , each with three different sizes .
You can see the final coded example here to take a closer look at the code .
Although this example may be overkill — who really needs this many button colors ? — the point is that RGBA is actually much more powerful than typical Hex values .
Consider this : if we were using hex values , we'd have three times the CSS per color — one color for background , one for border , and one for text - shadow .
With a little CSS3 magic , ** we 've created a scalable set of buttons with nearly half the CSS ** it would have taken with hex colors .
Give it a go in your next project and see how it can help add that extra polish you want without huge impact on your code .
In 2001 , three years before Barack Obama came to national prominence , Alysa Stanton embarked on her own audacious journey .
She spoke about breaking barriers , building bridges and providing , calling on people to focus on their similarities rather than differences .
Now that stage of her journey has reached its end , with Stanton attaining the distinction of being the first black woman in America to become a mainstream Jewish rabbi .
History was made last week at her ordination in the Plum Street temple in Cincinnati , one of the oldest synagogues in the US .
Parallels leap out between her journey and Obama's .
She is 45 , he 47 .
They both straddled racial and communal lines .
They both faced hurdles and brickbats along the way .
In her case , her decision to enter rabbinical school in 2001 broke multiple taboos .
On top of the age - old tensions between Christian — the religion of her birth — and Jew , were the bubbling hostilities between African Americans and largely white American Jews .
Even at the ordination ceremony the tensions were on display .
Her adopted daughter Shana was reduced to tears by a group of white Christian protesters outside the temple taunting her and making disparaging remarks .
Last week Stanton received a letter .
Inside was a tract that read " Last rite " above a picture of a coffin .
" There are some sick puppies out there , " Stanton said , speaking at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati where she took her rabbinical studies .
" But my God is bigger .
I will not be boxed in . "
She spent the first 11 years of her life in the midwestern state of Ohio , then moved to Colorado .
Her parents were Pentecostal Christians but from the age of nine she can remember looking for something else .
" I was a seeker , a different kind of kid .
I knew it , my family knew it . "
She experimented with many religions — Catholicism , eastern practices , Messianic Christianity where congregants speak in tongues .
Though she spent some of her childhood living in a white Jewish neighbourhood in Cleveland Heights , her discovery of the religion came later .
She was attracted to it she says because Judaism encompasses not just religion but also spiritualism , social justice and community .
She began converting to the faith in 1987 , driving 144 miles every week to a synagogue in Denver .
The late 80s and early 90s were a period of great tension between Jews and black people .
The two communities had a history of working together , particularly in the civil rights period when many young Jews campaigned alongside black protesters .
Some 20,000 marriages between Jews and African - Americans grew out of the movement .
But by the late 80s relations had soured .
Louis Farrakhan , leader of the Nation of Islam , was castigating Jews as " bloodsuckers " whom he accused of assisting the slave trade .
In 1991 the Crown Heights riots broke out in New York with fighting by black people against Jews .
Stanton found herself in the middle of much distrust on both sides .
On the black side , America has a long tradition of black Judaism , with its own synagogues serving almost exclusively black worshippers .
Indeed , Michelle Obama 's cousin Capers Funnye is a rabbi in one such temple in Chicago .
But Stanton was making a different statement , by entering mainstream — for which read white — Judaism in mainstream America .
" A lot of my African American friends think I have sold out .
At the time in my circle there were n't any blacks who were Jews so I think it was startling for some people and unnerving . "
On the Jewish side , the frostiness could be felt the minute she walked into her first synagogue in Colorado .
" As a Jew of colour , in the initial days there were comments and stares and isolation . "
Some of the most ugly rejection came , paradoxically , when she lived for a year in Israel .
She applied for an extension to her student visa and unusually it was rebuffed .
She had to threaten legal action before it was granted .
Her daughter was beaten up at school .
The child became so stressed by the racist taunting she developed shingles .
" They would call her ugly and tell her she 's not beautiful .
She would say I 'm black and I 'm beautiful and good .
It still brings tears to my eyes , as we are not talking about a dog , we are talking about a seven - year - old child . "
The Israeli episode hurt Stanton .
" Here I was in Israel having left everything I knew to devote my life to serve our people , and not only was I told I was n't a Jew , I was n't wanted . "
She came close then to giving it all up .
But just when she was at her lowest point there was a knock on her door and a neighbour with a little girl stood there saying " Shalom " and asking to be friends .
" So there was pain and there was joy , and during the depths whenever I 'm tired – I 'm not talking about physical tiredness – I 'll receive a card or a visit , something that will keep me going on this long journey . "
The next stage of the journey starts in August when she takes up her post as rabbi of the Bayt Shalom temple in Greenville , North Carolina .
She knows that her challenges are not over .
" It has n't changed .
There 's still negativity across racial lines from Anglos and Jews and African - Americans .
But I 'm still here to serve regardless . "
She believes she represents the new face of diversity in American Judaism , pointing to the little known statistic that up to 400,000 people , about one in five American Jews , are from racial and ethnic minorities .
Her new congregation will be largely white .
But she sees that as besides the point .
" When I said I would become a rabbi it was n't to be a rabbi for only polka dotted people or green or white or black .
I 'm a rabbi and proud to be that . "
Greenland shark meat may become new source of biofuel
Biofuel based on sharks and other sea products could supply 13 percent of energy consumption in the village of Uummannaq with its 2,450 inhabitants , according to estimates .
The project could help the many isolated villages on the vast island to become self - sufficient in terms of energy .

Sisimiut , Greenland ( AFP ) July 20 , 2009
The Greenland shark , one of the largest species of sharks , is a nuisance to fishermen and its meat is toxic to humans , but researchers now hope the flesh can be used to create a biofuel for Inuits .
Native to the cold Arctic waters , thousands of the sharks get caught and die in fishermen 's nets off Greenland every year .
The beasts -- which can be compared to the Great White Shark in size at seven metres ( 23 feet ) and can weigh up to a tonne -- are thrown back into the sea .
But at the Arctic Technology Centre ( ARTEK ) in Sisimiut in western Greenland , researchers are experimenting with ways of using the animal 's oily flesh to produce biogas out of fishing industry waste .
" I think this is an alternative where we can use the thousands of tonnes of leftovers of products from the sea , including those of the numerous sharks , " says Marianne Willemoes Joergensen of ARTEK 's branch at the Technical University of Denmark .
Joergensen , in charge of the pilot project based in the Uummannaq village in northwestern Greenland , says the shark meat , when mixed with macro-algae and household wastewater , could " serve as biomass for biofuel production . "
" Biofuel is the best solution for this kind of organic waste , which can be used to produce electricity and heating with a carbon neutral method , " she said .
Biofuel based on sharks and other sea products could supply 13 percent of energy consumption in the village of Uummannaq with its 2,450 inhabitants , according to estimates .
The project could help the many isolated villages on the vast island to become self - sufficient in terms of energy .
Joergensen plans to run tests next year at an organic waste treatment plant in a project financed by the EU in Uummannaq , using shark meat mixed with wastewater and macro-algae to create a fish mince that can be used to produce biogas .
In Uummannaq , the Greenland shark represents more than half of the waste disposed of by the local fishermen .
" Entire trawlers are sometimes full of sharks and they are caught everywhere , especially off the east and west of Greenland , to the fishermen 's great dismay , " says Bo Lings who used to work on a big trawler .
-- ' There are too many sharks in the nets ' --
---------------------------------------------
" It 's a large predator that devours fish , squid , seals and other marine life , and it also ruins the lines and nets of the halibut fishermen , " adds Leif Fontaine , the head of Greenland 's fishing and hunting association .
Fishing is Greenland 's biggest export industry , with halibut its second - biggest product after shrimp .
The shark , which Inuits once hunted for its razor - like teeth that they used to make knives and for its liver oil that was used to light homes , has " become a problem for the environment . "
" There are too many sharks in the nets and they just get thrown back , " explains one of ARTEK 's founders , engineer Joern Hansen .
Greenlanders usually dispose of fishing industry waste and household wastewater by throwing them into the sea .
In the Uummannaq municipality , over half of all the waste contains large amounts of fat that are suitable for producing biofuels in the future , and Hansen says that waste should be put to good use .
" All you have to do is set up installations in the fish processing centres , like in Ilulissat where the shrimp and halibut plant is partly heated by fish waste , " he said .
Aksel Blytmann , a consultant at Greenland 's fishing and hunting association , says the shark could turn out to be an " unexpected energy source . "
He explained that Uummannaq once paid a 200 - Danish - kroner ( 26 - euro , 38 - dollar ) reward to fishermen for a shark heart in order to keep their numbers down .
Other municipalities in the northwestern and western parts of Greenland still continue this practice , he said .
The species " swarms in the Arctic waters and is not in danger of extinction , " Blytmann claimed .
But the International Union for the Conservation of Nature disagrees , as does the Danish branch of the Worldwide Fund for Nature .
Anne -Marie Bjerg , a WWF specialist on ocean mammals , says the shark - for - biofuel project " is not a good idea , not at all , " and wants to see other sustainable energy projects undertaken instead .
" We know very little about the Greenland shark , which lives in a limited geographic zone , the Arctic , " she said .
Contrary to the fishermen 's own accounts , she insisted the mammal " does not pose big problems to Greenland 's fishing industry . "
" We are opposed to the commercial use of marine mammals , such as the Greenland shark , which is not universal and whose population size is unknown , " she said .
“ I do not have any recollection that day of there being a discussion of something that would have been as neon as waterboarding or other torture techniques , ” Mr. Graham said .
He said his confidence in the C.I.A. ’s account of the briefings had also been shaken by what he said was an incorrect assertion by the agency that he had been briefed on four dates .
Mr. Graham , who famously keeps a detailed record of his daily activities , checked and determined that the agency was wrong about three dates and that he had attended only one session before leaving the Intelligence Committee .
“ This is just a small chapter of a long , long book of C.I.A. inaccuracies , particularly in the early part of this decade , ” he said .
But Mr. Graham was not present for the briefing with Ms. Pelosi .
The only other lawmaker present , Porter J. Goss , then a Republican congressman from Florida who was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and later became the C.I.A. director , has contradicted her account .
He said he and Ms. Pelosi were told that the agency intended to use the harsh methods .
Republicans on Friday continued to dispute Ms. Pelosi ’s assertion that at her sole 2002 briefing as a member of the House Intelligence Committee , she was told that the Bush administration had determined waterboarding was legal but that it was not being used .
Senator Christopher S. Bond , Republican of Missouri , a member of the Intelligence Committee , said on the “ Today ” show on NBC : “ I have looked at the underlying materials , not only the records they kept but the cables they sent out to the field .
From what was apparently contemporaneous documents , it ’s clear that they did tell her . ”
The furor surrounding Ms. Pelosi ’s claim that she was misled has obscured one undisputed fact about the briefings .
The Sept. 4 , 2002 , session , the first given to anyone in Congress on the so - called enhanced interrogation methods , came weeks after the C.I.A. had started to use the methods .
Even if Ms. Pelosi had taken action , it is doubtful it would have averted the firestorm about torture that was to come .
Aurora – For 31 years , a hideaway in the rafters of Smoky Hill High School has served as a refuge for select drama students – a secret getaway whose whereabouts were passed down every year from class to class .
Unbeknownst to teachers and administrators , students had hauled up chairs , a radio and candles to furnish the lair above the lights .
The room was actually a space created by the vents and walls of the ventilation system , accessible only by perilous traverses across catwalks .
Knowledge about the room had become a sacred Smoky Hill rite until the school newspaper last month revealed the secret .
The April 14 article in the Smoky Hill Express prompted administrators to shut down access .
In its wake , newspaper students learned the power of the printed word .
Drama students learned that their unsupervised exploits above the rafters could have been deadly .
“ It ’s probably a pretty good idea to keep the kids safe , ” said Brian Pelepchan , 45 , one of two teens who created the room during the school ’s first year in 1975 .
Pelepchan and his best friend , Gary Walker , were sophomores , avid rock climbers and drama - department “ techies ” who were allowed on the catwalks above the stage .
“ We went up into the catwalks and saw this little opening , climbed up the structure and , lo and behold , we found this little cavelike place that we could hang out in , ” said Pelepchan , now an engineer with three children who attend Smoky Hill .
Pelepchan and Walker started the log book , which later filled with the names of everyone who had visited the room .
Rumors about activities in the room ranged from sex to drugs to rock ‘ n ’ roll .
Students changed the room ’s location in the rafters at various times over the years .
The log was found this year by newspaper students who stumbled upon the space while researching a story about things students do that they should n’t .
Freshman photographer Evan Hicks was on the catwalks , trying to find lovers smooching , when a drama student asked if he was looking for the secret room .
“ You do n’t tell a newspaper student that , ” said teacher Carrie Faust , the newspaper adviser .
“ It ’s kind of a challenge , do n’t you think ? ”
Her students worked to nail the story , asking drama students about the room ’s location and combing the catwalks to find it .
Senior Allie Lemieux along with Hicks wrote a story complete with photos of the room .
Lemieux said she immediately felt the weight of the room ’s tradition when she crawled into it .
“ All over the walls , people had signed their names , ” she said .
“ You could totally tell teens had been coming up there .
There was ash all over the ceiling .
They had used smoke from the candle to write on the ceiling . ”
The newspaper staff was conflicted about running the story .
If the room was outed , it would be shut down .
But Faust told them she would have to tell administrators anyway .
“ We decided that we report about the school ’s history , and this is news about the school , ” said Lemieux .
A few days before publication , Lemieux and Faust told activities director Kathy Daly about the room .
Within four hours , access was sealed .
After publication , drama students wore black T - shirts with the saying “ I know where the secret room is , but I ’m not telling ! ”
“ All the drama kids are really upset about it , ” junior Bill Setterlind said .
“ It was sort of a neat thing … It was one of the little things that made the school special . ”
Daly and Faust met with the drama department .
Students who had used the room were given amnesty .
The department was given the log book .
“ If the article had come out and was , ‘ What a bad thing , ’ … we would n’t have run it , ” Lemieux said . ” … I told the drama students , ‘ It was n’t about ratting you out .
It was about showing the cool tradition . ” ‘
