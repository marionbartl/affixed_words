Fields
Public methods
describeContents Added in API level 7 public int describeContents () Parcelable # describeContents
Returns int a bitmask indicating the set of special object types marshaled by this Parcelable object instance .
Value is either 0 or CONTENTS_FILE_DESCRIPTOR
equals Added in API level 7 public boolean equals ( Object o) Indicates whether some other object is " equal to " this one .
The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references :
It is reflexive : for any non-null reference value x , x.equals ( x ) should return true .
: for any non-null reference value , should return .
It is symmetric : for any non-null reference values x and y , x.equals (y ) should return true if and only if y.equals ( x ) returns true .
: for any non-null reference values and , should return if and only if returns .
It is transitive : for any non-null reference values x , y , and z , if x.equals (y ) returns true and y.equals ( z ) returns true , then x.equals ( z ) should return true .
: for any non-null reference values , , and , if returns and returns , then should return .
It is consistent : for any non-null reference values x and y , multiple invocations of x.equals (y ) consistently return true or consistently return false , provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified .
: for any non-null reference values and , multiple invocations of consistently return or consistently return , provided no information used in comparisons on the objects is modified .
For any non-null reference value x , x.equals ( null ) should return false .
The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects ; that is , for any non -null reference values x and y , this method returns true if and only if x and y refer to the same object ( x == y has the value true ) .
Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden , so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method , which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes .
Parameters o Object : the reference object with which to compare .
Returns boolean true if the signal strengths are the same

getCellSignalStrengths ( )
getLevel Added in API level 23 public int getLevel () Retrieve an abstract level value for the overall signal strength .
Returns int a single integer from 0 to 4 representing the general signal quality .
This may take into account many different radio technology inputs .
0 represents very poor signal strength while 4 represents a very strong signal strength .
Added in API level 30 public long getTimestampMillis ()
Value is a non-negative timestamp in the SystemClock# elapsedRealtime ( ) time base .
Returns long timestamp in milliseconds since boot for SignalStrength .
This timestamp reports the approximate time that the signal was measured and reported by the modem .
It can be used to compare the recency of SignalStrength instances .
Value is a non-negative timestamp in the SystemClock# elapsedRealtime ( ) time base .
hashCode Added in API level 7 public int hashCode () Returns a hash code value for the object .
This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap .
The general contract of hashCode is :
Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application , the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer , provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified .
This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application .
method must consistently return the same integer , provided no information used in comparisons on the object is modified .
This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application .
If two objects are equal according to the equals ( Object ) method , then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result .
method , then calling the method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result .
It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals ( java.lang .
Object ) method , then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results .
However , the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables .
As much as is reasonably practical , the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects .
( This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer , but this implementation technique is not required by the Java™ programming language . )
Returns int hash code
isGsm
Deprecated in Added in API level 7 Deprecated in API level 29 public boolean isGsm () This method was deprecated in API level 29 .
This method returns true if there are any 3gpp type SignalStrength elements in this SignalStrength report or if the report contains no valid SignalStrength information .
Instead callers should use getCellSignalStrengths ( ) to determine which types of information are contained in the SignalStrength report .
Returns boolean true if this is for GSM
toString Added in API level 7 public String toString () Returns a string representation of the object .
In general , the toString method returns a string that " textually represents " this object .
The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read .
It is recommended that all subclasses override this method .
The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance , the at - sign character ` @ ' , and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object .
In other words , this method returns a string equal to the value of : getClass ( ) .getName ( ) + ' @ ' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode ( ) )
Returns String string representation .

Payments could begin within a few weeks from a $ 20 - billion fund BP set aside to pay for the economic effects of its spill in the Gulf of Mexico , the fund 's top administrator told hundreds of Houma , La. , residents at a town hall meeting Thursday afternoon .
Kenneth Feinberg , who headed the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund , held a series of town hall - style meetings to answer questions from affected residents .
He also met with local government officials Thursday morning .
" This is not about politics , " he said in a crowded auditorium in Houma , about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans .
" This is about helping people in the gulf . "
He emphasized that claims facilities are independent of the government and of BP , and will be operating in affected areas for three years , to serve those whose economic well - being has been directly affected by the oil spill .
Feinberg addressed a fairly calm crowd in Houma , and said he will be coming back to the Gulf States " as often as necessary " to help people understand the claims process .
His biggest concern , he said , is that people wo n't file claims , and he cautioned people against filing lawsuits for their losses .
" If you do n't file a claim , I can't pay you , " he said , his Boston accent showing through .
Residents asked a variety of questions related to individual situations .
Thomas Dardar Jr. , the chief of the United Houma Nation , wondered if members of his tribe could be compensated for the loss of valuable land for trapping , fishing and sacred rituals .
" Absolutely :
You have a claim , " Feinberg said .
For others , it was n't so simple .
Amanda Domangue , 43 , owns Justice Transport , a company that transports supplies such as drilling jars and perforating guns to oil rigs .
She said she 's not eligible for claims through BP because her claim is n't related to oil damage , such as tainted oyster beds or closed waters .
She can't access the $ 100 - million moratorium compensation fund because she is n't a rig worker .
But Domangue estimated that 85 % of her business has been lost since April 20 .
" Ma'am you are exactly in no - man 's land , " Feinberg said .
Domangue said she was n't surprised .
" We 're stuck , " she said , adding that there are thousands of other contractors related to the oil industry who are out of work and unable to receive compensation .
Once the well is capped , Feinberg said , emergency payments will continue for 60 days .
He said people need to be able to verify income , even through a simple document such as a check stub or checkbook .
He said even having someone like a town mayor or sheriff verify income would work .
He needs something to avoid fraud , he said .
" I 'm not looking to get fancy here . "
Feinberg promised transparency , adding that the public will be able to access data related to how many claims and the amounts paid out .
He agreed with an audience member that the current " decentralized system is in shambles . "
Feinberg has experience with compensation :
He processed 7,300 claims in 33 months after 9/11 , he said .
He said the gulf compensation fund will be different from the 9/11 fund he previously oversaw .
What is similar is the surge in emotion , he said .
" You cannot do this program from Washington , " he said .
Lawrence Gautier , 64 , of Dulac , who works as an oyster packer at Gautier Enterprises , said he was impressed with Feinberg .
He filed a claim with BP only to receive a check at his address with the wrong name .
" I'm glad he took over , " he said .

“ Investors in BP should know that there ’s now an alternative to the litigation system in place , ” Kenneth Feinberg said in a telephone interview with CNBC Sunday afternoon .
“ I think that ’s a really helpful sign if you ’re an investor . ”
Feinberg , who was appointed last week as the independent administrator fund , said that recipients of emergency relief funds , which are being paid out in real time do not sign away their right to sue BP for damages .
But , he said , those people who accept final settlements from the fund , will likely be required to give up their right to sue BP .
“ You ’ll waive your right to sue , ” Feinberg said .
“ That ’s only fair . ”
“ It ’s a way for BP to avoid lawsuits in the end , ” Feinberg said .
“ And it ’s a way for a claimant voluntarily to get a check now .
You do n’t have to litigate for years – with some uncertainty about whether you ’d win – and you do n’t have to pay a lawyer thirty percent . ”
Watch Live TV Interview with Feinberg on " Squawk Box " Monday at 8:15 am EST .
Feinberg , whose previous experience includes overseeing the 9 - 11 victims fund and arbitrating executive compensation at TARP firms , said that only 94 of the 9 - 11 victims declined to take his settlement offer .
Three thousand claimants accepted the deal .
He said he ’s confident that the BP fund will similarly remove thousands of potential cases from court dockets .
“ The courts do n’t need thousands and thousands of cases , ” he said .
“ I am confident that the overwhelming majority of individuals and businesses will take my offer . ”
Feinberg said the initial emergency fund process could be in place for as long as three to six months , and then he will move toward final settlements .
But that date is uncertain because the oil is still flowing into the Gulf of Mexico and damage is ongoing .
He heaped praise on BP for having already established a claims process – which gives Feinberg infrastructure to build on – but complained that “ there ’s not enough transparency . ”
“ There ’s not enough sunlight as to the status of individual claims , ” said Feinberg , noting that thousands of claims have already been received .
Adobe on Thursday released its Flash Player 10.1 for the Windows , Mac , and Linux operating systems - after fixing 32 vulnerabilities across its product line .
Adobe on Thursday released its Flash Player 10.1 for the Windows , Mac , and Linux operating systems - after fixing 32 vulnerabilities across its product line .
The company also released Adobe AIR 2 for the same OSes .
Adobe promised improvements in performance , power management , and video , as well as new multi-touch and private browsing capabilities , and Mac - specific updates .
An Android version is expected later this month ; the beta release is available now in the Android Market .
The news comes as Adobe fixed 32 separate vulnerabilities , including one that was the target of zero - day attacks on Acrobat and Reader .
AIR was also updated to address some of these flaws .
The update is critical and all users would be well - advised to apply it as soon as possible .
If left to its own devices , the vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution and Web - based attacks .
Remember that different browsers on your system may have different installations of Flash , so you have to check and potentially update all of them .
Check your Flash version on Adobe 's site .
Adobe and Apple have waged a very public battle over Flash lately , with Apple chief executive Steve Jobs recently antiquated , closed , and unstable , and refusing to allow it on Apple devices like the iPad .
Nonetheless , Flash Player 10.1 makes several Mac- specific improvements .
The release is now a full - fledged Cocoa app , so it leverages Cocoa events , uses Cocoa UI for its dialogs , leverages Core Audio for sound , Core graphics for printing support , and Core Foundation for bundle - style text , Paul Betlem , a Flash Player engineer , wrote in a blog post .
Adobe also used double - buffer OpenGL for improved full - screen playback and used Core Animation to improve rendering performance on Macs , he said .
" Do n't let the version number fool you !
Flash Player 10.1 is more than a ' dot upgrade . '
It was a monumental undertaking including some significant architectural improvements and a long list of enhancements that will help the more than 3 million Flash designers and developers continue to move web innovation forward , " Betlam wrote .

Welcome to a new financial year and good luck !
We may need it .
The financial system is looking shaky again , the props to global economic growth are tumbling , and if it all ends up in shtook once more , the economic custodians will need the prowess of Houdini to get us out of it .
Remember the relief in late 2008 and 2009 when it seemed , for a few short months , as if the combined efforts of central banks and sovereign governments had beaten the GFC ?
The theme song for that phase of the crisis : Jefferson Starship 's Miracles .
The chorus , for the benefit of those unfamiliar with the 1970s hit is : " If only you believe like I believe , baby , we 'd get by .
If only you believed in miracles , so would I "
And believe they did - at least for a while .
In April last year , markets rallied and political journalists wrote gushing stories after the leaders of the G20 , representing nations that account for 85 per cent of the world 's economic output , pledged $ US5 trillion dollars to stimulate economic activity and banish the global recession .
The purpose of economic forecasting may be , as the late John Kenneth Galbraith quipped , to make astrology look respectable .
But you did n't need a crystal ball to work out where that bold initiative was heading .
The global financial crisis morphed into the sovereign debt crisis as the world 's governments attempted to raise massive amounts of money by issuing bonds on a scale never before attempted .
Many advanced economies were already lumbered with big budget deficits and sovereign debts before the worst downturn since the Great Depression hit and they were lumbered with a mountain more .
And , oh , how quickly the sentiment shifted .
It took less than a year before the financial markets that cheered the uber - Keynesian rescue , announced at the London G20 summit , instead began to jeer at the so - called Club Med economies and fear that their fiscal woes would cause a sovereign debt contagion engulfing Europe .
It 's breathtaking , when you think about it , that the Toronto Summit of the G20 this week staged a 180 - degree about - face , pledging to halve budget deficits within three years and to stabilise or cut public debt within six .
( Though there were so many loopholes in that pledge you could drive a Mac truck through it ) .
So where are we now ?
The Bank for International Settlements made a thorough assessment in its 80th annual report , released this week .
The theme song for that tome : The Rolling Stones , Paint it Black .
The sombre warning from the central bank for central banks : " A shock of virtually any size risks a replay of the events we saw in late 2008 and early 2009 . "
Only now there is no room to manoeuvre .
The monetary policy bullets are all shot , with real interest rates at zero in most advanced economies and central bank balance sheets " bloated " .
The fiscal policy bullets are all fired , too .
Fiscal positions , it said , are on an " unsustainable path " in many countries .
" In short , " it concluded , macroeconomic policy is in a vastly worse position than it was three years ago , with little capacity to combat a new crisis - it will be difficult to find a source of further treatment should another emergency arise . "
The prescription ?
The BIS is urging governments to engage in " fiscal consolidation " - the reining in of public debt and measures to eliminate structural budget deficits .
And it wants central banks to consider lifting interest rates .
The aim is to give them some ammunition should worst come to worst and to avoid the distortions that come from loose monetary policy ( cheap credit , remember , fuelled the debt binge that got us into the mess in the first place ) .
But what it does n't exactly state in banner headlines is that this remedy could be as painful as the malady itself .
Like radical chemotherapy , it 's guaranteed to make the patient even sicker in the hope of eventually curing the disease .
Growth is the elixir of capitalism and growth in the world economy remains sub -par despite the massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus .
The Euro zone is stagnant ; it recorded next to no economic growth in the last quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 .
Take away the government spending and the extreme low interest rates , and it's hard to see how Europe avoids a deep double dip .
Fiscal austerity measures being put in place in economies such as Greece and Spain will intensify already severe recessions .
America is posting economic growth but the unemployment rate is still alarmingly high at close to 10 per cent and consumer spending remains weak .
The good news ?
Australia is in a far better position .
Theme song : Kylie Minogue 's I should be so lucky .
The economy is in relatively good shape ; the Budget deficit and sovereign debt are miniscule by world standards and interest rates are relatively high .
So if worst comes to worst , there is ample scope for the Government to stimulate and the central bank to cut rates in order to cushion the blow .
We 're linked via trade ties to the high - growth economies of Asia - China in particular - and that offers some protection from the ills of Europe .
China 's exports will be hit by the European downturn and the huge rise in the value of its currency against the Euro .
So unless China 's own contradictions cause a bursting of the China bubble in the near - term it should continue to boost Australia 's economy - leaving us not immune but with plenty of antibodies .
But the big question is : do the woes of the old world economies of Europe and to a lesser extent in the US manifest mainly as a macro- economic problem or do they infect the banking system once again and play out as a renewed financial crisis that hits credit markets ?
Recall that warning from the BIS .
" A shock of virtually any size risks a replay of the events we saw in late 2008 and early 2009 . "
A global financial pandemic , with the stock of vaccine all gone .

Now that we know which shows we ’ll see during the 2010 - 2011 TV season , the real work can begin : writing them .
Six genre - show pros — veterans of shows like Lost , BSG , and Fringe — reveal what happens behind closed doors .

For this roundtable , we recruited writers and producers from all over : rookie “ baby ” writers like Deric A. Hughes ( Warehouse 13 ) ; mid-level writer - producers like Zack Stentz ( Fringe , Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ) ; co-executive producers like Amy Berg ( Eureka , The 4400 ) ; and top - level wizards who ’ve run their own shows , like Jane Espenson ( Caprica , Battlestar Galactica , Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) , John Rogers ( Leverage , The Jackie Chan Adventures ) , and Javier Grillo - Marxuach ( The Middleman , Lost ) .
And here ’s what they had to say .
For the layman , what is a writers room ?
What service does it perform for a television show ?

Jane Espenson :
The writers ’ room is the sleazy hotel room in which stories are conceived .
On most shows , this is where the writers spend the majority of their time , coming up with ideas for episodes and then breaking those stories into acts and scenes and moments before an individual writer is sent out to turn the story into an outline and then a script .
On a traditional multi-camera sitcom , the room is also where the script is rewritten by the entire staff working as a team to improve the jokes and story after the script is written .
Some drama shows do n’t have rooms at all — each writer works one - on - one with the showrunner to conceive and “ break ” their own episode .
I ’m told that The X - Files , for example , did not have a traditional room .
John Rogers :
It varies from show to show .
A writers room is a way for the head writer to collect all the writers in one place , hear their ideas , comment on them , have the other writers contribute and share ideas , and assemble them into not just scripts but an overall feeling for what the year ’s worth of stories are gonna be .
It ’s a clearinghouse .

Deric A. Hughes :
It ’s a place where a group of like - minded folks ( in our case , for our show , mostly people who can speak nerd / geek fluently and understand how to write for television ) come up with stories that will best serve show for which they ’ve been hired to write for .
Usually this means trying to come up with one great compelling character moment , one memorable scene , until finally you have enough great character moments and memorable scenes to fill one hour of television .
And then once that ’s finished , wash , rinse , repeat .
Zack Stentz : A writer ’s room is at its best the collective brain of a TV show — the place where the writing staff gets together and , under the leadership of the showrunner , plots out the season and “ breaks ” individual episodes .

Amy Berg ( second from left ) :
In many ways , it ’s the treehouse you had in your backyard as a kid .
A safe place where you can let you imagination take over without threat of censorship or judgment .
The room is where ideas are put through the ringer .
Where sidetracks in conversations take you down new , more interesting paths .
Where personal histories become character fodder .
And where passionate debate yields results that are otherwise unattainable by a single voice .

Javier Grillo - Marxuach :
When you are facing down the barrel of 22 hours of televised narrative that have to be produced in the course of about 10 months , it really is very difficult for any single writer to completely generate all of that material by themselves , with very rare exceptions .
And the writers room is really the closest thing in creativity to a kind of process that allows you to churn out episodic scripts week after week , to feel the ravenous beast that is production .
Every seven to eight days , production needs to be fed a new script .
And it eats scripts with extreme prejudice .
What do n’t people understand about writers rooms — people who think that it ’s just a bunch of people having a conversation ?
Advertisement
Amy Berg : You know the movie Twelve Angry Men ?
That ’s what the room is like , but instead of wrestling with a case we ’re wrestling with ideas .
It ’s a roomful of incredibly opinionated people trying to agree on one thing .
And once that thing is agreed upon , we rip it completely apart and then put the pieces back together to find the freshest take on it .
That ’s how episodes of television are conceived .
It ’s an exhausting process .
We ’re not digging ditches all day , but there ’s not a single writer who is n’t wiped out by the time they get home .
Deric A. Hughes : Actually , it is a bunch of people having conversations — a lot of very fun , interesting and sometimes thought - provoking conversations bent towards the task of creating ( hopefully ) entertaining episodes of television — but conversations nonetheless .
Advertisement
Jane Espenson :
It used to be that writers would often be asked “ which character do you write for , ” which made me think that people were picturing a sort of role - playing scenario in which we would use improv to plot the stories , but I have n’t been asked that in a long time .
I think depictions of the writers rooms in works like The Dick Van Dyke Show , 30 Rock [ above ] , Studio 60 , and Neil Simon ’s “ Laughter on the 23rd Floor ” show something close - ish to the real thing , although they tend to focus on the fun free - flowing joke - cracking part of the process , not the thinkier working - out - the - plot part .
Because that ’s kind of boring to watch .
Advertisement
John Rogers : I do n’t think they understand that the most important thing in television is the timely delivery of scripted material .
If we have a bad day , if we have some blank pages , if we have writers block , then the machine stops and we move inexorably close to bankrupting the company .
If the writers room does n’t work , the show does n’t work .
If the show does n’t work , hundreds of people are out of jobs .
And that is , at least in my writers room , evermost in our minds — that we are the people who lay the track for the train .
So we had best move with a combination of creativity and alacrity .
What makes for a good writers room , personnel - wise ?
Environment wise ?
Amy Berg : People think writers are non-aggressive , socially awkward types .
The ones who stood in the corner during school dances .
Maybe that ’s true of feature writers , but in television that ’s not the case at all .
Most television writers are natural leaders .
And when you stick a bunch of leaders in a room together , there are going to be clashes .
That ’s why personality is key .
If you have multiple Type A personalities on your staff , that ’s going to be trouble .
The job is enough of a pressure - cooker as it is , and having that added intensity and negativity around is only going to make it more difficult .

Jane Espenson :
The physical environment can vary a lot from show to show .
Sometimes there ’s a table that everyone sits around , sometimes just a room with comfy chairs and sofas .
Sometimes it ’s in the showrunner ’s office .
Sometimes it ’s in a clean - and - corporate setting , sometimes it ’s peeling paint and a window propped open with a book .
Personally , I do n’t care as long as there is enough corkboard space .
Advertisement
John Rogers :
It should be bright and spacious and have access to a fridge .
I think the biggest thing is that it should be a fun place where writers feel safe to say anything .
Even if that ’s an obscene joke about someone else ’s child .
A good writer ’s room is loose and funny .
We run our one - hour room like a sitcom room : writers come in , they pitch ideas , we all comment on them , we have a big board we put cards up on , we break it as much as we can break it , everyone throws in their two cents , the writer goes off and distills it down .
Not every one - hour does that .
A lot of one - hours , there is no writers room .
We do n’t do it that way because Leverage is a difficult show with a lot of moving parts so you never know who ’s gonna have the odd fact or weird thing that ’s gonna give us the way out or the way in .
Zack Stentz :
In my experience , a good writers room comes from the combination of having a collection of strong , confident voices who feel free to argue ideas without having to worry about politics and protocol and rank , and at the same time having a strong hand on the tiller to guide discussions and keep people focused when they threaten to go off on digressions or tangents .
On The Sarah Connor Chronicles we used to call it “ going down the rabbit hole ” — and it usually involved discussions of time - travel mechanics that lasted several hours and rarely accomplished everything .

As a showrunner , how do you go about creating that mix ?
Jane Espenson :
You want good writers and you want enough of them to be good in the room , not just on the page .
On a drama , a room benefits from writers with a good and fast sense of structure .
On a comedy a good room person is probably the one with the quickest and sharpest joke - pitching ability .
Of course , there ’s more to the job than being in the room .
A writer who is silent in the room may still be excelling by turning in brilliant drafts .
You create that mix by hiring people who have the skills your staff lacks at that moment .
Advertisement
John Rogers :
It ’s like being a baseball coach .
You have a good mix of writers of different abilities : some people are very research heavy , some people are very good with dialogue or character , some people pitch certain types of stories ....
It ’s just making sure your lineup has a good mix of skills .
Amy Berg : Putting a writing staff together is a lot like casting .
You ’re looking for the right chemistry .
You ’re not going to hire someone because they ’re a great writer .
You ’re going to hire them because they ’re a solid writer with great references and in their interview with you they did n’t come off as a total asshat .
There are a lot of people out here who are good at their jobs .
What you want are writers who you ’re going to spend 12 hours a day with for nine months and not want to wring their necks .
Advertisement
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : TV writing is somewhat akin to competitive group therapy .
And you want to have a group of people who can write well together and simultaneously challenge each other but also can play well together , work well together , and complement each others ’ strengths .
The other part of it is that as a showrunner , you ’re meeting with a writer ; you read a script , you like it , you call him in , you have a one hour meeting with them .
Based on that one - hour meeting , you decide if you wanna spend 12 hours a day in a room with him .
So there ’s still a lot of luck to it .
It ’s sort of like assembling one of those 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzles , maybe without the benefit of the cover to know what it looks like .
What ’s the single most poisonous thing to a room ’s chemistry ?
Amy Berg : Competition .
I worked on a show once where on day one the showrunner came in and said that no one is guaranteed a script and that everyone was going to have to earn it .
Now , I understand that to most people that does n’t sound like a bad thing at all , but what that showrunner did was create an atmosphere that rewarded individual achievement over collaboration .
A room cannot function on that kind of energy .
You ’re making a television show and you ca n’t do it by yourself .
When writers are trying to beat each other out for more scripts ( and script fees ) , it affects the entire vibe in the room .
They start shooting down each other ’s ideas more often .
They compete for the showrunner ’s attention .
There ’s more infighting and backstabbing .
And once that all starts , there ’s no getting the room back .
Advertisement
Deric A. Hughes : I think it ’s being negative for the sake of just being negative .
There ’s nothing worse than when a person just says “ no ” to every single idea that someone might be trying to pitch and not even offer a valid reason why they ’re saying “ no ” in the first place .
Advertisement
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : One of the rules I put in my writers room was Do n’t Break Anything You Ca n’t Fix .
Which is to say , if you do n’t like an idea I do n’t want to hear from you unless you can clearly articulate why you do n’t think it ’s any good and unless you have something to counter - pitch .
Zack Stentz :
In my opinion , the single thing that most hurts a room ’s chemistry is when writers feel like they have to pull their punches or worry more about the politics of the show and their own positions in the hierarchy than simply staying focused on making the best show possible .
On The Sarah Connor Chronicles I felt free to say things to [ executive producers ]
Josh Friedman and John Wirth that would have gotten me fired on other shows —
I went straight at them when I vehemently disagreed with an idea .
But they were confident and secure enough as writers and as leaders that they welcomed debate and dissension .
Advertisement
What ’s the one thing a writers room ca n’t be without , aside from other writers ?
Deric A. Hughes : Food .
Lots and lots of food !
And cookies and cakes and candies and sodas and teas and ( in my writing partner ’s case ) coffee ....
Need fuel to keep you going throughout the day , man .
Oh , wait , is that why I gained 15 pounds last year ?
Advertisement
Zack Stentz : Snacks !
Seriously , it is a constant struggle for someone like me , who has very little self - control when it comes to food , to not put on a lot of weight while on staff .
It ’s like Halloween every day in a writers room .
And it ’s even more dangerous if your show shoots next door — then there are the temptations of the craft services table to deal with as well !
Jane Espenson :
White boards and markers or corkboards and cards .
Whichever — some way to record the work .
Advertisement
Amy Berg :
There are two things that a writers room ca n’t live without : caffeine and toys .
Caffeine is vital , as you ’re working yourself into a state of mental exhaustion every day .
By about 3:00 in the afternoon , you ’re ready for a nap .
Having toys around the office is an important reminder that the room is supposed to be playful .
It helps keeps things light , fun , and imaginative .
On Eureka , we always have a jigsaw puzzle set up in the kitchen .
And in the writers room itself , there are toys on every table to play with .
Puzzle games in particular are great because they work different parts of your brain to help keep you sharp and focused .
John Rogers : A great writers ’ assistant .
A great writers ’ assistant kind of does the job of your ego .
Writers are all id : they ’re all storming out ideas , they ’re all riffing off each other , they ’re all puking out these random associations of facts .
A good writers ’ assistant is getting all of that down , and when they do the summary notes , they often distill it down ; they often prioritize based what they know of the room what the real strong ideas are .
A good writers ’ assistant makes a world of difference .
It is , possibly , behind the showrunner , the second most important person in a writers room .
Advertisement
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : One of the things I absolutely believe that no writers room should be without is a stupid stick .
A stupid stick is a device that , when held by the person that ’s pitching , shields that person from ridicule .
I find that it ’s actually the most useful tool I ’ve ever seen in a writers room .
A lot of the time , especially in the early going , people feel very unsafe , just talking about themselves , talking about any number of things .
Like they ’re gonna be mocked .
I generally believe that the writers room has to be safe .
A good stupid stick allows people to believe that they ’re protected .
What was your first experience in a room like ?
Amy Berg :
My first experience was one of my best experiences and has been hard to live up to .
Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert are an amazing writing team who oversaw a few shows on Nickelodeon .
I was their assistant for a couple months before they saw fit to promote me to writer .
They ran the room with the most insanely upbeat energy I ’ve ever seen .
I worked with them for three years and there was n’t one single bad day had in that room .
The vibe was always positive .
Everyone worked together , played together , succeeded or failed together .
Those guys lived and breathed teamwork as a writing partnership and they brought that into the room with them .

Jane Espenson : Wonderful .
I was briefly on a show called Dinosaurs , with a great showrunner named Bob Young who was very welcoming and patient .
It was perfect .
John Rogers :
My first experience was as a sitcom writer on Cosby .
Not the first one that made everyone rich and famous , the second one that ended careers and lives .
It was a very raucous writers room ; it was a straight - up comedy room : you sat in there for 12 hours a day , every week you had to rewrite the script from the ground up , and you shot it on Thursday , and you rewrote in between .
You lived in that room and you were the lifeboat and you were pitching jokes and if you were n’t pitching jokes , you had to get the hell out of Dodge .
Both Chris and I ( Chris Downey , the other creator of Leverage ) we both came out of that school of you must ever drive forward .
You must always be typing , always be writing , always be pitching — always driving that show forward .
And that the writers are a team .

Javier Grillo - Marxuach : My education in the writers room was actually on a show that did n’t have a writers room , and that was SeaQuest 2032 .
And that was a show where the showrunner hired a lot of high level people and he kind of let them create and develop their own ideas and write them as scripts .
Advertisement
But there were two lower level writers , I was the lowest guy on the totem pole , and the mid-level guy was Naren Shankar , who ’d just left Star Trek : The Next Generation .
But the great thing was that this was a guy that who ’d learned how to break story and generate story the Michael Piller way .
Michael Piller [ left ] is renowned for running a very strong writers room and believing very strongly that the room had to generate and collaborate .
So Naren and I would meet and break story the traditional way .
I do n’t think it ’s a surprise that Michael Piller discovered Naren , Ron Moore , Brannon Braga , and René Echevarria — all four of whom are very highly regarded showrunners in their own right .
Deric A. Hughes :
On day one of me and my writing partner ’s gig on Warehouse 13 , our showrunner , Jack Kenny , said to everyone , “ Here , inside the writers room , I do n’t care about a person ’s rank , I just want to hear good ideas .
And if you do n’t have any good ideas , I ’ll find someone else that does . ”
Now of course , he did n’t mean that you should n’t respect a person ’s rank and history , but it should never preclude you from coming up with ideas and sharing them with the room .
So when he said that , I think this immediately broke the ice and allowed everyone to relax , be themselves , and focus on coming up with great stories to tell .

Zack Stentz : My first experience of a writers ’ room was a very lucky one .
It was on Gene Roddenberry ’s Andromeda under Robert Wolfe , who was coming off of the very well - run Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and applied and even improved the room culture to create a very challenging but convivial environment for baby writers .
One hears of rooms where staff writers are n’t supposed to speak at all — the Andromeda room could n’t have been any more different .
What ’s been your best experience ?
Advertisement
Jane Espenson : Dinosaurs was such a warm place .
And Buffy was amazing .
And I was so proud of the staff on Caprica .
But it would be hard to beat Battlestar Galactica .
The room was absolutely packed with guys who were masters of storytelling and who would n’t let a single false moment slip through .
We would discuss a story in general terms and while we were talking , Bradley Thompson would be writing on note cards .
Then you ’d look up and realize he ’d pinned them to the board and there was a whole episode up there .
They all made it look easy , but it ’s not .
Deric A. Hughes : I think just being able to come into Warehouse room every single day and work with people you ’ve respected and admired from past TV shows / movies / animation for years and are now treating you as an equal … well , or at least someone who deserves to be there in the first place .
Advertisement
Amy Berg :
My current experience on Eureka is hard to top .
It ’s the exact right mix of humans .
Everyone is willing to do whatever it takes to make the show the best it can be .
It ’s never about the individual , it ’s always about the team .
There are some showrunners who have been known to keep their writing staff at the office late because they ’d rather work than go home .
That ’s both sad and cruel .
And it ’s not the case on Eureka .
There ’s a great respect here for the fact that we all have personal lives .
We have families we want to see , things we have to do , places we have to be outside of the show .
Whether that ’s a doctor ’s appointment , a school play , or a wedding out of town .
We want to make sure that your life does n’t stop just because production has started .
Success is always sweeter when you have people to share it with .
Camaraderie does n’t guarantee success , but it makes it more achievable because it ’s something we all want for each other and not just for ourselves .
Zack Stentz :
My best experience was on The Sarah Connor Chronicles — Josh had such a clear vision of the show he wanted to make ( which was challenging and appealing ) , John was such a master at guiding the room and getting the most out of all of us , and there were literally no weak links in a diverse room full of people at all levels of experience .
You had seasoned hands like Toni Graphia and Natalie Chaidez , and you had staff writers like Ian Goldberg , Dan Thomsen , and Denise The , who made me seethe with envy when I saw them turn in work that was far more accomplished than anything I was doing at their ages .
I still mourn the demise of that show , and confess to getting irritated when I see praise heaped on other genre shows that do n’t have 1/10th the ambition that we did .

John Rogers :
This room .
First year of Leverage , the studio had never done a show before , we had a tiny budget , we hired almost all staff writers because we had no money and we decided to go for volume — and we came up with one of the best years of television I ’ve ever produced in 15 years .
A rookie team with a lot of energy , a lot of gumption , a lot of ambition , and every single one of them worked their asses off .
It was great to be in that situation where this is plainly impossible , and it turned out to be great .
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : I have to say , at the risk of tooting my own horn , I had a wonderful room on The Middleman .
That was a show that I think was blessed in a lot of ways .
We all loved the show , we all got along , and even though it was a fairly small room — I do n’t think we ever had more than five people in it .
It was just a room where everyone vibes really well .
Advertisement
Without naming names , what ’s been your worst ?
John Rogers : I consulted on a show once , and it was hard to watch the network kind of beat up the showrunners .
My relationship with TNT on Leverage is that they ’re clearly supportive , they ’re full creative partners , and they pretty much tell us when they do n’t like something , but they hired us to run a show and they let us run a show .
This other situation was very much that kind of ... you could tell that the executive in particular was a frustrated showrunner or writer and he just beat the hell out of the guys who were running the room .
I ca n’t imagine being in that situation ; I actually quit .
Whenever you do n’t see the script department working — and I know I talk like a 1950s screenwriter when I say “ script department ” — but every script department has it ’s own rhythms , and whenever somebody interferes with it , you ’re interfering with the very guts of a show .
A smart network or a smart studio finds that once a staff is working , they stay out of their way .
Advertisement
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : I have worked with people who are absentee micromanagers , those are a lot of fun .
The shows where the showrunner is never around and then they show up for 15 minutes twice a week and destroy everything and insist that everything be redone .
The shows where the showrunner enters the writers room at 6:30 in the evening after we ’ve been there since 10 am and goes “ Right !
Let ’s go to work . ”
Look , no writers room is perfect , but the ones that work collaboratively are the best .
The ones where you ’re there to facilitate some emotional need of the showrunner are the worst .
Amy Berg : I ’ve been confronted by misogyny on a staff before .
It ’s just sad that this sort of thing still exists .
The really horrible thing about this kind of behavior is that it ’s not something you can change .
You ca n’t talk things out .
I tried that .
It ’s just something that ’s ingrained in people .
And if you do n’t have support from your showrunner ( or if the person is your showrunner ) , all you can do is pack your stuff and move on to bigger and better things .

Who have you , personally , learned the most from ?
Amy Berg :
On the page , I would have to say I learned the most from Ira Steven Behr .
I went into my experience on The 4400 as somewhat of a raw talent .
I was not refined by any means .
But the time I spent with Ira was incredibly valuable .
We wrote a script together during the final season , and I got to witness his process beat - by - beat .
It was amazing .
He had high expectations for me and forced me to raise my game .
John Rogers is an amazing story breaker .
I learned a lot from him during my tenure on Leverage that I will take with me everywhere I go .
I added a few more skills to my toolbox thanks to him .
As far as the kind of person I want to be as a showrunner , I have to look no further than Eureka ’s Bruce Miller and Jaime Paglia .
They are two of the best humans on the planet .
And the fact that they ’re super - talented is a double bonus .

Jane Espenson : Joss Whedon , although there are other great candidates .
Joss was the king of “ why are we telling this story ? ”
He really impressed all his writers with the sense that a story had to be about something other than the characters and their world .
It had to really have something to say about the real world .
I try never to forget what he taught me .
John Rogers :
Two people .
One was Dean Devlin .
Because he ’s a very emotional guy .
Everything comes from heart .
He ’s always like “ How does this make me feel ? ”
And I was always a very technical writer , I mean , I write very complicated heist stuff , and having a guy who ’s always like , “ What ’s the character beat here , what ’s the moment ? ” —
I ’ve definitely learned a lot just working with Dean .
Also Cosby ’s David Landsberg , who was my first showrunner .
David was relentless ; we were in that writers room for 20 hours at a time and he sat at the head of that table and he never bitched us out , he never yelled at us — no matter how bad things got on Cosby , he never took it out on us .
We were the lifeboat , we were gonna survive , we were gonna work together , we were gonna overcome this .
He was just an inspiration ; he was the showrunner I wanted to be .
The guy that , no matter how it happened , the staff would turn to and he ’d say , “ Okay , I got one more trick in the toolbox . ”
He never gave up .
That to me is what a showrunner is : the guy that ’s got one more trick in the toolbox .

Zack Stentz : I ’ve learned a ton from every single person I ’ve worked with , from Andromeda ’s Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer teaching me the concept of the “ two - one punch ” ( leading with your most powerful emotion instead of building to it ) to Jeff Pinkner masterfully pulling apart the structure of a Fringe episode to diagnose a problem .
But I think I ’ve learned the most from Josh Friedman , in how he constantly challenged me to look beyond the obvious way into a scene or an episode or a character , and to strip away unnecessary incident to find the core of truth and drama in whatever story we were telling .
Javier Grillo - Marxuach : I have learned things from so many different people .
Lost ’s Damon Lindelof is one of the most ingenious twisters of scene and story I ’ve ever seen at work .
He ’s a guy that you give a scene that is very stock and he comes up with a genius way of making it different .
Watching that muscle at work is an extraordinary thing — and you learn it by watching a guy do it .
Graham Yost , who ran Boomtown was a guy who —
Boomtown was a non-linear cop show , and he was a guy who could generate those non-linear stories in his head .
And learning how to break story like him was an amazing education in lateral thinking .
David Greenwalt is an extraordinary manager , and is also a guy who brings a lot of courage of his convictions to his storytelling .
From him , I learned about being very committed and gutsy .
Silvio Horta , on The Chronicle and Jake 2.0 , is a guy who ’s tremendously eager to give and to delegate and to let people flourish .
That was a lesson in and of itself .
I believe , very strongly , that a showrunner ’s legacy is as much in the show they create as it is in the number of people that they train and they groom and put out into the world — and that dynamic , that teaching , happens in the writers room .

What ’s it like as a baby writer ?
As a showrunner ?
Aside from the pay grade , how does the job differ ?
Zack Stentz :
The thing that makes a showrunner ’s job so difficult is that one has to simultaneously be an artist and a manager , and those are two very different skill sets that only occasionally overlap .
It ’s a reason why so few make it all the way up — it ’s a rare thing to find someone who simultaneously has an interesting and compelling vision and can effectively manage their staff , deal with temperamental actors , make a budget , and effectively interact with the executives from the studio and network .

As a baby writer , your first and most important job is to help contribute ideas to the room .
When you have 13 episodes to tell and only a few short months to get scripts into production , you need to be a fountain of ideas for your showrunner .
Because sitting there like a bump on a log and not saying anything is not going to help anyone achieve that goal .
Even if you ’re afraid what you have to say is a bad idea and it might get rejected , you need to get over that fear and speak what ’s on your mind .
Amy Berg :
The difference between a baby writer and a showrunner is enormous with regards to both responsibilities and expectations .
The only real job of a baby writer is to take the episode they ’ve been given and make the most out of it .
There are n’t high expectations for them in the room because of their lack of experience .
But if they give you something extra — if they work their asses off by doing research and constantly generating story ideas — they will work their way up the ladder very quickly .
A showrunner is the overseer .
They ’re responsible for supervising every aspect of the production .
Story breaking , script writing / rewriting , casting , editing , you name it .
It ’s a massive undertaking , both time - consuming and pressure - filled .
A show ’s success or failure is often placed squarely on the showrunner ’s shoulders .
Which is why they need a talented and supportive staff to back them up .

Jane Espenson :
They can both be fun jobs and they can both be very stressful jobs .
A baby writer has to worry about themselves a lot more — am I going to “ stick ” in the business ?
Am I good enough to do this for a living ?
Have I contributed today ?
The showrunner usually has done this long enough that those questions have receded .
But now they have to worry about everything else — all the details of getting a show made .
These are very different jobs .
John Rogers : I was raised by guys who trained young writers and taught them to write and work and give them production responsibilities .
And that ’s what we did with all of these writers and those first - year baby staff writers are now leaving to go be producers on other shows on year three .
Because we threw a lot at them , we did n’t just throw them on the first , we tried to teach them at the same time .
And they learned really wonderfully .
A lot of showrunners are just making a show , man .
And there ’s two reasons you should n’t do that .
One , no show should be dependent on one guy .
Personally thinking , I kind of refute the auteur theory in pretty much all produced television .
And , two , if you do n’t train your young writers to be producers , who ’ll give you a consulting job when you ’re in your 50s ?
I mean , the whole point of my career is to launch young writers so eventually I can work three days a week on their show .

Are there any times as a showrunner / executive producer , you wish you were a baby writer ?
Amy Berg : Sure .
You sleep more .
You ’re in better health .
You have the time and energy to enjoy an active social life .
There are some trade - offs .
But writers like me did n’t get into this business to work for other people their entire careers .
We want to be creators .
And with that goal comes great responsibilities .

Jane Espenson :
Oh yes , all the time .
Well , maybe not a baby writer , but a mid-level writer — the level at which you get to have a lot of input on the show and write a lot of scripts , but at which there is still someone above you with whom to confirm your instincts and decisions .
Javier Grillo - Marxuach :
The thing I learned about being a showrunner that has become crucial in my development , both as a showrunner and as a person : Credit is a self - renewable resource .
So the more of it you give away to people who rightfully deserve it , the more of it you get back anyway .
And that there ’s more work than any one person can do , so delegating work should n’t be an object of fear .
Frankly , after being in a lot of rooms , I do n’t necessarily yearn for my days as a baby writer because I feel like as a showrunner if I ’m willing to delegate and willing to trust and willing to teach and communicate , the writers will step up and do great work .
Being the boss is nice and being a nice boss is better .

John Rogers :
Oh , man .
Yeah !
Sometimes , you really do n’t want to be the guy with the toolbox .
Sometimes , it ’d be great if it was somebody else ’s problem .
But you know what ?
Television , we make stuff .
We make it .
We write stuff and then people shoot it and it ’s on the air .
It ’s the fastest turnaround for narrative or storytelling you can have .
It ’s worth paying pretty much any price for that , if you ’re a guy who makes stuff up for a living .
Scareware purveyors are ramping up for a big weekend poisoning search results .
Achal Khetarpal , research director at antivirus firm CyberDefender , just typed “ 4th July dessert recipes ” as a Bing query and got this innocuous - looking , but highly invasive , link as the 10th ranked result :
This is step one of a ruse spread by one of the most active scareware gangs out there selling worthless software called Security Master AV .
Clicking on the poisoned result instantly launched the fake scan and promotion for Security Master AV :
Black Hat SEO attackers have been intensively poisoning search results on Google and You Tube for the past year or so .
Khetarpal ’s discovery confirms the basic hacking techniques work well on Bing , too .
“ Blackhat SEO attackers are definitely deploying these attacks in Bing , but in smaller numbers , ” says Khetarpal .
Save yourself by force - quitting browser
If you see a suspicious virus alert or virus scan , the worst thing you can do is click on anything in the alert or scan , even a “ stop scan ” or “ cancel ” button , says Microsoft spokesman Eric Foster .
That ’s because clicking on anything the bad guys present to you usually advances the scam .
Instead , if you ’re using a Windows XP , Windows Vista , or Windows 7 computer hit “ ctrl- alt - delete ” or type Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ task managerÃ¢â‚ ¬Â into the Windows search box to navigate to your Task Manager .
At this point , the fake scan / alert is running on whatever web browser you are using , says RandyAbrams , Eset ’s director of technical education .
Locate your browser under the “ applications ” tab in your Task Manager and then force - quit it by clicking “ end task . ”
“ If the user is running Internet Explorer they need to end Internet Explorer , ” says Abrams .
“ If they are running Firefox , then end Firefox , Safari , end Safari , if Chrome , then end Chrome . ”
At this point , the fake scan / alert is running on whatever web browser you are using , says Randy
Abrams , Eset ’s director of technical education .
Locate your browser under the “ applications ” tab in your Task Manager and then force - quit it by clicking “ end task . ”
Reinstalling Windows operating system
Here ’s the rub :
If you do happen to click on the fake scan , you will most likely be insistently steered to screens prompting you to pay $ 30 – $ 80 for worthless clean up and ongoing protection .
At this point , getting rid of the malware now becomes more difficult .
You can :
Still try to force - quite your browser .
Reboot your PC .
Try using Microsoft ’s free Security Essentials scanning and basic protection tools
Try running a known - legit virus scan from your antivirus provider .
Try using a free scan and clean tool such as SpyBot Search & Destroy , Malwarebytes or Vipre PC Rescue .
Wipe your drive clean and reinstall your Windows operating system .
“ Sometimes it is much faster and easier to reinstall the operating system , ” says Abrams .
“ Typically skilled support professionals can fix the issue without requiring a reinstall , but if you go to a major electronics store they may tell you that reinstalling is the only way and that you will lose your data .
“ It can take weeks , in some cases , to clean up all of the malware these fake AV products install .
They rarely install only one item and often have hidden downloaders to install more . ”
Outrageously lucrative
The selling of scareware has evolved into an outrageously lucrative criminal enterprise .
Panda Security estimates that scareware generates some $ 34 million a month in revenue for a cottage industry of criminal gangs and independent specialst .
That estimate was affirmed by the bust of one such gang documents by federal regulators to have banked $ 163 million in sales from 2006 - 2008 .
Blackhat SEO attacks that disperse poisoned search results have become a popular way to spread scareware .
Such attacks “ are automated and take place every single day , ” says PandaLabs researcher Sean - Paul Correll .
“ It currently is the main delivery method ” for scareware .
Kaspersky Lab has also gathered data that “ at least some of the bad guys have managed to completely automate this process , ” says senior analyst Roel Schouwenberg .
“ They run scripts which crawl Google Trends , Twitter trends and potentially other sites to see what are hot topics .
This means that basically any ‘ breaking story ’ will be used for Black SEO , ” says Schouwenberg .
Google is the primary target , since it accounts for 65 % of U.S. searches , but the techniques hackers use to poison search results work just as well on any search engine , says Andrew Brandt , threat research analyst at antivirus firm Webroot .
“ This has been extremely pervasive since the middle of 2009 , ” says Brandt .
“ The fact that , nowadays , virtually any search result can contain malicious links is a sign that the Black Hats engaged in this practice have become expert search engine manipulators . ”
Recent trending topics for which they ’ve spread poisoned search results include the Twilight movie , the Gulf oil spill , World Cup soccer Justin BieberÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s car accident , and Kim KardashianÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Playboy Video Shoot .
Trust no links
The bad guys are using several sophisticated methods to cause poisoned search results to appear high in results ranking .
Eset senior research fellow David Harley describes one , called index hijacking :
Index hijacking tends to involve manipulation of the Google PageRank ( PR ) algorithm .
Google does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t discuss the detail of the algorithm , and has frequently modified the overall ranking strategy , which also involves other attributes such as link text , content of a page and its neighbors , and so on .
A classic manipulation technique is to create a Rank Sink , a page with lots of good incoming links and few visible outgoing links .
This increases what Google calls the importance of a page , since it looks like a page that attracts visitors rather than transient , more or less random link hopping .
Each incoming link is a vote for the page that increases its importance .
Search poisoning is just one type of attack in the daily mix of malicious software detected and blocked antivirus vendors .
Bottom line : Internet users not wishing to have control of their PC turned over to an attacker must be skeptical of all links — whether in a search result , e-mail messaging spam , Facebook wall posting , Tweeted posting , or just routinely navigating to known , safe web sites that might be hacked and tainted .
In this miasmic environment , poisoned search results ebb and flow , intensifying general threats to Internet users at predictable times .
Ã‚Â “ These attacks are omnipresent , ” says Kaspersky Lab ’s Schouwenberg .
Adam McNeil , Webroot threat research analyst , adds : “ What we have observed is that Google seems to figure out a way to thwart this malicious SEO for a time , then the bad guys figure out a loophole in Google ’s new algorithm . ”

Why Afghanistan ?
By James Rothenberg
26 May , 2010
Countercurrents.org
What are we doing in Afghanistan ?
According to U.S. Senator Charles Schumer , the Administration together with the Congress are working to complete our “ mission ” .
This is good news for enthusiasts of American imperialism who naturally take to national , militaristic , rallying calls .
Mission is a carefully chosen word .
Used in this sense by propagandists , it connotes purpose , goodness , unity , and suggestively … Stop !
Because once you accept the premise that we have a mission in Afghanistan , you are sufficiently indoctrinated .
With this level of indoctrination , attention can be safely turned away from the mission itself onto its details , things like strategy , tactics , timing , resources , and flexibility .
Schumer assures us that , in this debate over details , all the president ’s advisers are getting their say .
He calls the War in Afghanistan a “ complex issue ” to which there are no easy answers .
There are easy answers , but Washington does n’t like them .
And what makes the issue complex is the circular way Washington must represent the situation in order to keep the public in line with the program .
Foremost in this regard is to frighten , therefore the inevitable scare talk about protecting our country from terrorists ( in lieu of a truly formidable enemy ) and , in general , cultivating enemies ( Iran , North Korea , Cuba , Venezuela ) , the one thing that is indispensable to the Pentagon .
The thinking person must examine the concept of terrorism and the government ’s repeated reference to it .
If one accepts the State Department ’s definition limiting it to non-state actors , the U.S. is conveniently exempt .
This certainly answers the question of why no government officials will be considered terrorists , but it is hardly because of the popularly accepted notion of innocence .
State terrorism is violence on a scale ( for example , “ Shock and Awe ” in Iraq ) that is not approachable by non-state actors .
We talk about “ defeating ” al Qaeda .
What can that possibly mean when their methods are those of the already defeated ?
It is the method of those that lack – no size , no resources , no army , navy , or air force – possessing a very finite ability and number that cannot be reduced to zero .
Indeed , all indications are that our military aggression ( with even mere military presence constituting low - grade aggression ) in Muslim lands will move the number , predictably , in the opposite direction of zero .
The point is not that small scale terrorism has a place because large scale terrorism exists .
That is simply a fact .
The point is to oppose all forms of terrorism , wherever it emanates from .
The citizen is in no position to affect foreign terrorism , but has a natural and proper role to address the terrorism carried out by our own government .
Understanding why it is that our government exploits small scale terrorism to advance its own agenda is a step in this direction .
Which brings us to the real mission , actually obliquely referred to here by Schumer :
" We can achieve victory in Afghanistan when we have an environment that is conducive to economic development and most importantly when the Afghans have a security infrastructure that permits them to independently fight off and neutralize the Taliban insurgency in that country . "
Putting aside what he relegates most importance to , the two operative words are " economic development " , and it is not theirs that we are interested in .
If we are not interested in helping Cuba ’s economic development , 90 miles from our shore , why would we care about Afghanistan , halfway around the world .
All the troops , all the missiles , all the Predator drones are there to bring Afghanistan under American dependence , consolidating U.S. presence in the oil and gas rich Caspian Basin with its geopolitical significance toward potential enemies Russia and China , and encircling Iran .
We ’re fighting them “ over there ” not so we do n’t have to fight them “ over here ” , but because that ’s where the oil and gas are .
Try telling that to the American public and see if it turns up a few less patriots .
The vaunted “ stability ” that Washington yearns for in foreign countries has nothing to do with stability .
What country has been more stable than Cuba for the past 50 years ?
Stability in the State Department sense means compliance with U.S. instructions , access for U.S. investment , access to the country ’s raw materials , and the necessary military basing these entail .
The cheapest asset of U.S. multinationals is the U.S. military , serving to protect foreign investment with costs of blood and limb , paid for in full by the commons .
Collateral to this use of the military , some GIs in Afghanistan are now said to be under Army investigation for allegedly killing three Afghan civilians in Kandahar earlier this year , as well they should be .
But notice the distinction between this , an instance of military justice , and the enforcement work known as domestic justice .
Domestically , at least sometimes , we use the weak to get the strong .
There is a compelling logic to this because the weak only do what the boss allows .
Besides , there is much in this for the prosecutor in the way of making a reputation , and what it says for career advancement .
In the military , the strong are used to get the weak .
Careers are advanced by sealing off potential damage from above , for example , then Major Colin Powell in Vietnam , the subject being possible U.S. atrocities .
If all the truth were known , the responsibility in Afghanistan rests with those who give orders , ultimately , Washington .

US jobs report points to deepening slump
By Barry Grey
3 July 2010
The employment report for June released Friday by the Labor Department confirms that the United States is in the grips of a protracted economic slump with no recovery in sight .
If anything , the report suggests that the economic situation would best be described as a depression , rather than the official designation of a slow “ recovery . ”
The Labor Department reported a net loss of non-farm jobs of 125,000 , primarily due to the expiration of 225,000 temporary US Census government positions .
However , the private sector generated a mere 83,000 net jobs , well below economists ’ projections and barely half the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with the normal monthly growth of the labor market .
The anemic increase in private sector jobs in June follows a disastrous performance in May .
Friday ’s survey downwardly revised the May figure from 41,000 to 33,000 .
The impact of a new wave of job and service cuts by deficit - ridden state and local governments began to be felt with a net loss of 8,000 state and municipal positions .
Job gains were largely in low - paying industries — leisure and hospitality , and the temporary help industry .
Manufacturing payrolls grew by 9,000 , much smaller than the average of 25,000 over the previous five months .
Construction shed another 22,000 jobs .
The percentage of the overall working - age population that is in the labor force fell to 64.7 percent — near a 25 - year low .
These figures indicate that the most severe jobs crisis since the Great Depression will only grow worse .
According to Friday ’s report , two - and - a - half years after the official start of the recession in December of 2007 , there are now 15.2 million workers who are unemployed and 25.8 million who are either unemployed or underemployed .
Some 6.8 million have been unemployed for more than 6 months .
The official underemployment rate — including workers who have given up looking for a job and part - time workers who want a full - time job — stands at 16.5 percent .
The reality , however , is even worse than the dismal picture presented by these official figures .
Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Friday ’s report , ironically , is the nominal fall in the official jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent in May .
This is because the decline is due entirely to a contraction in the statistical labor force , a result of the staggering growth of long - term unemployment .
The official labor force shrank by 652,000 workers , primarily due to long - term jobless people giving up looking for work and therefore no longer being counted for the purposes of estimating the unemployment rate .
Had these so - called “ discouraged ” workers continued to look for work , the official rate for June would have been 9.9 percent .
The catastrophic impact of the economic crisis on widening layers of the working population is underscored by the levels of long - term joblessness .
The Labor Department reports that 45.5 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for 27 weeks or more ( the official benchmark for “ long - term ” unemployment ) .
The average length of joblessness is now six months ( twice the previous record duration ) .
Other aspects of Friday ’s employment report also indicate that the economy is losing momentum .
Average weekly hours of work declined , as did average hourly wages .
Friday ’s jobs survey comes in the midst of a series of economic reports pointing to weaker growth .
This week saw a sharply lower consumer confidence report , a record 30 percent drop in pending home sales for May , a double - digit decline in US auto sales for June , an unanticipated rise in initial jobless benefit claims , and a decline in an index of manufacturing activity to its lowest level since December .
Also on Friday , the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell by 1.4 percent in May , the first decline after nine months of gains and the biggest drop since March 2009 .
The employment report places in sharp relief the indifference of the Obama administration , Congress and both political parties to the social disaster facing millions of working class families .
On the same day the Labor Department report was issued , Congress adjourned for the week - long July Fourth holiday without extending federal unemployment benefits .
Some 1.7 million jobless people have already stopped getting an unemployment check ( averaging nationally a paltry $ 335 a week , and far lower in many states ) , as a result of the expiration of federally funded extended benefits .
That figure will rise to 3.3 million by the end of July .
Congress has also failed to allocate additional aid to the states , worsening the fiscal crisis of scores of states and setting the stage for the layoff of hundreds of thousands of public employees , including teachers , firefighters , social workers , etc . — as well as new and more draconian cuts in basic public services .
Obama has barely made an issue of the jobless benefit cutoff , focusing instead on demands that Congress pass a toothless financial regulatory bill tailored to the interests of Wall Street .
On Friday , he responded to the new jobless numbers with a statement that recalls Herbert Hoover ’s declaration in 1932 that “ Prosperity is just around the corner . ”
“ Make no mistake , ” he declared , “ we are headed in the right direction . ”
He added that “ we are not headed there fast enough for most Americans . ”
This statement is a direct falsification of the economic reality , intended to deceive and politically disarm the population .
It echoes Vice President Joseph Biden ’s declaration last month that this is the “ Recovery Summer . ”
The jobs report indicates that the economy is headed in the wrong direction , and may be slipping back to negative growth .
To talk of the “ right direction ” under the present circumstances — with unemployment , home foreclosures and personal bankruptcies at post - war record levels , and wages , home values and retirement savings being decimated — is an insult to the intelligence of the American people .
For those social layers whose interests Obama serves , however , things are going not at all badly .
The banks are making near - record profits and rewarding their CEOs with multi-million - dollar pay packages , and corporations across the board are using mass unemployment to drive down wages and drive up labor productivity .
An article by Brett Arends published June 29 on the MarketWatch web site notes : “ Numbers published by the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago show that corporate profit margins have just hit record levels .
Andrew Smithers , the well - regarded financial consultant and author of Wall Street Revalued , calculates from the Fed ’s latest Flow of Funds report that corporate profit margins rocketed to 36 percent in the first quarter .
Since records began in 1947 they have never been this high .
The highest they got under Ronald Reagan was 30 percent . ”
Arends also notes a recent report that estimates the super - rich of North America saw an 18 percent jump in their wealth last year .
In his article , entitled “ The Three Biggest Lies About the Economy , ” Arends cites statistics showing that the actual level of unemployment in the US is about 25 percent .
He writes : “ An analysis of data at the US Labor Department shows that there are 79 million men in America between the ages of 25 and 65 .
And nearly 18 million of them , or 22 percent , are out of work completely .
( The rate in the 1950s was less than 10 percent ) .
And that does n’t even count those who are working part - time because they ca n’t get full - time work .
Add those to the mix and about one in four men of prime working age lacks a full - time job . ”
In a provocative calculation in 1995 , Ted Jacobson , a theorist from the University of Maryland , showed that given a few of these holographic ideas , Einstein ’s equations of general relativity are just a another way of stating the laws of thermodynamics .
Those exploding black holes ( at least in theory — none has ever been observed ) lit up a new strangeness of nature .
Black holes , in effect , are holograms — like the 3 - D images you see on bank cards .
All the information about what has been lost inside them is encoded on their surfaces .
Physicists have been wondering ever since how this “ holographic principle ” — that we are all maybe just shadows on a distant wall — applies to the universe and where it came from .
In one striking example of a holographic universe , Juan Maldacena of the Institute for Advanced Study constructed a mathematical model of a “ soup can ” universe , where what happened inside the can , including gravity , is encoded in the label on the outside of the can , where there was no gravity , as well as one less spatial dimension .
If dimensions do n’t matter and gravity does n’t matter , how real can they be ?
Lee Smolin , a quantum gravity theorist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics , called Dr. Jacobson ’s paper “ one of the most important papers of the last 20 years . ”
But it received little attention at first , said Thanu Padmanabhan of the Inter - University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune , India , who has taken up the subject of “ emergent gravity ” in several papers over the last few years .
Dr. Padmanabhan said that the connection to thermodynamics went deeper that just Einstein ’s equations to other theories of gravity .
“ Gravity , ” he said recently in a talk at the Perimeter Institute , “ is the thermodynamic limit of the statistical mechanics of “ atoms of space - time . ”
Dr. Verlinde said he had read Dr. Jacobson ’s paper many times over the years but that nobody seemed to have gotten the message .
People were still talking about gravity as a fundamental force .
“ Clearly we have to take these analogies seriously , but somehow no one does , ” he complained .
His paper , posted to the physics archive in January , resembles Dr. Jacobson ’s in many ways , but Dr. Verlinde bristles when people say he has added nothing new to Dr. Jacobson ’s analysis .
What is new , he said , is the idea that differences in entropy can be the driving mechanism behind gravity , that gravity is , as he puts it an “ entropic force . ”
London , England ( CNN ) --
The Alaotra Grebe , a small diving bird native to Madagascar has been officially classified extinct , according to a leading bird conservation organization .
BirdLife International reported that the species , once found on Lake Alaotra , the largest lake in Madagascar , declined rapidly due to carnivorous fish being introduced to the lake and the use of nylon gill nets by local fishermen .
" No hope now remains for this species .
It is another example of how human actions can have unforeseen consequences , " Dr Leon Bennun , BirdLife International 's director of science , policy and information said in a statement .
Invasive alien species are causing extinctions around the globe , Bennun says , and are one of the major threats not just to birds but to other wildlife .
BirdLife International 's report is the latest update to the International Union for Conservation of Nature 's ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species for birds and highlights additional cases of the negative impact of invasive species on bird life .
The status of Zapata Rail -- a blue / brown bird native to Southwest Cuba -- was upgraded to " critically endangered " due to the introduction of mongoose and exotic catfish to its marshland habitat .
In Asia and Australia , pollution of coastal wetlands is contributing to the falling populations of wading birds like the Great Knot and the Far Eastern Curlew .
The destruction of inter-tidal mudflats in Saemangeum , South Korea , an important migratory stop - over site , has seen numbers of the Great Knot fall by 20 percent , according to BirdLife .
But the news is n't all bad .
Conservation projects are having a positive impact on the survival of bird species .
In particular , the Azores Bullfinch has been downgraded from " critically endangered " to " endangered " thanks to conservation work to restore its natural vegetation on its Atlantic island home .
And in Colombia , the numbers of Yellow - eared Parrot have been rising as its nesting sites are preserved and local communities take part in educational programs to learn about conservation .
Martin Fowlie , communications officer at BirdLife International told CNN : " The overall state of the world 's birds is getting worse year on year .
But these are two very good examples in the list this year that show conservation works .
" We have the skill and the expertise , so these things can be prevented .
But we need commitments from governments to provide money to help birds and animals to survive . "

senators regarding the choice of the first CFPB director
THE HILL'S BLOG BRIEFING ROOM
Dodd doubts Warren 's confirmability for job of consumer guardian
By Michael O'Brien
Elizabeth Warren might not have the votes to win confirmation as head of a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency , Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) suggested Monday .
Dodd , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , said he sensed rumblings among colleagues that Warren , the chairwoman of the panel overseeing the 2008 Wall Street bailout program , might not get the 60 votes necessary to win confirmation .
" I think Elizabeth would be a terrific nominee , " Dodd told NPR 's Diane Rehm on Monday .
" The question is , ' Is she confirmable ? '
And there 's a serious question about it . " . . .
Dear Mr. President :
One of the most important provisions in the Dodd - Frank Wall Street reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd - Frank ) establishes , for the first time , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) .
As you know , in the years preceding the crisis , providers of financial services offered consumers many products that were unfair , deceptive , and abusive , with disastrous effects on consumers and on our economy .
In many instances , consumers were hurt because our financial regulators failed to enforce existing consumer protection laws .
In other cases , because at least seven different agencies were responsible for consumer protection , no single agency viewed consumer protection as its primary responsibility .
All too often this important function was relegated far down their priority list .
The new CFPB will rectify these flaws and make sure the financial system also works for consumers .
The idea behind the CFPB came from the current head of the Congressional Oversight Panel , Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren .
In her 2007 article that launched the idea , Professor Warren wrote , " Just as the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) protects buyers of goods and supports a competitive market , we need the same for consumers of financial products -- a new regulatory regime , and even a new regulatory body , to protect consumers who use credit cards , home mortgages , car loans , and a host of other products . "
With your help , Congress was able to make this vision a reality over the objections of those in the financial services industry who spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to weaken or removed the CFPB .
Establishing and empowering the CFPB immediately is among the most important challenges that you face in implementing this historic legislation .
To help ensure the CFPB is able to stand up to the power of the financial industry , Congress endowed the CFPB with a single director to be nominated by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate .
As you make your decision regarding the nominee for this position , we believe it is essential that you select someone with a proven history of standing up to unfair and abusive practices in the financial industry , particularly in the area of consumer protection .
It will be especially important that the first director be someone who will not cave in when pressured by the financial industry , which we expect to be enormous .
Only with such a leader can we properly protect consumers from the unfair , abusive , and deceptive practices that have been standard practice in too many segments of the financial industry for too long .
Indeed , someone with a track record akin to that of Professor Warren would be the type of person we believe is necessary to head this Bureau .
With the enactment of Dodd - Frank , much work is now left to be done by the financial regulatory agencies , including the CFPB .
We look forward to your selection of a strong nominee to head the CFPB and to working with you to assure this person 's confirmation by the U.S. Senate .
Putting this person in place swiftly is among the important steps necessary to implement this groundbreaking legislation to ensure that it reaches its full potential of improving the financial system .
We appreciate y our serious consideration of our views .

[ Um , er , I notice that Senator Dodd 's name -- you know , as in " Dodd - Frank " -- is n't among the signatories .
Probably he just had one of those damned pens that when you try to , you know , write with the damned thing , you get nothing .
There are a lot of other missing Democratic senators , and I notice that there do n't seem to be any Republican signers .
Could this be like when somebody has a birthday in my office and the card gets passed around furtively for everybody to sign -- maybe this letter was being passed around and just never reached all those other Dems , and never did get shot across the aisle ? ]
SIDE NOTE : ISN'T THIS SOME SORRY SPECTACLE
CHRIS DODD IS MAKING OF HIMSELF ?
The suggestion has been made that you see a pol 's true colors when he / she reaches lame - duck status .
Remember , back when Dodd announced that he would n't seek what seemed increasingly unlikely reelection , and there was speculation that , despite his longstanding bankster and Wall Street ties , he might make a powerhouse financial reform package his legacy ?
We discovered pretty quickly that that was n't going to happen , that his mission was to keep whatever package ultimately passed within manageable ( by financial industry standards ) bounds .
Now he 's just embarrassing himself .
Dear Professor Warren :
After careful consideration , we 've decided we would sooner eat poison than let you anywhere near the CFPB .
Have a nice life .
Yours truly ,
A Senior White House Official
#
Two observations about the groundswell of support for Elizabeth Warren to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) authorized in the newly enacted financial reform package : (1) Contrary to the smokescreen raised the other day by Sen.
Chris Dodd , Warren is confirmable -- provided the administration and Senate leadership are serious about getting her confirmed .
Meaning that they actually mean for the CFPB to , as opposed to giving it some low - level funding ( ooh , jobs for cronies ! ) so it can serve as do - nothing cover for one thing we know the administration believes in : business as usual .
That means making a clear and emphatic case for its mission .
In other words , something like this letter sent to the White House today by a group of 12 U.S. senators .
( Apologies for typos .
I had to retype the letter -- I actually thought it was worth the trouble -- from this PDF file .
) A commitment to confirmation of a Warren nomination , and to the successful functioning of the CFPB , also means making sure that senators are forced to go on the record with their objections to the nomination , and understand that for once there will be a price to pay for defending the interests of the country 's economic predators .
One has to suspect that the real concern of the opponents of a Warren CFPB nomination is n't that she would n't be confirmed but that shebe .
(2) I do n't think there 's a chance in hell that Professor Warren will be offered the job .
I thought it was great theater the way Treasury Sec'y " Tiny Tim " Geithner stepped in to squelch those rumors that surfaced suddenly about him working to ensure that she would n't be .
Absolutely untrue , his flak insisted .
The secretary has the highest regard for Professor Warren , and she will definitely be considered for CFPB .
Yeah , right , she 'll be " considered . "
As in : The standard line of people inside and outside the administration preparing for Warrengetting the nod is that while she would be well - qualified , there are many other well - qualified candidates .
Why , to quote Senator Dodd : " That 's not the only potential nominee -- there are many fine nominees . "
But of course we 're never told the names of any of these other " fine nominees , " not even as window dressing , people to be " considered " in the same way that Professor Warren will be .
Sorry , but if the best they can come up with is a stooge like Ass't Treasury Sec'y Michael Barr ( now being said " to have the inside track " ) , maybe we ought to just forget about this whole CFPB thing .
In the most unlikely event that , for political reasons , the administration coughs up Warren 's name as " the one , " I think we can safely take that as a signal that CFPB nullification by other means will be the order of the day .
It should n't be that difficult .
As eight years of the Bush regime demonstrated so convincingly , when government people are determined to prove that they 're incompetent , their success rate is formidable .

In addition to being the birthplace of humanity and the cradle of human civilization , Earth is the only known planet in our Solar System that is capable of sustaining life .
As a terrestrial planet , Earth is located within the Inner Solar System between between Venus and Mars ( which are also terrestrial planets ) .
This place Earth in a prime location with regards to our Sun ’s Habitable Zone .
Earth has a number of nicknames , including the Blue Planet , Gaia , Terra , and “ the world ” – which reflects its centrality to the creation stories of every single human culture that has ever existed .
But the most remarkable thing about our planet is its diversity .
Not only are there an endless array of plants , animals , avians , insects and mammals , but they exist in every terrestrial environment .
So how exactly did Earth come to be the fertile , life - giving place we all know and love ?
Size , Mass , and Orbit :
With a mean radius of 6371 km and a mass of 5.97 ×1024 kg , Earth is the fifth largest and fifth most - massive planet in the Solar System .
In essence , it is the largest terrestrial planet , but is smaller and less massive than any of the gas / ice giants of the Outer Solar System .
And with a mean density of 5.514 g/ cm³ , it is the densest planet in the Solar System .
In terms of its orbit , Earth has a very minor eccentricity ( approx . 0.0167 ) and ranges in its distance from the Sun from 147,095,000 km ( 0.983 AU ) at perihelion to 151,930,000 km ( 1.015 AU ) at aphelion .
This works out to an average distance ( aka. semi-major axis ) of 149,598,261 km , which is the basis of a single Astronomical Unit ( AU ) .
The Earth has an orbital period of 365.25 days , which is the equivalent of 1.000017 Julian years .
This means that every four years ( in what is known as a Leap Year ) , the Earth calendar must include an extra day .
Though technically a full day is considered to be 24 hours long , our planet takes precisely 23h 56 m and 4 s to complete a single sidereal rotation ( 0.997 Earth days ) .
Viewed from the celestial north pole , the motion of Earth and its axial rotation appear counterclockwise .
From the vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth , Earth orbits the Sun in a counterclockwise direction .
Earth ’s axis is tilted 23.439281° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , which is responsible for producing seasonal variations on the planet ’s surface with a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ) .
In addition to producing variations in terms of temperature , this also results in variations in the amount of sunlight a hemisphere receives during the course of a year .
Basically , when the North Pole is pointing towards the Sun , the northern hemisphere experiences summer and the southern hemisphere experiences winter .
During the summer , the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky ; while in winter , the climate becomes generally cooler , the days are shorter and the Sun appears lower in the sky .
Above the Arctic Circle , an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year – up to six months at the North Pole itself , which is known as a “ polar night ” .
In the southern hemisphere , the situation is exactly reversed , with the South Pole experiencing a “ midnight sun ” – i.e. a day of 24 hours .
Earth ’s Structure and Composition :
The shape of Earth approximates that of an oblate spheroid , a sphere flattened along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a bulge around the equator .
This bulge results from the rotation of Earth , and causes the diameter at the equator to be 43 kilometres ( 27 mi ) larger than the pole - to - pole diameter .
Earth ’s interior structure , like that of other terrestrial planets , is differentiated between a metallic core and mantle composed of rock and silicate materials .
However , unlike other terrestrial planets , it has a distinct inner core of solid material and a liquid outer core .
This inner core has an estimated radius of 1,220 km , while the outer core extends beyond it to a radius of about 3,400 km .
Extending outwards from the core are the mantle and the crust .
Earth ’s mantle extends to a depth of 2,890 km , making it the thickest layer of Earth .
This layer is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust .
Although solid , the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales .
The upper layer of the mantle is divided into the lithospheric mantle ( aka. the lithosphere ) and the asthenosphere .
The former consists of the crust and the cold , rigid , top part of the upper mantle ( which the tectonic plates are composed of ) while the asthenosphere is the relatively low - viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides .
The mechanically rigid lithosphere is broken into pieces called tectonic plates .
These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries .
These are known as convergent boundaries , at which two plates come together ; divergent boundaries , at which two plates are pulled apart ; and transform boundaries , in which two plates slide past one another laterally .
Interactions between these plates are what is responsible for earthquakes , volcanic activity ( such as the “ Pacific Ring of Fire “ ) , mountain - building , and oceanic trench formation .
As the tectonic plates migrate across the planet , the ocean floor is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries .
At the same time , the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges .
The combination of these processes continually recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle .
The seven major plates are the Pacific , North American , Eurasian , African , Antarctic , Indo-Australian , and South American .
Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate , the Caribbean Plate , the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean .
Earth ’s Surface Features :
Unlike other planet ’s in our Solar System , the majority of Earth ’s surface is covered in liquid water .
In fact , about 70.8 % of the surface – which works out to 361.132 million km² ( 139.43 million sq mi ) – is covered by water , with much of the continental shelf below sea level .
The remaining 148.94 million km² ( 57.5 million sq mi ) is above sea level .
Whether it is underwater or above sea level , Earth ’s terrain varies greatly from place to place .
The submerged surface has mountainous features , as well as undersea volcanoes , oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains .
The remaining portions of the surface are covered by mountains , deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms .
Over long periods known as geological time , the surface undergoes reshaping due to a combination of tectonic activity and erosion .
Those features that are built up or altered by plate tectonics are subject to steady weathering and erosion from precipitation , flowing water , thermal cycles and chemical effects .
Glaciation , coastal erosion , the build - up of coral reefs , and large meteorite impacts also act to reshape the landscape .
The continental crust is made up of three kind of lower - density rock material – igneous rock , sedimentary rock , and metaphormic rock .
Igneous rock can be subdivided into granite and andesite ( which are the most common ) and basalt , a denser form of volcanic rock that is less common on the surface but accounts for the majority of the ocean floors .
Sedimentary rock , which makes up 75 % of continental surfaces ( though only 5 % of the crust ) , is formed when accumulated sediment is buried and is compacted .
Metaphormic rock is the result of igneos and / or sedimentary rock undergo transformation due to heat and pressure , and go on to form materials like gneiss , slate , marble , schist , and quartzite .
The elevation of the land surface varies from the lowest point of - 418 m ( at the Dead Sea ) to the estimated maximum altitude of 8,848 m at the top of Mount Everest .
The average height of land above sea level is 840 m.
Commonly , the planet is divided between northern and southern hemisphere , though the somewhat arbitrary division between eastern and western hemispheres is also acknowledged .
The Earth ’s land masses are also divided between the seven continents of Africa , Asia , Australia , Europe , North , South America and Antarctica .
The outermost layer of the Earth ’s surface ( known as the pedosphere ) is where soil exists , a combination of minerals and organic compounds .
This layer exists as the interface between the lithosphere , atmosphere , hydrosphere ( all watery surfaces in the world ) and biosphere ( where all terrestrial life exists ) .
The total amount of arable land makes up approximately 13.31 % of the Earth ’s surface , with 4.71 % supporting permanent crops .
Close to 40 % of Earth ’s land is used for cropland and pasture , or an estimated 1.3×107 km2 being used for cropland and 3.4×107 km2 for pastureland .
Earth ’s Atmosphere :
Earth ’s atmosphere is made up of five main layers – the Troposphere , the Stratosphere , the Mesosphere , the Thermosphere , and the Exosphere .
As a rule , air pressure and density decrease the higher one goes into the atmosphere and the farther one is from the surface .
However , the relationship between temperature and altitude is more complicated , and may even rise with altitude in some cases .
Closest to the Earth is the Troposphere , which extends from the 0 to 12 km ( 0 to 7 mi ) above the surface – though this altitude varies depending on latitude , ranging from 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator .
However , for the most part , temperatures decline with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the it is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface .
The troposphere contains roughly 80 % of the mass of Earth ’s atmosphere , with some 50 % located in the lower 5.6 km ( 3.48 mi ) , making it denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers .
It is primarily composed of nitrogen ( 78 % ) and oxygen ( 21 % ) with trace concentrations of water vapor , carbon dioxide , and other gaseous molecules .
Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere , so it is the layer where most of Earth ’s weather takes place .
The Stratosphere extends from 12 to 50 km ( 7 to 31 mi ) and is separated from the Troposphere by the tropopause – a boundary marked in most places by a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one , and in others by a zone where the temperature is constant regardless of altitude .
This layer extends from the top of the troposphere to the stratopause , which is at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km ( 31 to 34 mi ) .
At this altitude , the air pressure is roughly 1/1000th what it is at sea level .
This layer of the atmosphere is home to the ozone layer , which is the part of Earth ’s atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of ozone gas .
The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude , which is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation from the Sun by ozone particles .
This layer of atmosphere is very stable , thanks to a consistent temperature profile .
Hence , this region of the atmosphere is virtually free of weather - producing air turbulence , clouds , or any other forms of weather or weather - producing phenomena .
This is also the highest layer of the atmosphere that can be accessed by jet - powered aircraft .
Next is the Mesosphere , which extends from a distance of 50 to 80 km ( 31 to 50 mi ) above sea level .
Here , temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause , which marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere .
It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature of around - 85 °C ( - 120 °F ; 190 K ) .
The Thermosphere , the second highest layer of the atmosphere , is next to the mesopause .
This layer extends from an altitude of about 80 km ( 50 mi ) up to the thermopause , which is at an altitude of 500 – 1000 km ( 310–620 mi ) .
The lower part of the thermosphere , from 80 to 550 kilometers ( 50 to 342 mi ) , contains the ionosphere – which is so named because it is here in the atmosphere that particles are ionized by solar radiation .
At this level , temperature increases with height .
But unlike the stratosphere , which experience temperature inversion due to the adsorption of UV radiation by ozone , the inversion at this layer is due to the extremely low density of its molecules .
So while temperatures in the thermosphere can rise as high as 1500 °C ( 2700 °F ) , the spacing of the gas molecules means that it would not feel hot to a human who was in direct contact with the air .
This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor .
It is also at this altitude that the phenomena known as Aurora Borealis and Aurara Australis are known to take place .
The International Space Station also orbits in this layer , between 320 and 380 km ( 200 and 240 mi ) .
The Exosphere , which is outermost layer of the Earth ’s atmosphere , extends from the exobase – located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level – to about 10,000 km ( 6,200 mi ) .
The exosphere merges with the emptiness of outer space , where there is no atmosphere .
This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen , helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen , oxygen and carbon dioxide ( which are closer to the exobase ) .
The atoms and molecules are so far apart that the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas and the particles constantly escape into space .
These free - moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or with the solar wind .
The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible .
However , the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere , where they overlap into the thermosphere .
The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth .
Earth ’s Average Temperature :
The average temperature on the surface of Earth depends on a number of factors .
These include the time of day , the time of year , and where the temperatures measurements are being taken .
Given that the Earth experiences a sidereal rotation of approximately 24 hours – which means one side is never always facing towards the Sun – temperatures rise in the day and drop in the evening , sometimes substantially .
And given that Earth has an inclined axis ( approximately 23.4° towards the Sun ’s equator ) , the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of Earth are either tilted towards or away from the Sun during the summer and winter seasons , respectively .
And given that equatorial regions of the Earth are closer to the Sun , and certain parts of the world experience more sunlight and less cloud cover , temperatures range widely across the planet .
However , not every region on the planet experiences four seasons .
At the equator , the temperature is on average higher and the region does not experience cold and hot seasons in the same way the Northern and Southern Hemispheres do .
This is because the amount of sunlight the reaches the equator changes very little during the course of the year .
The average surface temperature on Earth is approximately 14°C ; but as already noted , this varies .
For instance , the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 70.7 °C ( 159 °F ) , which was taken in the Lut Desert of Iran .
These measurements were part of a global temperature survey conducted by scientists at NASA ’s Earth Observatory during the summers of 2003 to 2009 .
For five of the seven years surveyed ( 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , and 2009 ) the Lut Desert was the hottest spot on Earth .
However , it was not the hottest spot for every single year in the survey .
In 2003 , the satellites recorded a temperature of 69.3 °C ( 156.7 °F ) – the second highest in the seven - year analysis – in the shrublands of Queensland , Australia .
And in 2008 , a yearly maximum temperature of 66.8 °C ( 152.2 °F ) recorded on the Flaming Mountain , located near the Turpan Basin in western China .
Meanwhile , the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was measured at the Soviet Vostok Station on the Antarctic Plateau .
Using ground - based measurements , temperatures reached an historic low of - 89.2 °C ( - 129 °F ) on July 21st , 1983 .
Analysis of satellite data indicated a probable temperature of around - 93.2 °C ( - 135.8 °F ; 180.0 K ) on August 10th , 2010 , also in Antarctica .
However , this reading was not confirmed by ground measurements , and thus the previous record stands .
All of these measurements were based on temperature readings that were performed in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization standard .
By these regulations , air temperature is measured out of direct sunlight – because the materials in and around the thermometer can absorb radiation and affect the sensing of heat – and thermometers are to be situated 1.2 to 2 meters off the ground .
The Moon and Near - Earth Asteroids :
Earth has only one orbiting satellite , The Moon .
It ’s existence has been known of since prehistoric times , and it has played a major role in the mythological and astronomical traditions of all human cultures .
A number of cultures saw it as a deity while others believed that its movements and phenomena associated with it could help predict worldly events .
In the modern era , the Moon has continued to serve as a focal point for astronomical and scientific research , as well as space exploration .
In fact , the Moon is the only celestial body outside of Earth that humans have actually walked on .
The first Moon landing took place on July 20th , 1969 , and Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the surface .
Since that time , a total of 13 astronauts have been to the Moon , and the research that they carried out has been instrumental in helping us to learn about its composition and formation .
Thanks to examinations of Moon rocks that were brought back to Earth , the predominant theory states that the Moon was created roughly 4.5 billion years ago from a collision between Earth and a Mars - sized object ( known as Theia ) .
This collision created a massive cloud of debris that began circling our planet , which eventually coalesced to form the Moon we see today .
The Moon is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System and is the second - densest satellite of those whose densities are known ( after Jupiter ’s satellite Io ) .
It is also tidally locked with Earth , meaning that one side is constantly facing towards us while the other is facing away .
The far side , known as the “ Dark Side ” , remained unknown to humans until probes were sent to photograph it .
Though the Moon is fairly large for a satellite , it is significantly smaller than our own planet .
Its diameter , at 3,474.8 km , is one - fourth the diameter of Earth .
But at 7.3477 × 1022 kg , its mass is only 1.2 % of the Earth ’s mass .
It ’s mean density of 3.3464 g/cm3 is also surprisingly low , being equivalent to roughly 0.6 that of Earth .
Its gravity is only about 17 % of the Earth ’s gravity .
Given the differences between the Moon ’s size , mass , and density , its gravity is only about 17 % of the Earth’s .
The Moon also has a significant affect on the tides here on Earth .
Basically , sea levels rise and fall in response to the presence of the Moon ’s gravity , and this impact is amplified by factors in the Earth ’s oceans .
In short , whichever hemisphere is facing towards the moon will experience high tide , while the hemisphere facing away will experience low tide .
Another common feature caused by the Moon ’s orbit are eclipses .
There are two types – a lunar eclipse , and a solar eclipse .
A lunar eclipse occurs where the Moon passes into the shadow of the Earth and becomes darkened , whereas a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun and the Moon blocks out ( aka. “ occults ” ) the Sun , either partially or fully .
Much like Mercury , the Moon has a tenuous atmosphere ( known as an exosphere ) , which results in severe temperature variations .
These range from - 153 °C to 107°C on average , though temperatures as low as - 249 °C have been recorded .
Measurements from NASA ’s LADEE have mission determined the exosphere is mostly made up of helium , neon and argon .
The helium and neon are the result of solar wind while the argon comes from the natural , radioactive decay of potassium in the Moon ’s interior .
There is also evidence of frozen water existing in permanently shadowed craters , and potentially below the soil itself .
The water may have been blown in by the solar wind or deposited by comets .
The surface of the Moon is divided into different types of terrain .
Maria are the flat plains , which is Latin for “ seas ” , since ancient astronomers thought they were actual seas filled with water .
Terre ( “ Earth ” ) refers to the highlands , which appear lighter colored because they are closer to our own planet .
There are also numerous mountainous regions on the Moon , and the surface is marred by many craters that are a result of impact by asteroids and other space debris .
Earth also has at least five co-orbital asteroids ( aka. Near - Earth Asteroids ) , including 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29 .
A trojan asteroid companion , 2010 TK7 , is oscillating around the leading Lagrange triangular point ( L4 ) in the Earth ’s orbit around the Sun .
The tiny near - Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years .
During these approaches , it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time .
As of March 2015 , there were also 1,265 artificial orbiting Earth , consisting of telecommunication , research , military , and global positioning satellites ( GPS ) .
There are also inoperative satellites , including Vanguard 1 – the oldest satellite currently in orbit – and over 300,000 pieces of space debris .
Earth ’s largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station .
Earth ’s Formation and Evolution :
Since the 18th century , the scientific consensus has been that the Earth and the entire Solar System was formed out of a cloud of nebulous material ( aka . “ Nebula Theory “ ) .
According to this theory , roughly 4.6 billion years ago , the entire Solar System was a circumstellar disk made up of gas , ice grains and dust .
In time , most of this matter accumulated in the center and underwent a gravitational collapse , forming the Sun .
The rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets , moons , asteroids , and other small Solar System bodies were formed .
By 4.54 billion years ago , the primordial Earth had formed .
By 4.53 billion years ago , the Moon was formed by the accretion of material that was thrown into orbit by a collision between the Earth and the Mars - sized object named Theia ( see above ) .
Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon , and by inference , to Earth .
Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies .
However , between 4.0 and 2.5 billion years ago , the outer layer of the planet had cooled enough to form a solid crust with tectonic plates .
Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere , and condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years , continents formed and broke apart .
They migrated across the surface , occasionally combining to form a supercontinent .
Roughly , the earliest - known supercontinent Rodinia began to break apart .
The continents later recombined to form Pannotia ( and then finally Pangaea – the last supercontinent , which broke apart .
The present pattern of ice ages began about , then intensified at the end of the Pliocene ( ~2.58 million years ago ) .
The polar regions have since undergone recurring cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000 – 100,000 years .
The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago .
The first signs of life are believed to have emerged 4 billion years ago during the early Archean Eon .
This began with the formation of self - replicating molecules produced by highly energetic chemical reactions .
The development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun ’s energy to be harvested directly by life forms , and the resultant molecular oxygen ( O² ) accumulated in the atmosphere and interacted with ultraviolet solar radiation to form a protective ozone ( O³ ) layer in the upper atmosphere .
Thanks to the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer , true multi-cellular organisms ( consisting of cells of increasing specialization and complexity ) began to proliferate .
The earliest fossil evidence for life indicates that it existed in microbial form between 3.7 and 3.48 billion years ago .
During the Neoproterozoic , between 750 and 580 million years ago , severe glacial action covered much of the Earth in ice – aka .
the “ Snowball Earth ” hypothesis .
This was followed by the Cambrian Explosion , an event which took place during the Cambrian Period ( 541 – 485.4 million years ago ) when multicellular life forms began to proliferate .
Following the Cambrian explosion , about 535 million years ago , there have been five major mass extinctions .
The most recent such event – known as the Cretaceous - Paleogene Extinction Event – took place 66 million years ago when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles , but spared some small animals such as mammals .
Over the past 66 million years , mammalian life has diversified immensely .
And several million years ago , an African ape - like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright .
This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain , which allowed for the evolution of the human race .
The development of agriculture , and then civilization , led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms as no other species ever has .
In the past 100,000 years , humanity has settled every continent of the world ( except for Antarctica ) and become the dominant force for change , leading many geologists to informally designated the current era as “ Anthropocene “ .
Earth ’s Habitability :
Any planet which boasts conditions that are amenable to the existence of life is deemed as being habitable .
At present , Earth is the only known planet that is capable of supporting life .
By studying Earth ’s climate , ecosystems , and the diverse nature of organisms that exist here , scientists have learned much about what conditions are needed in order for life to both develop and flourish in a planetary environment .
For one , a planet needs to have liquid water on its surface – i.e. an environment where complex molecules can assemble and interact .
Second , it needs to be able to receive sufficient energy from its parent star in order to sustain metabolism .
Third , it needs to be able to maintain an atmosphere that will shield organic life from harmful solar radiation .
Earth ’s distance from our Sun , which places it inside it ’s “ Goldilocks Zone ” ( aka . “ Habitable Zone ” ) , ensures that it is neither too hot or cold .
It is thus able to maintain liquid water on its surface , and its atmosphere ( and magnetosphere ) protect it from harmful radiation and solar rays .
It ’s orbital eccentricity , rate of rotation , axial tilt , and geological history , all contribute to the current climatic conditions that contribute to the existence of life .
Venus , being on the inner edge of the Sun ’s habitable zone , is subject to a runaway greenhouse effect , where atmospheric pressure is too intense , and the concentrations of greenhouse gases and extreme heat make it hostile to life .
Mars , sitting on the outer edge of the zone , is too cold and has an atmosphere that is too thin to support life .
While scientists are certain that Mars once had an atmosphere and warm , flowing water on its surface , this period ended an estimated 3.8 billion years ago .
History of Study :
Since ancient times , human beings have sought to explain the creation of Earth , the universe , and all life .
The earliest known cases were unscientific in nature – taking the form of creation myths or religious fables involving the gods .
However , between classical antiquity and the medieval period , several theories emerged about the origin of the Earth , its true shape , and its place in the cosmos .
To many ancient cultures , the Earth was personified as a deity – often as a “ mother goddess ” that was associated with fertility .
Hence why many creation myths begin with a story in which the creation of the world involved an act of celestial procreation , where a goddess gave birth to all life .
To the Aztecs , Earth was known as Tonantzin ( “ our mother ” ) , while the Incas referred to it as Pachamama ( “ mother Earth ” ) .
To the Chinese , Earth was associated with the goddess Hou Tu , which was similar to the Hindu Bhuma Devi and the Greek Gaia – a goddess personifying Earth .
In Norse mythology , the Earth giantess Jörð was the mother of Thor and the daughter of Annar .
In ancient Egyptian mythology , Earth was seen as male ( Geb ) , while the sky was seen as female ( Nut ) .
Theories as to the Earth ’s physical form tended towards the view of it being flat in ancient times .
This was the view in the Mesopotamian culture , where the world was portrayed as a flat disk afloat in an ocean .
To the Mayans , the world was flat , and at it corners , four jaguars ( known as bacabs ) held up the sky .
The ancient Persians speculated that the Earth was a seven - layered ziggurat ( or cosmic mountain ) , while the Chinese viewed it as a four - side cube .
By the 6th century BCE , Greek philosophers began to speculate that the Earth was in fact round .
While Pythagoras is generally credited with this theory , it equally likely that it emerged on its own as a result of travel between Greek settlements – specifically from variations in visible altitudes and the change in the area of circumpolar stars .
By the 3rd century BCE , the idea of a spherical Earth began to become articulated as a scientific matter .
By measuring the angle cast by shadows in different geographical locations , Eratosthenes – a Greek astronomer from Hellenistic Libya ( 276–194 BCE ) – was able to estimated Earth ’s circumference within a 5 % – 15 % margin of error .
With the rise of the Roman Empire and their adoption of Hellenistic astronomy , the view of a spherical Earth became widespread throughout the Mediterranean and Europe .
This knowledge was preserved thanks to the monastic tradition and Scholasticism during the Middle Ages ; however , astronomers continued to view the Earth as the center of the universe well into the 16th and 17th centuries .
The development of a geological view of Earth also emerged during Classical Antiquity .
During the 4th century BCE , Aristotle observed the composition of the land and theorized that the Earth changes at a slow rate , and that these changes cannot be observed during a person ’s lifetime .
This was the first evidence - based concept of geological time and the rate at which physical change happens on Earth .
In the 1st century CE , Pliny the Elder produced an extensive discussion of minerals and metals .
In addition to properly identifying the origin of amber as a fossilized resin , based on the observations of insects trapped within some pieces , he also laid the basis of crystallography by recognizing the habit of diamonds to form into octahedrons .
By the early 11th century , The Persian astronomer and scholar Abu al - Rayhan al - Biruni conducted the first recorded study on the geology of India .
In his encyclopedic work on India , entitled “ Tarikh Al - Hind ” ( History of India ) , he hypothesized that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea .
The Persian polymath Ibn Sina ( Avicenna , 981- 1037 CE ) , also made significant contributions with his work “ Kitab al - Shifa ” ( the Book of Cure , Healing or Remedy from ignorance ) .
In this , he indicated a connection between mountains and the formation of clouds , theorized about the origins of water and earthquakes , the formation of minerals , and the diversity of Earth ’s terrain .
The Chinese naturalist and polymath Shen Kuo ( 1031 - 1095 ) was one of the first naturalists to formulate a theory of geomorphology .
Based on his observations of the presence of marine fossils in mountains far from the sea , and petrified bamboo in dry regions and underground , he theorized that the land was formed by erosion and the deposition of silt , and worked on a very long timescale .
During the 16th century , our understanding of planet Earth and its place in the universe advanced significantly thanks to two major developments .
The first was Nicolaus Copernicus ‘ model of a heliocentric universe , in which the Earth and all the other planets revolved around the Sun .
The second was the invention of the telescope , which allowed astronomers like Galileo to observe the Moon , the Sun , and the other Solar planets .
By the 17th century , the term geology began to enter usage among scientists .
There are two theories as to who coined the term , with one claiming it was Ulisse Aldrovandi ( 1522 – 1605 ) – an Italian naturalist – that made the first recorded use of the word .
The second credits Mikkel Pederson Escholt ( 1600 – 1699 ) , a Norwegian priest and scholar , who used the definition in his book 1657 work on Norway ’s geography ( “ Geologica Norvegica ” ) .
It was also during the 17th century that fossil evidence began to trigger a widespread debate about the true age of the Earth .
During this time , theologians and scientists had been at odds about the age of the world , with the former insisting that it was 6,000 years old ( based upon the Bible ) , while the latter believed it to be much older .
However , the debate would soon be resolved in favor of the latter .
James Hutton , who is often viewed as the first modern geologist , is credited with ending the debate through the publications of paper titled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785 .
In this paper , he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than previously thought in order to allow enough time for mountains to erode and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land .
During the 18th century , opinion was divided between those who believed that rocks were deposited by the oceans during flooding events , and those that believed they were formed through heat and fire .
In a two - volume study of his paper published in 1795 , Hutton advanced the idea that some rocks are formed by volcanic heat while others are formed by sedimentation .
These processes , he claimed , are ongoing and work over very long , very gradual time periods .
By the 19th century , the first geological maps were being made of the U.S. and Great Britain .
And in 1830 , Sir Charles Lyell , who had been influenced by Charles Darwin ’s theories regarding species evolution , published his famous book Principles of Geology .
In it , he stated that the geological processes have occurred throughout Earth ’s history and were still occurring today – a doctrine known as “ Uniformitarianism ” .
By the 20th century , the advent of radiometric dating allowed Earth ’s age to be estimated at two billion years .
Prior to this , geologists were divided over the exact age of Earth , with some believing it to be in the hundreds of millions of years , while others believed it to be in the billions .
This new awareness of geological time scales not only shattered the myths of creationism , but also expanded our view of cosmic time scales as well .
Two of the most significant advances in 20th - century geology were the development of the theory of plate tectonics ( 1960s ) and the refinement of estimates of the planet ’s age – both of which revolutionized the Earth sciences .
Today the Earth is known to be approximately 4.5 billion years old , and that its evolution has been subject to many catastrophic changes over the eons .
Earth ’s Future :
Earth ’s long - term future is closely tied to that of the Sun , and estimates on how much longer it will be able to support life range from 500 million to 2.3 billion years .
As a result of the steady accumulation of helium at the Sun ’s core , the Sun ’s total luminosity will slowly increase .
Over the next 1.1 billion years , it ’s luminosity will grow by 10 % , followed by a 40 % increase 3.5 billion years from now .
This will result in a serious shift in Earth ’s habitable zone , as the increased radiation will have a dire effect on life and lead to the loss of the oceans .
In 500-900 million years , increased surface temperatures will accelerate the inorganic CO² cycle , reducing it to lethally low levels for plants .
This will lead a lack of vegetation , followed by a loss of oxygen in the atmosphere , triggering a cycle of extinction over the course of several million years .
Within 1 billion years , all water will be gone and the average surface temperature will reach 70 °C ( 158 °F ) .
Earth is expected to be effectively habitable for about another 500 million years from this point , although this may be extended up to 2.3
Ga if the nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere .
By 5 billion years from now , the Sun will become a red giant , expanding to 250 times to a radius of roughly 1 AU ( 150 million km ) .
In this scenario , Earth will move to an orbit of 1.7 AU ( 250 million km ) from the Sun , will escape envelopment , but will also be rendered completely uninhabitable .
However , other simulations suggest that in time , Earth ’s orbit will decay , it will fall into the Sun and be vaporized .
Given the immense time scales involved with Earth ’s formation , evolution , and eventual destruction , humanity is little more than a very recent development – a proverbial “ flash in the pan ” , if you will .
Nevertheless , given that it is where all terrestrial life as we know it originated , coupled with the fact that it is the only habitable planet known to us , Earth is likely to remain our spiritual and physical home for many eons to come .
One can only hope that by the time it does become uninhabitable , we will have long since gone extinct , or evolved to the point that we no longer have to worry about dying along with it .
And in the meantime , we can only hope that our presence here on Earth does n’t ruin it .
We have many interesting articles about Earth here at Universe Today .
Below is a list that covers the many different aspects of our planet and what we ’ve come to know about .
We hope you find what you are looking for :

For all the reforms in the NHS White Paper , the one defining policy of the government towards the health service is the ring - fencing of its budget .
Image caption The Tories pledged to ring - fence health and international aid spending
Of course the NHS will not be a cuts - free zone - it is expected to find efficiencies of £ 20bn by 2014 - but as other government departments groan and stagger under whopping great cuts of up to 40 % , the NHS will enjoy real terms increases in spending .
It is for David Cameron , seemingly , a non-negotiable policy , one designed to reassure sceptical voters that the health service is safe in Tory hands .
And yet privately many Tories think it is daft and should be dropped .
' Business as usual '
How , they argue , can the government get to grips with the deficit if the second biggest spending department , with a great hulking budget of more than a £ 100bn which employs a quarter of all public sector workers , does not have to bear its share of the pain .
Indeed , given the health service enjoyed a three - fold increase in spending under Labour , disgruntled Tories believe there must be much more fat to cut in the NHS than in other leaner , more efficient areas of government .
Not surprisingly , ministers in other departments are also not huge fans of a NHS ring - fence that forces them to take a chainsaw to some of their own treasured spending projects .
But it is not just about the money .
It is also about the reform agenda .
So , muse Tory MPs , if it proves impossible to find the necessary savings in other departments and the markets get restless then perhaps Nick Clegg could be encouraged to tell Mr Cameron it is time to re-visit ring - fencing Norman Smith GPs ' to get control of NHS funds '
How do you encourage innovation and change in the health service if you have already guaranteed NHS managers extra money for just carrying on as normal ?
Even some health service experts , like the former head of NHS London Sir Richard Sykes , are critical , warning it will lead to " business as usual - thank you very much ! " .
And yet for all this unhappiness few Tories are willing to go public with their misgivings for fear it would be interpreted as an attack on Mr Cameron .
They have , however , not entirely given up hope of getting rid of the ring - fence .
Or rather they are hoping their Lib Dem partners might be able to do the job for them .
The Lib Dems , it is noted , have always been highly critical of the policy .
Before the election Vince Cable said : " There can be no ring - fencing if we are serious about getting the public finances back on track . "
Greek crisis
So , muse Tory MPs , if it proves impossible to find the necessary savings in other departments and the markets get restless then perhaps Nick Clegg could be encouraged to tell Mr Cameron it is time to revisit ring - fencing .
After all , Mr Clegg has taken a big hit on VAT .
Perhaps Mr Cameron , for the good of the coalition , should be prepared to do the same on the NHS .
And anyway , if the markets scent the deficit reduction plan is not delivering , then maybe Mr Cameron will have no option but to cut NHS spending if he wants to avoid a bit of Greek - style financial surgery .
More cautious Tories say the NHS pledge is too important to Mr Cameron .
For him it is an issue of trust .
They say he believes that the electorate would not forgive him if he broke the ring - fence promise .
But then again , argue Tory critics of the policy , could n't Mr Cameron just say that the financial situation was much worse than he thought ; that Labour have left the cupboard bare and the City are threatening higher interest rates unless the deficit is brought down faster ?
And , oh yes , could n't the prime minister say : " We 're all in this together ? "
Marcia Angell documents how drug companies have corrupted the integrity of drug research , medical education and clinical practice .
Anyone who works in clinical medical practice is keenly aware of Big Pharma ’s relentless and intrusive marketing practices .
You ca n’t avoid it .
The pens , notepads and schwag plastered with the brand - name anti-depressants .
The ubiquitous “ detail ” salespeople who schmooze up doctors and shower them with free samples .
The physician junkets to exotic resorts to hear “ educational ” lectures by esteemed leaders of the field .
I know all this .
What I did n’t realize was how thoroughly drug marketers have corrupted academic medicine — the research at medical centers , the education of new doctors at medical schools , and daily clinical practice .
In the May - June issue of the Boston Review , Marcia Angell , the former Editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , documents in devastating detail how the drug industry has insinuated itself into every imaginable nook and cranny of academic medicine in order to sell its drugs .
The best indication of its success is the invisibility of the marketing .
The sales propaganda has gotten so effective that it is brilliantly disguised as high - minded “ education . ”
Marketing has become a normative part of medical education , research and practice .
In her sober , understated indictment , Angell , Senior Lecturer in Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of The Truth About the Drug Companies , writes :
The boundaries between academic medicine — medical schools , teaching hospitals , and their faculty — and the pharmaceutical industry have been dissolving since the 1980s , and the important differences between their missions are becoming blurred .
Medical research , education , and clinical practice have suffered as a result .
Academic medical centers are charged with educating the next generation of doctors , conducting scientifically important research , and taking care of the sickest and neediest patients .
That ’s what justifies their tax - exempt status .
In contrast , drug companies — like other investor - owned businesses — are charged with increasing the value of their shareholders ’ stock .
That is their fiduciary responsibility , and they would be remiss if they did n’t uphold it .
All their other activities are means to that end .
The companies are supposed to develop profitable drugs , not necessarily important or innovative ones , and paradoxically enough , the most profitable drugs are the least innovative .
Nor do drug companies aim to educate doctors , except as a means to the primary end of selling drugs .
Drug companies do n’t have education budgets ; they have marketing budgets from which their ostensibly educational activities are funded .
This profound difference in missions is often deliberately obscured — by drug companies because it ’s good public relations to portray themselves as research and educational institutions , and by academics because it means they do n’t have to face up to what ’s really going on .
Angell ’s essay marshals a considerable amount of empirical research to make her case .
And while not all of the charges are new or shocking , the steady accretion of facts makes a powerful case that academic medicine has willingly surrendered its integrity and independence to the drug industry — with troubling consequences for the safety and scientific merit of many drugs and types of medical treatment .
Angell notes how medical centers and med schools have joined hands with the drug industry at numerous points — in striking up research partnerships , in sitting on companies ’ boards of directors , in offering up clinical facilities for drug trials , in sitting on advisory boards .
These incestuous relationships not only affect how research is shaped — what questions are asked and how research projects are designed and published ; they also affect how medicine is practiced .
Academics with paid ties to the industry play influential roles in writing practice guidelines that professional and governmental bodies issue , and they participate in numerous FDA deliberations .
Thanks to the Bayh - Dole Act enacted in 1980 , the drug industry no longer has to do its own early - stage drug development research .
It can rely upon federally funded university research , which we taxpayers finance .
Then , if a promising drug compound is discovered , the drug companies can swoop in late in the game to do the final stages of development and acquire exclusive rights to the drug .
Less risk , lower costs .
Or drug companies can produce trivial variations on established , top - selling drugs — the “ me - too ” drugs — which can be highly lucrative but therapeutically trivial .
Like most Boston Review cover stories , this one is part of a forum that solicits reactions from a variety of commentators .
One respondent , Adriane Fugh - Berman , elaborates in great detail how continuing medical education courses serve as a prime channel for pharmaceutical marketing :
Industry - paid speakers frequently deny espousing marketing messages .
I ’ve heard many physicians justify their pharma - funded speaking gigs by saying , “ I never emphasize their product ” or , triumphantly , “ I do n’t even mention their drug ! ”
But these comments only highlight their sales skills .
Pharma does n’t hire doctors to sell drugs ; that ’s a drug rep ’s job .
Pharma hires physicians to sell diseases .
The process of selling what industry calls a disease state begins many years before a drug is submitted to the FDA for approval .
Specific marketing messages for a product may be developed seven to ten years before a drug goes on sale .
Pre-approval marketing messages assigned to opinion leaders might emphasize the under - diagnosis of a targeted condition , stress the serious consequences of delayed treatment , or trumpet the importance of a new receptor or novel mechanism of action .
I am one of the commentators , too , in an essay called Restore Medicine to the Commons .
I make the case that we must develop a larger analysis of how academic medicine “ creates value ” in ways that commercial enterprises cannot .
Why is it important that medical research , education , and clinical practice be independent of the marketplace ?
An excerpt from my essay :
Vast swaths of medical knowledge and practice , too , have been privatized and monetized — patents for common medical procedures , one - fifth of the human genome , artificially created life forms , and much else .
It should come as no surprise that professional practices and norms have been similarly warped to serve market ends .
Much of this transformation has occurred in incremental , deliberately obscure ways .
Angell has performed a great public service in making this transformation more explicit and comprehensible .
In so doing , she has helped us to see the unmet challenge within academic medicine : to name and reclaim its moral sovereignty over the vital functions that it , and only it , can perform .
I will not presume to suggest how specific reform should be pursued .
But I do believe that , whatever paths are taken , academic medicine must assert the value of its independence from market forces .
Otherwise its moral stature and expertise will have no foundation .
Marcia Angell has performed a great public service in showing just how far the trustworthiness and integrity of academic medicine have been compromised .
The unanswered question is , From whence will the leadership for reform arise when so many aspects of academic medicine are already profoundly compromised ?
Image caption Josh Dubovie could only manage 10 points for the UK
Germany has emerged triumphant at this year 's Eurovision Song Contest as the UK limped home in last place .
Teenager Josh Dubovie , representing the UK with a song penned by Pete Waterman , scored just 10 points .
Speaking after her win , 19 - year - old Lena , who scored 246 points with her song Satellite , said : " I 'm so happy and so thankful and so grateful . "
Acts from 25 countries took to the stage during the event , hoping to impress voters from across Europe .
Turkey 's MaNga came in second place , with Romania third and Denmark fourth .
Belarus had been trailing in last place for most of the voting until the final marks saw it overtake the UK .
This is the third time the UK has finished in the bottom spot in the past eight years , following on from the dismal performances of Andy Abraham in 2008 and Jemini in 2003 .
Bookmakers had made Azerbaijan favourite to win this year 's contest .
Their chosen act , Safura , was the first contestant to perform on Saturday 's show with her song Drip Drop .
Organisers allowed Spain 's Daniel Diges to perform twice during the event after a fan disrupted his first performance by jumping on stage .
Ireland 's Niamh Kavanagh had been hoping to repeat her winning performance of 1993 , but finished in the bottom half of the scoreboard with It 's For You .
It 's about time Scotland had its own entry to the song contest .
Gerasimov Read your comments Eurovision loser ' still smiling '
It is only the second time in the 55 - year history of Eurovision that Germany has won , after Nicole 's A Little Peace in 1982 .
Speaking after the show , Lena said she was " shocked " by her victory .
" I think it 's unreal , " she said .
" This is such a big thing that I 'm just completely freaking out ! "
More than 125 million watched last year 's competition in Moscow , when Norwegian violinist Alexander Rybak took home the trophy with a record 387 points .
The economic downturn has hit this year hard , though , with several countries having to pull out of the event because they could not afford to take part .
Dubovie 's song That Sounds Good to Me was written by Pete Waterman and Mike Stock , best known for churning out hits for the likes of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan in the 1980s .
Speaking to the BBC earlier this week , Waterman admitted it was " highly unlikely " the UK would win this year 's competition .
However , he added : " There is always an outside chance that something bizarre might happen . "
Dubovie was chosen to represent the UK after securing the most public votes on Your Country Needs You ! on BBC One in March .
Is breast milk so different from infant formula ?
The ability to track which genes are operating in an infant 's intestine has allowed University of Illinois scientists to compare the early development of breast - fed and formula - fed babies .
They say the difference is very real .
" For the first time , we can see that breast milk induces genetic pathways that are quite different from those in formula - fed infants .
Although formula makers have tried to develop a product that 's as much like breast milk as possible , hundreds of genes were expressed differently in the breast - fed and formula - fed groups , " said Sharon Donovan , a U of I professor of nutrition .
Although both breast - fed and formula - fed babies gain weight and seem to develop similarly , scientists have known for a long time that breast milk contains immune - protective components that make a breast - fed infant 's risk lower for all kinds of illnesses , she said .
" The intestinal tract of the newborn undergoes marked changes in response to feeding .
And the response to human milk exceeds that of formula , suggesting that the bioactive components in breast milk are important in this response , " she noted .
" What we have n't known is how breast milk protects the infant and particularly how it regulates the development of the intestine , " she said .
Understanding those differences should help formula makers develop a product that is more like the real thing , she said .
The scientists hope to develop a signature gene or group of genes to use as a biomarker for breast - fed infants .

Many of the differences found by the scientists were in fundamental genes that regulate the development of the intestine and provide immune defense for the infant .
In this small proof - of - concept study , Donovan used a new technique patented by Texas A&M colleague Robert Chapkin to examine intestinal gene expression in 22 healthy infants -- 12 breast - fed , 10 formula - fed .
The technique involved isolating intestinal cells shed in the infants ' stools , then comparing the expression of different genes between the two groups .
Mothers in the study collected fecal samples from their babies at one , two , and three months of age .
Scientists were then able to isolate high - quality genetic material , focusing on the RNA to get a gene expression or signature .
Donovan said that intestinal cells turn over completely every three days as billions of cells are made , perform their function , and are exfoliated .
Examining the shed cells is a noninvasive way to examine intestinal health and see how nutrition affects intestinal development in infants .
Understanding early intestinal development is important for many reasons , she said .

" An infant 's gut has to adapt very quickly .
A new baby is coming out of a sterile environment , having received all its nutrients intravenously through the placenta .
At that point , babies obviously must begin eating , either mother 's milk or formula .
" They also start to become colonized with bacteria , so it 's very important that the gut learns what 's good and what 's bad .
The baby 's body needs to be able to recognize a bad bacteria or a bad virus and fight it , but it also needs to recognize that even though a food protein is foreign , that protein is okay and the body does n't want to develop an immune response to it , " she said .
If anything goes wrong at this stage , babies can develop food allergies , inflammatory bowel disease , and even asthma .
" We 're very interested in frequent sampling at this early period of development , " she added .
Donovan also would like to learn how bacteria in the gut differ in formula - and breast - fed babies , and this technique should make that possible .
" Now we 'll be able to get a complete picture of what 's happening in an infant -- from the composition of the diet to the microbes in the gut and the genes that are activated along the way . "
Of potential clinical importance :
The gene expressed most often in breast - fed infants is involved in the cell 's response to oxygen deprivation .
Lack of oxygen is a factor in the development of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , a kind of gangrene of the intestine that can be fatal in premature babies .
NEC is a leading cause of disease and death in neonatal intensive care units , with a reported 2,500 cases occurring annually in the United States and a mortality rate of 26 percent .
The study will appear in the June 2010 issue of the American Journal of Physiology , Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology .
Co-authors are Robert S. Chapkin , Chen Zhao , Ivan Ivanov , Laurie A. Davidson , Jennifer S. Goldsby , Joanne R. Lupton , and Edward R. Dougherty , all of Texas A&M University , Rose Ann Mathai and Marcia H. Monaco of the U of I , and Deshanie Rai and W. Michael Russell of Mead Johnson Nutrition .

David Finch Launches Batman : The Dark Knight in November
Finch Will Be the Writer and Artist of the New Ongoing Series
Since signing an exclusive contract with DC Comics , David Finch has been drawing beautiful covers for Brightest Day , Action Comics and Batman # 700 , along with some interior pages .
In November , we 'll finally see David Finch as the artist of an ongoing DC Series .
And he 'll write it !
And it 's a Batman book !
The story kicks off in October with the Grant Morrison written and Finch penciled Batman : The Return .
The one - shot will lead into the first issue of Finch 's new series , Batman : The Dark Knight , which will be inked by Scott Williams .
On DC Comics : The Source blog Finch spoke about the new book :
“ I ’ve made no secret of the fact that I ’ve wanted to draw Batman for a very , very long time .
Batman and his world embody everything that I love about Superhero comics , and I could not be happier that I ’ve gotten this opportunity !
Maybe the greatest thing about Batman is his versatility as a character .
He can be so many things to so many people .
For me though , the Neal Adams , Denny O’Neil issues from the early 70 ’s are the most definitive .
That work casts a very long shadow over every Batman book that has come out since , and I think its a testament to it ’s strength that close to 40 years later it remains modern and vital .
Batman is at his best with his hands dirty , chasing the worst of the worst with everything on the line .
He ’s a detective , first and foremost .
But he ’s also the enforcer .
Nobody gets away with crime under Batman ’s watch , and he makes sure they think twice before they step over the line again .
The Dark Knight takes Batman outside what he knows , into a world of demonology , dark arts , and mystery .
He ’s the ultimate detective , faster , stronger and smarter than any villian , but now he faces creatures to whom logic and mortality do n’t apply .
I want Dark Knight to be true to Batman ’s street level , crime fighter roots .
He ’ll face a rogues gallery that we ’re all familiar with , but this book will take him on a darker path where he ’ll be stretched to his physical and psychological limits . ”

Hatch pleads for his job and proves he will say anything to avoid Bennett ’s fate :
Tea Party members I know by and large are good , honest , decent people , but out of anger should not disrupt the few GOP [ candidates ] who can win , he said .
He said the Republicans need to organize and pull together just as unions , environmentalists , personal injury lawyers and gay rights activists do for Democrat [ sic ] candidates .
Gays and lesbians dont pay tithing , their religion is politics , said Hatch .
Almost as funny as that time Orrin pretended to be a Washington outsider .
I ’m guessing it ’s a calculated ploy by Orrin to attract the ire of the Utah LGBT community so that he can then put on a show playing the martyr for the Tea Party crowd , but I do n’t think it ’s gonna work .
It ’s such a clumsy insult that all it ’s going to trigger is a bunch of eye - rolling now and more schadenfreude later when Orrin gets the boot from the same folks he ’s trying so hard to impress with his playground taunts .
By the way , so far , this has been my favorite response to Hatch ’s nonsense :
Hatching falsehood … I saw today that Sen. Orrin Hatch recently told a crowd at Dixie State College in St. George , Utah , “ Gays and lesbians do n’t pay tithing , their religion is politics . ”
That ’s just false .
According to a 2009 survey by the Barna Group , 60 % of gay adults say faith is “ very important ” in their lives .
The study also found that gay and lesbian Americans are less likely to be registered to vote than heterosexuals .
I suppose one ca n’t fault Sen .
Hatch for not having Barna ’s data at his fingertips , but if he cared to understand the role faith plays in the lives of LGBT Americans instead of just spouting false stereotypes , he ’d find gay and lesbian people of faith in diverse congregations across the country .
He would n’t have to go very far , either .
Sen .
Hatch ’s office is 3 miles from my church , which has numerous LGBT members .
I do n’t snoop around in the collection plate to see who tithes and who does n’t , but I know that my neighbors in the pews worship God , not politics .
Sen .
Hatch does n’t have the standing to dismiss their faith or anyone else ’s .
Amen , Dan .

JOBS are bringing people to Warrnambool at almost twice the state average growth rate and more than three times the regional figure .
But the expansion is coming at a cost .
As the estimated population nudges 33,380 the city ’s housing shortage — particularly in the rental sector — is getting worse .
In the past four years the number of new jobs in the city rose by 3.4 per cent , compared with a two per cent average for the state and 0.9 per cent for regions , the city council was told last night .
City chief executive Bruce Anson described the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures as “ colossal ” .
“ It shows that most of our population growth in recent years is coming from new jobs , which would be mainly in the service and construction sectors , ” he said .
“ We had about 580 new residents and about 430 of those were involved with new jobs .
“ Many of them live in Warrnambool and work outside the city . ”
The growth has far exceeded forecast targets .
Ten years ago the population was tipped to reach 32,500 by 2030 .
That target was reached three years ago and the 2030 forecast population has been expanded to 50,000 .
Last night ’s report to the council showed the estimated population at June 30 , 2009 , was 33,374 , up by 1.8 per cent , equal to Bendigo and only 0.1 per cent below Ballarat .
The number of employed people in Warrnambool at the end of the March quarter rose by 0.8 per cent from the December quarter to 16,582 while the unemployment rate fell 0.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent or 959 people .
The unemployment rate is slightly below state and regional rates .
Mr Anson said the challenge was to plan well for the future and manage growth .
He said state and federal governments had been asked to help address the housing shortage .
“ It ’s not an easy fix , ” Mr Anson said .
“ In the next couple of weeks we will be making a fresh focus on housing .
“ The mayor and I recently were in Canberra where we raised the issue with Housing Minister Tanya Plibersek . ”
Cr Jacinta Ermacora described housing as “ the big elephant in the room ” .
“ Our population growth is good for Warrnambool , but raises big challenges like more traffic , greater competition for housing and higher living costs , ” she said .
“ It ’s important to protect our city ’s unique heritage . ”
The Standard has recently reported soaring rental rates and public housing waiting lists .

Obtenir votre permis de surfer
Obtenir votre permis de surfer est un pré-requis afin de sécuriser le web pour tous .
Avant que les gouvernements ne rendent le permis de surfer obligatoire , les gens se trouvaient souvent perdus dans une myriade de sites web , cliquant naïvement sur les publicités clignotantes pour se retrouver spammés par des fenêtres surgissantes .
Obtenir le permis prend de deux à cinq jours d'éducation par votre Surf - Ecole locale .
Vous devrez vous préparer soigneusement au test final , dans lequel vous aurez à répondre à de simples questions comme celles - ci :

Placement produit
Comme vous le savez peut - être , le placement produit et les mentions produit sponsorisées dans les vidéos et les textes ont remplacé toutes les autres formes de publicité .
Gardez à l'esprit que sans ces placements produit , l'Internet tel que nous le connaissons ne pourrait être financé , et n'existerait même pas !
Tous les principaux producteurs de contenus se sont mis d'accord pour adopter le placement produit plutôt que toute autre forme de publicité en 2014 , et depuis 2019 les politiciens gouvernementaux dans plus de 80 pays les ont rejoins , saupoudrant leurs discours politiques de références commerciales .

Jargon technique
Parfois vous rencontrerez des abréviations spécifiques à Internet .
Si vous n'avez pas l'habitude du jargon technique , gardez ce glossaire à portée de main ou chargez - le dans votre module d'extension cérébrale .
Les principaux mots - clés sont :
WWW — Littéralement « World Wide Web » , une expression utilisée dans les premiers temps du web .
Elle est depuis passée de mode , mais elle est encore utilisée par certains vieux citoyens numériques .
Comme le communisme , c'était une idée séduisante mais complètement irréaliste .
Virus —
Un virus , souvent appelé « virus informatique » par les nostalgiques , est un programme qui pénètre dans votre puce cervicale et est conçu pour stimuler votre désir consumériste .
Si vous vous retrouvez au supermarché pris d'une soudaine envie d'acheter des quantités phénoménales d'une certaine marque de céréales , cela peut être dû à un « virus informatique ».
Ces programmes sont clairement illégaux ; stimuler le désir consumériste via la puce cervicale doit être approuvé a priori et réservé aux plus de 6 ans .
LOL — La signification mot -à - mot de cette expression est perdue dans la nuit des temps ( vous vous rappelez peut - être que la loi Karcheriser le net de 2015 a accidentellement détruit une grande quantité des archives ) .
Quoi qu'il en soit , elle est généralement interprétée comme une forme de rire ( et elle a remplacé « A tes souhaits » quand quelqu'un éternue ) .

Usama bin Laden gets up each morning in his dark , damp cave in northern Pakistan , gripped by fear , listening carefully for the telltale sound of a drone that is searching for him .
His isolation is almost complete .
Only a few trusted associates know where he is , and they visit rarely -- bringing food and news , but careful not to fall into a routine .
There is no radio or other electronic device whose signal might be followed .
He ca n’t go out in daytime for fear of satellites .
It is a grim , lonely existence .
At least , that is the picture that has emerged of the life of the world ’s most wanted man since he fled Tora Bora in 2001 .
But a new and vastly different picture of the Al Qaeda leader 's life has been emerging over the past few years .
In this scenario , he wakes each morning in a comfortable bed inside a guarded compound north of Tehran .
He is surrounded by his wife and a few children .
He keeps a low profile , is allowed limited travel and , in exchange for silence , is given a comfortable life under the protection of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard .
The idea that Bin Laden is in Iran got a strong boost recently with the premiere of a documentary called “ Feathered Cocaine . ”
In it , Alan Parrot , the film ’s subject and one of the world ’s foremost falconers , makes a case that Bin Laden , an avid falcon hunter , has been living comfortably in Iran since at least 2003 and continues to pursue the sport relatively freely .
He is relaxed , healthy and , according to the film , very comfortable .
To make his case , Parrot , president of the Union for the Conservation of Raptors , took two Icelandic filmmakers , Om Marino Arnarson and Thorkell S. Hardarson , into the secretive world of falconers .
It 's a world in which some birds can sell for over $ 1 million , and in which the elite of the Middle East conduct business in luxurious desert camps where money , politics and terror intermingle .
Parrot , who was once the chief falconer for the Shah of Iran and who has worked for the royal families of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , still has extensive contacts in Iran and the falcon world .
One of those contacts , described as a warlord from the north of Iran and disguised in a balaclava , reveals in the film that he has met Bin Laden six times on hunting trips inside Iran since March 2003 .
He says the Al Qaeda leader is relaxed and healthy and so comfortable that “ he travels with only four bodyguards . ”
Their last confirmed meeting was in 2008 , Parrot says .
“ There may have been more since then , but I have n’t talked to my source since we left Iran , ” he said .
Parrot told FOX news.com that the extraordinary disclosure by the warlord , who supplies the falcon camps Bin Laden visits on hunting forays , was not done out of altruism .
“ One of my men saved his life and this was the repayment , " he said .
" He was asked to talk .
He was n’t happy about it . ”
To prove his case , Parrot said he managed to get the telemetry setting for the falcons Bin Laden was flying , and he provided them to the U.S. Government .
“ They could locate him to a one - square - mile area using those unique signals ” ’ he said .
He says the government never contacted him to follow up .
Maj .
Sean Turner , a Pentagon spokesman , said the U.S. Military would not comment on the whereabouts of Bin Laden .
Parrot 's story is supported in the documentary by former CIA agent Robert Baer , an outspoken critic of U.S. policy in the Middle East and of how the CIA is managed .
Baer , the onetime Middle East operative on whom the movie Syriana is based , explains that while he was in the CIA , he used satellites to watch the camps and they proved to be one of the key ways Al Qaeda was funded .
He underscored how important falconry is to the vastly wealthy , and how Parrot ’s position gave him a unique lens on that world .
Parrot 's disclosures add another piece to a jigsaw puzzle that for years has fed suspicion that Bin Laden is living in Iran .
Among the other clues are :
-- Iran accepted 35 Al Qaeda leaders after the fall of the Taliban , despite the schism between Al Qaeda ’s Sunni roots and the Shiite regime in Iran .
-- In February 2009 the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on several high - ranking Al Qaeda operatives working out of Iran and helping run the terror network .
-- In 2004 author Richard Miniter , in his book “ Shadow War , ” wrote that two former Iranian Intelligence agents told him they had seen Bin Laden in Iran in 2003 .
-- In June 2003 the respected Italian newspaper Corre de la Sierra , http://www.corriere.it/,quoting intelligence reports , reported that Bin Laden was in Iran and preparing new terror attacks .
-- Some analysts believe the reason Bin Laden switched from video to audiocassettes for his announcements was that he could n’t find a place in Iran that matched the terrain of northern Pakistan .
--
In December 2009 it was widely reported that one of Bin Laden 's wives , six of his children and 11 grandchildren were living in a compound in Tehran .
The living situation was made public after one of the daughters escaped the compound and sought asylum in the Saudi Embassy .
It is in this compound , Parrot says , that Bin Laden has found sanctuary .
Parrot said Bin Laden was renowned as an avid falconer who captured most of the falcons around Kandahar to raise funds to support his terror efforts .
Each spring wealthy Arabs from the Gulf would fill military cargo planes full of specially equipped Toyota Land Cruisers and other equipment and fly to the falcon camps in Afghanistan .
" Usama would arrive and presented the falcons as gifts , " Parrot said .
" In return , the wealthy princes would leave the cars and equipment with him when they left , giving Al Qaeda a considerable material advantage over others , including the Taliban . ”
Richard Clarke , the former counterterrorism expert at the White House through two administrations , has admitted in interviews and before the 9/11 Commission that on one of the three occasions the United States was able to place Bin Laden , he was in a falcon camp set up by falcon hunters from Dubai .
The CIA requested a cruise missile strike against Bin Laden .
Clarke said he stopped the government from firing at the camp because “ it did n’t look like an Al Qaeda camp . ”
“ I am not political , ” Parrot says , “ But he is the most wanted terrorist in the world and it has been frustrating getting the government to listen .
Perhaps now they will . ”
Delivering a powerful message of discontent , voters Tuesday swept out veteran Sen. Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania , nominated a “ tea party ” movement founder for a Senate seat in Kentucky and forced Sen.
Blanche Lincoln into a runoff for the Democratic nomination in Arkansas .
Looking shell - shocked and speaking to fewer than 100 supporters in a half - empty ballroom , Specter delivered a brief speech in Philadelphia conceding the Democratic race to two - term Rep. Joe Sestak — marking the end of his 30 - year Senate career .
Specter was a Republican the whole time save the last year , when he switched parties in a failed bid to keep his seat .
“ It has been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania , ” he said , with teary eyes , surrounded by his wife , son and grandchildren .
In Kentucky , political novice Rand Paul delivered the tea party its biggest win since the movement ’s emergence last year amid a backlash over bailouts and President Obama ’s expansive agenda .
Although Paul ’s victory had been telegraphed by his big lead in polls , it was nonetheless seismic in scale , marking a significant breakthrough for the loosely knit protest movement .
Up to now , activists have mainly lent their support to candidates who shared their principles , as opposed to backing one of their own .
“ I have a message , ” Paul told supporters at a victory party in Bowling Green , “ a message from the tea party , a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words : ‘ We have come to take our government back . ’ ”
In a fourth race watched closely for its national implications , Democrat Mark Critz defeated Republican Tim Burns in the fight to fill a Pennsylvania House seat vacated by the late Democratic Rep. John P. Murtha .
Exultant Democrats seized on the win as a sign that they can withstand an expected Republican tide in November and keep control of the House .
But the outcome elsewhere could give pause to many longtime lawmakers .
Specter ’s defeat was the third loss for a congressional incumbent in less than two weeks and was perhaps the most resonant .
Unlike Republican Utah Sen. Robert F. Bennett , who was defeated at a convention of conservative activists , or Democratic West Virginia Rep. Alan B. Mollohan , who was shadowed by ethical problems , Specter was rejected by a statewide electorate that shrugged off the clout that came with his seniority .
“ It ’s a wake - up call for every incumbent , Republican , Democrat , or anybody around the country , ” a disappointed Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said as he left Specter ’s election - night gathering .
Although he enjoyed the backing of Obama , Specter was laboring under perhaps the heaviest burden of any candidate Tuesday , defending not just his long tenure in Washington but his admittedly self - interested party switch .
Specter quit the Republicans — after casting a key vote in favor of Obama ’s economic stimulus plan , outraging conservatives — because he said there was no longer a place for moderates like him .
He built his campaign around the power he wielded as one of the longest - serving members of Congress — and how that worked to Pennsylvania ’s benefit .
But Sestak portrayed Specter , 80 , as interested in nothing more than self - preservation and made frequent , if indirect , references to his age and history of health problems , including two bouts of Hodgkin ’s lymphoma and a brain tumor .
“ His time has come and gone , ” Sestak said .
Casting her ballot Tuesday , Johnelle Duncan , 72 , agreed .
“ We need new blood , new ideas , ” the retired librarian said after voting for Sestak at Philadelphia ’s Simon Community Center .
Sestak , a retired admiral , addressed chanting supporters Tuesday night at a military academy outside Philadelphia .
“ This is what democracy looks like , ” he shouted .
“ A win for the people over the establishment , over the status quo , even over Washington , D.C. ”
Sestak , 58 , will face former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey , 48 , in November ’s general election .
Toomey narrowly lost to Specter in the 2004 Republican Senate primary and is seen as the early front - runner to claim the seat .
In Kentucky , Paul started far behind Secretary of State Trey Grayson , the handpicked candidate of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell .
McConnell , an architect of the Kentucky GOP , helped shove aside junior Sen. Jim Bunning , a fellow Republican , because he considered Grayson more electable .
But Paul , 47 , surged past him , thanks to a plain - spoken style and platform rooted in the tea party movement ’s small - government tenets :
He favors term limits , a balanced - budget amendment , a requirement lawmakers read every word of legislation before it passes and a stipulation that laws spell out their constitutional underpinning .
“ He ’s not anyone ’s lap dog , ” said Dianna Knight , 62 , a retired high school math teacher in Louisville , who said she supported Paul precisely because so many in the GOP leadership opposed him .
Grayson and his allies sought to portray Paul , a Bowling Green eye doctor , as something of a kook .
They cited , among other things , his support for legalizing medical marijuana and the view that America ’s interventionist foreign policy was at least partly to blame for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
But the criticism served mainly to rally Paul supporters — many of whom backed his father for president in 2008 — and helped reinforce his image as a political outsider .
Analysts consider the fall campaign against Democratic Atty .
Gen. Jack Conway a toss - up , suggesting Paul may not stand up well to scrutiny in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans and voters are accustomed to their long - serving lawmakers bringing home Washington largesse .
In Arkansas , Lincoln faced a fierce challenge from Halter , who attacked her equivocal stance on healthcare — she supported the overhaul bill on initial passage , but opposed its final approval — and accused her of being too friendly to Wall Street and insufficiently supportive of organized labor .
Outside groups , led by labor unions , poured millions of dollars into a negative ad campaign pummeling Lincoln .
Lincoln and Halter will face each other in a June 8 runoff for the chance to take on Republican Rep. John Boozman in the fall .
Boozman starts as a strong favorite to win that contest .

James Oliphant of the Washington bureau contributed to this report .
The federal government will try to push more than 50 pieces of legislation through parliament this week as it clears the decks ahead of a possible election in August or September .
Included in the long list of bills needing approval are Labor 's plans to expand welfare quarantining , previously limited to some indigenous communities , to around the country .
The government 's legislative timetable is being hamstrung by the Senate 's reluctance to prolong scheduled sitting times beyond the norm and past Thursday .
The upper house already has 50 bills to consider even before the House of Representatives possibly sends it another 22 pieces of legislation for approval .
Election speculation is rampant as Labor insiders debate the merits of a spring poll .
Episode 8
" I... uh ... " the Boss says , wandering into Mission Control aimlessly , searching for the right words to bring up whatever 's on his mind .
" Yes ? " I ask , letting him off the hook .
" The lifts " he says cryptically ..
" The lifts ? " I repeat ..
" The buttons on the lifts " he says .
" They have buttons - yes - well spotted , " I say .
" They 've got more buttons . "
" More than ? "
" The building has extra floors , " he finally blurts .
" Now there 's buttons for floors 7 to 12 . "
" You mean the building gets bigger if you add buttons to the lift ? ! " the PFY says .
" Like the buttons are actually an array of floor pointers ?! ? "
" Oooh yeah , " I say , getting in on the act .
" So you could push 8 and it does a new ( floor ) . "
" And maybe you could do it so if you held the button down it does a destroy ( floor ) then a new ( floor ) ! "
" For the 4th floor , " I say , wondering how the Beancounters would cope with sudden non-existence .
The Boss ' blank expression indicates that this conversation is wasted on him .
" The lift control panels have apparently been recalled for saftey reasons , " the PFY sighs .
" The only spare panels they had in stock were for taller buildings . "
Which is not entirely the truth .
The truth was revealed a couple of days ago .
" Look what I scored ! " the PFY says .
" Some ... lift control panels ? " I ask .
" Yeah , they 're renovating the building down the street and I noticed these were going to be chucked out . "
" They were in the bin ? "
" Not exactly . "
" In a wheelbarrow destined for the bin ? "
" No . "
" On the floor outside the lifts ? "
" Ah ... "
" In the lift , with the power connected , in the building which is n't being renovated ? "
" Well , yes .
But I was thinking , we could swap these with our panels and then use the extra buttons for special controls . "
" Special controls like ? "
" Well , you press the 8th floor button , it delivers you to the ground floor and sends a text message to the Indian down the street to order two chicken vindaloos , some chilli bhajis , a couple of garlic naans and four Kingfishers . "
" But would n't that mean that they'd be inundated with orders every time idiot tested the button ? "
" You 'd think so , but then it would only be active outside of work hours . "
" After 4 pm , except on Fridays , when it 's on after 12 pm . "
" Yes , well , I might need to think about that one a little . "
" So we 'd just use the lift control panel as a form of ordering system ? "
" Not necessarily .
Press floor 9 and it'll take you to whatever floor the hottest woman in the building is on . "
" Really ? "
" Of course not .
It does n't do that - but it could do if you thought it was a good idea . "
" And Floor 10 ? "
" The floor 10 button would take you up and down in the lift randomly for 15 minutes - without opening the doors or stopping at floors .
At variable speeds . "
" 11 ? "
" The same as 9 , but for 30 minutes . "
" And do n't tell me , 12 is for an hour .
So if you pressed 12 and 9 it would be one hour , 15 minutes of lift joyriding ? "
" No , 12 will gas you with a vapourised version of rohypnol before taking you to Basement 1 - where the creepy Courier Guy parks his van .
You know , the one with the tinted windows .
I like the binary addition of button travel times idea though . "
" Gassing them and dropping them off in the basement 's a little cruel do n't you think ? "
" No , cruel 's dropping the ceiling tile with ' all you can eat ' written on the back of it onto the lift floor . "
" Ah , yes , Rule 2 , the double tap ...
You 've given this a lot of thought have n't you ? "
" It passes the time between pub visits , " the PFY nods .
" And it only works when it 's enabled ? "
" When it 's enabled or when you press the floor number with the DOOR OPEN button held down .
I thought we could use it like a shift key - that way all the other buttons could do something special too . "
...
" Well , I gave them a call and get the lifts fixed properly as I was stuck in there for quarter of an hour this morning , " the Boss says .
" But they say they do n't know anything about the panels . "
" Really ?
Must be a different crew .
Did you speak to anyone else about this ? "
Crap Segue Tip :
If anyone , anytime - even if you 're not in a movie - says " did you speak to anyone else about this ? " say ' yes ' .
" No , not yet . "
... half an hour later ...
" Has anyone seen Jerry ? " the IT Director asks , looking around for the Boss .
" Have n't seen him all day , " the PFY responds .
Crap Segue followup :
Told you so .
" Oh .
Only there 's a couple of people at reception who 've got a meeting scheduled with him .
Some chaps who do cloud computing - whatever that is .
Sounds like something we should be looking into though . "
" You know , I think I saw him on the 7th floor . " the PFY says .
" Does this building have a 7th floor ? "
" Yes , it 's just some sort of optical illusion that makes the building seem smaller . "
" OK , I 'll send them up there then . "
" No , you need to have a company swipe card to get access . "
" OK I 'll take them up . "
" Good idea , " the PFY says .
. . .
" 7th floor ? " I ask as soon as the Boss leaves .
" Same as 12 but it also sends a text message to the courier to say his packages are ready and bring the big van ... "
" It 's still ... I dunno ... a little cruel , " I say .
" What about if I text him and tell him if he 's not on 7 he 'll be on 8 ? "
" And we 'll pop down for a quick ruby ?
OK then , you talked me into it ... "
MegaUpload is one of the most prominent file - hosting services on the Internet .
It is owned by an unbelievably colorful individual who is probably better known for his multiple convictions for computer fraud , embezzlement and insider trading .
He owns several luxury cars , for which he is currently under investigation , and has just acquired New Zealand 's most expensive house - a snip at just over $ 20 m .
The file - sharing and anti-piracy world is full of interesting characters , most of whom remain hidden in the shadows .
Some individuals are just too large to be contained though , and are either involuntarily thrust into the media spotlight by force or become deliberately high - profile by design .
While many people will be familiar with Pirate Bay founders Gottfrid and Fredrik due to them being featured in countless articles , the pair tend to shy away from too much direct publicity .
The same cannot be said of Peter Sunde who rarely misses an opportunity to be in the spotlight , and to great effect it must be said .
The believed owner of MegaUpload , however , makes Peter Sunde look like a shrinking violet .
Kim ‘ Kimble ’ Schmitz is a quite unbelievable character .
Born in 1974 in Germany , he grew to become a computer hacker , successful businessman and convicted criminal .
In 1998 Schmitz received two years ’ probation for hacking into corporate networks and abusing telephone services but the draw of big money was just around the corner .
In 2001 Schmitz pulled off a huge stock market bluff which netted him a small fortune .
After buying shares worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in the almost bankrupt LetsBuyIt.com , he announced that he would invest 50 million euros in the company , but in reality he did n’t have the money .
His declaration led to the biggest single - day rise on the German stock market which allowed Schmitz to sell his shares and pocket $ 1.5 million profit .
He was arrested for insider - trading in 2002 , sentenced to a term of 20 months and given a 100,000 euro fine .
Also in 2001 , one of Schmitz ’s companies loaned another one 280,000 euros and conveniently both went bust shortly after .
Schmitz later pleaded guilty to embezzlement and received another two years probation .
A master of the PR stunt , Schmitz has previously faked his own suicide and also offered a $ 10 million reward for the capture of Osama Bin Laden .
He also claimed to own a fleet of jets but apparently the planes he was photographed with belonged to other people .
A self - confessed car - nut , Schmitz entered the Gumball 3000 rally many times and actually came first in 2001 , but his appearances in this event brought even more controversy .
According to YouTube videos here and here , Schmitz drove at 240 km/h on a public road in Belgium , ignored stop signs and drove in cycle lanes where one of his friends hit a pedestrian .
In another clip he ’s seen admitting to bribing the police and deliberately nudging a rival ’s Porsche with his Mercedes .
But claims that he also did the private jet ‘ trick ’ mentioned above when photographed with , allegedly , other peoples ’ cars , may have been a little off the mark .
According to a recent report from New Zealand , Schmitz is currently under investigation for using multiple names to register three luxury cars including a Rolls - Royce Phantom convertible .
The cars are adorned with personal plates – GOD , WANTED and GUILTY .
The vehicles are registered to an address in Coatesville , New Zealand , which turns out to be a very special venue indeed – Schmitz ’s newly - acquired mansion and the country ’s most expensive house , a snip at just over $ 20 million USD .
The mega -money has clearly continued to roll in , with the addition of porn site Megarotic and the site most readers will be familiar with , MegaUpload .
Although Schmitz ’s connection to these projects has been denied in the past , he was the person who registered the site ’s domain name in 2005 and there are many other links which are difficult to simply brush off .
MegaUpload has become more and more successful in recent times and its growing popularity make it a popular choice with those looking for an alternative to RapidShare .
Much of MegaUpload ’s system appears to be running from host LeaseWeb in The Netherlands and Carpathia Hosting in the US .
In both locations they have many hundreds of IP addresses and servers .
While RapidShare ’s huge growth has seen the company become the target for recent legal action , according to information received by TorrentFreak it appears that an apparent expansion of MegaUpload has n’t gone unnoticed either .
French anti-piracy group ALPA has been cranking up the pressure on LeaseWeb in what is being described as a “ pre-litigation period ” .
If the future of MegaUpload and Kim Schmitz is anywhere as colorful as the past , there will be yet more amazing stories to come .
How Do I Check For Bed Bugs ?
Simple Identification For Homeowners
Bed bugs hide , their scampering / bolting away may make some homeowners fearful to look for them , and a baby bed bug ( nymph ) are usually too difficult to discover for the un-trained eye .
For these reasons , when you move around your mattress and investigate , you should be looking not only for brown adult bed bugs and yellow pale nymphs , but also , in - animate evidence such as white bed bug eggs , and black bed bug feces .
Use the following steps to help you conduct a search for bed bug evidence in your room :
Thoroughly check the seams of your mattress and joints of the bed frame Investigate all wooden constructs of the bed carefully as bed bugs may blend in with the colour of wood Flatten and stretch fabric properties of bedroom furniture to properly see bugs and eggs hiding under fabric folds Checking basebords near the bed may yield effortless fecal matter findings due to the contrast in colour
Not finding evidence using the above steps is not a confirmation that you are bed bug free .
The bed bug exterminator inspection is distinguished from a regular homeowner inspection because a simple homeowner check lacks extensiveness , detail , and is not sufficient to draw a bed bug extermination plan upon .
An expert bed bug inspection determines the entire scope and far - reaching effects of the infestation .
Thus , it is necessary in order to eliminate the bed bugs from every single source and hiding spot .
How Do You Even Get Bed Bugs ?
Bed bugs may transport using bags , humans , clothing , luggage .
They may get off at any spot and then aboard another bag , or the clothing of a new person .
Thus , apart from hotel rooms , bed bugs may latch on to you or your belongings from the fabric and cushiony seats found in movie theatres , public transportation vehicles , airplanes , and hospitals .
With cases Pest Solution Services has previously dealt with , sources of infestations can even be a continuous guest who visits your home frequently ( such as a client who comes many times to your home office ) .
Outside the Lines investigates the impact of the World Cup on the often hidden underworld of human trafficking ( 12:42 )
Editor 's note :
For more than nine months , " Outside the Lines " has investigated whether the presence of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa will have an effect on human trafficking in the country .
OTL interviewed dozens of sources in South Africa and around the world , including officials in law enforcement , government agencies , research institutes and advocacy groups , as well as pimps and prostitutes who will work the brothels and streets of South African cities that are hosting World Cup matches .
The investigation included undercover footage , recorded from within the South African sex industry in Cape Town and Johannesburg .
The reporting process led to multiple sources who said more young people have been trafficked either into South Africa from other countries or internally to work in a rapidly growing sex industry because of the monthlong soccer tournament .
CAPE TOWN , South Africa --
She agreed to meet at a safe house in Cape Town , her refuge since early February .
Now 32 , Jasmine ( her name has been changed to protect her identity ) has barely known a life outside prostitution .
She said her mother , a former prostitute and drug addict , saw to that , selling Jasmine 's virginity to a Japanese sailor when Jasmine was 12 or 13 .
" She said she brought me into the world and she always supported me and paid for the bills and everything , and it's now my turn to give back , " Jasmine said , recalling her mother 's decision to sell her daughter 's innocence .
" It was just normal .
It was just expected of me to do . "
" Jasmine " is a victim of human trafficking in South Africa .
ESPN
From that early age until May 2009 , Jasmine worked on and off as a prostitute in South Africa , surviving what she described as the horrors that come with that life : rape , an addiction to crack cocaine and an abusive former boyfriend with whom she has a daughter .
For the past few years , Jasmine said , she has lived in fear of two German pimps who used a recruiter to lure her more than 200 miles from Cape Town to the Indian Ocean - coastal city of Mossel Bay .
She said the men raped her , threatened her with beatings if she tried to escape , controlled her day - to - day movements and fined her if she left her small apartment without their permission .
Despite her most recent experience , Jasmine asked before an extensive interview with " Outside the Lines " whether she " fit the criteria " to be included in a story about the effect of the World Cup on human trafficking in South Africa .
" My perception of human trafficking was being chained to a bed , or like in a small little box , and being sent to another country , and I did n't think of it internally , " she said .
According to anti-trafficking advocates , Jasmine 's story is an example of what 's happening with greater frequency all over South Africa as the World Cup approaches .
" That 's classic human trafficking , " said Tonya Stanfield , network director of Justice [ ACTS ] , a Cape Town anti-trafficking group .
" She was told , ' You will be a sex worker , and you will be a prostitute , ' but she was n't told she was going to be a slave , " Stanfield said when told of Jasmine 's story .
Tonya Stanfield speaks with ESPN reporter John Barr outside a Cape Town warehouse , where police rescued five teenage trafficking victims in late April .
ESPN
Stanfield 's organization distills the often murky practice of human trafficking down to four core elements .
Trafficking victims , Stanfield said , are tricked , transported , trapped and traded .
Jasmine said she was working as a prostitute in Cape Town when a female acquaintance told her about an opportunity to make some quick money in Mossel Bay , about a six - hour bus ride from Cape Town .
Jasmine said the woman told her that she would work for a German pimp and have her own apartment right on the beach and that she could come and go as she pleased .
" I thought that she was going to be there with me , working with me , and then when we went to the bus station , she 's like , ' Adios !
Bye , see ya ! '
I never ever saw her there , " Jasmine said .
" When I got there , other women told me , ' No , she gets paid ' to bring women there . "
Jasmine said she later discovered she 'd been sold to the Germans for roughly $ 65 ( U.S. ) .
She said that she was stuck inside an ocean - side apartment with three other women and that the first time she met the owner of the apartment -- one of the German pimps -- he raped her .
" I realized that I could n't leave the flat .
There were two big German guys that were also there , all the time .
I could n't go to the shop .
I could n't go to the beach .
I could n't go anywhere , " she said .
Jasmine and the three other women were not kept in Mossel Bay long .
Every few days , she said , they were moved to new , unfamiliar locations .
" In the middle of the night , like about 2 o'clock in the night , they would come and they 'd switch on the lights and [ say ] , ' Come !
Take you stuff now , quickly ! ' "
Jasmine said .
She estimated she was moved more than 10 times , something she now recognizes as a tactic by her pimps to control her and the other women .
" They do n't want you to get too familiar with a place .
...
That is why they never take ladies from the area , " she said .
Global impact ?
As South Africa awaits an estimated half - million soccer fans for the World Cup , there are increasing concerns that more people will become victims of human trafficking and that younger women and girls , in particular , will be at risk .
One - third of all workers in South Africa are unemployed and nearly 70 percent of South African children live in poverty , according to Patric Solomons , director of the Cape Town - based children 's advocacy group Molo Songololo .
Patric Solomons is the director of the Cape Town - based children 's advocacy group , Molo Songololo .

Solomons fears relaxed visa controls at South Africa 's already porous borders , the decision by South African public school officials to give children vacation during the month - long soccer tournament starting Friday and the influx of hundreds of thousands of foreigners with deep pockets have created a perfect storm for sex trafficking .
" The magnitude of the event will definitely have an impact , " Solomons said .
Determining just how much is no easy task .
In 2000 , according to Johannesburg police , an estimated 38,000 children each year were being forced into prostitution in South Africa .
Various medical sources have since placed the estimates closer to 20,000 children , Solomons said .
" We actually do not know how big the problem is , of trafficking ... or children just being prostituted or sexually exploited within South Africa , " Solomons said .
" We really do not know . "
That acknowledgement is rare in a realm in which wild estimates often are stated as fact .
Before the 2006 World Cup in Germany , for example , several anti-trafficking advocacy groups said 40,000 women would be trafficked to Germany and forced to work within the sex industry for the World Cup .
A 2007 report by the Geneva - based International Organization for Migration , a respected anti-trafficking group that advises governments and provides training to police agencies worldwide , found " the estimates of 40,000 foreign prostitutes or even 40,000 forced prostitutes were not supported . "
Of the 33 suspected human trafficking cases reported to the Federal Criminal Police Office in Germany , " only five cases were assumed to have a direct link to the 2006 World Cup , " according to the IOM report .
Prostitution was legal in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and remains legal today .
Numerous advocacy groups say the policing strategies and public awareness campaigns before the World Cup in Germany had the effect of dramatically reducing the number of trafficking victims who ultimately were discovered there .
In South Africa , public service announcements airing on television and radio stations are reminiscent of the human trafficking estimates stated publicly before the 2006 World Cup .
" Leading up to the 2010 World Cup , as many as 100,000 victims are expected to fall prey to traffickers , pimps and underground crime syndicates , " warns one anti-trafficking message starring several popular South African actors and musicians .
" What we have seen is misreporting of facts , " said Eric Harper , director of the Cape Town - based Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce ( SWEAT ) .
Harper said South Africa would do well to learn from the German example , in which the number of trafficking victims ultimately identified by police paled in comparison to the pretournament hype .
To control trafficking , he argued , prostitution should be legalized .
" Of course we are concerned about trafficking , and the sex workers would like to fight in the fight against trafficking ... but as long as sex workers are criminalized , you are driving the industry further and further underground , " Harper said .
As recently as 2007 , government officials in South Africa , including then - national police commissioner Jackie Selebi , pushed to legalize prostitution in time for the 2010 World Cup .
The effort gained traction , in part because of concerns about the spread of HIV and AIDS .
The United Nations estimates that 5.1 million people in South Africa are HIV - positive , and , according to recent studies , roughly half of all prostitutes have HIV .
Selebi's controversial and ill - fated position on prostitution speaks to a larger issue .
In South Africa , according to different advocacy groups and even sources within law enforcement , the police themselves often turn a blind eye to the illegal sex trade .
A city vice squad created in Cape Town this past September remains the only one of its kind in all of South Africa , according to the unit 's assistant chief , Neil Arendse .
Anti-trafficking advocates such as Tonya Stanfield have heard the arguments for legalization before and remain convinced the underground sex trade would grow exponentially under such a system .
" How can you decriminalize an industry that is interlaced with organized crime and drug addiction ? "
Stanfield said .
" How can you bring some sort of order to that and police that in a way that sex workers are free to be sex workers and have the rights of all workers , when the people they are working for do n't care a lick about human rights ? "
Solomons pointed out that South Africa , unlike Germany , has a host of factors that make it uniquely susceptible to exploitation by human trafficking syndicates : a huge , impoverished lower class and , unlike more than half the world 's countries , no law specifically criminalizing all forms of human trafficking .

Last month , South African President Jacob Zuma signed legislation that makes trafficking in minors a crime , but more comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation remains stuck in a committee within the South African Parliament and wo n't be passed into law until late 2010 at the earliest , according to Errol Naidoo , an activist and lobbyist who pushed hard to get the legislation passed before the World Cup started .
" I think that most people are just appalled that government is not taking this seriously enough , " Naidoo said in a recent interview near his Cape Town office , just outside the gates of Parliament .
" Recently , they arrested nine Nigerian traffickers ... and they do n't have the law in place to effectively and comprehensively deal with these guys . "
An ordained minister who runs the conservative Family Policy Institute , Naidoo said sex traffickers see the World Cup as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to " cash in . "
" They are operating on the principle that there are many desperate young women in South Africa because of the high levels of unemployment , of poverty and desperation , so they are feeding off that and they know that they stand to make millions and millions of rand [ South Africa 's currency ] over the period [ of the World Cup ] , " Naidoo said .
A new phenomenon
In Johannesburg , where the World Cup begins Friday , the number of brothels has doubled within the past year , according to one law enforcement source .
The source , who spoke to " Outside the Lines " in an extensive interview in early May , agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because of the undercover nature of his work .
He explained that he has spent years penetrating human trafficking syndicates and that he had found 10 trafficking victims in Johannesburg - area brothels alone in just the two weeks before the interview .
" In the last couple weeks , there has been an increase in domestic trafficking , and it has been for the World Cup , " the source said .
He went on to speak of a Cape Town organized - crime syndicate known as " The Firm , " an umbrella organization made up of roughly 100 smaller criminal groups that collectively run the sex trade in Cape Town .
The Firm , according to the source , recently expanded to include Chinese crime syndicates .
" Cape Town is cut and dried into organized crime like you can't believe , " he said .

" Some of the worst trafficking we 're seeing is amongst Southeast Asians and Chinese , " said Councillor J.P. Smith , the Cape Town city official responsible for safety and security during the World Cup .
" I can tell you we 've been raiding [ brothels ] in my suburb and surrounding suburbs for 10 years .
... I have never seen the amount of Chinese nationals we 've seen in the last six months to a year . "
Smith said the Cape Town vice squad , created in September , has been profiling prostitutes since November .
Since then , according to Smith , the number of foreign nationals working as prostitutes has doubled .
" Where we 're starting to see a lot of foreign nationals is in brothels in residential suburbs , " Smith said .
" Chinese nationals , Mozambican , Zambian , Zimbabwean and other Southeast Asian .
That 's worrying .
And they were not here a year ago . "
" These girls did n't come here by themselves , " Smith said .
" They 're being brought here through syndicates , who have the means to manipulate immigration processes , to bribe border patrol , border guards , to bribe immigration officials . "
When asked for an explanation , Smith said : " The only assumption you can make is they 're anticipating increased business around the World Cup . "
Safe haven
Back at the safe house on the outskirts of Cape Town , Jasmine recounted the story of her final months in the sex trade .
Here 's part of a much longer essay by Paul Volcker on financial reform ( and a few other issues ) :
Important questions about ... governance ... and the relationships between principals and their agents are being reexamined .
Most obviously and appropriately , the role of regulation and supervision ...
To me , the lesson is clear .
There are deep - seated structural issues that must be dealt with by legislation .
Moreover , there should be common elements among nations hosting significant international financial markets and institutions .

The federal Conservatives ' lead over the Liberals continues to narrow , with roughly four percentage points dividing the two parties , a new EKOS opinion poll suggests .
The poll , released exclusively to CBC , suggests that 30.5 per cent of respondents would vote for the Tories if an election were held today , compared with 26.3 per cent who would back the Liberals .
The Tories ' lead of 4.2 percentage points over the Liberals is slightly down from the 4.6 - percentage - point spread of last week .
But over the past month , the Tories have seen a notable decline in support , with a lead of nearly 10 points for the party deceasing to a four - point margin .
Support for the NDP was up from last week , increasing to 17.4 per cent from 16.6 per cent .
The Bloc Québécois also recorded an increase in support over the week , increasing to 10.5 per cent from 8.9 per cent .
Green Party support remained relatively stable at 12.3 per cent .
The poll also suggests that close to half of Canadians ( 48.9 per cent ) feel that the country is moving in the right direction while 38.6 per cent say it is moving in the wrong direction .
Similar to previous weeks , more than half of Canadians ( 51.5 per cent ) feel the government is moving in the wrong direction , compared with 36.6 per cent who say the government is moving in the right direction .
This suggests Canadians are not associating the direction of the country with the direction of the government .
The random survey of 2,013 Canadians aged 18 and over was conducted June 9-15 and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .

[ Haskell - cafe ] DpH / repa cache locality
Hey everyone , Just out of curiosity , what work is being done in the data parallel haskell / repa projects regarding cache locality ?
The reason I am asking is because , as I understand it , the biggest bottleneck on today 's processors are cache misses , and the reason why optimized platform - specific linear algebra libraries perform well is because they divide the data into chunks that are optimally sized for the cache in order to maximize the number of operations performed per memory access .
I would n't expect data parallel haskell / repa to automatically know what the perfect chunking strategy should be on each platform , but are there any plans being made at all to do something like this ?
( To be explicit , this is n't meant as a criticism ; I 'm just curious and am interested in seeing discussion on this topic by those more knowledgeable than I . :-) )
Thanks !

Red Blood Cells
They look like little cinnamon candies here , but they 're actually the most common type of blood cell in the human body - red blood cells ( RBCs ) .
These biconcave - shaped cells have the tall task of carrying oxygen to our entire body ; in women there are about 4 to 5 million RBCs per micro liter ( cubic millimeter ) of blood and about 5 to 6 million in men .
People who live at higher altitudes have even more RBCs because of the low oxygen levels in their environment .

'A Chart That Screams , " Extend Unemployment Benefits ! " '
You 'll have to excuse me for simply stealing Daniel Indiviglio's headline for this chart , but it 's really the right way to introduce it :
" That giant gap consists of Americans who are unemployed , and could n't get a job even if they wanted to , " Indiviglio writes .
" This emphasizes the need for Congress to extend unemployment benefits .
It 's pretty clear that millions of Americans remain unemployed because the jobs are n't there -- not because they are n't trying hard enough to find them .
In fact , it 's not even close . "

The city is living and breathing and you must notice that fact .
With the help of a talented photographer you can capture a city ’s beauty in a picture and acknowledge its magnificent beauty .
Street photographers are on the mission to turn culture , life , and humanity into candid masterpieces , and it is exactly the challenge of converting ordinary moments into art that distinguish the best among them .
Not that many talented artists specialize in street photography , as the technique is far more complex than pointing the camera towards a beautiful mountain landscape .
Basically , it comes down to extracting a special moment from a scene nature did n’t exactly shed its best light on .
As fun and admirable as urban photography sounds , it tends to be rather clunky and intimidating for people who have n’t done it so far .
Learning it and applying it in practice , nevertheless , is the most rewarding photography experience you could possibly get .
Urban photography tips that can be very useful to beginners
Best street photography is still reserved for a handful of well - known artists , and the reason for that is its casual , unplanned nature .
Everything around you can be considered as inspirational content , but it is up to you to decide which the scene worth of capturing is .
Urban photographers are challenged to come up with their own visual language and ability to depict interesting moments , and use the spontaneous , quick instant to turn them into works of art .
Unlike most photography styles , urban photography is based almost entirely on practice , and requires a lot of time and a sharp eye for detail .
What is even more important is to love the experience of being an urban photographer , and enjoy the hours you ’re investing into developing a successful career .
Street photographers , however , are not strictly looking through the prism of their audience and what they expect to see , but pay attention to things that are interesting to them , and share that story with them .
As urban photography is still considered to be a niche genre , there is enough room to experiment and to offer something the audience is not used to see .
The best part is that urban photography gives you the freedom to present life as you see it , be it weird , ugly , busy , scary , or extremely personal .
Let your creativity guide you , and invest at least a part of yourself and what you like – the more individualized your work feels , the more viewers will appreciate it .
Street photography tips :
How to capture the ideal scene ?
Henry Cartier - Bresson is the man we should give credit to for introducing ‘ the decisive moment ’ phrase .
He is among the first and most experienced urban photographer who advises practitioners to give their work some time , wait for things to come together in a perfect setting , and hit their shutter .
According to him , and popular company experts ( Kodak , for instance ) , the secret of quality urban photography is solid timing .
But how can you recognize the decisive moment without experience ?
The concept is in fact a misleading one , as a single glance on the street will give you at least ten ideas of what would be a good scene to capture .
There is nothing to worry , though – professionals deal with the same issue , and usually take up to 30 photographs of the same scene until they get the ideal one , or better yet – the one that has the most potential for editing .

As for people , the decisive moment usually refers to the feelings visible through their facial expressions , hand gestures , movements , and distinctive actions .
Which is the best lens for street photography ?
Another good side of street photography is that ‘ capturing the moment ’ is more than feasible with compact cameras , go pros , and even solid camera phones .
Nevertheless , those looking to become professional street photographers should consider interchangeable lens systems , and use prime lenses with different focal lengths to maximize the potential of their work .
Choosing reliable equipment is the most important part of creating a masterpiece , as it affects the looks of the final product more than you can imagine .
Why should you choose prime lenses ?
Prime lenses are the choice of almost all professional urban photographers , as they give them the flexibility to move and create their own frame and composition .
The focal is fixed , and zooming is not an option , but street photographers see this as an advantage rather than a limitation .
Fixed prime lenses are lighter and smaller than zooming - enabled lenses , which makes them less bulky and easier to carry around .
They also tend to be optically superior and much sharper , as their design is freed of all unnecessary clutter usually present on their professional counterparts .
There will be no elements to move , no glass layouts to take on and off , and therefore no degradation that would stop natural light from reaching the sensor .
It is because of this that prime lenses have wider aperture ( f0.95 in the best scenario ) compared to zooming lenses where the typical aperture is f.2.8 .
As a result , the depth of the field is shallower , and the photographer can instantly focus on the isolated object without worrying about the rest of the portrait .
Another advantage to consider is the fact that prime lenses do n’t require photographers to crank up the ISO each time they ’re trying to capture a low light image , and final products rarely end up with lowered quality or the frustrated motion blur .
Another key benefit is the possibility to shoot handheld in low light without having to crank up the ISO resulting in lower image quality or slow down the shutter too dramatically resulting in unwanted motion blur .
What should you be looking for ?
Are 35 or 50 mm focal lengths better for street photography ?
The question is a disputed one and the answer will come down to what the photographer thinks is better for his work .
Some well - known and reputed artists go outside this frame and use different lengths to make their pieces more conventional .
Lenses below 35mm
Lenses whose length is below 35 mm are considered more cumbersome to use , and that ’s particularly true for beginners and inexperienced users .
As an urban photographer , you will likely focus on people and want them to assume the role of focal points , and this will be difficult to achieve with lengths shorter than 35 mm .
According to some photographers , 24 mm work the best for people photography , so you may as well explore this option if distance is not an issue .
For instance , you can consider the work of Willem Jonkers known for fisheye street photography , as his results may not be the most realistic representation of urban life , but prove that this can be an interesting way to represent it .
35 mm lenses
35 mm lenses are street photographers ’ favorite focal lengths .
Even if they ’re not as flattering and sharp as 50 mm ones , they can work for close portraits ( at least where the photographer knows how to adjust the settings ) .
If you wish to keep a certain distance from your subject , these may not be the ideal samples for you .
Many popular photographers , nevertheless , relied exactly on 35 mm lengths to create unique urban photographs .
These are the brands they usually choose :
Voigtlander Nokton 17.5 mm ( 35 mm FF equivalent ) f.95 for Micro Four Thirds
zuiko 17 mm ( 35 mm FF equivalent ) f1.8 for Micro Four Thirds
35 mm f1.4 Distagon FE for Sony A7 mirrorless such as the A7RII .
50 mm ( known also as the ‘ nifty ’ fifty )
Most photography experts will agree that 50 mm lenses work the best for urban photography .
This is because they are versatile , and therefore work with any focal , and you ca n’t go wrong buying them ( there will hardly be a need to change them ) .
The distortion present with 35 mm lenses or shorter ones will simply disappear , which is why we recommend these to beginners .
These are the leading brands on the market :
The Pana Leica 25 mm ( 50 mm FF equivalent )
Voigtlander Nokton 50 mm f/1.5 ( works with a Leica M Mount , but with the right adapter you can use it on your Sony A7RII ) .
Ending thoughts on street photography
Images and photography tactics are very different from each other , and so are the reasons for it .
What distinguishes high quality from low quality photographs is not the situation presented on them , but the obvious technical mistakes the artist could have easily avoided .
The most important thing , however , is to love what you ’re doing , and to enjoy while doing it .
Turn urban photography into an off - killer hobby , be brave , and improvise as much as you can .
Once you ’re really into it , inspiration will come automatically .
In case you were asking you were wondering , various techniques like HDR , black and white or infrared were used on some of these shots .
That combined with the photographers ’ skills created the results that you see here .

But now , Ms. Bickel said , young people in Munich , Bavaria ’s capital , just grab a thickly buttered pretzel with coffee on the way to work .
“ It ’s like Starbucks , ” she said .
“ There are pretzel chains in every neighborhood . ”
But older people stick to the tradition .
“ You see grandmas in the beer garden , having weisswurst and a pretzel at 11 a.m. with their first beer of the day , ” she said .

In Baden - Württemberg , in southwest Germany near France and Switzerland , the pretzels are known for their fat “ bellies ” and skinny , intertwined arms .
That ’s the style at Prime Meats in Brooklyn ; Frank Castronovo , an owner , learned to make pretzels there .
“ The goal is to have two distinct eating experiences , one crunchy and one fluffy , in a single pretzel , ” said Jeffrey Hamelman , director of the King Arthur Flour Baking Education Center in Norwich , Vt .
Mr. Hamelman ’s first professional baking experience , in 1976 , was an immersion course in pretzels .
“ I worked at a stellar German bakery in Northampton , Mass. , when most Americans were still eating Wonder bread out of plastic bags , ” he said .
“ The owner was German , but her bakers were French , and none of them wanted anything to do with pretzels .
So she hired me just for that , and taught me all the secrets . ”
The defining “ secret ” of pretzels is lye , a powerful alkali that gives them their defining contrast between a creamy white interior and a crunchy , dark - brown , lightly bitter crust .
Just before baking , pretzels are dipped into a bath of water and lye , which transforms the starch on the surface so that it can brown quickly , while the interior remains moist .
Cold lye solution can burn the eyes or skin , but the chemicals are neutralized by the heat of the oven .

And yet the reasons now is a bad time for voluntary taxes are precisely the same reasons it may be a good time .
Raising taxes is so politically poisonous that it is largely off the table .
But government , at all levels , is in urgent need of revenue — and many citizens are anxious to preserve government services .
If elected officials wo n’t require citizens to pony up , maybe they can at least beg .
Of course , now seems like an inhospitable time to be trying any such thing .
Hostility toward taxes is , in many quarters , intense , finding an outlet in the vociferous Tea Party movement .
The president has repeatedly vowed not to raise taxes on any but the richest Americans .
The deepest recession in more than half a century has made people less eager to open their wallets for any avoidable expenditure , let alone a check to the government .
“ What drove it was the need and the political atmosphere , ” says Hayes , who heard residents plead for higher taxes out of fear of losing programs .
“ If there were that many people out there who were willing to pay more , why not find an avenue for them to do so ? ”
Forty - one states already make it possible to donate on their income tax forms ; a pending bill in California would allow taxpayers to contribute to a fund for the arts .
Ian Ayres , a Yale law professor and economist , has proposed a voluntary gas tax as a way to reduce oil consumption .
In Maine , a recent bill would have established an optional sales tax to help save imperiled programs for the elderly and mentally ill .
The bill failed in the Legislature for technical reasons , but its sponsor , Representative Terry Hayes , does n’t rule out the possibility of introducing a refashioned version .
Though voluntary tax programs could never generate enough money to run a state , more people chip in than you might expect ( more , that is , than none ) .
And according to some enthusiasts , we could be doing more to capitalize on this surprising willingness to give .
Voluntary taxes , these thinkers say , offer a politically palatable way to raise additional revenue and perhaps even to strengthen Americans ’ sense of patriotism and citizenship .
And in the current political and fiscal climate , lawmakers are frankly desperate for creative solutions .
The functions of these programs differ widely , but they all share one remarkable feature .
The taxpayer dollars were not wrenched from the pockets of the Commonwealth ’s residents .
Instead , thousands of Bay Staters checked off boxes on their income tax returns opting to contribute to the funds .
These people paid , in other words , what sounds like the ultimate oxymoron : voluntary taxes .
In tax year 2008 , the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Fund received $ 216,544 in taxpayer money to protect threatened species , such as the bald eagle and the marbled salamander .
The state ’s Organ Transplant Fund received $ 117,654 to help patients who need new kidneys and hearts pay for medical care .
And the Massachusetts AIDS Fund got $ 112,939 for research and education relating to the disease .
Ayres , the Yale Law School professor , cites this precedent as an inspiration for a novel approach to our energy crisis : a voluntary gas tax , or “ independence bonds . ”
In this proposal , which he discusses in a forthcoming book , “ Carrots and Sticks , ” you could register a car , and get an initial lump sum — say , $ 500 .
In exchange , you would agree to pay a tax on every gallon of gas the car consumed , thus creating the incentive to use as little gas as possible .
There ’s a historic example of an enormously effective program that could be characterized as a voluntary tax : war bonds , which helped finance World War II .
About 85 million Americans purchased these bonds ; the government repaid them with interest , but the returns were below - market .
If not for war bonds , the government would have had to borrow money at high interest rates , but instead , it persuaded citizens to lend it money at low interest rates .
And buying bonds was marketed as the right thing to do , with celebrity endorsements .
The government could have raised taxes , but instead it chose to appeal to patriotism and engage citizens voluntarily .
A handful of states also allow people to pay a slightly higher overall rate .
In Massachusetts , the standard income tax rate is currently 5.3 percent , but residents can choose to pay 5.85 percent .
In 2008 , surprisingly , 1,953 taxpayers opted for this rate , generating an extra $ 231,907 .
The concept of voluntary taxation has a long history in this country .
Since 1843 , the US Department of Treasury has maintained an account called Gifts to the United States , a general fund to which people can contribute .
As of 1961 , it ’s been possible to donate money specifically to reduce the national debt .
( In fiscal year 2009 , donations exceeded $ 3 million . )
And starting in the late 1970s , states began to include boxes on their income tax forms that you could check to make voluntary contributions to various causes ; the recipients of these funds are both government - run programs and private nonprofits .
Other familiar fixtures — state lotteries and specialty license plates — are also essentially voluntary taxes .
And many public schools accept donations , sometimes via excise or property tax forms .
“ We were blown away that people would give almost as much to government as to private charities , ” says Catherine Eckel , one of the study ’s coauthors .
“ It ’s really the function they support .
They do n’t really care who does the work . ”
Two recent studies by economists at the University of Texas at Dallas suggest that people , at least in the context of a lab , are unexpectedly willing to donate to the government .
In one experiment , subjects were allotted $ 20 and given the chance to contribute anonymously to private organizations or specific government programs .
( They got to keep the balance . )
On average , they gave 22 percent of their money to the government , not much less than the 27 percent they gave to private charities .
The authors concluded that dislike of taxes may be not just a matter of reluctance to part with our money , or mistrust of the government :
It may be largely about the lack of control over where exactly our money goes .
The plan might generate revenue , but the real purpose is to encourage people to drive their cars less , with the goals of independence from foreign oil , mitigated climate change , and even fewer fatalities on the road .
It could appeal to environmentalists , proponents of energy independence , and people who wanted the initial cash infusion .
There ’s one obvious pitfall :
Those who already drive less would be more likely to participate .
But with the right leadership , Ayres says , it could be successfully promoted as the patriotic choice , luring enough Americans to have an impact .
“ Some of those people would opt into this program because it was the right thing to do , ” he says .
“ You might be willing to do that if you knew a good proportion of your fellow citizens were doing it also . ”
An example from abroad demonstrates the value of innovative leadership .
Antanas Mockus , the former mayor of Bogota , Colombia , included voluntary taxation in a larger agenda of experimenting with governance and civic engagement .
He asked citizens to pay an extra 10 percent in taxes , and about 63,000 people reportedly complied .
His tenure , which ended in 2003 , suggests that when people feel respected by and trusting of their government , they might be willing to donate to a general fund .
But as a rule , it seems that giving taxpayers some control over the funds is key .
The University of Texas economists found that when subjects were permitted to earmark their donations , contributions more than doubled .
Of a $ 20 budget , subjects gave on average $ 1.68 to a general government fund , while forking over $ 5.52 for cancer research and $ 4.04 for disaster relief .
Another important factor , the research found , seemed to be which entity was seen as responsible .
For instance , though on the whole participants gave somewhat larger amounts to private groups , they gave more to the government ( at the state level ) for education , because that is seen as falling under the government ’s purview .
The main implication of the research , Eckel believes , is that the government should encourage contributions for specific functions .
She suggests , for example , that citizens be able to donate directly to particular federal agencies .
Right now , she says , people might be willing to give to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which is heavily involved in responding to the Gulf oil spill .
Eckel envisions government websites adding a mechanism by which you could easily click and donate by credit card , in the manner that countless charitable organizations already do .
A significant expansion in this kind of giving would not be without risks .
Conceivably , it could offer a new way for the wealthy to peddle influence .
It also raises questions about the relationship between citizens and government .
Do n’t we elect officials to make informed decisions for us about how to allocate funds ?
Realistically , any upswing in voluntary taxes is likely to be modest .
But even a small change — if the opportunities became more available and more conspicuous , and a non-negligible fraction of citizens participated — could subtly reshape our conception of government and the citizen ’s role .
We could see paying taxes less as an impotent surrender and more as an assertion of our values , an investment in our society , and a means of making a difference , however limited .
“ To get bigger dollars out of it , I think you need bigger changes in consciousness , ” says Edward McCaffery , a law professor at the University of Southern California who studies taxes .
“ That might be a two - way street .
People are n’t going to do it more until they have more faith in government .
But people are n’t going to have more faith in government until they feel they have more stake and agency . ”
Perhaps eventually , “ We could be a different kind of society where we did n’t think of government in such adversarial terms , ” McCaffery says .
“ Things could snowball , you ’d have a virtuous cycle . ”
But , he adds , “ You still have the possibility of government blowing that trust . ”

BP chief executive Tony Hayward has been told by an angry US Congressional panel his firm ignored dangers when drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
House committee on energy and commerce chairman Henry Waxman said BP's " complacency " before the 20 April rig explosion had been " astonishing " .
He accused Mr Hayward of " stonewalling " for failing to answer his questions .
As a public relations exercise for BP , the hearing was a disaster , a BBC correspondent says .
ANALYSIS Maybe it was President Obama 's decision to dispatch the Attorney General - Eric Holder - to the Gulf Of Mexico a few weeks back to look into the possibility of criminal charges against BP that made the company 's CEO so cautious as he gave testimony .
Time after time , to their growing frustration , Tony Hayward told members of Congress that it would be " premature " to prejudge the outcome of investigations into the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon well nearly two months ago .
Mr Hayward 's reticence to be drawn further into the causes of the disaster led to growing frustration on the part of committee members , one of whom accused him of " stonewalling " .
Another recurring theme of Mr Hayward 's testimony was that he was n't personally involved in decisions relating to the construction of the well which could have impacted on safety .
Committee members had accused BP of cutting corners in order to get the well into operation , but Mr Hayward professed himself out of the loop on those matters .
" " With respect , sir , we drill hundreds of wells a year around the world , " he informed Republican committee member Michael Burgess .
" Yes I know , Mr Burgess replied dryly , " That 's what 's scaring me right now . "
Over and over , the BP chief refused to agree with the conclusions of a group of angry , hostile Congressmen and women who seemed in no doubt , after their own lengthy enquiries , that BP had shown a reckless lack of attention to safety , Paul Adams reports .
Infuriated by Mr Hayward 's inability or unwillingness to answer their questions , committee members resorted to expressing their disgust , more than one saying he felt insulted .
Eleven people died in the Deepwater Horizon drill rig accident , which left a ruptured well spewing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
Despite BP efforts to contain the leak , oil continues to enter the sea , threatening states along the Gulf coast .
BP says it will withhold dividends until the end of the year as part of its response to the spill .
The long - term hope for ending the spill rests with two relief wells now being drilled , one of which has reached two miles ( 3 km ) below the seabed , or about two - thirds of its way to its target , US disaster coordinator Admiral Thad Allen reported on Thursday .
It is planned is to seal the leak with concrete but that is not likely to happen until August at the earliest .
' Tremendous risks '
BP 's shares rose more than 6 % after it agreed to put $ 20 bn ( £ 13.5 bn ) in a fund to compensate victims of the spill .
The increase halted falls that had led to the company 's stock value halving in recent weeks .
Congressman Waxman said in his opening remarks that BP had " cut corner after corner " in order to save money , which led to the explosion and fire on board the Deepwater Horizon .
" We could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks BP was taking , " he went on .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
This is going very badly for Mr Hayward and for BP Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor Read Mark 's thoughts in full More comment and analysis
" We reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP , including your e-mails .
There is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well . "
He told Mr Hayward : " You 're not taking responsibility , you 're kicking the can down the road . "
One by one , other Congressmen , both Democrats and Republicans , questioned BP 's activities in America in a hearing which lasted some seven hours .
" We are not small people but we wish to get our lives back , " said Bart Stupak , playing on a comment made the day before by BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg about how BP sympathised with the " small people " of the Gulf , and a recent remark by Mr Hayward about wanting his " life back " .
Image caption Congressmen were angry at the effects of the oil spill
Texan Republican Michael Burgess expressed surprise when the BP chief said he had not known anything about the well in question until he was told in April that drilling had confirmed an oil discovery .
" But you 're the CEO of the company , " Congressman Burgess said .
" With due respect , " Mr Hayward replied , " we drill hundreds of wells around the world . "
" Yeah , that 's what scares me right now , " said Mr Burgess .
A row erupted within Republican ranks after another Texan Republican , Joe Barton , suggested BP had been subjected to a " $ 20bn shakedown " by the Obama administration .
Mr Barton , the senior Republican on Mr Waxman 's committee , was rebuked by his own party leaders and retracted his words , the Associated Press reports .
" I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , " he said in a statement .
BP pledge
Earlier , as Mr Hayward prepared to testify , a protester briefly disrupted the hearing , shouting that he should be " charged with a crime " before she was removed .
This week , the BBC is assessing the impact of the Louisiana oil spill .
Correspondents in the US , the Gulf of Mexico , Brazil , Nigeria and London are reporting for the BBC World Service , World News TV and the BBC News website .

She was identified as Diane Wilson , a fisherwoman from Seadrift , Texas , near the Gulf Coast .
Expressing his " deep regret " for the spill , Mr Hayward repeatedly stressed he was constrained in what he could say by the fact that a number of investigations into the explosion had yet to finish .
" There is nothing I have seen so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety , " he said at one point .
" If there are , then we 'll take action . "
He said he had focused on improving safety for the three years he had been in his post and his priority was ending the spill and clearing up the oil .
" I give my pledge as the leader of BP that we will not rest until we make this right , " he said .
Mr Hayward 's inability to answer specific technical questions about the situation on the rig angered the panel particularly .

BP 's chief executive said answers would be supplied by his firm when they were ready .
The questions , set out in a letter to Mr Hayward on Sunday by Mr Waxman and fellow committee member Bart Stupak , include allegations that BP :
Years of national denial about looming bankruptcy have turned to resentment as Greece is told how it must tackle its debt crisis
Deep inside the august halls of Athens University , the renowned political commentator Paschos Mandravelis will deliver a message this week that until very recently was lost on most Greeks .
His speech will focus on a single fact : that the country in the centre of the storm of Europe 's worst crisis since the creation of the common market , missed the biggest story ever – its own looming bankruptcy .
" Everyone , " he says , " starting with the Greek media , was in an incredible state of denial . "
Last week escapism was no longer an option as Greece 's debt drama claimed its first lives and the nation , teetering on the brink of economic collapse , erupted into violent protests over unprecedented austerity measures .
The deaths on Wednesday of three Greeks , killed in a fire set off by hooded youths throwing petrol bombs into the bank in which they worked , has been the wake - up call – one more shocking than ever thought – to ask questions Greeks would have preferred never to ask .
Yesterday , as tributes continued to pour in for the victims – a man and two women , all recent British university graduates who had shown up for work despite a general strike for fear of losing their jobs – they were asking : " How could it come to this ? "
" Greece , " says Mandravelis , " is not only confronted with economic failure but a media failure and political failure , and that is what is so frightening . "
The financial , and increasingly social , crisis gripping the country has , say analysts , brought the nation face to face with a myth : the myth of a democratic state that thrived not on meritocracy and progress but cronyism and corruption after the last chapter of its troubled history ended with the collapse of military rule in 1974 .
As Athens prepares to receive the biggest bailout in history – up to € 120bn dispensed from the EU and IMF over the next three years – the consensus is that Greece has reached rock bottom .
A point so low that even Brigadier Stylianos Pattakos , the last of the dictators still alive , feels unabashedly vindicated .
" In our time , " he told the Observer in an interview , " there was no debt .
Not one drachma went astray .
The Greeks are not disciplined like the Germans or the British .
They need authority . "
Today the junta is embodied not by the likes of Pattakos , who at the age of 98 has no qualms about his role in quashing liberty in the birthplace of democracy , but the IMF .
For the unions and tens of thousands who took to the streets last week – and are girding their loins for the " mother of all battles " in the weeks and months ahead – the Washington - based body is neither saint nor saviour .
Prime minister George Papandreou agreed to activate the emergency international aid after it became clear two weeks ago that Greece was heading for sovereign default , unable to refinance its staggering € 300bn ( £ 259 bn ) debt because of prohibitively high borrowing costs on international markets .
But for those on the left , leading the protests with flags emblazoned with the hammer and sickle , the intervention of the IMF has been the tipping point .
The majority of Greeks not only see it as the harbinger of harsh economic reforms but the symbol of foreign occupation .
For the abundance of conspiracy theorists on both the left and right , its involvement is part of a grander , but seemingly no less implausible , plan to subjugate Greece after draining the country of its resources .
" This has gone beyond economic matters to a battle for national independence , " says Manolis Glezos , the leftist who shot to fame snatching the swastika from the Acropolis shortly after Hitler 's forces streamed into Athens in 1941 .
" Papandreou himself has admitted we had no say in the economic measures thrust upon us .
They were decided by the EU and IMF .
We are now under foreign supervision and that raises questions about our economic , military and political independence . "
At approaching 88 , Glezos embodies the Greek spirit of resistance – a leading light in the struggle against Nazi occupation , bloody civil war , authoritarian right - wing rule and the seven - year military dictatorship that ended with Pattakos sending a tank crashing through the gates of the Athens Polytechnic to crush the students ' revolt that would pave the way to the regime 's demise .
" We are , " he says , " neither at the middle nor the end of political developments , of protesting what is happening in this country .
We are at the beginning . "
The Greeks ' innate anti-authoritarianism , a legacy of 400 years of Ottoman rule , is also at the heart of the problem that has helped to push their country to what President Karolos Papoulias described last week as " the brink of the abyss " .
More than any other European nation , the Greeks think nothing of taking to the streets in noisy outbursts of protests .
But more than that , in a culture of cutting corners , they also have a problem with being told what to do .
It is an attitude that could have profound consequences for Papandreou 's ability to enforce policies that include painful wage and pension cuts – and the course of the crisis .
" The capriciousness of Ottoman rule and the weakness of the idea of the rule of law helped to shape the underlying values of Greek society and to determine attitudes to the state and to authorities that have persisted into the present , " wrote Richard Clogg , Britain 's pre-eminent historian of modern Greece .
Nothing encapsulates the strained relationship with authority more than the nation 's predilection for avoiding the taxman – a hobby that has helped to push the public deficit to a European record – and Greeks ' love - hate relationship with the state .
Assuming power after five years of scandal - plagued conservative rule last October , the Socialist government discovered that the tax inspectorate had virtually collapsed with revenue losses from tax evasion surpassing € 20bn , more than any other eurozone nation .
It also emerged that fewer than 15,000 Greeks declare incomes of over € 100,000 , despite tens of thousands living in opulent wealth on the outskirts of the capital .
A new drive by the Socialists to track down swimming pool owners by deploying Google Earth was met with a virulent response as Greeks invested in fake grass , camouflage and asphalt to hide the tax liabilities from the spies in space .
The country 's black economy – estimated conservatively at 30 % – has also helped to bring public finances to the point of meltdown .
" When the rest of Europe were living in dukedoms and refining democratic institutions , we were part of a huge empire living in an agrarian and feudal Balkan state , " said Nikos Dimou , author of the best - selling book The Misfortune of Being Greek .
" We had little relationship to our glorious past .
Our institutions were imported or thrust upon us , our identity both eastern and western .
It created a human being that feels very strange in his skin , culturally very different to other Europeans . "
Dimou wrote the book in the latter years of the junta , but with ordinary Greeks now embroiled in the sort of soul - searching last seen at the end of the junta , the tome is selling like hotcakes .
" Greeks want to know why they have got to this point , what went wrong , " he says .
The austerity measures that have provoked such unrest aim to trim the budget of € 30bn through 2012 .
Almost all are targeted at the country 's dysfunctional and bloated public sector .
" Papandreou is paying for the sins of his father [ former prime minister ]
Andreas , under whom Greece 's debt soared , " added Dimou .
" The cuts he will have to make have never been made before .
It is all very new . "
But with poverty growing and the country 's militant Communist party insisting that " the plutocracy pay " for the crisis , Greece could also be headed for a new class warfare the likes of which have never been seen before .
Some commentators have not ruled out kidnappings and assassinations as Greek turns against Greek in the months ahead .
The conspiracy of silence that has marked Greece 's troubles may be over , but the battle that could tear it apart has only just begun .

From the Association of American Railroads : Rail Time Indicators .
The AAR reports traffic in May 2010 was up 15.8 % compared to May 2009 - and traffic was still 11.8 % lower than in May 2008 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows U.S. average weekly rail carloads .
Traffic increased in 18 of 19 major commodity categories YoY .
From AAR :
• U.S. freight railroads originated 1,153,675 carloads in May 2010 , an average of 288,419 carloads per week .
That ’s up 15.8 % from May 2009 ( which is the second highest percentage gain ever , behind April 2010 — see chart ... ) but down 11.8 % from May 2008 .
• U.S. railroads averaged 294,758 carloads per week in April 2010 and 288,793 in March 2010 .
Thus , May 2010 ’s average was actually down slightly from those months ...
One month does not a trend make , but it would obviously be worrisome if the decline continued .
• As was the case in April 2010 , the big year - over - year percentage gains in May 2010 U.S. rail traffic were partly a function of easy comparisons ( May 2009 was a miserable month for rail traffic ) and partly a function of real traffic growth .
• For the purposes of AAR rail traffic data , May 2010 consists of the four weeks ending May 29 — i.e. , it does not include Memorial Day , which was May 31 this year .
However , the May 2009 and May 2008 comparison months do include Memorial Day .
The net result is that May 2010 data is a bit overstated relative to the two previous years , and June 2010 will be a bit understated relative to the two previous years .
It is impossible to know exactly how much rail traffic is affected .
excerpts with permission
As the graph above shows , rail traffic collapsed in November 2008 , and now eleven months into the recovery , traffic has only recovered about half way .
This is more evidence of a sluggish recovery ... and the decline in May is concerning , although one month does not make a trend ( and May was " a bit overstated " due to the timing of Memorial Day ) .
The bad news weighed not merely on the dollar but also on equity markets around the world .
The FTSE 100 index fell by 111.12 points or 2.3 pc to 4805.75 points - leaving it well shy of the psychologically important 5,000 mark .
Its fall was mirrored across Europe , as investors took fright in the face of another day of disappointing data .
Over in the US , the S&P 500 Index fell for a fourth straight day , down 1.2 pc in late trading , while the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 pc down at 9669.35 points .
" You must shoot if you want to score . "

I 've spent a couple of posts on the players that take the least amount of shots on goal and in doing so discovered that Jason Strudwick 's 2009 - 2010 performance was record - breaking , though not necessarily in a good way .
The subject of forwards came up in the comments of the latter of the two posts , so I ran the numbers .
Limiting the results to forwards only led me to the discovery that both 2008 - 2009 and 2009 - 2010 were also record - breaking for another player in the Northwest Division .
Sorry Kent , it was n't Derek Boogaard .
The NHL began recording time on ice stats in 1998 , so we have eleven seasons of data to work with .
Listed below are the twenty - five worst shots on goal seasons by forwards only since 1998 , ordered by shots per sixty minutes of time on ice .
I 've ignored " goons " by using a minimum standard of 600 minutes of time on ice , equivalent to sixty games and ten minutes of time on ice per game .
Using only sixty games as I did with defensemen did n't pick up a number of the third and fourth liners on the list , so I used a time on ice minimum instead .
Like the list of overall worst seasons , the shots per sixty minutes tells a story , a story that we 'll call the " Ballad Of Ryan Johnson " .
Ryan Johnson has the record for the lowest amount of shots on goal per minute , but as far as a career goes , Johnson is going to need some additional terrible seasons to threaten Kelly Buchberger .
Don Cherry defended Johnson from the evils of those dumb dumb Corsi adherents , and we 'll certainly be mindful of Johnson 's zonestart when thinking this through , but Ryan Johnson has the two worst shots on goal seasons by a forward since 1998 .
He 's the only regular , non - goon forward in the league to not average two shots per sixty minutes of time on ice since 1998 , and he 's done it twice .
Oneiromancer ( Specialist Wizard )
- Sigmund Freud
Note :
The oneiromancer uses material from the Heroes of Horror and Complete Arcane supplements .
It is recommended that you have access to those books in order to use this specialist wizard .
As technology advances in a civilization , magic use begins to wane .
Ironically , this causes many mages to begin specializing in extremely diverse roles that adapt to the changing times .
One such spellcaster , the oneiromancer focuses in the use of dreams and travel to the dreamscape .
The oneiromancer ( ON - air - O - man - sir ) is an especially sought after mage because his focus in all things sleep - related allows him to do such mundane skills such as dream interpretation or sleep therapy or fantastic feats like protecting their charges from assaults through the dreamscape .
Many of the oneiromancer 's spells are sleep and dream - focused .
Even an unskilled oneiromancer can put his enemies into a deep slumber .
They may also learn to travel through the dreamscape , to project horrifying visions and to impose their will on those around them .
For the most part , an oneiromancer is focused on making a living and if possible , usually sets up a shop or clinic in a large city .
A few become travelers , moving from place to place , working for those who can afford their unique services .
An adventuring oneiromancer does n't usually pack the same kind of punch as other wizards , but possesses far more subtle powers than a fireball and can be a great asset to any party of adventurers .
After all , most creatures have to sleep some time .
Alignment : Any .
Although oneiromancers are usually lawful , occasionally a chaotic oneiromancer will spread fear and doom around the land recklessly .
They have no particular bent towards either good or evil , and most are neutral in that respect .
Hit Die : d4 .

The oneiromancer is a variant wizard .
Unless otherwise noted , an oneiromancer advances in the same manner as a wizard ( same base attack bonus , saving throw bonuses , skill points and so on ) .
When a character elects to take a level of wizard or oneiromancer , he may not later take levels in the other class .
This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st - level wizard twice .
An oneiromancer can prepare as many spells per day as a regular specialist .
Spellbooks :
Just like a wizard , an oneiromancer must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells .
He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook , except for read magic , which all oneiromancers can prepare from memory .
School Specialization :
An oneiromancer is a specialist wizard ( see page 57 of the Player 's Handbook ) specializing in a distinctive school of magic unique to oneiromancers .
Unlike typical wizard schools , the oneiromancer 's school of magic regroups spells especially suited towards sleep and dreaming .
As such , the oneiromancer school of magic allows him to cast spells not typically available to other wizards ( not available on the wizard spell list ) .
As a type of specialist wizard , an oneiromancer can prepare one additional spell of this specialty school per spell level each day , as normal .
These spells go on the oneiromancer 's spell list , allowing him to prepare them in any spell slot .
He also gains a + 2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells of this school .
The oneiromancer 's prohibited schools are always evocation and necromancy , and he may never learn or cast spells from them .
An oneiromancer cannot become a specialist in any other school .
The oneiromancer 's school includes the following spells .
Spells marked with an asterisk can be found in the supplement Heroes of Horror .
Dreamtelling :
At 1st level , the oneiromancer gains the Dreamtelling feat ( see Heroes of Horror ) .
This allows even the lowliest of oneiromancer apprentices to interpret dreams .
Summon Dream - Familiar :
At 3rd level , the oneiromancer learns to summon a familiar .
This works exactly like summoning a normal familiar ( including the costs normally incurred ) , except the oneiromancer 's familiar is drawn from the dreamscape and gains the pseudonatural creature template ( see Complete Arcane ) .
The oneiromancer 's familiar gains abilities as if he were a standard wizard of two levels lower .
Oneiromancy :
At 5th level the oneiromancer becomes better adapted to working within the world of dreams .
As such , they gain the Oneiromancy feat ( see Heroes of Horror ) .
Dream Knowledge : Oneiromancers study the forces of dreams to the exclusion of most other fields .
At 10th level , they gain a +3 bonus to Knowledge ( arcane ) and Knowledge ( the planes ) checks .
Spell Focus :
At 15th level , the oneiromancer gains the Spell Focus feat choosing either Enchantment or Illusion .
At 20th level , they gain Spell Focus in the school that they did not choose at the previous opportunity .
Table 1-01 - Oneiromancy Spells Level Spells 0 daze , ghost sound , guidance 1st comprehend languages , hypnotism , restful slumber * , silent image , sleep 2nd detect thoughts , hypnotic pattern , touch of idiocy , undetectable alignment 3rd deep slumber , good hope , major image , nondetection , sculpt sound 4th crushing despair , dream walk* , manifest desire* , manifest nightmare * 5th dream , dreaming puppet* , nightmare , symbol of sleep 6th find the path , mislead , repulsion , true seeing 7th dream sight * , plane shift , sequester 8th antipathy , sympathy , temporal stasis 9th etherealness , foresight , gate Table 1-02 - The Oneiromancer Class

Using the Oneiromancer in Your Campaign
Oneiromancers are designed for the 1800s campaign , meant as a representation of the psychiatric sciences that began to come into prominence in the later part of the century .
That does n't mean that they should be restricted to that setting though .
Oneiromancers might simply be esoteric wizards , or an interesting alternative to the traditional diviner as they use the power of dreams to predict future events .
They may be foils or enemies of psions , both claiming the mind as their exclusive domain .
Oneiromancers may even be villains who seek to unleash nightmares on the world , perhaps even taking levels in the Alienist ( Complete Arcane ) or Dread Witch ( Heroes of Horror ) prestige classes .
Oneiromancers do best in settings with multiplanar travel .
The city of Sigil provides easy access to the planes , and a large customer base that an oneiromancer might take advantage of when setting up shop .
Particularly evil oneiromancers might find themselves swept away into the Domains of Dread , turning to preying on the weak minded in a city like Il Aluk .
If you 're using the Manual of the Planes supplement , consider adding the dream travel spell to the oneiromancy spell list , and the lucid dreaming skill to the oneiromancer 's class skills .
Both are purely optional , but provide more dream - related abilities that the oneiromancer can take advantage of .
In the Eberron campaign setting , most oneiromancers come from Sarlona .
Understandably , quori can be edgy about the very idea of a spellcaster specializing in ways that can easily subvert and destroy them , so the average oneiromancer can expect to be put to death if their particular training is discovered by the wrong person .
Humans , chosen and the occasional kalashtar make up the majority of oneiromancers .
If you have access to the Secrets of Sarlona supplement , add dream lock , mass dream lock and dream spirit to the list of oneiromancy spells .
You may also want to consider taking the dreamtouched feats from this book , as they provide several dream - related abilities that can be very useful .
My Character Does n't Dream !
Some races , like elves and kalashtar either do n't sleep or do n't dream .
Why on earth would a member of that race want to become an oneiromancer ?
Oneiromancy is not an introspective pursuit .
While the concept of dreaming might be alien to races that are incapable of it , the Plane of Dreams is a tangible place that they may one day visit .
These races may take a more analytical view of their school of magic , learning to harness it as a weapon or as a tool that can be used to help understand other people better .

Some of you might remember the great MongoDB saga , which ended with me migrating from MongoDB to SQLite after losing my data more often than not .
After the Nth time I lost my data , I decided I had enough and decided to migrate to SQLite .
I also decided not to use MongoDB for historious , as I had originally planned .
I wanted to share my story with the world , just to give people another use case .
This is that story .
For reference , everything below ran on a Core 2 Duo MacBook Santa Rosa with 2 GB of RAM and an intel X25 - M 160 GB SSD .
Shortly after deciding to migrate to SQLite , I wrote a simple program to get documents from MongoDB and insert them into an SQLite database using Elixir ( and , by extension , SQLAlchemy ) .
I used transactions and did one commit every 1,000 documents , to speed things up .
After my first run , however , I discovered that it took ages to complete 1,000 insertions .
It was n’t unbearably slow , but it was slow enough that it would take two days to insert the 3,000,000 user rows I had , not to mention the other 70,000,000 rows of relationships I had to insert later .
For a short while I considered leaving my data in MongoDB and just making many , many backups , but then I decided to persevere and try to see if postgres was any faster on my single - user use case .
In short , it was n’t .
Insertions took about the same time on the two databases .
I did notice , however , that the script was CPU - bound , which did n’t seem right .
I figured that most time should be spent in memory I/O instead of CPU , so I tried to bypass the ORM and use raw SQL statements .
That sped up my program by more than ten times .
Where MongoDB took about 5 seconds for 1,000 insertions , SQLite takes 0.3 .
That is more than an entire order of magnitude !
To be fair to MongoDB , however , I was using pymongo , which I ’m sure took a fair chunk of CPU to run .
I think that pymongo should be faster than Elixir , since it has fewer things to do , but I might be way off on this .
During the course of the migration , I killed SQLite many a time while it was writing .
My database did get corrupt once ( because I killed it and then deleted the journal , so you ca n’t really blame SQLite for it ) , but all I had to do is dump and restore it , and all my data was back ( or , at least , most of it , enough that I did n’t notice any missing ) .
This is in contrast to MongoDB , which lost , over the time I used it , more data than it stored ( by my count , literally ) .
In summary , I am very very impressed with SQLite .
3,000 insertions a second is nothing to sneer at ( this is with checking for duplicates and failing if they exist , so they are n’t pure inserts ) , and it provides strong durability in one , self - contained file .
I would still use MongoDB , but only if I really really needed a schemaless database , I had only a few thousand rows and I did n’t care about the data in it at all .
For anything else , I would use an ACID - compliant database , and SQLite is a great fit if the use is single - user .
I ’m not sure how SQLite fares on multi-user cases because I have n’t tested it yet , but for all other uses and for data gathering , it has exceeded even my most optimistic expectations .
As always , this is in no way meant to be objective , and this should go without saying .
It is just what I encountered , and it might not be representative at all of the norm .
Also , I have no axe to grind with any database , and I started with MongoDB with the best intentions .
I hope that someday MongoDB can reach the level of ACID - compliant databases , not only in terms of usefulness but also of speed .
More robust , open software benefits the community as a whole .

This post was updated at 1:56 p.m .
Crews were doing basic inspections of bridges throughout Maryland and the District after a 3.6 magnitude earthquake jolted the region early Friday , transportation officials said .
So far , so good .
Besides a natural gas leak at a maintenance depot in the Gaithersburg - Rockville area that may have had nothing to do with the earthquake , officials have found no evidence of damage after residents awakened to wobbling homes at precisely 5:04:47 a.m .
" There 's not a single tree branch down , " Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief Scott Graham said .
" This was a nonevent , thank God . "
Still , many residents dialed 911 to report the rumbling .
A zoomed view of the wooded area at the epicenter of Friday 's quake in Germantown .
( Bill O'Leary / Post )
At Montgomery County 's emergency center , as many as 100 confused people called in during or just after the earthquake .
" We were inundated with calls from people not knowing what it was , " said Gloria Jackson , a communications supervisor at the center .
Carroll Ripley of Germantown said his first guess was that an explosion had been set off or perhaps a plane soared low overhead .
" The whole house shook , " he said .
" I went straight outside to do a perimeter check -- in my underwear . ”
The quake ’s epicenter was in the Germantown - Gaithersburg area near I - 270 and Route 119 ( 39.167°N , 77.252°W ) , according to USGS .
It was 3.1 miles deep .
The fault 's slide " probably only lasted a second or two , " Mike Blanpied , a USGS geologist , told Post readers during an online chat .
The resulting vibrations , he said , may have been felt for 10 seconds or more .

Amy Vaughan , a geophysicist with the USGS , said the quake was the largest recorded within about 45 miles of Germantown since a database was created to track such activity in 1974 .
The largest earthquake before Friday morning 's was a 2.7 tremor in 1993 , Vaughan said .
There was a 2.6 - magnitude tremor in 1990 and quakes measuring 2.5 in 1997 , 1993 and 1974 .
" It ’s not something that ’s completely out of the ordinary , " Vaughan said .
Q&A recap : Mike Blanpied of USGS
Audio : USGS official , residents discuss quake .
At the same time , quakes measuring above 3 are extremely rare in this area .
Vaughan said the number of people reporting the quake to the USGS highlighted how unusual it seemed to residents of the Mid-Atlantic states .
Within about two hours of the quake , more than 6,700 people had reported it on the agency 's Web site .
Most were from the District , Maryland , Virginia and Delaware , but reports came from as far away as New York and Georgia .
Many found it thrilling .
" It felt like the earth was churning , " said Linda Wheeler of Monrovia in Frederick County .
" I knew it was an earthquake right away because it was unlike anything I 've ever experienced .
It was actually kinda cool .
" David Hayes of Boyds was getting dressed when he said he heard a loud rumbling .
“ I opened my front door and yelled ' earthquake ' toward my neighbor .
Great way to start the day ! ” he said .
Reader forum : Discuss your experiences
The first question journalists asked President Obama Friday morning , when he appeared outside the White House to discuss the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , was whether he felt the earthquake at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
NW .
No , the leader of the free world answered with a slight smile , " I did not . "
Geologists note that earthquakes can occur anytime and anywhere .
They are a natural phenomenon resulting from the movements of continental plates along faults under the Earth 's surface .
" These faults just naturally exist and over time they build up pressure , " Vaughan said .
When the pressure is released at a high enough intensity , an earthquake results .
The earliest recorded earthquake in Maryland occurred in Annapolis on April 24 , 1758 , and lasted a full 30 seconds , according to a history posted on the USGS Web site .
There have been other tremors reported periodically in the region through the years .
None caused any significant damage , according to the Web site .
Story : Recall the Annandale quake of ' 08 ?
See Post 's coverage .
The confusion following Friday 's quake led to some misplaced theories on its cause .
Dean Miletich of Frederick said he was taking out the trash when the rumbling started .
“ When I came back into the garage , everything on the shelves was shaking , ” he said .
“ It sounded like a deep rumble .
When I came back inside , my wife had woken up and asked me , ' What did you do ? ’ ”

Bodies of Murdered Disappeared From Flotilla
Where Are the Bodies of the other people who were murdered on the humanitarian ship Flottila ?
Which are the countries allied with Israel which helped to hide the names of the victims from the public ?
Are the other dead persons , whose names Israel erased from the list of victims , holders of fake passports or Israeli infiltrators among the peace activists on board of the ship ?
What is the story behind decreasing the number of murdered persons by Israel ?
German Parliamentarian Inge Hoeger stated that peace activists murdered by the Israeli last Monday were 19 persons and not 10 ( or 9 ) as the Israeli government says .
This serious statement contradicts the Israeli allegations and was delivered during her speech before a huge demo organized on Sunday June 6 2010 in Berlin as a protest against the criminal Israeli attack on the humanitarian ships .
German MP
Hoeger demanded that Israel must return the ships , which were stolen from their owners during the israeli piracy act , and transfer the humanitarian supplies and aid to the besieged Gaza Strip .
MP Hoeger described what happened in international waters in the Mediterranean as a massacre against the civilians which added to the track record of massacres in Gaza and other Palestinian territories by the Israeli army .
BP Atlantis munchicken on flickr Suddenly regulators are paying more attention to a former BP worker who has been complaining since 2009 that his company did not get approval on engineering plans , according to WaPo .
Kenneth Abbott testified at hearings today :
WaPo :
" The overwhelming majority of documents and drawings had never received any engineering approval at any phase of development , " Kenneth W. Abbott , who was fired in February 2009 , says in testimony prepared for delivery Thursday to a House subcommittee .
Although MMS and BP have previously dismissed Abbott 's claims , now both organizations have lost a lot of credibility .
As the BP Atlantis could face a new examination , so could dozens of BP rigs that Tony Hayward said were drilled with the same procedures used with the Deepwater Horizon .
Large numbers of people may be suffering in silence from the terrible condition of " sexsomnia " - somewhat like sleepwalking , but instead of wandering around the sufferer attempts to have sex with people .
According to results announced at a recent conference for sleep scientists , some 7.6 per cent of patients being treated for snooze - related disorders " reported that they had initiated or engaged in sexual activity with a bed partner while asleep " .
" There have been no previous studies of how frequently sexsomnia occurs , " said Sharon A Chung of the Sleep Research Laboratory in Toronto .
" While our finding of eight percent of people reporting sexsomnia seems really a high number , it should be stressed that we only studied patients referred to a sleep clinic .
So , we would expect the numbers to be much lower in the general population . "
While happy to report sleep - shagging on a questionnaire , it seems that sexsomnia sufferers were much more reluctant to discuss their snoozy shenanigans face - to - face with a doc .
Chung noted that only four of 832 patients expressed a complaint about sexsomnia during a consultation with a sleep specialist .
" It seems that patients generally do n't discuss this with their doctors , " she said .
Readers may or may not be surprised to note that sleep - rogering is far more common in men ( 11 per cent ) than women ( four per cent ) .
Sexsomniacs are also twice as likely as average to admit to illicit drug use , though there appears to be no link to smoking or caffeine .

Jobs figures do n’t tell the same story everywhere
14 Jul 2010 , by John Wood in Labour market
The jobs figures are out today , and show a headline rate of five JSA claimants chasing every job vacancy listed at Jobcentre Plus .
This does n’t tell the whole story though , and there are huge regional variations , from 43.2 claimants competing for every job opening in Hackney North , through to just 0.7 in Lichfield .
I ’ve made ( with the help of some great code made available by Tim Craft ) an interactive map , that lets you see what this data means at a glance .

Dareta , Nigeria ( CNN ) --
In remote northern Nigeria , it is now a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in the world 's worst - ever recorded outbreak of lead poisoning .
Officially 163 people have already died in Zamfara state -- 111 of them children .
But no one knows the true figures .
" You read about it in the literature but several hundred children have died here as a result of what happened here , " says Ian von Lindern from the environmental engineering organization the Blacksmith Institute , which is heading the clean - up operation in the region .
Children began to die in January , but only now in June has the clean - up operation begun in the mud-hut village of Dareta .
Using the only tools available -- crude metal hoes normally used for farming -- local villagers are trying to clear the contaminated topsoil from the worst - affected housing compounds .
Dug up , the soil is put into plastic bags and buried far from the village .
Young children look on as their friends and family wear unfamiliar white protective suits and face masks .
And they inhale more of the stirred - up dust .
The U.S. - based Blacksmith Institute -- a global leader in pollution clean - up operations -- has found disturbingly high levels of lead across the village .
" The fact that this is 10,000 parts per million -- which is 1 percent lead -- that 's very high , " explains Casey Bartram of the Blacksmith Institute .
In the U.S. , the standard for residential - area soils is normally 400 parts per million .
" Because lead particles are so small , the levels so high , and because in this environment the kids are always in contact with the soil -- it 's extremely dangerous for them to be exposed to levels like these , " says Bartram .
The Blacksmith Institute currently is trying to help clean up a toxic lead site in Senegal where , in the last few years , 18 people died .
Until now , it was the worst case of lead poisoning anyone had seen .
" We were asked if we 'd come over and look at this [ site ] so we only planned on a four - day visit -- but it 's so bad we just have to stay and do what we can , " says von Lindern .
Many of the men in the region are gold miners .
They bring the metal ore mined from the local mines back to be crushed by their wives and children in their homes .
Unbeknownst to them , the gold ore contains extremely high levels of lead .
The ore processing has since been moved out of most of the villages and , in theory , the lead could be cleared away .
" I will instruct all the people to excavate their houses , " the local chief , Mohammed Bello , declares .
" But it will be difficult to enforce because of poverty . "
There are also many other problems .
Just getting to Dareta village takes several hours ' drive -- a journey that will soon be made almost impossible with the oncoming rains .
And with the rains coming , the young men working to clear away the contaminated earth are anxious to get to their farms .
Simba Terima of the Blacksmith Institute is helping train them in safely removing the contaminated soil .
" This is a local problem , this is not an international problem , " he says .
" So if they can own it , it 'll be very good because long , long after we 're gone they will be here . "
It is hoped that Dareta village will be cleared in 26 days , but manpower is still lacking .
The local government , apart from handing out red election hats for an upcoming vote , is almost nowhere to be seen .
" I tell you that the problem has now been contained and we are now on remediation , " explains Abubakar Maru , the local environmental commissioner .
" I 'm sure these measures are good enough . "
The government claims there have been no more fatalities since it first identified the problem as lead poisoning .
However , Dareta is only one of seven villages identified with extremely toxic levels of lead -- and the only village in the region receiving an on - going clean - up operation .
From reports , some of the other villages are not being monitored properly .
And there has been no thorough report on whether there are more villages suffering from the same toxic levels of lead .
" We hope to do just this village before the rainy season , but by mid-July there 'll be so much rain we wo n't be able to , and we 'll have to wait until October , " says von Lindern .
" The kids will still be exposed . "
On Sunday , the village cleared its first compound .
For now , villagers are just taking it one home at a time .
In the Bawdy section of the Rude Britannia : British Comic
Art exhibition which opened this week at Tate Britain , there 's a disembodied fibre - glass arm .
It pokes rudely out the gallery wall , attached to a metal spring that causes it to move , rhythmically , up and down .
The arm ends in a hand whose fingers are closed around an invisible object – but there 's no mystery about what the object might be .
The title of Sarah Lucas 's piece is Wanker .
Many of us , I 'm sorry to say , will have seen that slow , strumming gesture sketched in the air by drivers who have just overtaken us on the M4 .
It 's a masterstroke by Ms Lucas to select it as an embodiment of British rudeness , for it does several things with admirable economy .
It accuses us of habitual masturbation ( much ruder and more personal than calling us a fool or a cuckold ) , it shakes an aggressive fist , it impersonates a large and intimidating phallus , and it gesticulates at its enemies with a kind of insulting slowness .
God we 're rude , are n't we ?
The British are so rude .
We 're obsessed with bums , tits , willies , lavatory humour , vicars , knickers , smells , foreigners , fat tummies , fat slags , Fat Les , fat wrestlers , Benny Hill , Carry On Up The Khyber , Viz , Private Eye , men dressed as laydeez , women dressed as anarchic schoolgirls , sitcoms that offer howling tsunamis of verbal abuse , from The Young Ones to The Thick Of It .
We love to see an irate , fictional British hotelier smacking his Spanish waiter around the head .
We admire the host of BBC2's Newsnight when he roasts politicians with scarcely believable belligerence .
We quiver when a middle - aged , redheaded quiz - show hostess tells her guests how thick , ugly and badly dressed they are .
We lap up radio shows in which grouchily opinionated men insult members of the public who hold views contrary to their own .
We celebrate Christmas by buying our loved ones " lavatory books " with titles like Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Complete Shit In Pants ?
And we love to consider our own rudeness .
Rude Britannia is also the umbrella title for six hours of programmes broadcast on BBC4 next Monday , examining whether Britain has become " an impossibly rude and selfish country " , with special reference to Till Death Do Us Part and the life of Kenneth Tynan .
And this month sees the inaugural exhibition of the " international cult cartoonists and animators " behind Modern Toss magazine , with its colourfully offensive adventures of Mr Tourette and the Drive - By Abuser .
How did we become addicted to rudeness – in the sense of fart - joke vulgarity as well as personal insult ?
Is it a phenomenon of British art history , a leitmotif of British popular culture , or something firmly engrained in the British character ?
It 's clear what motivated Hogarth , " the founding father of British art " .
He was driven by a wholesale dislike of the very un-Englishness of the " age of elegance " .
He hated the upper classes ' obsession with foreign art and foreign styles .
Houses were designed according to the principles of Palladio and his fellow Italians .
Furniture was either French or constructed by English cabinet - makers from French or Italian styles .
Aristocrats loved collecting foreign artworks , and favoured rococo luxuriance and classic themes from the school of Boucher .
Viewing the scene with a jaundiced eye , Hogarth complained about the invasion of bloody foreigners .
Picture dealers , he griped , were " continually importing shiploads of dead Christs , Holy Families , Madonnas and other dismal , dark subjects , neither entertaining nor ornamental ... "
He looked at the faces of Olympian loveliness and was n't impressed : " That grand Venus ( as you are pleased to call it ) has not beauty enough for the character of an English cook - maid . "
Instead of painting predictable subjects from the Bible , from mythology or French pastoral scenes , he gave the world vulgar realism .
His prints are crammed with character , action , behavioural giveaways , tortured animals , lecherous clergymen and fair day revels .
They fairly reek with decay and misbehaviour , drink and venery , sex and violence , even though the surroundings are often magnificent drawing rooms .
What is Hogarth doing in these paintings ?
He is ( excuse my French ) taking the piss .
In roughly the same period – the reign of George II – literary satire was growing fangs .
In the forefront was Jonathan Swift , dean of St Patrick 's Cathedral , Dublin .
Though born in Dublin , Swift came from blunt Yorkshire stock .
He is central to any discussion of British rudeness , not only because his career was a series of furious attacks on politicians and clergymen but because he was obsessed with shit .
Critics prefer to talk about his " excremental vision " but it amounts to the same thing .
Among his scatological poems is the tender " Cassinus and Peter " , which sings of the loveliness of his lady friend before concluding : " No wonder how I lost my wits / Oh , Celia Celia , Celia shits ! "
His is the ultimate rejection of polite society as a fatuous concealment of reality .
As one critic put it , Swift 's excremental obsession was his way of insisting that " sublimation – that is to say , all civilised behaviour – is a lie " .
Indeed .
Gulliver 's Travels is a brilliantly comprehensive satire on the puniness of human ( especially political ) ambitions , the grossness of human physicality , the folly of scientific enquiry and the bankruptcy of human morals .
It is , one can say , the rudest insult to humanity ever devised .
Swift 's successors found it hard to stomach .
William Thackeray wrote : " When Gulliver first lands among the Yahoos , the naked , howling wretches clamber up trees and assault him , and he describes himself as ' almost stifled with the filth which fell about him ' .
The reader of the fourth part of Gulliver 's Travels is like the hero himself in this instance .
It is Yahoo language : a monster gibbering shrieks , and gnashing imprecations against mankind – tearing down all shreds of modesty , past all sense of manliness and shame ; filthy in word , filthy in thought , furious , raging , obscene . "
These are strong words from Thackeray , himself no slouch when it came to satirising human folly and venality .
But they express a sentiment – " You have gone too far " – that 's central to British rudeness .
One of the most shocking exhibits in the Rude Britannia exhibition is Gerald Scarfe 's caricature of Mrs Mary Whitehouse , the Sixties Christian " Clean Up TV " campaigner .
After she complained about the " Schoolkids Issue " of Oz , the underground magazine , in 1971 , Scarfe produced a drawing entitled Mrs Mary Righteous explains her position to the Pope , in which she is depicted lying , spread - eagled and fishnet - stockinged , before the supreme pontiff , engaging in sex with Rupert Bear .
( It 's the revelation of her underwear that 's most disturbing ) .
An outraged Mrs Whitehouse sued Scarfe and The Times .
In a letter to Scarfe ( which is on show at the exhibition ) , the newspaper 's lawyer explained : " I think a jury would probably award Mrs W some damages ...
My belief is that the average jury would think : ' He ca n't get away with this ! ' "
Going too far , getting away with it , pushing your luck – there 's something schoolboyish about British rudeness , about being quite the naughtiest kid in the class .
And how quickly the connoisseur of British humour moves from naughtiness to bodily functions .
The Fifties cabaret duo Flanders and Swann had a routine called " Mum 's Out , Dad's Out , Let 's Talk Rude " , which climaxed with the line : " Pee , poo , belly , bum , drawers " .
One looks at the high number of bottoms and willies in the Rude Britannia show , and marvels at how fundamental our sense of humour has always been .
Paul Sandby 's startling 1784 aquatint , Coelum ipsum petimus Stultitia , seems to offer the spectacle of a gigantic hot - air balloon catching fire in a London field ; it is , in fact , a colossal arse blowing clouds of smoke and flames into the sky , taking the mickey out of scientific breakthroughs in human flight .
An anonymous hand in 1740 made an etching called Idol - Worship or The Way to Preferment , which shows two men finding their path to the corridors of power blocked by another massive human bottom , which they have to kiss before they can get anywhere .
There is surely a political dimension in our fondness for fundaments , and it's to do with British people 's attitude to the monarchy .
Before the English Civil War , it would have been considered extremely unwise to criticise the Crown .
We cannot imagine , say , Henry VIII responding well to caricature or lampoon .
After the Restoration , when the divine right of kings was no more and government was decided by democratic franchise , attitudes to the monarchy could be more robustly expressed .
When William I appeared from Germany to sit on the English throne , awkward in manner and unable to speak English , he was ridiculed in public by wits such as Lady Mary Wortley Montague .
By the time his son William II inherited the throne , the monarch 's powers had dwindled .
Artists and engravers felt free to depict the king as an ordinary man who belched , farted , picked his nose and mistreated his wife .
The social satires of 18th - century Britain – the heyday of Gillray , Cruikshank and Rowlandson as well as Hogarth – are the result of this empowerment , this freedom to be rude to the highest in the land , this thumbing of the popular nose at monarchy and authority .
It was beyond belief that such an attitude could have flourished in France after the return of the Bourbon monarchy , or in Italy , Spain or Germany .
But it took root in England .
The 18th - century Englishman was a remarkable figure , an aggressive , imperialist merchant revelling in the prosperity of the age and the greatness of his nation over other continentals ; he was also suspicious of the new power - brokers who had replaced the old hierarchy of the royal court .
He was n't sure if the people representing him in Parliament were quite up to scratch ; and he reserved the right to hold them to account , to confront and abuse them , should the occasion demand .
And thus was born the Rude Briton .
In the 20th century , " rudeness " in art was confined to the lower orders : it derived from the Victorian music hall and burlesque show , and turned up in seaside postcards with their personnel of busty blondes , furtive Peeping Toms , battle - axe wives , henpecked husbands , guileless vicars , beachside lovelies , newly - weds and gormless soldiers .
George Orwell , in his essay " The Art of Donald McGill " , recoiled from their " overpowering vulgarity ... an utter low - ness of mental atmosphere " , but concluded that they performed an important function : " They stand for the worm 's - eye view of life , for the music - hall world where marriage is a dirty joke or a comic disaster , where the rent is always behind and the clothes are always up the spout , where the lawyer is always a crook and the Scotsman always a miser , where the newly - weds make fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging houses ...
Like the music halls , they are a sort of saturnalia , a harmless rebellion against virtue ...
On the whole , human beings want to be good , but not too good , and not quite all the time . "
What 's happened to us all in the last 50 years is difficult to pin down .
There was , everyone agrees , a democratising of rudeness in the Sixties .
From being grounded in low - class entertainments like the Carry On movies ( tits , loo jokes , and effete " cissies " who were never likely to come out as gay ) , gross comedy went middle - class and invaded the mainstream .
Joe Orton 's plays featured bent coppers , rent boys and sexually voracious housewives ( speaking wonderfully Wildean dialogue ) .
That Was That Week That Was and Round the Horne brought topical satire and camp slang to the nation 's startled eyes and ears .
Detecting a loosening of societal reins , television sitcoms ceased their gentle herbivorous existence ( see Terry and June , The Likely Lads ) , and plunged into foul - mouthed exchanges of bile ( see Till Death Us Do Part , Love Thy Neighbour . )
Language became freer and coarser .
The human body – undressed , cross-dressed , disarrayed and laid completely bare – became a common sight in popular culture in a way that had n't been seen since the 18th century .
That 's why we 're such rude people .
It 's all an atavistic throwback .
The template for modern , piss - taking , toss - potting man was set nearly 300 years ago , by Hogarth in art and Swift in literature .
Revolting close - ups of gargantuan bosoms and bottoms , a cavalcade of gurning faces of the greedy , the lusty and the deranged – all followed the revelations of corrupt human nature in The Rake 's Progress and the visit to Brobdignag in Gulliver 's Travels .
A fascination with portraying excrement and genitalia , as a counterblast to gentility and civilisation , grew in this period and lives today in the works of Young British Artists .
And a chronic , ungovernable urge to say the unsayable , push the boat out , see how far you can bend the rules of behaviour , in a country with a toothless monarchy and a government made of people like yourself – that 's what has given us our unsavoury but vivid identity .
KHE SANH , Vietnam —
Swishing his metal detector across the red dirt of his backyard , Le Van Thang points to the spot where he buried two grenades .
He found the explosives about five years ago while plowing the family garden .
He says he called authorities to take them away , but they refused .
“ The soldiers said two grenades were n’t enough to bother with , ” Thang explains .
“ They said to call them back if I found more . ”
The explosives have been sitting there under a tree , just a couple of yards from his back door , ever since .
Thang lives just outside Khe Sanh , in Vietnam ’s Quang Tri province .
His two - room concrete home sits on a jungle - covered hilltop about 15 miles from the former demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) .
Until 1975 , the DMZ divided the communist north from the pro-Western south .
It was the site of some of the fiercest fighting of the Vietnam War , and as a result , is littered with explosives .
Unfortunately , Thang ’s situation is not uncommon .
Thirty - five years after the end of the war , families across the central provinces live in fear of explosions that happen on a regular basis .
In early 2010 alone there were several blasts .
Locals were burning a stump when a bomb rocked a schoolyard in Dong Ha , about 30 miles east of Khe Sanh , shaking walls and shattering windows .
Luckily all 550 students were in class at the time of the blast and escaped injury .
About a week later , a man was seriously injured while weeding a coffee plantation beside the former U.S. Marine base outside Khe Sanh .
Then , in February , just before the Vietnamese New Year , a 40 - year - old man was killed while clearing weeds from his banana trees .
Many of the accidents involve unexploded cluster munitions , large weapons often deployed from the air that release dozens , sometimes hundreds , of smaller , baseball - sized “ bomblets , ” or “ grenades . ”
They were widely used in the central provinces during the Vietnam War .
Cluster bombs blanket large swaths of land and have a high “ dud ” rate , meaning they do n’t explode on contact and go on injuring and killing civilians long after wars officially end .
Experts say the cluster bombs used in Vietnam are estimated to have a “ dud ” rate between 5 and 40 percent .
Three years ago , while digging for scrap metal , Thang came across a cluster bomb and carries the scars of that encounter with him today .
Watch this video about Thang 's experience :
Some countries are taking action to see that accidents like the one Thang experienced can be avoided in the future .
The Convention on Cluster Munitions becomes binding international law Aug .
1 . So far , 106 countries have signed the treaty , with Britain joining the list in May .
However support has been slow to come from the world 's biggest cluster bomb makers — Russia , China , Israel and the United States .
The U.S. has n't used cluster bombs since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003 , but it has held out on signing the treaty and still has a large stockpile of the weapons .
Stephen Goose , the Arms Division Director of Human Rights Watch said it ’s crucial that the U.S. sign .
" As one of the biggest users , producers , traders and stockpilers of cluster munitions , getting the U.S. on board is key , ” Goose said .
“ The U.S. joining will greatly increase the international stigmatization of the weapon , and convince many of the other hold - outs to come on board . ”
A 2009 study by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense ’s Technology Center for Bomb and Mine Disposal and the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation notes that about 7,000 people have been injured or killed by explosives left from the Vietnam War era in Quang Tri Province alone .
The report also highlights a correlation between poverty and the impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) .
“ [ The presence of UXO ] creates a burden of fear and concern among people living in contaminated communities , ” the report states , which hinders construction of housing , expansion of infrastructure , resettlement initiatives and other development activities .
Vietnam ’s shift from a centrally planned economy to a market - driven economy in the mid-'90s raised the annual household income from $ 220 per year to more than $ 1,000 in 2009 .
Even during the global economic downturn , Vietnam ’s economy is one of the fastest growing in Southeast Asia , at more than 5 percent .
But the countryside , where Thang lives , remains mired in poverty .
Every time a new building or road is constructed or a new field is plowed , a survey has to be completed to ensure there are no explosives .
That takes time and money .
Surveys are currently being provided by several NGOs , but the process is slow .
NGO leaders say they are eagerly awaiting a national mine policy from the Vietnamese government , which they hope will speed things up .
Critics also note that Vietnam might attract more international funding for mine removal if it signed on to the international treaties prohibiting the use of landmines and cluster munitions .
After a reporter visited
Thang ’s house , an NGO removed the explosives from his land — a small step toward in the daunting task of cleaning up the country .
Demining efforts are underway in Vietnam , but experts say at the rate they 're going , it will take at least 300 years to finish the job .
Kitchen Chemistry is Hard ( but fun ! )
This week a friend and I made ferrofluid .
For those of you who may not know , ferrofluid is the coolest thing ever .
Go look it up .
Seriously .
Look it up .
As you might guess from the title , things did n’t go exactly as planned .
We ’re treating this as a practice run .
Eventually we ’ll be using the ferrofluid for some fun projects that are still in the planning stages , but first , the ‘ fluid !
We originally planned to use the ferrofluid recipe that my friend Sacha over at ChemHacker is making , but he has n’t worked out all the kinks .
He offered to let us use his lab and reagents , but scheduling difficulties got in the way ( he did hook me up with some oleic acid , and exchanging chemistry supplies in a bar is one of the shadiest legit things I ’ve ever done ) .
He pointed us to a recipe over at SciSpot , which we ended up using a modified version of ( at Sacha ’s suggestion we did the last ammonia gas releasing step in a safer way ) .
Having good lab technique is hard to do in your kitchen .
I ’d love to be able to devote a room to being a full time lab , but that ’s just not happening where I live right now .
Here ’s our setup :
Here ’s
Nick stirring the mixture :
Is it supposed to look radioactive ?
Skipping ahead some steps , here ’s the modified setup we used for step 5 from the SciSpot recipe .
The erlenmeyer flask has a mixture of chemicals including ammonia , which we ’re trying to evaporate off .
Ammonia gas is not exactly good for you ( read : it will burn your lungs off ) , so we ’re running the gas into a beaker full of ice water .
Ammonia gas dissolves readily in water , turning back into something that wo n’t necessarily harm you for life .
Finally , we got some ok looking ferrofluid !
Some of the imperfections come from the recipe ( using PCB etchant instead of straight chemicals means there are extra things in there that we do n’t need ) , and some probably come from this being our first try .
We should be trying this again soon , so we should know then .
Once again , a big thanks to Sacha at ChemHacker for helping us get this done !

Republicans Having Second Thoughts About Dirty Energy
May 26th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Are Republicans really Democrats to whom anything really bad has yet to happen ?
Now that America faces a crisis of almost Chernobyl - like proportions ; fewer Republicans are thinking in chirpy slogans about scraping the bottom of the barrel for the last few drops of oil .
The gusher on the sea floor is so far out of the range of the human expertise and abilities of oil industry technicians – let alone Government agencies – to rein it in ; that it might as well be taking place in outer space .
Yet last year 86 % of Republicans told Rasmussen they were fine with Drill , Baby , Drill .
[ social_buttons ]
But in a new Fox News poll , one month after the accident , Republicans ’ support for off - shore oil drilling has now dropped to 68 % .
This brings overall support , according the Fox Poll , down to a new average low of 54 % ( including the views of Democrats and Independents ) , from a combined average of 72 % support in August of 2009 .
A Rasmussen poll at the beginning of May showed that Republican support already had fallen in two steep drops from their original 86 % support baseline last year – at a time when the entire RNC energy strategy was Drill , Baby , drill !
Already , their support had sunk to 77 % two weeks after the explosion , when the full extent of the catastrophe was still not as well known .
The steepest drops of 20 % come from a state that is in the direct line of fire , Florida .
Republican support there has dropped to a tepid 57 % .
Florida is a tourism state that has been directly impacted by off - shore drilling problems over time , so support has never been as high as the national average , for all three groups .
The support of Independents – as always , in the middle – has gone from a 51 % baseline down to 27 % .
Support amongst Florida Democrats was only at a 36 % baseline before this crisis : now that is down to just 19 % .
Florida ’s views are key to passing the climate bill .
For the “ No Government ” Party , this crisis may be a wake up call .
The solution to dirty energy is waiting .
Good government policy exists to get us started on the alternative – which is clean energy – if only Republican Senators would stop stonewalling it .
The American Power
Act is due back from the CBO in June , and teed up for a vote .
Putting an accurate price on the costs of dirty energy helps move us to clean energy .
The very carefully negotiated climate bill , whatever its perceived flaws , does puts a hard price on pollution for the first time .
The cap in the American Power Act places an ever - tightening lid on allowable pollution .
Both the price paid and the new first - ever limits placed will force companies like BP to really think Beyond Petroleum – about solar and wind , and not just pretend .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Researchers at the University of Warwick and the University of Sheffield have applied computing power to crack a problem in egg shell formation .
The work may also give a partial answer to the age old question " what came first the chicken or the egg ? "
The answer to the question in this context is " chicken " or -- at least a particular chicken protein .
There is however a further twist in that this particular chicken protein turns out to come both first and last .
That neat trick it performs provides new insights into control of crystal growth which is key to egg shell production .
Researchers had long known that a chicken eggshell protein called ovocledidin - 17 ( OC - 17 ) must play some role in egg shell formation .
The protein is found only in the mineral region of the egg ( the hard part of the shell ) and lab bench results showed that it appeared to influence the transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate ( CaCo 3 ) into calcite crystals .
The mechanism of this control remained unclear .
How this process could be used to form an actual eggshell remained unclear .
University of Warwick researchers Mark Rodger and David Quigley , in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Sheffield , have now been able to apply a powerful computing tool called metadynamics and the UK national supercomputer in Edinburgh to crack this egg problem .
Dr David Quigley from the Department of Physics and Centre for Scientific Computing , University of Warwick , said : " Metadynamics extends conventional molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations and is particularly good at sampling transitions between disordered and ordered states of matter . "
Using these tools
The Warwick and Sheffield researchers were able to create simulations that showed exactly how the protein bound to amorphous calcium carbonate surface using two clusters of " arginine residues , " located on two loops of the protein and creating a literal chemical " clamp " to nano sized particles of calcium carbonate .
While clamped in this way , the OC - 17 encourages the nanoparticles of calcium carbonate to transform into " calcite crystallites " that form the tiny of nucleus of crystals that can continue to grow on their own .
But they also noticed that sometimes this chemical clamp did n't work .
The OC - 17 just seemed to detatch from the nanoparticle or " be desorbed . "
Professor Mark Rodger from Department of Chemistry and Centre for Scientific Computing , University of Warwick , said " With the larger nanoparticles we examined we found that the binding sites for this chemical clamp were the same as the smaller nanoparticles but the binding was much weaker .
In the simulations we performed , the protein never desorbed from the smaller nanoparticle , but always fell off or desorbed from the larger one .
However
In each case , desorption occurred at or after nucleation of calcite . "
The researchers had therefore uncovered an incredibly elegant process allowing highly efficient recycling of the OC - 17 protein .
Effectively it acts as a catalyst , clamping on to calcium carbonate particles to kickstart crystal formation and then dropping off when the crystal nucleus is sufficiently large to grow under its own steam .
This frees up the OC - 17 to promote more yet more crystallisation , facilitating the speedy , literally overnight creation of an egg shell .
The researchers believe that this new insight into the elegant and highly efficient methods of promoting and controlling crystallisation in nature will be of great benefit to anyone exploring how to promote and control artificial forms of crystallisation .

In February 1998 , at the age of 91 , Philip Johnson , the godfather of modern architecture , who 40 years earlier had collaborated with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe on the iconic Seagram Building , in Manhattan , traveled to Spain to see the just - completed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao .
He stood in the atrium of the massive , titanium - clad structure with its architect , Frank Gehry , as TV cameras from Charlie Rose captured him gesturing up to the torqued and sensually curving pillars that support the glass - and - steel ceiling and saying , “ Architecture is not about words .
It ’s about tears . ”
Breaking into heavy sobs , he added , “ I get the same feeling in Chartres Cathedral . ”
Bilbao had just opened its doors , but Johnson , the principal apostle of the two dominant forms of architecture in the 20th century — Modernism and Postmodernism — and the design establishment ’s ultimate arbiter , was prepared to call it on the spot .
He anointed Gehry “ the greatest architect we have today ” and later declared the structure “ the greatest building of our time . ”
Five years after Johnson ’s death , in 2005 , Vanity Fair has asked 90 of the world ’s leading architects , teachers , and critics to name the five most important buildings , monuments , and bridges completed since 1980 , as well as the most significant structure built so far in the 21st century .
The survey ’s results back up Johnson decisively : of the 52 experts who ultimately participated in the poll — including 11 Pritzker Prize winners and the deans of eight major architecture schools — 28 voted for the Guggenheim Bilbao .
That was nearly three times as many votes as the second - place building received .
Therefore it seems fair to conclude that the 81 - year - old , Canadian - born Gehry is the most important architect of our age .
( He received four additional votes for three other projects : the Walt Disney Concert Hall , in Los Angeles ; Millennium Park , in Chicago ; and his house in Santa Monica . )
It is rare that a single building can be judged a transformational work .
The last architectural event to have had such an impact may have been the publication of Le Corbusier ’s landmark manifesto , Towards a New Architecture , in 1923 , followed , in 1929 , by the completion of his small , experimental Villa Savoye , outside Paris .
( All - too - human footnote : the owners of the villa took le maître to court over their revolutionary — but leaky — flat roof . )
“ Bilbao is truly a signal moment in the architectural culture , ” says the Pulitzer Prize — winning critic Paul Goldberger , author of Why Architecture Matters ( 2009 ) .
“ The building blazed new trails and became an extraordinary phenomenon .
It was one of those rare moments when critics , academics , and the general public were all completely united about something . ”
“ Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics , academics , and the general public were all completely united , ” says Paul Goldberger .
Achieving the Bilbao Effect
‘ Gehry just let go , ” the critic Mildred Friedman told Sydney Pollack in the director ’s 2005 documentary , Sketches of Frank Gehry .
“ He began to delve into all these ideas that he ’d been beginning to work with and just went the whole way there .
I do n’t think there is a building that comes anywhere near it in this period of art history . ”
Thomas Krens , the former director of the Guggenheim , who commissioned the museum in Spain , said , “ Bilbao has been the watershed thing for Frank .
He was an interesting architect until Bilbao opened .
After that , he became a transcendent architect . ”
Bilbao — today one of the top tourist destinations in Europe — was such a backwater in the 1990s that , according to Gehry , the 265,000 - square - foot museum , beside the Nervión River , went up almost unnoticed by the press .
That only contributed to the drop - dead impact it created with its unveiling .
“ I like to work under the radar as much as I can .
It ’s been harder since I ’ve gotten notorious , ” says Gehry .
The first photos of the near - complete structure , which resembles a gargantuan bouquet of writhing silver fish , rendered a seismic shift in the global art culture .
At first , Gehry was himself unsure whether he approved of it .
“ You know , I went there just before the opening , ” he tells me , “ and looked at it and said , ‘ Oh , my God , what have I done to these people ? ’
It took a couple of years for me to start to like it , actually . ”
A student who received a full - ride ROTC scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill may now owe the Army nearly $ 80,000 for the money it put toward her tuition and books after coming out as a lesbian .
Sara Isaacson was notified in March that she was being discharged for violating “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” after informing the head of the university ’s ROTC program of her sexual orientation in a formal memo , the Chronicle of Higher Education reported .
Along with the notice was a recommendation that she repay the $ 79,265.14 the government spent on her education , the paper reported .
Isaacson says keeping her sexual orientation a secret would put her at odds with one of the Army ’s key virtues .
" I did n't feel like I could be a good officer if I did n't have integrity , " she told the Chronicle of Higher Education .
Lt. Col. Monte Yoder , head of the university 's Army ROTC program , said Ms. Isaacson would never have had to talk about her sexual orientation at all .
" I was very clear with Miss Isaacson about that , " he told the Chronicle .
" I told her I wo n't ask . "
Army officials have yet to issue a final decision on whether she will need to repay the money , the paper reported .

Cooking Some Bacon – The Machine Gun Method
Making breakfast could n’t get any more manly :
I ’ve discovered a new way of cooking bacon .
All you need is : bacon , tin foil , some string , and .. oh whats it called ?… oh yeah , an old worn out 7.62 mm machinegun that is about to be discarded , and about 200 rounds of ammunition .
1 ) You start by wrapping the barrel in tin foil .
Then you wrap bacon around it , and tie it down with some string .
2 ) you then wrap some more tin foil around it , and once again tie it down with string .
3 ) It is now ready to be inserted into the cooking device .
I ripped the tin foil a little bit getting the barrel inserted .
that part of the bacon got severely burned by hot gasses .
4 ) After just a few short bursts you should be able to smell the wonderful aroma of bacon .
5 ) I gave this about 250 rounds .
but I think around 150 might actually be enough .
But then again I do n’t mind when bacon is crispy .
Ahh the smell of sizzling bacon mixed with the smell of gunpowder and weapon oil .
6 ) And the end result : Crispy delicious well done bacon .
He should have bust some eggs downrange onto a hot skillet , or shot some oranges to make some juice !
The gun appears to be a German Rheinmetall MG 3 Machine gun .
It ’s rate of fire is approximately 1150 rounds / min .
Too bad I do n’t have anything with a high enough rate of fire to try this :(
I guess could work on my bump firing skills ….
I can see it now “ Bump Fire Bacon ” !

The first thing to understand is that the USGS does more than detect earthquakes .
Water is also a huge part of its mission and it monitors the thousands of rivers and lakes across the country .
The USGS has this site where , if so inclined , you can look up water levels of streams and lakes near you or across the country .
Unfortunately , the way the law is written , most of these stream gauges require some sort of matching funding , usually from states , counties and other local cooperators with a vested interest .
Of course , states are currently under enormous budgetary pressure .
So they are cutting their funding for stream gauges .
As Jeff says in his blog :
With over 50 people dead from two flooding disasters already this year , now hardly seems to be the time to be skimping on monitoring river flow levels by cutting funding for hundreds of streamgages .
These gages are critical for proper issuance of flood warnings to people in harm 's way .
Furthermore , most of the northern 2/3 of the U.S. can expect a much higher incidence of record flooding in coming decades .
This will be driven by two factors : increased urban development causing faster run-off , and an increase in very heavy precipitation events due to global warming .
To get an appreciation for the size of the problem , look at this map of discontinued or threatened stream gauges on the USGS web site :
As Jeff says :
According to the USGS web site , river stage data from 292 streamgages has been discontinued recently , or is scheduled for elimination in the near future due to budget cuts .
In Tennessee , 16 streamflow gages with records going back up to 85 years will stop collecting data on July 1 because of budget cuts .
Five gages in Arkansas are slated for elimination this year .
Hardest hit will be Pennsylvania , which will lose 30 of its 258 streamgages .
You do n't need a rocket scientist , or even a hydrologist to see the problem here .
To make predictions of the future , we need to know what happened in the past .
By removing these stream gauges , the country is losing a valuable historical information .
In the short term of course you need to know what very recent water levels are and how fast they are rising or dropping to make flood predictions .
Moreover , since NOAA uses USGS stream gauge data for flood predictions , by retiring these gauges , it 's like we are choosing to make ourselves blind , or at least worsen our vision .
Stream gauges are doubtless not cheap but most can be maintained for a year for less than the cost of a new compact car .
They have to be maintained and monitored , which means even after they are put in the USGS has to send out hydrologist periodically to service the station .
Some 9,000 of these gauges periodically broadcast recent streamflow information .
If all these gauges are discontinued clearly the impact will be felt .
You can see a graph of the event in Arkansas on the Caddo River here :
At least 20 people died on the Caddo River .
Fortunately , the gauge on this river is not one of those scheduled to be cut .
I do not know if NOAA issued a flood warning for the river .
Perhaps the rain fell too quickly to give a proper notification , or no one was available on site monitoring the river to give warning .
It does appear that procedures could be improved that might have saved some or all of the lives lost on the Caddo River .
One thing is for sure : you cannot save lives without data , and NOAA cannot create flood forecasts without data from various stream gauges that are out there .
I know money is tight , but with states cutting their funding for these stream gauges , in a way it 's like they are telling their citizens they are getting out of the public safety business .
Shame on 'em .

In the footsteps of Shenzhen Internet Police , the police in China 's capital , Beijing , will start patrolling websites registered on Beijing servers using animated police officers that pop up in a user 's browser .
From September , 1st , Beijing 's new virtual cops will be active on 13 of China 's portals , including China 's biggest blog - hosting services , Sohu.com and Sina.com .
By the end of the year , the virtual police 's patrols are expected to cover all websites registered with Beijing servers .
According to the Associated Press , the cartoon cops can “ walk , bike or drive across the screen ” every 30 minutes , warning Internet users to stay away from “ illegal Internet content ” and “ bad websites ” .
“ We will continue to promote new images of the virtual police and update our Internet security tips in an effort to make the image of the virtual police more user friendly and more in tune with how web surfers use the Internet , ” the Beijing Public Security Ministry said in a statement issued yesterday .
According to the statement , these cartoons officers will offer police help to Internet users .
Clicking on the cartoon images will redirected users to the authority 's web site .
But is this the main purpose of China ’s new Big Brother and Big Sister ?
Last year , on January 17 , 2006 , Global - voices co-founder , Rebecca MacKinnon , reported a similar story via China Digital Times , introducing the two male and female cartoon web cops “ Jingjing ” and “ Chacha ” who have been patrolling websites since last year in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen :
These cartoon web cops named “ JIngjing ” and “ Chacha ” ( the word “ jing cha ” means “ police ” in Chinese ) will apparently be patrolling websites originating in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen .
(…)
According to the Public Security official interviewed by the Beijing Youth Daily , their real function is to remind internet users that the Chinese police are watching people online no differently than offline .
In other words : do n't do anything online that you would n't do in a physical public place in China !
Blogger South Puget Sound Libertarian shares his thoughts and this image of Shenzhen Internet police mascot , JingJing :
Notice that JingJing is cute .
The face that the Chinese government has decided to put on its repression is not that of the Orwellian jackboot stamping on a human face forever .
No , totalitarianism comes wrapped in cuteness these days .
So how could you really object ?
After all , it ’s just the government trying to protect you from evil doers on the internet .
In addition to this new technique for monitoring the Web , Beijing police are also posting signs clearly intended to intimidate Internet users at the entrances to Internet cafes ( see image below ) :
“ You should not spread antisocial material on the Internet ” on the top , and “ Please come with me because you published materials to harm the unity of the nation ” on the bottom .

Sohu.com and Sina.com , the two leading Chinese portals where the virtual and “ cute ” cops will be patrolling , are already censoring their users ’ content quite aggressively .
Beijing - based blogger Liu Xiaoyuan is suing Sohu.com for censoring some of his blogposts .
And four Chinese lawyers have protested the “ un- transparent , arbitrary , and unaccountable way in which Sina.com has been censoring blog posts by bloggers on its system , ” wrote Rebecca MacKinnon .
​ A Spokane , Washington man busted in a federal marijuana sting and looking at a prison sentence figured what the hell , it could n’t hurt to make a request .
He asked to go to Disneyland .
The Spokesman - Review .
Scott Nicholas Cassell , 29 , got his wish , reports Meghann Cuniff at
Two weeks before a judge will likely approve a plea bargain that will land him behind bars for five years , Cassell left for Southern California over the weekend .
U.S. Magistrate Cynthia Imbrogno granted a motion late last month for Cassell to travel to the Happiest Place On Earth for a week with his mother , wife and six - year - old daughter .
“ What he ’s doing is good for him and good for the family , ” said Cassell ’s lawyer , David Miller .
“ His young daughter ca n’t be around her dad for awhile ; how sad is that ? ”
Miller said .
“ This will put a good memory in the memory bank . ”
Cassell said the trip will “ provide one great final memory for our daughter prior to my leaving , ” according to court documents .
“ I know this trip would mean so much to our six - year - old , and my wife would have the ability to keep a positive spin on these last few weeks at home , ” Cassell said .
“ I promise I will return to Spokane to face whatever consequences this court deems appropriate . ”
Spokane defense lawyer Mark Vovos said Magistrate Imbrogno made the decision due to her experience .
“ She ’s been on the bench long enough to know there ’s reasons and people you have to take a chance on , ” Vovos said .
“ It depends on your background , your criminal history , your family support and things like that . ”
Imbrogno could n’t comment , according to her assistant , Kathy Roberts , but Roberts said it ’s not unusual to allow defendants some time with their families before sentencing .
Federal prosecutors objected to Cassell ’s Disneyland request .
“ The defendant no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence , ” huffed Assistant U.S. Attorney Russell Smoot , who said Cassell “ should already have been behind bars ” until sentencing .
Cassell ’s first serious felony came in January when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana .
He was one of about two dozen people rounded up in February 2009 in a statewide sweep .
According to court documents , he had five guns at the time of his arrest .
According to his lawyer , Cassell has undergone drug treatment and is subjected to regular drug tests .
“ He ’s followed everything and complied with all the court ’s orders , ” Miller said .
“ I was n’t surprised ( the trip ) was approved .
He ’s a local person who ’s lived here all his life , and it was merely the distribution of marijuana . ”
Cassell , who is out of jail on $ 10,000 bond and is under house arrest , is allowed to leave for work .
He sentencing is scheduled for June 30 by U.S. District Judge Edward Shea .
Prosecutors are recommending a prison term of 60 months .
Are Democrats setting themselves up for failure in 2011 by not passing a budget ?
The most important job news of the days was not the June jobs numbers .
It was a mostly ignored vote in the House of Representatives last night .
By a vote of 215 to 210 , the House passed a " budget enforcement resolution " setting discretionary spending levels and making it almost impossible to imagine that any job - creation measures will pass in 2011 .
The budget enforcement resolution is an alternative to actually passing a budget .
It does the main work of the budget , which is telling the appropriators how much money they have to spend , but it includes few details beyond that .
The absence of those specifics means House Democrats are n't voting for a budget with a trillion - plus - dollar deficit , which is a vote they do n't want to take , and it spares the House leadership the trouble of navigating the normal budget - related squabbles .
But no budget means no budget reconciliation instructions , and no budget reconciliation instructions mean no passing jobs legislation with 51 votes in the Senate .
The 2010 elections , however , are likely to return a much - reduced Democratic Senate majority .
As the situation stands , Democrats could n't pass unemployment - insurance legislation with 59 votes , because they could n't quite get to 60 .
If they have only 52 members in their caucus , they really have no chance .
That 's why setting down reconciliation instructions now was so important :
It was their best chance to actually govern next year .
Senate Democrats are hanging this one on the House .
" It was our intent in a budget resolution to include those instructions , " Sen. Debbie Stabenow told me .
" And we passed such a resolution out of committee . "
House aides retort that they were told Senate Democrats did n't have the 51 votes necessary to pass the budget on the floor , and in any case , it 's not their fault that the Senate is paralyzed by the filibuster .
In fact , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called just today for an end to the filibuster .
But the fact remains :
By not passing a budget with reconciliation instructions this year , Democrats are setting themselves up for further gridlock and failure next year .
If you can't get 51 votes for a budget when you have 59 , you sure can't get 60 votes for controversial legislation when you only have 52 .

The rocky island off Grand Isle was intended as a haven for brown pelicans , a centerpiece of environmentalists ’ efforts to rescue Louisiana ’s state bird from the federal endangered species list .
On Monday , wildlife rescue workers came to the Queen Bess Island Pelican Rookery to capture the giant birds as oil from BP ’s blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico despoiled the state ’s largest pelican sanctuary .
A man in a canoe paddled near the shoreline , nudging the oil - covered birds into deeper water , where big boats motored up , their bird - catching crews leaning over the sides .
They cast their nets in quick swoops , then twisted them to snare the pelicans safely inside so they could be lifted from the water and shoved into waiting animal carriers .
None proved easy to catch despite their pitiful condition .
At least two tried to take flight but managed only to bounce across the flat surface of the bay .
Their oily feet splashed through the water and their wings flapped helplessly .
“ This island is what brought the brown pelican back to Louisiana , ” said Hudgins Littleton III , a retired oil worker watching the arrival of rescue boats .
For days , orange booms encircled the rookery as protection against a spill that has broken up into patches and streaks across the gulf .
But oily water topped the barrier and spilled through a hole punched by a weekend storm .
Such scenes were repeated throughout the gulf region Monday , while engineers tinkered with a cap diverting oil from the gushing well to a surface ship and drill crews made steady progress on a shaft to intercept the runaway well and plug it sometime in August .
By Monday morning , at least 597 birds had been picked up by wildlife workers in Louisiana , 209 of them dead .
Across the waters of four gulf states , the total number of dead birds was estimated at 594 .
After a tour of the rookery , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced that the Coast Guard had approved a plan to anchor barges and build rock dikes around the barrier island at the mouth of Barataria Bay .
The plan “ will allow them to narrow those passages by as much as 70 % , ” Jindal said .
At the same news conference in Grand Isle , BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said the company would pay $ 360 million to fund the construction of 45 miles of sand berms off the Louisiana coast .
His announcement that BP had made the first $ 60 - million payment was met with applause from locals watching the news conference at the Grand Isle Community Center .
Even as a containment cap installed last week captured more of the leaking oil , the record slick generated by the well blowout has metastasized to what Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen described Monday as “ a massive collection of smaller spills . ”
The cap on Monday was capturing an estimated 11,000 barrels of oil per day , a rate expected to increase .
Oil will continue to escape the cap until relief wells are completed .
A government panel has estimated the total flow at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day , but BP said that cutting a kinked riser pipe before placing the cap could have increased the flow by as much as 20 % .
Estimates of the leak rate , however , continue to be met with skepticism .
BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said Monday that the plume of gas and oil swirling around the containment cap is not as thick as it appears to be , and he said that some vents on the cap may be kept open during the pumping process .
By Monday morning , as oil slicks expanded to affect about 120 miles of gulf coastline , the drilling of one relief well had reached about 8,000 feet below the seafloor , while another had reached about 3,000 feet , but they are not expected to be operable until August .
Since the spill began April 20 , more than 1 million gallons of oil - breaking chemicals called dispersants have been pumped into the gulf , Allen said .
He said the Coast Guard had conducted drills to prepare for spills in the gulf but had not anticipated one of this scope and at this distance from shore .
“ I do n’t think any plan envisioned it would get out that far and disaggregate , ” Allen said .
“ If anything is taxing our resources , it ’s the breadth . ”
While BP works to ramp up the collection rate , it is undertaking a plan to use hoses to extract oil and send it to a platform vessel .
Wells said the hoses and cap operation would be able to capture 20,000 barrels , or 840,000 gallons , of oil per day .
BP also plans to place a tighter “ sealing valve ” over the damaged well .
At a hearing in St. Bernard Parish near New Orleans , members of Congress heard testimony from the widows of two of 11 workers killed when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank .
“ One way we can hurt BP is to make sure that ‘ BP ’ stand for ‘ bills paid , ’ that the money for families , the money to clean up the gulf , comes out of their pocket , and that we repeal the Death on the High Seas Act , ” said Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass ) .
He was referring to the 1920 law that limits liability for wrongful deaths that occur more than three miles out to sea .
“ We have thousands and thousands of people who are out on these rigs , out on the ocean .
And there never was any intention for you and people like you not to be able to recover for your families , ” Markey told the widows .

Wireless has become a part of our official and personal lives .
Securing against wireless threats has been and will continue to be an important piece in the overall enterprise security puzzle .
However , as if following Darwin 's theory of evolution , wireless security myths too are born , evolve and then die to be replaced by new ones .
An improved awareness of wireless security issues seems to have given network security professionals enough information to dispel certain wireless security myths ( e.g. , hiding your SSID in beacons will improve security ; open APs with MAC filters can provide good security ; use of static network IP addresses can impede an attacker ; and WEP can provide good - enough security ) .
The fact that more and more users are moving towards WPA2 deployments confirms this .
The recent PCI DSS wireless guideline ( perhaps spurred by the infamous and high - profile TJX security breach ) is certainly driving some of these developments .
However , on the flip side , the wireless security community still lacks a clear consensus on how to handle threats caused by unmanaged devices .
10 woeful tales of datga gone missing
This has led to an evolved set of wireless security myths that are probably harder to debunk .
Let 's take a brief look at them and discuss how enterprises can avoid some of these common pitfalls .
Myth 1 : My enterprise is secure if we do not have a Wi -Fi deployment .
Many people still think that they are secure if they have a " no Wi - Fi " policy .
If only wireless security were that simple .
In the real world where it is not possible to trust everyone , it would be naïve to assume the policy will never be violated .
A disgruntled employee can implant a rogue access point , and even well - meaning employees can deploy APs that will inadvertently expose your network to rogue activity .
Similarly , Wi-Fi client cards that come embedded in most of the notebooks today can be a potential source of threat -- they can be exploited by attackers .
Further , other wireless technologies embedded in notebooks such as Bluetooth can create security vulnerabilities .
Reality : Assuming that a " no Wi - Fi " policy will secure your network is akin to an " Ostrich solution " .
Myth 2 : I use WPA2 in my network and I am secure .
If you have rolled out your enterprise Wi-Fi deployment with WPA2 , it is definitely a good start .
WPA2 provides a strong cryptographic security for your WLAN APs and clients .
However , in a large deployment , it is important to ensure that none of the devices are accidentally mis-configured , thus potentially exposing gaping security holes .
Wi - Fi is increasingly used to carry mission - critical applications , so hackers and criminals will continue to focus on breaking Wi -Fi security .
Researchers have recently demonstrated that WPA - TKIP can be compromised to achieve packet - injection attacks .
Similarly , a Cisco WLAN controller - based vulnerability that can be exploited to " skyjack " Cisco LAPs has been reported .
Reality : A WPA2 - based WLAN deployment cannot protect you from all types of wireless security threats .
Myth 3 : I have enabled 802.1X port control and I am secure .
IEEE 802.1X port - based access control provides an authentication mechanism for devices wishing to communicate via a port ( e.g. , a LAN port ) .
It allows further communication only if the authentication succeeds .
If it fails , it disallows further communication via the port .
The goal of the designers of 802.1X was not to protect a network from wireless security threats .
As we can expect , 802.1X is completely ineffective against Wi -Fi client - based threats .
Even though 802.1X - based port control can act as a deterrent to rogue APs , it can be easily bypassed via a " hidden rogue AP " -- for example , by an employee with the knowledge of 802.1X credentials .
First , he needs to connect a Layer - 2 bridge AP in " silent " mode by configuring it with a static IP ( so that it never has to reveal identify over the wire ) .
Then , he can masquerade the identity ( i.e. MAC address ) of a Wi-Fi client to that of his Ethernet card to deceive 802.1X control .
Reality :
The basic problem here is that 802.1X is a one - time ( i.e. , entry level ) control , but , what you actually need is continuous monitoring and control .
Myth 4 : My network access control ( NAC ) solution will protect me from Wi -Fi based threats .
NAC aims to control access to a network with policies .
It includes pre-admission endpoint security policy checks ( to determine who can access the network ) and post - admission controls ( to determine what they can access ) .
Since NAC solutions include some host - based checks ( i.e. , operating system , services running on host ) , it can protect against the class of rogue APs that function as a router or a network address translator .
NAC also fails against the " silent rogue AP " threat .
Reality : Similar to 802.1X , NAC is also an entry level control and the arguments made against 802.1X hold true against NACs as well .
Myth 5 : 802.11w eliminates
Wi - Fi denizl - of - service ( DoS ) mattacks .
By its very nature , Wi-Fi is susceptible to DoS attacks .
The unlicensed radio frequency spectrum coupled with a " keep - it - simple " MAC protocol have lead to the development of several DoS attacks on Wi-Fi ( e.g. , RF jamming , deauthentication / disassociation flood , virtual jamming ) .
IEEE recently ratified the 802.11w standard , which adds cryptographic protection to a certain subset of 802.11 Management frames ( e.g. , deauthentication frames , disassociation frames ) .
This definitely mitigates the attacks based on such protected frames .
Reality : Attacks based on frames that are outside of the purview of 802.11w protection ( e.g. , virtual jamming ) and RF spectrum based attacks are still possible .
Myth 6 : Part - time security .
WLAN infrastructure may support a mode wherein an AP can be programmed at times to act as a wireless intrusion - detection sensor .
However , if you need a higher level of protection , for example to comply with industry or government regulations , you really need wireless intrusion - prevention ( and not just detection ) , as switching an AP from access to protection provides , at best , part - time protection .
A device acting as an AP cannot spend significant cycles on security .
If it does , it will affect its performance as data / voice carrying device .
Therefore when this mode is employed , such devices end up spending less time on scanning and threat mitigation .
This introduces delays in threat detection and can affect blocking / prevention severely .
Reality : Part - time sensors fail miserably in reliably blocking threats ( as such sensors cannot perform a sustained and frequent transmission of containment packets ) .
It is clear that threats occurring from unmanaged wireless security devices need focused attention .
The first step in addressing this issue is to define wireless security policies for your enterprise -- define what authorized communication is and what is not .
The next step is to evaluate the security risk specific to your enterprise and invest in specialized tools such as a wireless intrusion detection / prevention system .
Last , but not least , wireless security is also a people problem and user education goes a long way in mitigating the security risks .
AirTight Networks specializes in wireless security and performance management .
It provides customers cutting - edge wireless intrusion detection and prevention ( WIPS ) solutions to automatically detect , classify , block and locate current and emerging wireless threats .

While the United States and Europe fret over huge deficits and threats to a fragile recovery , this region has a surprise in store .
Latin America , beset in the past by debt defaults , currency devaluations and the need for bailouts from rich countries , is experiencing robust economic growth that is the envy of its northern counterparts .
Strong demand in Asia for commodities like iron ore , tin and gold , combined with policies in several Latin American economies that help control deficits and keep inflation low , are encouraging investment and fueling much of the growth .
The World Bank forecasts that the region ’s economy will grow 4.5 percent this year .
Recent growth spurts around Latin America have surpassed the expectations of many governments themselves .
Brazil , the region ’s rising power , is leading the regional recovery from the downturn of 2009 , growing 9 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year .
Brazil ’s central bank said Wednesday that growth for 2010 could reach 7.3 percent , the nation ’s fastest expansion in 24 years .
After a sharp contraction last year , Mexico ’s economy grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter and may reach 5 percent this year , the Mexican government has said , possibly outpacing the economy in the United States .
UPDATE : A deal reached between BP and four environmental groups suing the company over the burning of endangered sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico will see biologists monitor future oil burns and save as many turtles as they can .
The two sides involved in the litigation presented the agreement to US District Judge Carl Barbier on Friday , Reuters reports .
William Eubanks , an attorney for the environmental groups , told AP Friday that the deal will see “ biologists or other trained observers … present whenever oil is burned . ”

The controlled oil burns in the Gulf have been on hold due to inclement weather .
The agreement states that the observers will be in place before the controlled burns resume on July 6 .
The environmental groups have agreed to withdraw their request for a restraining order stopping the burns , but have reserved the right to bring the request back if BP and the Coast Guard do n’t fulfill their side of the bargain , Bloomberg news service reports .

Daniel Tencer reported ,
A rare and endangered species of sea turtle is being burned alive in BP ’s controlled burns of the oil swirling around the Gulf of Mexico , and a boat captain tasked with saving them says the company has blocked rescue efforts .
Mike Ellis , a boat captain involved in a three - week effort to rescue as many sea turtles from unfolding disaster as possible , says BP effectively shut down the operation by preventing boats from coming out to rescue the turtles .
“ They ran us out of there and then they shut us down , they would not let us get back in there , ” Ellis said in an interview with conservation biologist Catherine Craig .
Part of BP ’s efforts to contain the oil spill are controlled burns .
Fire - resistant booms are used to corral an area of oil , then the area within the boom is lit on fire , burning off the oil and whatever marine life may have been inside .
“ Once the turtles get in there they ca n’t get out , ” Ellis said .

Turtle eggs to be rescued from Gulf of Mexico spil
MIAMI Ã¢â‚¬â€ 
In an ambitious and unprecedented plan to save wildlife , volunteers in coming weeks will move tens of thousands of turtle eggs from oil - soaked Gulf of Mexico beaches to safety on Florida ’s Atlantic coast .

The eggs , which could number some 70,000 , will be carefully hand - picked , placed in special containers , and in driven in temperature - controlled FedEx trucks starting in mid-July , according to the company and rescue officials .
“ There are about 700 nests in Florida and the affected area , and the number of eggs in each it can be anywhere to a 100 to a 128 per nest , ” said Patricia Behnke , with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .

The eggs “ will be incubated in a storage unit , a private facility close to Cape Canaveral , ” on Florida ’s Atlantic coast .
she said .
After a 50 - 60 day incubation period the hatchlings “ will be taken out to the beach at night and released into the sea , probably in an area in mid-eastern Florida coast , ” Behnke said .
The whole process it could last up to four month , she said .

“ A plan like this is absolutely unprecedented and it would not be the choice of our scientists , ” she said .
However the hatchlings are at great risk staying on the oil - soaked Gulf of Mexico beaches and within reach of ocean water polluted by oil and chemical dispersants , she said .
Staff with the US Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) are also participating in the egg rescue .
NOAA warned of the risks of damaging the eggs , but said in a statement that taking no action “ would likely result in the loss of all of this year ?s northern Gulf of Mexico hatchlings . ”

Florida beaches have the highest concentration of turtle nests in the United States , many of them located in the oil - stricken northwestern panhandle area .
This egg moving plan “ applies to nests deposited on Florida panhandle and Alabama beaches during the 2010 nesting season only , as it is this year ? s cohort in the Northern Gulf area which is at the highest risk for encountering oil after entering the ocean , ” said Barbara Schroeder , NOAA Fisheries national sea turtle coordinator .
Animal welfare groups on Wednesday sued BP for burning endangered sea turtles and asked a federal court to stop “ controlled burns ” in the Gulf .
“ It is horrifying that these innocent creatures whose habitat has already been devastated by the oil spill are now being burned alive , ” Animal Welfare Institute ( AWI ) President Cathy Liss told the court in Louisiana .
ADVERTISEMENT
An estimated 430 sea turtles from endangered species have died so far in the oil spill , according to animal welfare groups .
The lawsuit filed by AWI , Center for Biological Diversity , Turtle Island Restoration Network and Animal Legal Defense Fund said BP was violating the Endangered Species Act and other laws with their “ controlled burns ” in the Gulf of Mexico .
They asked the court for a temporary restraining order to stop all burning activities “ until … mechanisms are implemented that will prevent any additional sea turtles from being burned alive . ”
“ Endangered sea turtles , including the Kemp ’s Ridley , one of the rarest sea turtles on Earth , are caught in the gathered oil and unable to escape when the oil is set ablaze , ” the animal welfare groups said .

Special Report
The Costs to American Taxpayers of the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict : $ 3 Trillion
By Thomas R. Stauffer
Conflicts in the Middle East have been very costly to the U.S. , as well as to the rest of the world .
An estimate of the total cost to the U.S. alone of instability and conflict in the region — which emanates from the core , Israeli - Palestinian conflict — amounts to close to $ 3 trillion , measured in 2002 dollars .
This is an amount almost four times greater than the cost of the Vietnam war , also reckoned in 2002 dollars .
Even this figure underestimates the costs because certain classes of expenditure remain unquantified .
In particular , no reliable figure is available for the costs of " Project Independence , " Washington 's lavishly promoted effort to reduce U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East .
That effort , which was subverted early on by diverse local special interests , was designed primarily to insulate Israel from any new " Arab oil weapon " after 1973 / 74 , and may easily have cost $ 1 trillion .
Even though the outlays were rationalized in the interest of " national security , " however , they contributed little or nothing to reducing U.S. strategic dependence upon imported oil from the Middle East .
Similarly , aid to Israel — and thus the regional total — also is understated , since much is outside of the foreign aid appropriation process or implicit in other programs .
Support for Israel comes to $ 1.8 trillion , including special trade advantages , preferential contracts , or aid buried in other accounts .
In addition to the financial outlay , U.S. aid to Israel costs some 275,000 American jobs each year .
The major components in this minimum estimate of the costs are summarized in Table One ; the detailed breakdown is displayed later in Table Two :
The major components in this minimum estimate of the costs are summarized in Table One ; the detailed breakdown is displayed later in Table Two :

Of which identifiable programs $ 285 bn " Defense " of Gulf Oil Supplies Presence and preparedness in the Gulf ( since mid-1980s ) $ 40 bn + Contingent Cost Oil Supply Guarantee for Israel ( 1975 MOU ) $ 3bn / month
TABLE 2 : Detailed Breakdown of Cost of Mideast Conflicts to U.S. Since WWII ( in 2002 dollars or jobs per year )
Total identifiable costs come to almost $ 3 trillion .
About 60 percent , well over half , of those costs — about $ 1.7 trillion — arose from the U.S. defense of Israel , where most of that amount has been incurred since 1973 ( see later section and Table Three ) .
OIL CRISES
The largest single element in the costs has been the series of six oil - supply crises since the end of World War II .
To date these have cost the U.S. $ 1.5 trillion ( again in 2002 dollars ) , excluding the additional costs incurred since 2001 during the build - up toward the second war with Iraq .
Until 1991 , each crisis was triggered by a conflict among two or more Middle Eastern states , usually with the active involvement of at least one extra-regional power .
The nature and impact of the oil crises changed over time , becoming more serious and implying greater risk to the oil - consuming world .
The several earlier Mideast oil crises , in 1956 and 1967 , actually had relatively little effect on the United States .
Indeed , the U.S. profited from exporting surplus oil in 1956 when Mideast supplies — especially of " sterling oil " — were interrupted .
The second such crisis , in 1967 , did have a longer - term impact .
Initially , only the cost of shipping was raised when the Israelis interdicted the Suez Canal .
The splitting of oil markets between east and west of Suez , however , was the catalyst for an overall price increase which otherwise would have been unlikely , if not impossible .
Several OPEC states were successful in exploiting the closure of the Suez Canal to increase oil prices across the board after 1968 .
Again , the effect on the U.S. was relatively small , because U.S. oil imports were still at a low level .
Nonetheless , those increases between 1970 and 1973 did cost the U.S. some $ 40 billion ( in 2002 dollars ) .
The period before 1973 , therefore , had little effect on U.S. oil costs , and the burden of aid to Israel was modest , so the overall cost of Middle East conflicts remained modest .
The major cost prior to 1973 , in fact , was support for Turkey as part of Cold War operations to contain the Soviet Union .
This changed with 1973 , and costs escalated rapidly thereafter .
Starting with the Arab - Israeli war of 1973 , the costs to the U.S. of regional crises and aid programs began to increase beyond any original expectations .
Since 1973 , protection of Israel and subsidies to countries willing to sign peace treaties with Israel , such as Egypt and Jordan , has been the prime driver of U.S. outlays or the trigger for crisis costs .
The 1973 war proved to be dear .
At a minimum , it cost the U.S. between $ 750 billion and $ 1 trillion .
This was the price tag for the rescue of Israel when President Richard Nixon agreed to resupply Israel with U.S. arms as it was losing the war against its neighbors .
Washington 's intervention triggered the Arab oil embargo which cost the U.S. doubly : first , due to the oil shortfall , the US lost about $ 300 billion to $ 600 billion in GDP ; and , second , the U.S. was saddled with another $ 450 billion in higher oil import costs .
A third factor added to the oil - related cost of the 1973 war ( over and above the multi- billion dollar aid package to Israel which began in that year ) .
Deciding to act preventively , as it were , the U.S. created , after some travail , a Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( " SPR " ) designed to insulate Israel and the U.S. against the wielding of a future Arab " oil weapon . "
It was destined to contain one billion barrels of oil which could be released in the event of a supply crisis .
To date the SPR , which still exists and is slowly being expanded , has cost $ 134 billion — since much of the oil was bought at high prices , and because the salvage value is relatively low .
Thus , the 1973 oil crisis , all in all , cost the U.S. economy no less than $ 900 billion , and probably as much as $ 1,200 billion .
Ironically , military costs themselves were negligible .
The 1973 war illustrated the new dimension of Middle East conflicts , where the burdens are economic rather than military .
The next regional oil crisis was relatively less dear , although costly nonetheless .
The Iranian revolution and the subsequent Iran - Iraq war cost the U.S. $ 335 billion in terms of higher oil import prices .
There were two stages .
First , 5 million barrels per day ( b/d ) of Iranian oil exports were suspended when the revolutionaries closed the oil terminals in 1978 .
The resulting shortfall in oil supply , compounded by speculators , doubled oil prices .
Then , just two years later , in 1980 , began the Iran - Iraq war , which interrupted oil exports from both warring countries , causing prices to more than double once again .
The joint effect of the two crises cost the U.S. consumer $ 335 billion in terms of higher prices for imported oil .
It also caused a rise in prices of domestic energy — oil , gas , and coal .
These " knock - on " effects are not included , however , so that the figure of $ 335 billion is indeed a lower bound for the actual costs of those two , back - to - back crises .
The total consumer cost is likely to have been more than double that figure .
The 1990/91 Gulf war , on the other hand , proved to be almost a bargain .
It did cost American consumers approximately $ 80 billion in higher oil prices , including both imported and domestic oil , again excluding the resulting " knock - on " effects .
The military costs of conducting the war itself were all but nil , however , because virtually all the other costs were passed on to Washington 's willing or reluctant allies through " burden - sharing . "
The Germans , Japanese , and some Gulf states contributed cash and kind to the pursuit of the war , with the result that the net military cost to the U.S. was essentially zero .
Officially reported " burden - sharing " contributions amounted to $ 45 billion , compared to officially reported U.S. military costs of $ 49 billion .
Given the inherent imprecision in the budgeted figures , the net effect was a wash .
In fact , the U.S. government actually showed a fiscal profit from the crisis , because it collected at least an additional $ 10 billion in taxes and royalties from the higher prices of domestically produced oil and gas .
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID
This category includes only those amounts which flow through the conventional foreign aid appropriations process .
Ad hoc and special aid is discussed later .
The total for the Middle East is $ 867 billion , which includes the official " Near East " category , plus Greece and Turkey , which are classified as part of Europe for purposes of U.S. statistics .
Greece is included because the Greek lobby has ensured that Greece receives roughly 70 percent as much aid as Turkey as a condition for acquiescing in the appropriations for Turkey .
Thus the outlays for Greece are necessary conditions for the outlays for Turkey , given the U.S. domestic political dynamic , and thus are causally linked to the Middle East .
The official reports are incomplete .
First , it is necessary to estimate the ad hoc and special aid for Israel , which is reported differently , if at all ( see below ) .
Secondly , it is necessary to include such special , but related , transactions as U.S. support for insurgents in the Sudan , or the U.S. share in multilateral aid to Turkey , in order to flesh out the full picture .
" Humanitarian aid " to the revolutionaries in the southern Sudan has aggregated to some $ 2 billion , while the U.S. share of recent multilateral aid to Turkey from the IMF and World Bank can be estimated at $ 7 billion .
It can be argued that this money was made available to Ankara as a result of U.S. pressure , intended to reward Turkey further for its alliance with Israel and as an incentive for further cooperation against Iraq .
Increasingly , aid to the periphery is part of U.S. involvement in the Middle East .
Ethiopia , Somalia and Eritrea are viewed as integral to geopolitical planning for the Middle East , and , more recently , aid to the Central Asian " emergent democracies " is linked in part to Middle East politics , related to efforts to encircle and isolate Iran .
That increasing flow of aid is also part of the larger picture of aid to the Middle East .
Another element is ad hoc support for Israel , which is not part of the formal foreign aid programs .
No comprehensive compilation of U.S. support for Israel has been publicly released .
Additional known items include loan guarantees — which the U.S. most probably will be forced to cover — special contracts for Israeli firms , legal and illegal transfers of marketable U.S. military technology , de facto exemption from U.S. trade protection provisions , and discounted sales or free transfers of " surplus " U.S. military equipment .
An unquantifiable element is the trade and other aid given to Romania and Russia to facilitate Jewish migration to Israel ; this has accumulated to many billions of dollars .
Lastly , unofficial aid , in the form of transfers from the Diaspora resident in the U.S. and net purchases by U.S. parties of Israel Bonds , adds at least $ 40 billion to the total .
A rough estimate , again a minimum , for such additional elements is more than $ 100 billion since 1973 .
U.S. jobs and exports also have been affected , adding to costs and losses .
" Trade followed the flag " in the area — but in the reverse direction .
As U.S. relations with Mideast countries deteriorated , trade was lost .
Worsening political relations resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs .
Some disappeared as a consequence of trade sanctions , some because large contracts were forefeited , thanks to the Israel lobby — as in the case of foregone sales of fighters to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s — and still others due to a dangerously growing trade - aid imbalance vis-Ë†-vis Israel .
Sanctions alone have caused U.S. jobs to disappear .
The trickle of U.S. trade with Iran , Iraq , Libya and Syria — compared to what would have been expected had relations been " normal , " let alone " good " — currently costs the U.S. some 80,000 to 100,000 jobs each year .
The figure is probably higher , in fact , because it does not reflect the lost opportunities for U.S. farmers to export their products into the growing markets of the sanctioned countries .
" Good " relations , however , do not necessarily mean employment gains for Americans .
In the case of Israel , the striking trade - aid imbalance vis-Ë†-vis Israel costs the U.S. almost as many jobs as the sanction regimes .
Israel exports to the U.S. much more than it imports , while it pays for only a fraction of what it does import from the U.S. Specifically , Israel buys little from the U.S. in relation to U.S. aid levels , and the trade - aid imbalance of $ 6 billion to $ 10 billion each year costs about 125,000 jobs .
One aspect of U.S. government policy in the region , however , does create American jobs : the states of the southern Gulf incrementally buy large quantities of U.S. arms and related services .
That relationship , primarily with Saudi Arabia , has translated into an extra 60,000 jobs in recent years .
This gain , due to the special status of Saudi Arabia , partly offsets the jobs lost through Israeli pressures or contracting policies .
Another large element in cost has been the push for energy autarky — specifically , " Project Independence . "
This clutch of programs has been extraordinarily costly since it was initiated as a policy objective in the 1970s .
Oil imports are higher today than before , in spite of the imposing array of subsidies or forced technologies designed to increase U.S. energy production and cut consumption .
No overview of these costs has been compiled .
Identifiable costs come to $ 285 billion , but the grand total is certainly very much higher .
A reasonable estimate is at least one trillion dollars , but only part of that can be documented .
While the subsidies were inevitably justified in the interests of national security , the projects and programs were in most cases captured and co-opted by domestic lobbies .
Since the national objective was reducing dependence upon Mideast oil , however , the costs should be subsumed within the costs of coping with regional conflicts , even if the programs were largely ineffectual .
" Defense " of the Gulf — often cited as a major cost factor — in fact has been but a minor element of cost .
Excluding the buildup for war against Iraq in late 2002 , the official figure for operations and presence in the Gulf is about $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion per year .
That figure is misleading , however .
Most of the equipment and troops and the operations of the carrier task force at Diego Garcia would be maintained in support of other geopolitical objectives , so those outlays , which represent the largest component in the reported " cost , " are not substantively tied to U.S. policies in the Gulf itself .
The U.S. presence itself has entailed relatively modest incremental costs — on the order of $ 2 billion ( net ) per year , exclusive of any new costs tied to the new mobilization against Iraq .
Lastly , a large part of the costs have been inextricably tied to U.S. protection of or support for Israel .
It is therefore useful to pull together the various elements linked to that policy :
Direct costs , excluding crisis costs , have amounted to about $ 800 billion .
This figure includes budgeted U.S. aid for Egypt and Jordan , since that flow of aid is so closely correlated with their postures toward Israel — i.e. , that aid is part of the cost of buying peace for Israel on two of its borders .
It also includes the flow of dollars from private Jews or Jewish organizations in the U.S. to Israel , which are drains on the U.S. balance of payments , analogous to official aid transfers .
The rescue of Israel in 1973 cost another $ 1 trillion , so total direct costs , including the costs of the results of support for Israel , are some $ 1.8 trillion .
There have been further costs where the causal linkage is less clear — aid to the states of the periphery ( Ethiopia , Central Asia , etc. ) , the " defense " of the Gulf , and the costs of Energy Independence .
Although some part of those costs of $ 300 - plus billion are attributable to U.S. support for Israel at the core , any allocation is beyond the scope of this discussion .
A last element is a contingent cost : the cost to the U.S. of the Oil Supply Guarantee which Secretary of State Henry Kissinger proffered the Israelis in 1975 .
If Israel 's oil supply is affected , Israel in effect gets a first call on any oil available to the U.S.
The opportunity cost of that oil depends upon the crisis scenario — a plausible scenario would entail costs to the U.S. of $ 3 billion per month in terms of lost GDP if the U.S. were embargoed at the same time .
EXPENSIVE UNREST
Unrest in the Middle East has proven to be very expensive for the U.S.
It is known that most of American foreign aid goes to Egypt and Israel , but it is clear that the total costs to the U.S. of conflict in the region are very much higher than the aid bill itself .
The total costs of supporting Israel are some six times the official aid , for example .
Oil price crises have been particularly expensive — a sobering lesson from the history of the Middle East over the last 30 years .
Future " burden - sharing " is unlikely — while successful in eliminating much of the cost of the 1990 / 91 Gulf war , it will become much more difficult .
Mercenary allies , such as Turkey , moreover , are likely to demand compensation " up front , " since , they argue , they never received the aid promised to them during the prior Gulf war .
Ankara is especially likely to demand considerable rewards , since it protests that it received little to offset the $ 30 billion it claimed it lost in the last affair .
Israel , too , is demanding more aid — $ 4 billion in extra military support and a further $ 10 bn in loan guarantees , over and above the current level of appropriated aid .
Conflicts in the Middle East have become expensive indeed for the American taxpayer .
It is worth noting , however , that the burden shared by the other oil - consuming states has , in fact , been much higher .
Even though they do not share in policy formation , they do indeed share in the costs of the consequences .
While not greatly drained by foreign aid to the region — unlike the $ 800 billion borne by the U.S. — they bear much more of the costs of oil crises because , collectively , they import much more oil than the U.S.
Thus the total bill — the total burden shared by default — is two to four times higher than that for the U.S. alone .
All states — not just the U.S. — have borne the burden of conflicts in the Middle East .

NEW ORLEANS – Labor leaders here say the oil spill will be worse for workers in this region than Hurricane Katrina was almost five years ago and that the major media , both locally and nationally , are actually downplaying its significance .
“ First they said it was a thousand barrels a day , then 5,000 , now 200,000 and the oil is getting closer every day , ” said Robert “ Tiger ” Hammond , president of the Greater New Orleans AFL - CIO and leader of the IBEW ( International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ) .
“ And once it gets into the marshland it will become a bigger catastrophe than Katrina . ” “ Tiger , ” as he is known in the labor movement and on job sites all over this city , said he fully expects workers here to be hit with a “ double whammy ” on top of Katrina because , “ even if they succeed in building a side by side well that would mean at least 75 to 90 days more of oil gushing into the Gulf .
That brings us to hurricane season ad very possibly oil washing up all over this region . ”
“ Tiger , ” in an interview yesterday with the World , said , “ I ’m hearing already about people with strange rashes and there are whole stretches near the shores and elsewhere where you can already smell the oil .
Fish , animals and sea gulls are dying and there is not enough publicity about it .
It ’s a matter of the people ’s health and of their lives .
And then , if the oil reaches those marshes more than 100,000 people will be almost immediately out of work – this , on top of Katrina and on top of the economic depression already going on is a lot for workers to have to handle . ”
David Magee , vice president of the dock workers ’ union ( ILA , Local 3000 ) , said that environmentalists and others the union has consulted warn that all major commerce here is in imminent danger .
“ We have a heads up that this spill will affect our industry adversely in the next two or three weeks .
We have spoken to the membership and we are all trying to do our best to be prepared . ”
Union workers are already a key to the effort to minimize environmental damage and keep ships flowing through the mouth of the Mississippi River which empties into the Gulf of Mexico .
“ There are cleaning stations where our members are already cleaning the oil off the hulls of ships before they enter and pollute the river , ” Magee explained .
Despite this effort , he said , “ it wo n’t be long before major shippers take their cargo elsewhere .
That will devestate us and hurt the entire national economy by driving up prices . ”
Magee and Chris Hammond , the local ’s secretary treasurer , told the World yesterday that they were both “ first responders ” after Katrina .
They returned to work on the docks within three weeks after the storm to begin the work of rebuilding the port .
“ I was lucky , ” Hammond said , “ because I could live with family 35 miles north of here .
Other workers did n’t have a place to live and even today some of our guys have their families living as far away as Texas . ”
Both were visibly shaken as they discussed the potential impact of the oil spill on dock workers here .
“ The labor movement is working , through the Central Labor Council , with community and environmental groups to try to deal with this , ” Magee said .
“ We are going to push hard to expand our influence in the elections this year , ” Tiger , the AFL - CIO leader said .
“ Candidates backed by labor won most of the elections in the southern part of the state last time around and we will push hard to elect more who come out strong for tougher regulations on the oil industry . ”
Magee said he hoped that people “ will learn from this the importance of regulating these big companies .
There is already reliable information that in a worse case scenario we could be looking at a total evacuation of New Orleans .
Something so terrible as that would be the result of BP ’s cutting corners and not wanting to pay the $ 250,000 it would have cost them to put shut - off valves underneath the oil platforms . ”
Tiger said it was President Bush who let BP off the hook when the company complained that spending the extra money was unnecessary because there would be no accidents .
Hammond and Magee said a broad based movement to fight BP and go after other abusive corporations would be bigger and stronger than it is now if the media were not doing such a poor job of explaining “ just how serious this crisis is . ”
“ Why does the media not demand that BP provide pictures or actual footage of the leaks ? , ” Hammond demanded to know .
“ The company has submarines and all kinds of sophisticated technology down there .
They ’ve come forth with nothing and they havn’t been forthcoming with information even to the President of the United States .
President Obama was down here and offered them all kinds of resources .
Why are n’t they taking advantage of them ? ”

Japan 's kite - shaped " space yacht " has successfully started sailing through space using solar - power generation .
A Japanese rocket last month launched the experimental Ikaros - or Interplanetary Kite - craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun - which is designed to be propelled by the pressure of sunlight particles .
The technology could eventually enable space travel without fuel , as long as there is sunlight .
Similar to an ocean yacht pushed by wind , the device has a square , ultra - thin and flexible sail measuring 14 metres by 14 metres that will be driven through space as it is pelted by solar particles .
The sail , which was fully expanded on Thursday , is only a fraction of the thickness of a human hair and is partly coated with thin - film solar cells to generate electricity .
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) has released a statement confirming " the full expansion of the sail and electric generation with thin film solar cells at about 7.7 million kilometres from Earth " .
The spacecraft 's name alludes to Icarus , the figure from Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun .
The space yacht is headed in the direction of Venus , however .
Ikaros , which cost 1.5 billion yen ( $ 19 million ) to develop , will be the first use of propellant - free technology in deep space , although it has been tested in orbit around the Earth before .
JAXA has said the navigation technology " will mark the first spectacular achievement of its kind in the world " .

It 's the July 4 weekend , so naturally our thoughts turn to independence , and bloody , lovely revolution .
Unfortunately , overturning your colonial rulers is hard work .
So we 've collected tips from the ten greatest science fiction revolutionaries , to help you prevail .

John Sheridan ( Babylon 5 )
The lesson : Keep an ace up your sleeve .
When President Clark of Earth declares martial law , the Babylon 5 station breaks away from the Earth alliance , and Sheridan starts recruiting Earth colonies to join his uprising .
The odds are way , way against Sheridan — but there 's a reason why he's the only human ever to have taken out a Minbari warship .
He has an ace in the hole :
There are a group of telepaths who have been programmed to interface with the Shadows ' vessels , but their programming has driven them nuts and they screw up all technology when you take them out of cryosleep .
These telepaths were a minor plot point earlier in season three , but Sheridan forgets nothing , and just when you least expect it , he smuggles them aboard Earth ships and takes out a large portion of the Earth fleet all at once .
He also does a great job recruiting allies , including ships from the League Of Non-Aligned Worlds .
This show , in general , is one long tutorial in insurrection — there is n't a major character on the show who has n't overthrown at least one planetary government .

The Authority ( The Authority )
The lesson : Become the lesser of two evils .
The Authority only take over the government of the United States after there 's been a series of hideous failures that blow up the whole state of Florida and nearly caused a war with a set of extra-dimensional aliens .
It 's time to clean house , and the Authority are the ultimate ass - kicking Roomba of justice .
Of course , as the fantastic / weird Ed Brubaker run on the comic proves , taking power is the easy part for these guys — holding on to it turns out to be the hard part .

Luke Skywalker ( Star Wars )

The lesson : Invalidate the governing ideology .
At the end of Return Of The Jedi , Luke does n't just defeat Darth Vader in combat — he also proves that the Empire 's main ideology is wrong .
The Dark Side of the Force is not stronger than the Light Side .
This is as powerful a blow against the Empire as launching a million X - wing fighters , because it undermines the Emperor 's whole reason for being in charge .
Instead of Vader converting Luke to the Dark Side , Luke brings Vader back to the light .

The Doctor ( Doctor Who )

The lesson : Declare victory early .
The Doctor has overthrown more oppressive planetary governments than almost anyone .
For a while there , he was toppling two or three a year .
His greatest revolutions , arguably , happen in " The Happiness Patrol , " " The Sunmakers , " and " The Long Game . "
And in all three cases , he 's very interested in controlling the state 's propaganda apparatus .
This is especially true in " The Sunmakers , " where he takes over the government 's broadcasting center and announces that the revolution has been a success — before it 's even started .
Why wait until you 've actually won to declare victory ?
Life is short , even for a Time Lord .

Mike ( The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress )
The lesson : Do n't be afraid to cheat
Mike , the computer that helps the residents of the lunar colony revolt against their Earth overlords , is n't above using base trickery to get ahead .
When he worries that the Earth people will try to take out the electromagnetic catapult that the Loonies use to send grain to Earth ( and which could be a powerful weapon ) he has the Loonies build a secret backup model .
He impersonates the colony 's governor , to trick the Earth people into think they 're still in control for a while after the revolution .
He even allegedly stuffs the ballot box in the newly independent colony 's first election .
Because winning means cutting some corners sometimes .

The lesson : Force your enemies to put all their strength into their offensive
When Tron and Flynn lead the attack against the Master Control Program , they 're outgunned , even though Flynn has amazing user powers .
But when Tron attacks the Master Control Program 's main enforcer , the program Sark , the MCP starts to panic .
And the MCP makes a crucial mistake , putting all of its functions into Sark .
This causes Sark to become giant and super - powerful , but it also creates a giant target — and leaves the MCP itself unprotected .

The lesson : Control access to a key resource
In the first Dune book , Paul proves he 's the Kwisatz Haderach , and then launches an assault on the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV with the help of his Fremen allies .
They win partly by riding on the enormous sandworms that are native to the planet Arrakis , aka Dune .
But also , when Paul wins an audience with Shaddam , he threatens to destroy the spice , melange , that allows navigators to see and travel between worlds , unless Shaddam steps down as Emperor in favor of Paul .
Faced with the loss of the all - important spice , the Spacer 's Guild urges Shaddam to fold .

Captain Kirk ( Star Trek )
Advertisement
The lesson : Blow up the computer .
I do n't think Captain Kirk ever overthrew a repressive regime without first causing its computer systems to explode .
It 's just the way you do things , in James Tiberius ' playbook :
Step one , detonate the mainframe , and the system will collapse like a house of cards .
Step two usually involves giving an impassioned speech with your shirt ripped in strategic places .
But really , Kirk knows that most evil regimes are either run by a computer , or utterly dependent on a computer for their surveillance and social control infrastructure .
And most computers can be talked into self - destructing .
Oh , and if someone accuses you of being Archons , just run with it — especially if it freaks them out .
The SG - 1 crew ( Stargate SG - 1 )
Advertisement
The lesson : Prove that the godlike rulers are n't wielding the power of magic , just technology .
Pretty much every time the SG - 1 gang steps through a stargate , they wind up upsetting the order of the galaxy .
In their original movie , they defeat the false god Ra , and over the course of their series they bump off a bunch of the System Lords , former rulers of the galaxy .
They also take time to unseat a bunch of random dictators and oppressive governments that are n't connected to the System Lords but are still unfair or icky .
Overthrowing governments just comes naturally to these folks .
And a lot of the time , they do this by proving the Goa'uld are using regular old technology , not magic , and anybody can control it .
( They also gain key allies , including the Tok'ra and former Jaffa Teal'c , which is an important factor too . )

The lesson : Create symbols that are more important than any one individual
( Spoiler alert ! )
V dies at the end of the miniseries , but through a series of twisted mindgames and psychological torture , he creates his own replacement : Evie , who takes over wearing the iconic mask and destroys Downing Street .
The uprising succeeds partly because V , the symbol , can't be destroyed as easily as just wiping out one single person .

LIC has NEFT as the payment option for their policyholders from the last few years .
The procedure for a policy owner is to download LIC NEFT form , fill and submit it at a nearest LIC office for claims and getting maturity payments .
LIC then deposits the survival / death benefit to the bank account of the policy owner through online transfer ( NEFT ) .
It was a well - working system until the recent COVID outbreak in India .
Now with the lockdown and limited office timing , the company has finally come up with online registration for LIC NEFT details .

Police have arrested 178 people in Europe and the United States suspected of cloning credit and debit cards in an international scam worth over 20 million euro ( $ 24.52 million ) , according to a report from Reuters and authorities in Spain .
The stories so far are all light on details or whether this bust was connected to specific fraud forums that facilitate the trade in stolen credit card data , but the wire reports include the following information :
Police in fourteen countries participated a two - year investigation , initiated in Spain where police have discovered 120,000 stolen credit card numbers and 5,000 cloned cards , arrested 76 people and dismantled six cloning labs .
The raids were made primarily in Romania , France , Italy , Germany , Ireland and the United States , with arrests also made in Australia , Sweden , Greece , Finland and Hungary .
The detainees are also suspected of armed robbery , blackmail , sexual exploitation and money - laundering , the police said .
Source here .
There is also quite a bit more juicy information in the press release from Spanish Ministry of Interior , a Google translated version of which is available here .
For all you Spanish speakers , the original version is here .
Criminals can clone debit cards if they have access to the cardholder ’s PIN as well as the data stored on the magnetic strip on the back of these payment cards .
In some cases , crooks obtain these “ dumps ” by stealing the data ( either in person or via hacking ) online or main street merchants .
Another popular method of obtaining dumps and PINs is through the use of ATM skimmers , which I have written about extensively .
According to Spanish police , as part of the raids Germany has arrested 16 people involved in skimming bank cards ( look for another KrebsOnSecurity post on ATM skimmers sometime in the next week or so ) .
In related news , MasterCard announced it is trialing a new debit card that includes not only a computer chip but also a tiny digital display that produces a one - time password for each online transaction .
But do n’t expect to see these replacing regular , low tech credit and debit cards here in the U.S. , at least not for a while .
Slashgear.com reports that the devices are being trialed with Turkish bank for now .

[ [ nid:13455 ] ]
Having just returned from his fourth trip to the Gulf Region , the President addressed the American people for the first time from the Oval Office .
He focused on the government 's ongoing all - out response to the immediate crisis , the steps being taken to make sure such a crisis does not happen again , and the longer term crisis of America ’s reliance on fossil fuels .
And for the Gulf Region in particular , which has gone through the toughest of times in recent years , he announced that he has tasked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy and a former governor of Mississippi , with developing a long - term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible in conjunction with states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists , and other Gulf residents .
On the immediate crisis :
Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced .
And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it ’s not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days .
The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years .
But make no mistake :
We will fight this spill with everything we ’ve got for as long as it takes .
We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused .
And we will do whatever ’s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy .
Tonight I ’d like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward : what we ’re doing to clean up the oil , what we ’re doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we ’re doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again .
First , the cleanup .
From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation ’s history -- an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters .
We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil .
Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf .
And I ’ve authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast .
These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , they ’re ready to help clean the beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims -- and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible .
Because of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming and other collection methods .
Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil .
We ’ve approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we ’re working with Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines .
On making sure it never happens again :
A few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe –- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken .
That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why .
The American people deserve to know why .
The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion -- these families deserve to know why .
And so I ’ve established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place .
Already , I ’ve issued a six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling .
I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue .
And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially .
One place we ’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service .
Over the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves .
At this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight .
Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations .
When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency .
But it ’s now clear that the problem there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow .
And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency -- Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General .
And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry ’s watchdog -- not its partner .

If you have never used Irwin brand Vise - Grips , you need to reevaluate your goals in life .
They are so unbelievably awesome , that human words cannot describe them .
They should be the prize that you win in every contest throughout life .
Graduation from anything should get you a set of vise grips .
Instead of worthless tokens & tickets , arcade games should hand kids Vise - Grips with every new high score .
Birthday parties should be limited to Vise - Grip related gifts only .
Every car coming off the assembly line should have a pair of Vise - Grips attached to a panel in the trunk .
If aliens do really exist , they are likely just coming to earth to try to get some new Vise Grips .
If something goes horrible wrong in 2012 , you better hope that somebody tucked away a pair of Vise - Grips in a secret chamber .
Without them , we will all be doomed .
Vise Grips Can :
– Open Vise - Grips that are so tightly gripped that the only way you can open them is with more Vise - Grips .
– Take the place of every size socket , wrench , and screwdriver you own
– Tear things off / apart
– Remove flywheels
– Hold things while you weld / grind / cut them
– Temporarily & permanently hold parts onto your vehicle for inspection purposes
– Break stuff when you want to break it
– Remove all the broken stuff that you broke
– Hammer on stuff ( not recommended , but it works )
– Pinch you into submission
– Turn stuff that is stuck or not meant to be turned
– Hold up your hood / hatch
– Crush imposters that fail to grip , and always slip .
– Survive the worst that you can throw at them
– Laugh at other tools when they ca n’t successfully do their intended job
– Ever - so - gently grab gentle stuff
– Work forever , no matter how long your forget them in the rain .
Full Disclosure : I truly love Vise Grips this much , and even if I owned 100 of them I would still need more .
Would I trade your lunch for a pair of Vise - Grips ?
You better believe I would .
Sure we have all been bitten by them a couple times , but that is just the Vise - Grips ’ way of saying “ Excuse me mere mortal , my supernatural grip is mightier than all .
Respect the grip or the pain of a blood blister will be bestowed upon thee !! ”

Emperors are the largest of all penguins — an average bird stands some 45 inches tall .
These flightless animals live on the Antarctic ice and in the frigid surrounding waters .
Antarctic Adaptations
Penguins employ physiological adaptations and cooperative behaviors in order to deal with an incredibly harsh environment , where wind chills can reach - 76 °F .
They huddle together to escape wind and conserve warmth .
Individuals take turns moving to the group 's protected and relatively toasty interior .
Once a penguin has warmed a bit it will move to the perimeter of the group so that others can enjoy protection from the icy elements .
Emperor penguins spend the long winter on the open ice — and even breed during this harsh season .
Females lay a single egg and then promptly leave it behind .
They undertake an extended hunting trip that lasts some two months !
Depending on the extent of the ice pack , females may need to travel some 50 miles just to reach the open ocean , where they will feed on fish , squid , and krill .
At sea , emperor penguins can dive to 1,850 feet — deeper than any other bird — and stay under for more than 20 minutes .
Reproduction and Parenting
Male emperors keep the newly laid eggs warm , but they do not sit on them , as many other birds do .
Males stand and protect their eggs from the elements by balancing them on their feet and covering them with feathered skin known as a brood pouch .
During this two - month bout of babysitting the males eat nothing and are at the mercy of the Antarctic elements .
When female penguins return to the breeding site , they bring a belly full of food that they regurgitate for the newly hatched chicks .
Meanwhile , their duty done , male emperors take to the sea in search of food for themselves .
( CNN ) -- Federal officials announced indictments Tuesday against four police officers and two supervisors in the investigation surrounding the post - Katrina deaths of civilians on New Orleans ' Danziger Bridge .
At least three New Orleans police officers were in FBI custody Tuesday afternoon , an attorney for one of them confirmed .
Kenneth Bowen , Anthony Villavaso and Robert Gisevius surrendered to authorities .
Announcement of the charges stemming from a federal civil rights investigation was made by Attorney General Eric Holder in New Orleans .
" Put simply , we will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who have sworn to protect the public , " Holder told reporters .
Holder promised the Justice Department will help restore the troubled New Orleans police department .
" Today marks an important step forward in administering justice , in healing community wounds , in improving public safety and in restoring public trust in this city 's police department , " Holder said .
He was joined by the Justice Department 's civil rights chief , Thomas E. Perez , and U.S. Attorney Jim Letten , the top federal prosecutor in New Orleans .
The shootings occurred at the bridge on September 4 , 2005 , six days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast .
The indictment allegesthat two separate shootings at the bridge resulted in the deaths of a teenager and a 40 - year - old disabled man .
The indictment contends four officers -- Bowen , Gisevius , Robert Faulcon and Villavaso -- opened fire , killing 19 - year - old James Brissette .
Minutes later , Faulcon allegedly shot and killed 40 - year - old Ronald Madison .
The indictment says the officers violated the victims ' civil rights .
The indictment says police supervisors Arthur Kaufman and Gerard Dugue helped the other officers to obstruct justice during the subsequent investigations .
An earlier investigation launched by the local district attorney resulted in charges but no convictions .
Federal prosecutors then moved in and launched a new investigation which led to the newly announced charges .
Letten said the federal case took so long because prosecutors waited for the local investigation to conclude , so as not to interfere or duplicate that probe .
Although the charges announced Tuesday carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty , Letten played down that likelihood , saying an extended process will eventually be followed and any final decision on seeking the death penalty would be made by Holder .
Attorney Frank DeSalvo , who represents Bowen , said of the indictment , " We expected it and are ready to deal with it . "
The two shootings occurred on opposite sides of the bridge .
In the first shooting , on the east side of the bridge , one person -- later identified as Brissette -- was killed and four people were wounded , prosecutors have said .
In the second shooting , on the bridge 's west side , Madison , a severely disabled man , was killed .
Madison 's brother was arrested but later released without indictment , authorities said .
A witness to the shooting of Madison told CNN in 2006 that New Orleans police lined up " like at a firing range " and fatally shot the man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore .
" He just fell like he was collapsing , " Kasimir Gaston told CNN .
" Like something just wiped him out . "
Gaston was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the Friendly Inn , a low - income motel on the city 's east side .
He said on Sunday , September 4 , 2005 , he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running , hands outstretched and being fired upon .
Initial police accounts said that Madison , 40 , reached for his waistband and turned on police , but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police " hands out , full speed " when he was shot .
Police declined CNN 's request for an interview in response to Gaston 's remarks .
After the shooting , police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the Danziger Bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects .
A police department press release from October 4 , 2005 , said Madison , described as an unidentified gunman , was " confronted by a New Orleans Police officer .
The suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot , fatally wounding him . "
When asked if Madison had a gun , Gaston said , " I did n't see any on him . "
No gun was found on Madison 's body .
An autopsy report obtained previously by CNN and verified by the Orleans Parish Coroner said Madison suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder .
CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
Small mammals have been gnawing on bones for calcium and protein to supplement their diet for 75 million years , according to a report on the oldest known evidence of gnawing : on dinosaur bones .
The study was published online June 16 by the journal Palaeontology .
Scientists found mammalian bite marks on the rib of a dinosaur and on the femur bone of another dinosaur , as well as on fossil bones of an aquatic reptile and a marsupial  all from the Cretaceous period .
The bones have opposing pairs of teeth marks on them , a bite attributed only to mammals during that time .
They appear to have been made by multituberculates , a now - extinct group of mammals that were small and rodentlike in appearance , said Nicholas R. Longrich , the study ’s lead author and a paleontologist at Yale University .
It is possible that the mammals were eating meat off the dinosaur bones , but based on the bite marks this does not seem to be the case .

Baby boomers — those of us born between the end of the war and the early 60s — are a failed generation , ” said Alex Jadad , chief innovator and founder , Centre for Global eHeath Innovation ( and much else ) , at a conference on last week .
I ’m a baby boomer .
Am I the member of a failed generation ?
Sadly I think that I am , although there might be just time to put it right .
There ’s no disputing that we are an extremely privileged generation , probably the most privileged that has ever lived .
My grandfather was at Gallipoli , and my father at El Alamein .
I ’ve never been in the army , never at war .
I ’ve hardly ever seen violence — except on television .
My father left school at 14 , my mother at 16 .
I was the first in my family to go to university .
I have 21 years of full time education and three degrees ( but still ca n’t speak a foreign language or play a musical instrument . ) .
What ’s more , I was given a grant to go to university , have an index linked pension that begins when I ’m 60 , and a house worth over a million pounds .
My mother hardly ever went abroad , and my father only to fight .
I ’ve been to 66 countries .
I am , I must confess , one of the lucky of the lucky , but us baby boomers are richer and better educated than any other generation and have enjoyed more peace .
So what have we done with all this privilege ?
“ Buggered it up for everybody ” is the sad answer .
It ’s hard to know whether our biggest failure is to do with climate change or poverty .
Scientists first began to recognise climate change soon after the war , and activists were beginning to call for action some 20 years ago .
Yet here we are pumping out almost as much greenhouse gas as ever and with a gross failure in Copenhagen .
And in our ever more desperate attempts to find oil we are destroying environments like the Gulf of Mexico .
The world is a much more polluted place than when we were born , and thousands of species have disappeared forever .
Considering how rich we are we ’ve made precious little progress with poverty .
The gap between rich and poor has widened , and 80 % of the world ’s population lives on less than $ 10 a day .
We did manage to create the Millennium Development Goals , but we look set to miss most of them .
Then through greed and financial ignorance , a disastrous cocktail , we ’ve managed to accumulate levels of debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay off while working ever longer and trying to find a way to care for the air craft hangers full of us dementing baby boomers .
( I could understand if they did n’t bother . )
One “ achievement ” has been to lengthen life for ourselves , but this is a dubious achievement as we seem to overemphasised quantity and underemphasised quality .
And we have created such an obesogenic and unhealthy environment that our children may have shorter lives than us .
We baby boomers have perhaps another 30 years to go and that might be enough time to make amends .
But our record so far gives little cause for optimism .
I think of Kennedy ’s quote–
“ To those whom much is given , much is expected ”

This month , the Italian utility Enel unveiled " Archimede " , the first Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP ) plant in the world to use molten salts for heat transfer and storage , and the first to be fully integrated to an existing combined - cycle gas power plant .
Archimede is a 5 MW plant located in Priolo Gargallo ( Sicily ) , within Europe 's largest petrochemical district .
The breakthrough project was co-developed by Enel , one of World 's largest utilities , and ENEA , the Italian National Agency for New Technologies , Energy and Sustainable Economic Development .
Several CSP plants already operate around the world , mainly in the US and Spain .
They use synthetic oils to capture the Sun 's energy in the form of heat , by using mirrors that beam sunlight onto a pipe where pressurised oil heats up to around 390°C .
A heat exchanger is then used to boil water and run a conventional steam turbine cycle .
Older CSP plants can only operate at daytime – when direct sunlight is available - , an issue that has been dealt with in recent years by introducing heat storage , in the form of molten salts .
Newer CSP plants , as the many under construction in Spain , use molten salts storage to extend the plants ' daily operating hours .
Archimede is the first plant in the world to use molten salts not just to store heat but also to collect it from the sun in the first place .
This is a competitive advantage , for a variety of reasons .
Molten salts can operate at higher temperatures than oils ( up to 550 °C instead of 390 °C ) , therefore increasing efficiency and power output of a plant .
With the higher - temperature heat storage allowed by the direct use of salts , the plant can also extend its operating hours well further than an oil - operated CSP plant with molten salt storage , thus working 24 hours a day for several days in the absence of sun or during rainy days .
This feature also enables a simplified plant design , as it avoids the need for oil - to - salts heat exchangers , and eliminates the safety and environmental concerns related to the use of oils ( molten salts are cheap , non -toxic common fertilizers and do not catch fire , as opposed to synthetic oils currently used in CSP plants around the World ) .
Last but not least , the higher temperatures reached by the molten salts enable the use of steam turbines at the standard pressure / temperature parameters as used in most common gas - cycle fossil power plants .
This means that conventional power plants can be integrated – or , in perspective , replaced – with this technology without expensive retrofits to the existing assets .
So why has n't this technology come before ?
There are both political and technical issues behind this .
Let 's start with politics .
The concept dates back to 2001 , when Italian nuclear physicist and Nobel prize winner Carlo Rubbia , ENEA 's President at the time , first started Research & Development on molten salt technology in Italy .
Rubbia has been a preminent CSP advocate for a long time , and was forced to leave ENEA in 2005 after strong disagreements with the Italian Government and its lack of convincing R&D policies .
He then moved to CIEMAT , the Spanish equivalent of ENEA .
Under his guidance , Spain has now become world leader in the CSP industry .
Luckily for the Italian industry , the Archimede project was not abandoned and ENEA continued its development till completion .
There are also various technical reasons that have prevented an earlier development of this new technology .
Salts tend to solidify at temperatures around 220 °C , which is a serious issue for the continuous operation of a plant .
ENEA and Archimede Solar Energy , a private company focusing on receiver pipes , developed several patents in order to improve the pipes ' ability to absorbe heat , and the parabolic mirrors ' reflectivity , therefore maximising the heat transfer to the fluid carrier .
The result of these and several other technological improvements is a top - notch world 's first power plant with a price tag of around 60 million euros .
It 's a hefty price for a 5 MW power plant , even compared to other CSP plants , but there is overwhelming scope for a massive roll - out of this new technology at utility scale in sunny regions like Northern Africa , the Middle East , Australia , the US .
The Italian CSP association ANEST claims Italy could host 3-5,000 MW of CSP plants by 2020 , with huge benefits also in terms of jobs creation and industrial know - how .
A lot more can be achieved in the sun belt south of the Mediterranean Sea , and in the Middle East .
If the roll out of solar photovoltaics in Italy is to offer any guidance ( second largest market in the World in 2009 ) , exciting times are ahead for Concentrating Solar Power .

Toxicology tests have reportedly found that two teenagers who were thought to have died as a result of taking mephedrone – leading to a successful campaign to ban it – had not taken the drug .
The deaths in March of Louis Wainwright , 18 , and Nicholas Smith , 19 , contributed to a furore over mephedrone , which was at the time legal and being sold over the internet .
The Labour government banned the legal high in the final days of the last parliament , sacrificing other legislation in order to push through an amendment that made the synthetic substance a class B drug .
Today the BBC reported that toxicology tests had revealed there were no traces of mephedrone in the blood of the two Scunthorpe teenagers .
It said further tests were being conducted to try to establish what , if any , substances the two had taken .
Mephedrone – which prior to the ban was marketed as plant food with names such as Bubbles and M - Cat – is a synthetic imitation of cathinone , a compound found in the plant khat .
Humberside police prompted widespread concern in March when they held a press conference over the teenagers ' deaths , announcing there was " information to suggest these deaths are linked to M - Cat " .
The force advised anyone who had taken the drug to attend a hospital " as a matter or urgency " .
Drug campaigners , teachers , doctors and leading politicians called for an immediate ban on the drug , which ministers made a priority .
The force last night declined to comment on the toxicology tests , saying the final report was incomplete .
" The findings of the report , once completed , will be forwarded to the coroner and may be discussed at any inquest and will not be disclosed without the authority of HM Coroner , " it said in a statement .
North - east Lincolnshire coroner 's court has refused to comment .
Professor David Nutt , whom the government sacked last year as chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) after he questioned government drugs policy , said the Scunthorpe deaths had been a tipping point in the debate over the drug .
He called for an inquiry into Humberside police for publicly speculating over the deaths .
" The temperature was rising a bit , but the deaths got it boiling over , " he said .
" You can argue if that had n't happened the previous government would n't have been bounced into this response .
If these reports are true , the government 's rush to ban mephedrone never had any serious scientific credibility – it looks much more like a decision based on a short - term electoral calculation . "
He added : " This news demonstrates why it 's so important to base drug classification on the evidence , not fear and why the police , media and politicians , should only make public pronouncements once the facts are clear . "
The former home secretary , Alan Johnson , who repeatedly clashed with Nutt , responded that the decision had been taken after advice from ACMD , which was being led by a new chairman .
" We took advice from the ACMD , " he said in a statement .
" The advice was n't based on any deaths that had occurred in recent times , but on the prevalence and availability of the drug and its potential harm . "
Professor Roumen Sedefov , a leading scientist who monitors new drugs for the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) , was mandated this week to begin a risk assessment of mephedrone .
He said he was aware of only one fatality in the world – that of a woman in Sweden – where the drug had been definitively identified as the cause of death .
Referring to data provided to him by the UK government , he said officials had identified 26 cases where mephedrone may have been a contributing cause of death .
There had been definitive results in three cases , two of which showed that the drug , though present in the body , had not contributed to the death .
The third death was put down to " adverse affects " of methadone and mephedrone , he said .
Methadone is a heroin substitute linked to thousands of deaths .
This gets more ridiculous by the day .
Why should workers have to suffer only because BP does n’t want workers wearing safety masks ?
Is anyone in Washington planning to step up and push BP aside to save more lives or will BP continue to decide what the rules are going to be ?
BP has zero credibility so how about we focus on protecting workers who are helping to protect others ?
For days now , Dr. Damon Dietrich has seen patients come through his emergency room at West Jefferson Medical Center with similar symptoms : respiratory problems , headaches and nausea .
In the past week , 11 workers who have been out on the water cleaning up oil from BP ’s blown - out well have been treated for what Dietrich calls “ a pattern of symptoms ” that could have been caused by the burning of crude oil , noxious fumes from the oil or the dispersants dumped in the Gulf to break it up .
All workers were treated and released .
“ One person comes in , it could be multiple things , ” he said .
“ Eleven people come in with these symptoms , it makes it incredibly suspicious . ”
" When did women exchanging bodily fluids and a little light bondage become the most obscene thing in the land ? " asks Constance Penley , a University of California at Santa Barbara professor well - known for her classes on pornography .
That question may be answered this week when porn producer John Stagliano 's federal obscenity trial enters its second week .
Stagliano faces up to 32 years in prison for distributing the adult films Milk Nymphos , Storm Squirters 2 : Target Practice , and a promo reel for a trailer for Belladonna 's Fetish Fanatic Five via his website for Evil Angel Productions ( adults only ) .
( Full disclosure : Stagliano has been a donor to Reason Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this website . )
Emboldened by the Stagliano trial , a group of anti-pornography organizations recently held an event to demand a new " War on Pornography . "
" We have a war on pornography and we 're going to win it , " declares Patrick Trueman , a former Department of Justice prosecutor and leader of the War on Pornography Coalition .
" The pornographers know exactly what they 're doing and they 're not going to respond to anything but the stick of the law , " adds Donna Rice Hughes , founder of Enough is Enough .
But Reason.tv speaks with others , including an adult film actress and fetish film director , who promise to resist the anti-porn crusaders .
And there is a bigger issue at stake , says Marty Klein , author of America 's War on Sex : The Attack on Law , Lust and Liberty .
" The right to see South Park , may actually depend on the right to watch Butt Busters 3 , " says Klein .
" If people want to have the right to do what they want to do , they have to protect the rights of other people to do what other people want to do . "

A 35 - year - old Manitoba man who uses a wheelchair is recovering from surgery in Sydney , Australia , after he was severely beaten late Tuesday night .
A still from video footage captured at the train station where Heath Proden was beaten shows him with one of his assailants .
( ( CCTV / City Rail ) )
Heath Proden suffered a fractured skull and deep cuts during the beating , which happened at a train station northeast of the city at about 11 p.m. local time .
He underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain .
Doctors say the procedure went well and he should recover , according to Proden 's mother , who lives in Winnipeg Beach .
Shellan Proden said it was a huge relief to get the news her son was going to be OK , and to finally speak with him for the first time since learning about the beating .
" Oh , it felt like somebody let the air right out of me .
My body 's been so tense , " she said , adding her son does n't realize how much worldwide interest and concern has been generated by the attack .
" He said , ' Do n't worry , it 's nothing , ' " Proden said .
She is not sure when he will be well enough to return home but has been told no further operations are expected .
Closed - circuit cameras at the Mt. Druitt commuter rail station recorded video of Proden being stomped on by two young men , who also hit him on the head and body with metal bars , including one from his wheelchair .
Police have charged two boys , aged 15 and 16 , with intent to cause bodily harm and armed robbery .
Both have been denied bail and are expected to remain in custody pending future court dates .
Suspects claim self - defence
Friends of the accused teenagers are trying to turn the tables , saying they were provoked by Proden and lashed out in self - defence .
" My boys called me up and said that .
I know it 's true for a fact that they do n't hit anyone for nothing , " the father of one of the accused said , speaking to BBC reporter Phil Mercer .
" They said that the guy came up to them and was hassling them . "
If there was a verbal provocation , that 's still no excuse for what happened , said Proden , who has not spoken about the incident with her son and has no idea what prompted it .
" They have legs — walk away , " she said .
" You know , you do n't have to hurt anybody , you do n't have to beat them .
To come back that many times to excessively beat on him .
Like , you made your point the first time when you knocked him out of the chair . "
Heath Proden and girlfriend Kristin Sharrock pose in an undated photo .
( ( Family photo ) ) Australian police Supt .
Wayne Cox called the assault an act of cowardice .
" The attack is quite savage and certainly unprovoked from what we can see , " he said .
Heath Proden , who is also from Winnipeg Beach , tried to leave the station via an elevator but was punched in the face by one of the boys and knocked from his chair , police said .
He has been living in Australia with his girlfriend , Kristin Sharrock , since November .
She has been at his bedside and keeping the family informed .
" He 's a kind , generous , strong individual , " Sharrock said Wednesday , fighting back tears .
" He does n't deserve what 's happened to him . "
Her boyfriend , who has used a wheelchair since breaking his back in a snowmobile accident in 2000 , was on his way home from seeing Canadian country music band Doc Walker play at a bar when he was attacked .
He grew up with members of the band in Portage la Prairie , Man. , about 70 kilometres west of Winnipeg .
Airline ticket offered to mom
Jason Webb , an Australian who has been living in Canada for 14 years , said he is devastated and embarrassed about what happened in his native land .
It 's one of those moments when you 're not proud to be where you 're from , he said .
" You know , I 've been telling myself that , you know , trying to make myself feel better about it saying this probably could 've happened anywhere in the world , " he said .
" It 's just one of those horrible things that you hear about now and again that should never have happened at all . "
Webb , who now lives in Calgary and owns the Down Under Travel agency , is offering to fly Shellan Proden to Australia for free to visit her son .
Peter Debenham , who grew up in Sydney , but has lived in Winnipeg since 1981 , has also been shocked by the violent incident .
The attack was front - page news in Australia because it was so unusual , he said .
" It 's just a despicable act .
It would be terrible to happen to anybody , let alone a disabled person , " he said .
" The Australian population is embarrassed , too , that this would happen to a tourist .
No , everybody 's just shocked that it would happen .
" It is extremely unusual and hopefully , it would never happen again . "

As the Hershey Trolley carried tourists past the chocolate plant that Milton S. Hershey built , workers walked to their cars Tuesday carrying white envelopes with information about the company ’s plans to close the historic factory .
Workers said they will vote Friday on whether to accept the company ’s plan to transfer jobs to the newer West plant , with a severance package offered to those who do n’t make the cut .
There was a mix of sadness and anger among the workers , most of whom said they ’ll vote for the proposal to save at least some jobs .
“ There is really no option , ” said Todd Zulick of Lebanon , who said he ’s worked at the plant for 30 years .
“ There was no negotiating — they said this is the way it ’s going to be . ”
Company officials have said 500 to 600 jobs might be lost when it closes the 19 E. Chocolate Ave. plant , but some workers would be offered positions at the West plant .
Employees said about 1,000 workers are at the older factory .
Darwin Williams of Harrisburg , who ’s worked at the plant since 1980 , also said he sees little choice other than to take the company ’s offer .
“ We knew when the next contract came around we were going to take a beating , ” he said .
“ Even when we get to West Hershey , there could be a situation if somebody decides they could do it cheaper somewhere else , they ’ll do it , ” Williams said .
“ I do n’t think anything in Hershey is secure . ”
Teresa Smith of North Cornwall Township , who has worked at the older plant for 29 years , said she was n’t shocked by the news , just disappointed .
“ It ’s very upsetting .
They ’re not looking at what the legacy of this place was , ” she said .
Brent Johnson , who ’s worked there 11 years , said the second shift was going to hear details in a meeting at the start of its day .
“ Friday we ’ll vote .
If it does n’t end up ‘ yes , ’ it will close at the end of the year .
If it ’s ‘ yes , ’ they ’ll keep it open until 2013 , and everything will move to West Hershey , ” Johnson said .
“ I think Hershey is greedy , ” he said .
“ It ’s a billion - He said he thinks the company ’s goal is to pay lower wages and insurance benefits .
The lowest - paid worker earns about $ 20 an hour , he said .
People in downtown Hershey seemed resigned to the news and not surprised .
A woman who worked at the Parkside Hotel across from Hersheypark on East Derry Road described the announcement as a self - fulfilling prophecy that the company could have prevented if it had invested in the old plant .
“ Surely , they could see this coming , ” said the woman , who would not give her name .
She could n’t say how the job losses would affect the Parkside , a popular hangout for company workers , especially those coming for breakfast after the graveyard shift
Greg Berger said he worked in management for The Hershey Co. for 28 years until retiring in 2008 .
Now he ’s a landscaper for Hershey Nursery .
Berger said the West plant requires far fewer workers because it is so automated compared with the East plant .
Where the company probably needs up to 30 workers to staff a typical production line in the East plant , the same line in the West plant would require four .
“ It makes sense as far as making a profit for the company , ” Berger said .
John Christopher said he was a production worker at the East plant for 25 years until he left in 2004 to start a business , Johnny ’s Down Under barber shop on West Chocolate Avenue .
“ I think that the writing has been on the wall for that plant for some time .
It was just a question of when they would pull the trigger , ” Christopher said .
Mike Pries , chairman of the Derry Township Board of Supervisors , said supervisors are monitoring the situation to determine the economic impact to the township and surrounding communities .
“ It ’s too early to speculate on the impact , if any , on tourism , ” he said .
Are you power , nude , laughing , Christian or contemporary ?
Or perhaps you are pure ashtanga vinyasa ?
If your preferred yoga style is among the former you could find yourself on the wrong side of an effort to define what constitutes the millennia - old physical and mental discipline .
An Indian government body tasked with protecting the country 's rich heritage of medicinal and medical philosophy and practice has started filming hundreds of asanas – yoga poses – in an attempt to make a rigid system out of this most flexible of meditative practices .
The " videographs " are intended to provide irrefutable evidence for anyone hoping to patent a new style of yoga that the Indians got there first .
A previous effort to define yoga , based simply on translations of ancient texts circulated to the relevant authorities , had mixed results , so now they are trying again .
" It 's like soccer and Britain , " said Suneel Singh , one of India 's leading yoga gurus .
" You have given it to the world which is wonderful and generous .
But imagine that people started saying they had invented the sport .
That would be annoying . "
Dr Vinod Kumar Gupta , who heads the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library , a Delhi - based government organisation set up jointly by the ministries of health and science , told the Guardian : " Simple text is n't adequate .
People are claiming they are doing something different from the original yoga when they are not . "
" Yoga originated in India .
People cannot claim to invent a new yoga when they have not . "
The campaign to safeguard India 's rich heritage of medicinal art , craft and practice has already scored major victories , forcing European companies to reverse patents on the use of extract of melon , ginger , cumin , turmeric and onions for a range of health products .
In each case Indian government officials were able to comb the new digital library to submit carefully translated excerpts from texts ranging from 19th century medical text books to 5th century manuals of traditional ayurvedic medicine to support their claims .
But stopping yoga being " misappropriated " is different from defending Indian plants against " bio- prospecting " of natural remedies by companies abroad .
There are tens – if not hundreds – of millions of practitioners and hundreds of different schools ranging from naked yoga through to Christian yoga , developed in faith schools and churches in America .
" There is no intention to stop people practising yoga but nobody should misappropriate yoga and start charging franchise money , " said Gupta , who , like many Delhi residents , practises the ancient art in a park near his home .
" As for hot yoga , power yoga , or whatever I have no views to comment .
Our job is to provide the evidence and let others decide . "
The campaign to preserve yoga as Indian has its roots in a bid several years ago by Bikram Choudhury , the self - proclaimed Hollywood " yoga teacher to the stars " , to get his Bikram yoga style patented in the US .
" They are creating brands , " said Guru Singh , who has himself invented what he calls " Urban Yoga " .
" Anyway , clapping , laughter , all these kinds , they all existed before .
They just now get a new name in English . "
Even within India , yogi and yogini ( the feminine variant ) are divided .
Conservatives say only yoga as described in texts such as hatha yoga pradipika , the manual compiled by a 15th century sage , is true to tradition .
But a new generation wants something else .
Guru Mohan , 31 , runs courses for young Indian professionals working in technology companies in the vast satellite town of Noida outside Delhi .
" The lifestyle was different 2,000 years ago .
There were different needs .
" Then , they practised yoga in jungles and rivers .
According to the texts you use cow dung to clean the place where you will practice .
That 's clearly not appropriate any more , not even in India , " Mohan , who uses one name professionally , said .
According to Mohan , who has pioneered what he calls " Call Centre Yoga " with special asanas for those spending hours on end answering phones , some things , however , are eternal .
" Yoga is there for all humanity .
It is for serving people , " the guru said .
" It is traditional wisdom and its reach should never be limited " .
John Philpott , chief economist at the CIPD , said : “ Against the backdrop of massive public sector job downsizing it does n’t require anything like a double - dip recession to cause a serious prolonged jobs deficit . ”
He added : “ A slightly milder growth outcome – which many would consider a decent recovery in output given the various strong headwinds at present facing the economy – is easily as imaginable as the OBR ’s central forecast . ”
BMW is excited about numbers .
Specifically , execs are thrilled about the millionth X5 SUV that today rolled off a production line in South Carolina : a sapphire - black xDrive 35 i with a brown leather interior .
Bets are that South Carolinians care about another number -- 5,000 .
That 's the number of workers employed at BMW 's 1,150 - acre campus .
Or , maybe they 're excited about $ 4.6 billion .
That 's how much BMW has paid its workers since it opened the Spartanburg , S.C. , plant 15 years ago .
They are the kind of numbers that no politician can resist :
" This is a day of great pride for all South Carolinians and the BMW family , " said Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , who was not at the event .
" It is a testament to the quality of the S.C. workforce , the supply chain , and to BMW , one of the greatest automobile manufacturers in the world . "
BMW 's plant has become an integral part of the South Carolinian economy , accounting for over 1 % of the state 's total GDP , according to a University of South Carolina study .
When accounting for suppliers , the factory adds 23,000 jobs to South Carolina 's economy and generates over $ 1 billion in wages annually .
The Spartanburg factory opened in 1994 and has produced over 1.6 million vehicles , including the X5 , X6 and the Z3 Roadster .
Recently another $ 750 million was invested to upgrade the factory and get it ready to produce the next - generation BMW X3 .
The X5 got high crash test marks from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
USA TODAY 's James R. Healey , however , was n't crazy about the diesel version .
That millionth X5 ?
Wo n't be around for long .
BMW plans to export it , just as it exports about 60 % of the vehicles it makes in Spartanburg .

Ump Screws Up Call – Ruins Perfect Game for Galarraga ( video )
I do n’t generally follow sports but from time to time something happens that deserves attention and the blown call by an umpire officiating at first base is no exception .
Here is the story from ABC :
With only one out to go , a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers was on the verge of one of baseball ‘s loftiest and rarest accomplishments — a pefect game — until one blown call cost him a place in the record books .
The Tigers ’ Armando Galarraga had not allowed a single hitter to reach base through eight and two - thirds innings when Jason Donald of the Cleveland Indians hit a ground ball towards first .
Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera cleanly fielded the ball and tossed it to Galarraga , who was covering first , seemingly in time to get Donald out .
In a call that ’s sure to go down in infamy for Tigers fans for generations to come , umpire Jim Joyce spread his arms wide , pronouncing Donald safe .
The call was immediately disputed by Tigers manager Jim Leyland and several other players and instant replays showed that Donald was clearly out .
The nearly 18,000 fans at Detroit ’s Comerica Field , many clearly irate , launched into rancous booing .
Here ’s the video .

Border Patrol union defends shooting that killed Mexican teen
By Ed O'Keefe
( Video courtesy of Univision .
Warning :
The video contains graphic images and language . )
The union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents is defending the actions of a colleague who shot and killed a Mexican teenager on Monday -- the second killing of a Mexican by U.S. agents in two weeks .
The National Border Patrol Council said the still - unidentified agent acted appropriately after Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereka , 15 , started throwing rocks in his direction .
" Since biblical times , rocks have been used as a crude but effective weapon to injure and kill humans , " the union said .
" On June 8 , 2010 , when Border Patrol Agents were assaulted at the U.S. / Mexico border by several individuals armed with rocks , they were forced to defend themselves and their fellow agents .
Border Patrol Agents are not trained , nor paid to withstand violent assaults without the ability to defend themselves .
Rocks are weapons and constitute deadly force . "
The union also stated , " While the loss of this teenager ’s life is regrettable , it is due solely to his decision to pick up a rock and assault a United States Border Patrol Agent .
We stand behind the actions of the agents who did their duty in El Paso , and are confident that the investigation into his incident will justify their actions . "
Hernandez Huereka was buried Thursday in Ciudad Juarez .
Speaking Thursday at the announcement of a crackdown on Mexican drug cartels , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Thursday called the shooting " extremely regrettable . "
Mexican officials condemned the shooting and phoned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to issue a formal protest .
Some officials want the agent extradited south of the border to face charges .
Reaction to the shooting intensified Thursday night when Univision aired exclusive cell phone video of the shooting ( see above ) .

Marouane Chamakh could essentially pose Arsene Wenger a selection problem this season if Arsenal stick to their current tactical set up , but ultimately he provides excellent cover for a team which has been stretched far too often over the previous few years .
In 2009 – 10 Arsenal played with what was widely regarded as a 4 - 3 - 3 , but in effect was a fluid 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation .
This consisted of two central midfielders holding the centre of the park , whilst Fabregas played between the lines .
Two wide players , usually Arshavin and Nasri , looked to cut in from the flanks , whilst a single striker played as a ‘ false nine ’ , dropping deep .
Chamakh At Bordeaux
Chamakh actually has the attributes to play in 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , as he played the stiker ’s role in this formation at Bordeaux .
The team played two slightly deeper central midfielders , with attacking support from three forward midfielders .
Their line - up against Bayern Munich in last season ’s Champions League is a good example of Bordeaux ’s system in action .
Jussie looked to cut in , whilst the two fullbacks went on the overlap , especially Chalme , rather like the system emplyed by Clichy and Sagna at Arsenal .
Gourcuff played a more similar role to Mesut Ozil for Germany than Fabregas at Arsenal though .
Chamakh ’s role for Bordeaux is clearly displayed in the heat map analysis from the Bayern Munich game .
Chamakh dropped deep and wide , in the style that Wenger has utilised strikers for Arsenal since Henry .
Van Persie and Bendtner play in a similar style , evidence that Wenger has signed a player who will fit into the current system .
However , this may create selection problems for Arsene Wenger as Robin Van Persie has been first choice for that role for both Arsenal and World Cup finalists Holland .
Playing a single striker would mean a choice between the two .
Selection Issues ?
Of course Van Persie has struggled with long term injuries almost every season he has been at Arsenal .
In effect the signing of Chamakh would just allow another top quality option to lead the line , as Bendtner is still developing , and Eduardo demonstrated last season that playing the lone striker is not his best role .
This would solve the dilemma and allow Wenger to rotate the team , and this may well happen .
The team has been in desperate need of extra depth , and Chamakh is an experienced player with his best years ahead of him , and his heading ability adds another dimension to Arsenal ’s play .
However , if Arsene Wenger wanted to play both Chamakh and Van Persie Arsenal might see a slight change of system .
It has been suggested that the team could play a 4 - 4 - 2 , but Arsenal have already switched away from the 4 - 4 - 2 , and the development of formations suggests that the 4 - 4 - 2 can no longer always be effective .
The 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 allows players to play between the lines , and as demonstrated at the World Cup in South Africa the more fluid sides dominated , with both finalists , Spain and Holland lining up with four zone formations .
In this formation Chamakh could partner Van Persie who would drop deep in the hole .
The problem here is congestion in the centre of the field , as both Arsenal wingers look to cut inside , and Fabregas plays best pushing forward .
Having Chamakh playing up front in addition means the team could lack balance .
In another case Chamakh or Van Persie could play on the left or right respectively , but considering the depth of support for those positions , and the qualities of the two strikers it seems that they will be used up front .
Conclusion
The last few seasons have shown that in reality Arsenal have almost never had a full strength squad , and so many players have had to provide cover in different positions .
This epidemic of injuries means that for me Chamakh will slot in as the lone striker to cover Robin Van Persie .
Not only this but even without injury , the large amount of games that the team plays means that the strikers could play 30 games apiece playing as single strikers in a squad rotation system .
When looked at through the lens of the recent past , there should n’t be a selection dilemma , due to the fact that injuries have been so prevalent .
If anything Wenger is simply strengthening the side and adding a quality option up front .
This should see Arsenal retain their fluid 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system in the coming season , interchanging Van Persie , Chamakh and Bendtner .

Looks like the Japanese government is headed for a frustrating , and potentially ineffectual , phase after Sunday ’s election left the nation ’s parliament in a “ twisted ” condition .
That ’s an actual term , not a value judgment .

AP via Google News :
The Democratic Party - led coalition enjoys a comfortable majority in the powerful lower house , but it lost control of the upper house in an election this week .
If past experience holds , the twisted parliament is a formula for policy gridlock , because both houses must approve legislation .
The predicament , which has plagued earlier governments too , comes at a time when Japan badly needs action .
The world ’s second - largest economy faces serious challenges , from reducing its bulging budget deficit and reviving growth to fighting deflation and shoring up its social security system as the population ages and shrinks .

I know the theme song to the horrid TV show Step by Step .
By heart , even .
Step by Step aired for six years on ABC ’s “ TGIF ” lineup , and then for a seventh on CBS , totalling 160 episodes .
At thirty minutes per episode ( including commercials — this was pre-DVR ) , a person who watched the entire run wasted over three whole days of his or her life .
It is still being aired in syndication on ABC Family : once a day on weekdays and twice - daily on weekends .
The show featured six children and later , a seventh and one cousin .
It was not significant enough , however , to vault any of those eight actors and actresses beyond the show itself .
A quick perusal of Wikipedia confirms this ; in fact , one of the actors is so insignificant that he did not even have an entry in Wikipedia until 2009 .
That ’s not terribly surprising .
Step by Step was not something you commiserated over the next week at school .
No cultural icons came out of the show ; there was no Balki Bartokomous or Tony Micelli or Mike Seaver .
Even in retrospect , the only things I can remember about the show is how across the board stupid the characters were ( except for the nerdy kid , who was hardly praised for being smart ) and , of course , the theme song .
Heck , it was only marginally funny .
Yet , I watched it often enough to be able to sing a significant part of the theme song by heart , over a decade after it ceased production .
And apparently , I am not alone .
We ’re enamored by the lure of Twitter , Facebook , blogs , and social media generally .
But do n’t underestimate the power of television .
Tesla ( Nasdaq : TSLA ) , or TSLA as it will trade under on Nasdaq , has been priced at $ 17 per share , allowing the electric car start - up to raise more than $ 226 million in its IPO .
Investors were expecting the share price target range to be between $ 14 and $ 16 but the overflow of excitement saw Tesla increase the number of shares it plans to offer to 13.3 million , nearly 20 percent more than originally planned .
Most of that excitement is riding on news of the upcoming Model S electric sedan , which is expected to go on sale in 2012 priced at around $ 50,000 .
News also broke recently that the company is planning several other models all based on the Model S , including a crossover , convertible and commercial van .
Tesla is desperate need of new models if it ever hopes to earn a return for its investors .
Last year the company lost $ 55.7 million , which brings its total lost since inception seven years ago to $ 260.7 million .
The new round of funding raised in the IPO , as well as the $ 465 million in DOE loans and $ 50 million stake sold to Toyota , should help Tesla considerably with its future model plans .
The company will be offering up its shares to the public for the first time on June 29 .

Image caption Google has apologised for collecting the personal data
The Australian police have been ordered to investigate Google for possible breach of privacy while taking pictures for its Street View service .
Australia 's attorney general said he had asked police to probe the internet giant following complaints that Google had gathered personal data from some unencrypted wi-fi services .
Google has admitted doing so , but apologised , saying it was in error .
The company has recently criticised the government 's plan for internet filters .
Vendetta ?
Attorney General Robert McClelland said there had been numerous complaints from the public and that police should investigate possible criminal breaches of the telecommunications privacy laws .
Australian law prohibits people from accessing electronic communications for unauthorised purposes .
Google has said it will co-operate with a police investigation .
The possible offences occurred while Google vehicles , mounted with 360 - degree cameras , gathered pictures for Street View , collecting private wireless data at the same time .
Google , the government said , had committed " probably the single biggest breach in the history of privacy " .
The company says it mistakenly collected the data and has since apologised , and has implied that the Australian government is pursuing a corporate vendetta , says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney .
The internet giant has been a strong critic of the Australian government 's plans for an internet filter blocking illegal material , saying it would slow down user speeds and filter legitimate content .
Just a day after Google and Twitter called the legal concept of " hot news " obsolete , the major news heavyweights have collectively thrown their hat into the ring in support of the nebulous restriction .
The Associated Press , New York Times , Time , Washington Post , Agence France - Presse , Advance Publications , and others submitted their own amicus brief in the ongoing legal case between theflyonthewall.com and Barclays Capital .
They are n't taking a side in the dispute , but they do want the ability to tell others not to re-report " their " facts .
According to the brief , the news orgs believe the hot news doctrine provides " limited but vital protection " for those who put elbow grease into publishing the news .
They argue that they 're the ones spending time and money doing the research on a piece of news , and that they should get full control over who can republish the facts while the news is still considered timely .
( Facts generally are not protected by copyright . )
" Unless generalized free - riding on news originators ’ efforts is restrained , originators will be unable to recover their costs of newsgathering and publication , the incentive to engage in the news business will be threatened , and the public will ultimately have fewer sources of original news , " reads the brief .
It 's not easy being the one who puts in all the work so that everyone else can grab the details for free .
And , of course , there are many stories that would never get the full attention they deserve without major news outlets putting in that effort .
That 's the crux of the news orgs ' brief — they want to stay in business so that they can keep reporting the news to the public , and they believe the " hot news " doctrine will help them in that effort .
Note that this is not the same as protecting their work from being plagiarized — current copyright law already protects their specific words .
Rather , if one of them breaks news about pigs suddenly learning to fly , they do n't want a competitor to see the story in an RSS feed , read the post , and immediately rewrite the facts in new language .
Doing this occasionally is one thing , but " hot news " was developed by courts during World War I when this kind of rewriting became a staple practice for some new competitors .
It 's even worse when it happens with no attribution .
When everyone 's a publisher , is " hot news " practical ?
Could hot news protection extend to tweets , Facebook posts , blog posts , and more ?
The news orgs are n't likely to go after people for a tweet that contains few facts , but the door could be open for that kind of " enforcement . "
As Google and Twitter noted in their own brief , how would a court choose a time period during which the facts about the latest Times Square bombing could n't be reported by others ?
Further , how would the court fairly enforce such a restriction across the entire Internet ?
It could target one site at a time — like The Fly — but that hardly stops other news sites , blogs , and social media from repeating the facts at lightning speed across the Internet .
It 's not just Google and Twitter who think the concept is impractical in today 's Internet world : the Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that the hot news doctrine tramples core principles from the First Amendment , and Duke professor and public domain booster James Boyle has spoken out publicly several times against turning it into federal law .
But some news organizations , even new - media savvy ones like the New York Times , still believe that their business needs hot news protection , and they 're willing to fight for the idea in court .

The city of Albany will once again host the Devils AHL affiliate .
The Devils will officially move their AHL affiliate to Albany , beginning in the 2010 - 2011 season .
The team will be named the Albany Devils and will play their home games at the Times Union Center .
The move has been expected since the team submitted a letter of intent to lease the Times Union Center for five years in late April .
On May 10 , the Albany County Legislature voted to approve a $ 1.6 million bond to improve the arena as part of the movement plan .
Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello shared his excitement over the move with Tom Gulliti of the Bergen Record .
“ We are all looking forward to bringing our AHL team back to the Capital District area , ” Lamoriello said .
“ The support we previously received from the fans in Albany was tremendous . ”
Albany hosted the Devils AHL affiliate for 13 years before the team moved to Lowell in 2006 - 2007 .
The team won the Calder Cup as the Albany River Rats in 1995 .
The team ’s lease with the Times Union Center is for five years .

We Speak Whatever Language We Dadgum Well Please Here
During the Alabama Republican primaries , gubernatorial candidate Tim James announced in one of his ads : “ This is Alabama .
We speak English .
If you want to live here , learn it . ”
If that were just the sentiment of one knuckle - dragging idjit who washed out of a Republican primary , it would n’t be worth commenting on .
But James ran the ad precisely because the view he expressed was popular among such a wide range of troglodytes in the general public .
I can’t imagine anything that ’s less anybody ’s business than what language someone else speaks , or whether or not they “ assimilate . ”
Imagine someone saying “ This is Alabama .
We go to the Baptist church here . ”
Or wear a certain kind of clothing , or eat a certain kind of food , or whatever .
I do n’t feel obligated to learn Spanish to accommodate immigrants who have n’t learned English , and would resent being expected to do so .
But if they can find enough Spanish speakers here to get by , and enough bilingual businesses to employ them and trade with , it ’s entirely their business .
And it ’s certainly none of my business what language people use to talk to each other .
The idea that there should be some single “ official ” language in each country is one of the more pernicious things associated with the rise of the modern nation - state .
It has led to ethnic cleansings , genocides , and enormous population transfers ( like , for example , the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey after WWI ) .
It has led , internally , to the sort of linguistic homogenization by which the “ standard ” versions of national languages spoken in the capitals supplant regional dialects .
There ’s still something recognizable as a Downeast or Appalachian accent in the U.S. , but it ’s a lot more watered down than it used to be after fifty years of universal exposure to American Network Standard .
I also wonder just when “ we ” were supposed to have started speaking only English here .
The United States has always had populations of “ unassimilated ” non-English speakers , as long as it ’s been a country : Dutch in the Hudson River valley , Germans in Pennsylvania , French in the St. John ’s River valley of Maine , Acadians in Lousiana , etc .
So people speaking Spanish ( especially in parts of the U.S. that were once part of Mexico ) is as American as apple pie .
Oddly enough , the people most agitated about English as the “ official language ” are many of the same folks who claim to be terrified that the government is taking over everything .
It ’s hard to think of anything more personal the government could take over than what language a person chooses to speak .
In a free country , people speak whatever language they choose , to anyone who is willing to talk to us , and we all mind our own dadblamed business .
That realization alone would n’t abolish all government , but it would be a good start towards developing the clear thinking that liberatory futures require .
NEAR TULUL AL - BAQ , Iraq  President Obama has set an August deadline for the end of the combat mission in Iraq .
Here at this makeshift desert camp in the insurgent badlands of northern Iraq , a mission is under way that is not going to stop then : American soldiers hunting terrorists and covertly watching an Iraqi checkpoint staffed by police officers whom the soldiers say they do not trust .
“ They ’re not checking anybody , and they ’re wondering why I.E.D. ’s are getting in to town , ” said Staff Sgt. Kelly E. Young , 39 , from Albertville , Ala. , as he watched the major roadway that connects Baghdad with Mosul , regarded as the country ’s most dangerous city .
He referred to improvised explosive devices , the military term for homemade bombs .
The August deadline might be seen back home as a milestone in the fulfillment of President Obama ’s promise to end the war in Iraq , but here it is more complex .
American soldiers still find and kill enemy fighters , on their own and in partnership with Iraqi security forces , and will continue to do so after the official end of combat operations .
More Americans are certain to die , if significantly fewer than in the height of fighting here .
The withdrawal , which will reduce the number of American troops to 50,000  from 112,000 earlier this year and close to 165,000 at the height of the surge  is a feat of logistics that has been called the biggest movement of matériel since World War II .
It is also an exercise in semantics .
US President Barack Obama signed the most sweeping financial reforms since the 1930s into law Wednesday , promising everyday Americans would no longer have to pay for Wall Street ’s mistakes .
“ These reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history , ” Obama said , before signing the new law , passed by Congress last week .

“ These protections will be enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job : looking out for people — not big banks , not lenders , not investment houses — in the financial system . ”
Whether or not you 're enthralled by the World Cup , this Roberto Carlos score — dubbed " the Impossible Goal " — is a wonder from the perspective of physics .

I grew up an American football fan , so my love of sport comes attached to things I can easily understand : speed , power , strategy , and absorption of pain .
But as age comes upon me , I 've begun to reassess sports that I brushed aside .
The skill it takes to return a 90 - mph tennis forehand , one with upwards of 2000 rpm of topspin , while sprinting across clay , and place that three - inch ball on a three - inch line 40 feet away .
The steel nerve it takes to hurl one 's self down a mountain with an incline of 50 degrees , filled with blind rises and covered with ice , with no brakes and little but the sharp edges on two strips of metal to guide your way .
And , yes , the preternatural ability to squeeze a soccer ball into a goal with a window of opportunity less than one degree wide .
Play on , footballers .
Play on .

NEW ORLEANS — The new head of the agency that regulates offshore drilling said he plans to hold a series of public hearings over the next 60 days on what additional safety measures are needed before deepwater oil and gas exploration should be allowed to resume .
Michael Bromwich , director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , said his agency will hold a dozen public hearings in Gulf Coast states , as well as in California and Alaska .

" Everything about Debrahlee Lorenzana is hot .
Even her name sizzles , " writes the Voice in a profile of the hot banker fired for being " too distracting for her male colleagues to bear . "
Her lawyer even has photographic evidence of said hotness .
Lorenzana is about to enter arbitration with Citibank , which she accuses of wrongful termination .
Writes The Village Voice ,
Her bosses told her they could n't concentrate on their work because her appearance was too distracting .
They ordered her to stop wearing turtlenecks .
She was also forbidden to wear pencil skirts , three - inch heels , or fitted business suits .
Lorenzana , a 33 - year - old single mom , pointed out female colleagues whose clothing was far more revealing than hers : " They said their body shapes were different from mine , and I drew too much attention , " she says .
As Lorenzana 's lawsuit puts it , her bosses told her that " as a result of the shape of her figure , such clothes were purportedly ' too distracting ' for her male colleagues and supervisors to bear . "
For legal purposes , her " sex positive " women 's rights lawyer Jack Tuckner had to get Lorenzana to pose in sexy - but - work - appropriate outfits , doing sexy - but - work - appropriate things like reading the newspaper and bending over to look at a piece of paper .
( Is it wrong to find men who self - define as " sex positive " gross ?
It 's like the guy who offers , " I wo n't respect you any less for putting out right away . "
Um , thanks ? )
For journalistic purposes , the Voice had to include a gallery of photos of Lorenzana airbrushed to an inch of her life , in skimpy outfits and with her chest heaving .

The Voice also had to include lots of sexy sentences , best read through fogged - up eyeglasses :
At five - foot - six and 125 pounds , with soft eyes and flawless bronze skin , she is J.Lo curves meets Jessica Simpson rack meets Audrey Hepburn elegance — a head - turning beauty .
The dress was form - fitting and tight in the bust :
She says one size up would have been too big for her .
" Men are kind of drawn to her , " says Tanisha Ritter , a friend and former colleague who also works as a banker and praises Lorenzana 's work habits .
" I 've seen men turn into complete idiots around her . "
She has five closets full of Burberry , Hermès , Louis Vuitton , and Roberto Cavalli .
As we speak , Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch are in a pitched battle over who gets to employ this woman next .

The education department faces more cuts
The education budget in England faces another £ 1bn reduction , following an announcement from the Treasury .
The Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , responsible for universities , will lose £ 265 m .
Chief Secretary to the Treasury , Danny Alexander , said the cuts followed " unfunded promises " .
The announcement was made as the coalition government also cancelled much of the school re-building programme .
The reductions in education spending are part of a total cuts across government of £ 1.54bn , announced by the Treasury .
' Cancelling plans '
They will affect spending plans which had depended upon funding from an underspend at the end of the financial year - the " end year flexibility " .
Not all of the £ 1bn to be cut from education will have been allocated - some of it is in reserve and the education department says savings can be achieved through " better financial management and tighter controls " .
But £ 169.5 m of the funding has already been ear - marked for projects which will now be cancelled .
This includes £ 50 m from a technology improvement fund , £ 50 m for diploma provision , £ 24 m for co-location projects for schools and £ 15 m for school swimming pools .
The Sure Start scheme for families of young children will also face unspecified amounts of savings for capital spending .
" The previous government committed to spending money it simply did not have , but this coalition government has taken action to address this serious situation , " said Mr Alexander .
" The decisions have not been easy , but the understanding and cooperation of my Cabinet colleagues has enabled us to act swiftly to ensure that the nation can live within its means . "
The Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls has rejected any suggestion that any of his spending plans , under the Labour government , had not been correctly funded .
The end - year flexibility is a mechanism whereby departments may carry forward unspent budget provision into later financial years

If you want to be more environmentally friendly and really make a difference in your part of the world you can simply change one habit and see long lasting results .
You can make a difference to the planet , and to your local economy by selecting where you eat and what you eat .
This applies to eating out and dining in your own home .
Eating Out
On the back of the menu at the restaurant it said “ Good to Know , $ 100 spent in a locally owned business generates about $ 48 worth of local economic activity .
$ 100 spent in a global retailer equates to only $ 13 for the local economy . ” .
A restaurant in your local area is not necessarily a “ Locally ” owned restaurant .
Chains are run by companies that are out of town and often even out of the country .
Only pennies from your meal stay in the local economy in the form of wages , the rest goes to the head offices .
The particular restaurant I was in , is not only locally owned , but they look for local suppliers for the food they serve .
This is different than most restaurants where food comes from wholesalers and mass distributors .
Chains , and indeed many restaurants that are not chains , do not buy locally , this is an “ inconvenience ” for them .
Many chains even run their own supply companies , meaning nothing is local , and produce may even come from over seas .
McDonalds was once well known for using “ rain forest beef ” .
They were linked to deforestation of our rain forest for cattle production .
Other companies still buy beef raised in such locations .
Some buy from factory farms , and even when local , the farms are owned by corporations that can be overseas , again sending profits elsewhere .
These restaurants may get their vegetables and fruits from far , far , away .
Dining in your Own Home
The best source for local produce is your own yard .
If you can grow it yourself , then you should eat it .
If you have excess , share with your neighbor and perhaps they will share what they have with you .
This saves money and the environment .
Some urban areas are allowing people to keep hens for the purpose of egg production .
Locally owned “ You Pick ” farms are great ways to get fresh produce .
Farmers markets are great places where a person can pick up a lot of locally raised , or grown , produce .
You may find everything from meat , to fruits and vegetables .
When things are purchased in stores , they can come from anywhere , look for labels and be sure to shop at locally owned and independently run stores .
Chains send profits out of your area and buy from sources that are not local .
These stores might be locally run , but they are NOT locally owned .

Benefits of Eating Locally
Not only is more money kept in your local economy , but as less shipping is involved in getting the food to you , it is considered a “ greener ” option .
Your food is likely fresher when it comes from a local source because the time it took to get to you was not increased by shipping .
You might get a nice turn around effect , in that when you shop locally , and get to know local people , they may return to support your business , or where you work .

It is an unusual romance , to say the least .
He is made of flesh , blood and shell while she is constructed entirely out of plastic .
But after years of heartache , Timmy the tortoise seems to have found some sort of comfort by teaming up with Tanya the plastic toy tortoise .
Timmy , a Hermann 's tortoise ( Testudo hermanni ) , appears to dote on Tanya night and day since the pair were brought together by keepers at the sanctuary where he lives after he was " bullied " by other real tortoises .
The sprightly 60 - year - old fetches her food ( and does not seem to mind that she does not eat it ) and nuzzles his head against hers .
He will not go to bed unless she is put into his hut before him .
Timmy arrived at the Tortoise Garden sanctuary in St Austell , Cornwall , three years ago when his owners emigrated to New Zealand .
Staff tried to introduce him to other tortoises but he did not get on with them .
The sanctuary 's owner , Joy Bloor , said : " I tried introducing him to other tortoises but they do n't seem to like him and bully and fight with him .
I put the plastic toy in his pen with him and now they are inseparable .
" He nuzzles and kisses her , moves her around and pushes lettuce towards her .
He plays with her every day .
If I want him to go into his hut at night time I have to put Tanya in there first , otherwise he wo n't go . "
The lack of response does not seem to bother Timmy .
" Tanya 's only a third of the size of him but he does n't seem to mind , " Bloor said .
" He 's much happier when it 's just the two of them . "
Over the years the sanctuary has looked after thousands of unwanted , abandoned , injured and illegally imported tortoises .
Set up by Bloor and husband , Geoff , 20 years ago , it currently cares for 450 tortoises from 15 species in 60 pens .
( CNN ) -- Harry and Barbara Cooper are telling everyone how their marriage has lasted seven decades .
On the day of their 72nd wedding anniversary , they leaned toward each other , hands tenderly clasped , as they peered into the camera .
' It 's a give - and - take situation , " said Harry , as Barbara , giggled .
" I give , and she takes . "
This is an unconventional showcase for any elderly couple in their retirement home , but a typical day for two of the oldest bloggers in Los Angeles , California .
Harry recently turned 98 .
Barbara is 93 .
The Coopers rely on their granddaughters to videotape their chat , which is later posted on their blog , " The OGs " ( short for Original Grandparents ) .
Harry and Barbara have become an internet sensation , attracting thousands of fans since their blog debuted in late 2008 .
Their grandchildren helped them launch the OG blog as a way for them to share their wisdom , humor and relationship with the rest of the world .
When most people their age shy away from the mysteries of the Internet , the pair boasts 1,900 Facebook fans .
Barbara , whose dark hair has turned to a wispy white , also tweets and posts restaurant reviews on Yelp .
But perhaps what 's most fascinating for readers is n't the couple 's ease with the Web , but it 's the strength of their marriage .
At a time when statistics show every other marriage ending in divorce in the U.S. , Harry and Barbara have proved a relationship can last a very long time .
They have witnessed important moments in history together -- World War II , President Kennedy 's assassination and the terror attack on New York 's Twin Towers .
They 've been inseparable since they first met on a tennis court in Los Angeles in 1937 .
Harry , then 24 , was playing a game while Barbara , then 19 , showed up with friends in her high heels .
She caught his attention .
" Barbara was a pretty girl , " he recalls .
" She was very , very polite , and we got along pretty good . "
On their first date , Harry took her for a drive in his car , and they did what most young love birds did back then :
They munched on popcorn and listened to crooner Bing Crosby .
Harry proposed swiftly , about four months after their first date .
He had asked Barbara 's father for permission to pop the question .
Harry sold himself as a hard - working man with $ 116 proudly saved in his bank account .
The couple were outside a jewelry shop in Pasadena , California , window - shopping when Harry turned to Barbara and said , " Someday , I 'm going to buy you a ring like this . "
He gave her gold wedding band with small diamonds .
She kept the ring on her finger until her elbow surgery a few years ago .
Over the years , he proved himself to be a fine husband , Barbara said .
In addition to serving in the Army , Harry was a delivery man and started a shoe business .
At one point , he worked a dangerous position as a boilermaker 's helper .
Barbara spent most her time at home , raising their two children .
" It was happy , " said Barbara about the early years of their marriage .
" It was building one dollar on top of another . "
By the 1960s , their children , who had been the center of their worlds , had grown into young adults ready to start families of their own .
Their initial years as empty - nesters were challenging , but the couple found comfort in each other .
Barbara describes Harry as a sweet , content and happy man .
Harry holds similar feelings .
He calls Barbara his " guiding light . "
Harry and Barbara celebrated their 25th anniversary with a trip to Europe .
Then the first grandchild came .
Today , they have seven of them .
The couple can't remember what they did for their 50th anniversary , but for Harry 's 80th birthday , they recalled , the family went on a three - day cruise to Mexico .
" We are just content individuals , " Barbara said , adding , " We landed on our feet .
We have a fine family . "
But the couple experienced several emotional setbacks in 2007 when both their children , who were in their mid-60s , died .
One died from a heart attack and one from cancer .
The couple battled anguish and sadness after their children 's deaths .
Granddaughters Kim Cooper , now 43 , and Chinta Cooper , now 21 , who live in the Los Angeles area , encouraged their grandparents to move to a nursing home nearby .
There , the blog was born .
" They are so adorable together , " Kim says .
" Their incredible romance shines through in everything they do .
They are funny , inventive , unusual characters . "
In the video segments on the OGs , viewers can easily spot the enduring bond between Harry and Barbara .
They lean in on each other and stare at each other when they talk .
They laugh and smile together .
They make being married , even at their old age , look effortless .
Barbara is better known as " Cutie " on their blog , where she wears several hats .
As a food critic , she recently wrote a review of French pastries at a local restaurant .
She danced in a video where she showcased her moves , waving her arms and sashaying her hips .
In another post , she offered her opinion of Lady Gaga 's music video " Alejandro . "
" I think it 's nothing new , it 's nothing charming , " Barbara wrote in the music - related post last month .
" It 's got no message .
I 'm sorry , I did not enjoy this . "
Readers can also seek Barbara 's advice on the " Ask Grandma " video series .
Even with her meek voice , she delivers no - nonsense answers on friends , family and relationships .
Harry appears online as " PopPop , " a nickname given to him by his granddaughter Kim when she was a child .
He 's the quieter sidekick in the duo , but he has his own section of the blog called " PopPop 's Adventure Corner , " where he tells jokes and sings songs he learned in the Army .
When Harry is n't blogging , he enjoys eating raw fish , spicy foods and Chinese dumplings .
He broke his leg last year and now has titanium in his thigh .
He uses a walker now , his family says , and requires more care than Barbara .
Barbara spends her days watching daytime judge shows and , of course , she visits Harry every morning .
She suffered a heart attack a few years back but has been healthy since then .
So what 's the secret to their marriage ?
" We have a solid marriage , " Barbara says .
" It is n't Romeo and Juliet every day , but Harry thinks I 'm OK , and I love him .
We are accepting of each other . "
And that 's good enough for them .

I 've said it more than once ... I know that bigotry and racism have always been around , but I really miss the days when people ( especially in positions of power ) were loath to be so open about their irrational hatred .
Is it me , or is Arizona proudly embracing the notion of being the xenophobic capital of the country ?
The Arizona Department of Education recently began telling school districts that teachers whose spoken English it deems to be heavily accented or ungrammatical must be removed from classes for students still learning English , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
The crackdown applies to classes deemed to have students who are learning English , mostly as a second language .
Federal No Child Left Behind regulations call for students to be taught by persons fluent in English .
The determination of fluency is left up to individual states .
Arizona seems to think that includes accents .
Of course , they are wrong - accents do not by themselves measure fluency .
And almost every person who is a native speaker of another language is going to have an accent when speaking English , unless they learned English at a young age .
" This is just one more indication of the incredible anti-immigrant sentiment in the state , " said Bruce Merrill , a professor emeritus at Arizona State University who conducts public - opinion research .
Indeed .
Arizona 's action against immigrants did n't begin with the recent passage of the " show me your papers " bill , but it emboldened anti-immigrant sentiment in other states around the country , and apparently in the Arizona educational system too .
Arizona 's education department has sent people into schools to audit teachers on comprehensible pronunciation , correct grammar and good writing .
Teachers who fail are given the chance to improve , but if not , they must be fired or reassigned .
Oy vey .
My in - laws immigrated here from Denmark in the 50s .
They never lost their accents .
My uncle , who immigrated here in the 60s from the Middle East , has never lost his accent ( and how many immigrants who are n't children at the time of do ? ) .
My eldest 's science teacher in middle school is a first generation American , whose family immigrated here from Mexico and for whom Spanish was the primary language spoken at home .
She has a slight accent .
All of these people I 've mentioned were highly intelligent , highly educated people from whom you could learn much .
But not in Arizona .
Makes me wonder if Arizona will ban Kindergarten Cop from the area video stores .
California Rep. Darrell Issa has told GOP leaders he plans to double his staff if he becomes chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .

Issa has eye on subpoena team
HERSHEY , Pa. — Rep. Darrell Issa , the conservative firebrand whose specialty is lobbing corruption allegations at the Obama White House , is making plans to hire dozens of subpoena - wielding investigators if Republicans win the House this fall .
The California Republican ’s daily denunciations draw cheers from partisans and bookings from cable TV producers .
He even bought his own earphone for live shots .
But his bombastic style and attention - seeking investigations draw eye rolls from other quarters .
Now , he ’s making clear he wo n’t be so easy to shrug off if he becomes chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2011 .
Advertisement
Issa has told Republican leadership that if he becomes chairman , he wants to roughly double his staff from 40 to between 70 and 80 .
And he is not subtle about what that means for President Barack Obama .
At a recent speech to Pennsylvania Republicans here , he boasted about what would happen if the GOP wins 39 seats , and he gets the power to subpoena .
“ That will make all the difference in the world , ” he told 400 applauding party members during a dinner at the chocolate - themed Hershey Lodge .
“ I wo n’t use it to have corporate America live in fear that we ’re going to subpoena everything .
I will use it to get the very information that today the White House is either shredding or not producing . ”
In other words , Issa wants to be to the Obama administration what Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind. ) was to the Clinton administration — a subpoena machine in search of White House scandals .
Even if Republicans do n’t take the House , Issa has other ambitions .
Those close to him say he is eyeing a potential run for a leadership post , even though he ’s a two - time loser for Republican policy chairman .
Issa also is trying to build his national brand , traveling to Pennsylvania for a summer Republican meeting .
He basked in praise for his role in creating “ Job - gate , ” a mini scandal that forced the White House to admit that former President Bill Clinton tried to coax Rep.
Joe Sestak out of the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania by offering him an unpaid job .
After calling the White House “ corrupt ” and Obama ’s presidency “ failed , ” Issa reiterated his claims that — despite a contrary assessment from most experts — the administration violated federal law with the Sestak imbroglio .
He also mentioned e-mail from White House deputy chief of staff Jim Messina to Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Andrew Romanoff about three possible administration jobs as the administration apparently tried to steer him away from a primary challenge against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet .
Many Democrats — and , truth be told , even a few Republicans in the House — regard Issa as something of a clownish figure , full of bluster and a perfect representative of an age of polarized , cable TV - driven politics .
He once asked a reporter what planet he was on when he questioned one of Issa ’s assertions .
But some Democratic operatives think colleagues are underestimating the threat : A clown with subpoena power is no laughing matter .
Issa would have the ability to barrage the White House and executive agencies with document requests and demands for officials to appear under oath .
“ He ’s very dangerous , ” said a Democratic House aide .
“ He does n’t have any parameters .
He ’s scary smart . ”
Lately , Democratic apparatchiks have started flooding reporters with thick files of old articles referring to run-ins with the law during Issa ’s youth .
Democrats also recently shopped a 12 - year - old news story about Issa ’s inconsistencies in discussing his military service during a 1998 campaign .
Even with control of the House , Republicans wo n’t be able to easily pass their agenda into law , since the GOP is unlikely to win the Senate and would face a presidential veto on their most sweeping agenda items .
That ’s actually good for Issa .
With little policy work to get done , Republicans would focus on fighting and investigating Obama .
Issa is temperamentally suited for the role .
He does n’t mind making enemies , he ’s in a very safe district and he craves publicity .
With his slicked - back black hair , his BMW motorcycle and his net worth of more than $ 150 million , Issa fashions himself a rebel with a cause .
Issa already brought down a governor .
Seven years ago , he financed and spearheaded the successful drive to collect petitions to recall then - California Gov. Gray Davis .
He did n’t achieve his goal going in — to replace the Democrat — but he made a name for himself in the Golden State .
Issa frequently reminds reporters that he has bashed Republicans too .
He pushed legislation to restrict fundraising mailers that look like the census after the Republican National Committee used the tactic .
And he proudly told the crowd that he resisted pressure from the Bush White House to drop his California recall push on grounds that an unpopular incumbent Democrat could help a Republican ’s electoral chances .
And it ’s not like Issa would be unique in using the Oversight panel as a bully pulpit .
Most recently , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) held the Bush administration ’s feet to the fire when he chaired the Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
He aggressively pressed the White House for information about U.S. attorney firings , demanded details about the use by Bush aides of private e-mail accounts , held a hearing on the disclosure of CIA agent Valerie Plame ’s identity and published a report on administration officials ’ misstatements about Iraq .
Waxman takes a somewhat wait - and - see approach with Issa , saying he has n’t followed his work as closely since he left to chair the Energy and Commerce Committee .
He praised Issa for being “ involved in some serious oversight ” with the current committee chairman , Rep. Edolphus Towns ( D - N.Y . ) .
However , Waxman criticized Issa ’s recent request for administration travel statements .
“ That is n’t oversight , as far as I ’m concerned , ” he told POLITICO .
“ That ’s a fishing expedition .
We never did things like that . ”
As the committee ’s chairman from 1997 to 2002 , Burton issued 1,052 subpoenas to the Clinton White House and various Democrats .
And he took heat for calling Clinton “ a scumbag ” and for releasing audiotapes of former White House lawyer Webster Hubbell ’s prison telephone conversations .
Burton , who is still on the committee , sees Issa as possibly continuing his work .
“ When you go after bad guys who do bad things , you ’re going to be criticized , ” he said in an interview .
“ That comes with the territory .
But I ’ll take somebody like Darrell Issa to milquetoast any day . ”
Issa ’s accomplishments in the past year also include pressing embattled insurance giant American International Group to release records about payments to Goldman Sachs , uncovering irregularities at ACORN , publicizing pornographic - laden e-mails at the Securities and Exchange Commission and memorably scolding the chief executive of Toyota .
It ’s tarring Obama , though , that endears him to tea partiers .
Patti Weaver , who has organized rallies in Pittsburgh , said Issa is becoming one of the central characters in Washington that conservative activists admire .
She groups him with Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) , Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) and Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) — all rabble - rousers in their own right .
Yet , for all his cable news prowess and an aggressive press operation , Issa ’s still not a celebrity within the Republican establishment .
Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason introduced their guest speaker for the night as “ Dan Issa . ”
That did n’t bother press secretary Kurt Bardella .
He updated his Facebook status after the speech : “ Something tells me this is just the start of Issa ’s outreach to the party and the country . ”
Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors , thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair .
However , in previous attempts astroglia - derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses , a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis .
It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants .
Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing - resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional , synapse - forming neurons .
Importantly , the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia - derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors : forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin - 2 ( Neurog2 ) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse - forming glutamatergic neurons ; in contrast , the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity , although the overall efficiency of Dlx2 - mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2 , suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant .
Interestingly , however , reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2 .
Importantly , this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex , allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons .
These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor , stably generating fully differentiated neurons .
Moreover , neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury - induced reactivation .
The brain consists of two major cell types : neurons , which transmit information , and glial cells , which support and protect neurons .
Interestingly , evidence suggests that some glial cells , including astroglia , can be directly converted into neurons by specific proteins , a transformation that may aid in the functional repair of damaged brain tissue .
However , in order for the repaired brain areas to function properly , it is important that astroglia be directed into appropriate neuronal subclasses .
In this study , we show that non-neurogenic astroglia from the cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro using just a single transcription factor to yield fully functional excitatory or inhibitory neurons .
We achieved this result through forced expression of the same transcription factors that instruct the genesis of these distinct neuronal subtypes during embryonic forebrain development .
Moreover we demonstrate that reactive astroglia isolated from the adult cortex after local injury can be reprogrammed into synapse - forming excitatory or inhibitory neurons following a similar strategy .
Our findings provide evidence that endogenous glial cells may prove a promising strategy for replacing neurons that have degenerated due to trauma or disease .

Towards this end , we first aimed at a more potent neuronal reprogramming by inducing higher and more persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants in astroglial cells .
This allowed us not only to obtain fully functional neurons that also establish synapses from astroglial cells in vitro but also to demonstrate that distinct neurogenic transcription factors , such as on the one hand Neurog2 and on the other Dlx2 alone or in combination with Mash1 , can indeed instruct the selective generation of different neuronal subtypes , such as glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons , respectively .
Moreover , we found that the reprogramming efficiency of postnatal cortical astroglia towards GABAergic neurons by Dlx2 could be enhanced by first expanding the astroglial cells under neurosphere conditions prior to forced expression of Dlx2 .
Given that following brain injury reactive astroglia from the adult cerebral cortex de-differentiate , resume proliferation , and can give rise to self - renewing neurospheres in vitro [ 16 ] , we finally show that neuronal reprogramming and subtype specification are not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from adult cortical astroglia responding to injury .
However , several major obstacles remained to be overcome to fully exploit the potential of reprogrammed astroglia as an endogenous cellular source for neuronal repair .
Firstly , reprogramming of astroglia towards neurons remained incomplete as the astroglia - derived neurons failed to establish a functional presynaptic output [ 7 ] , an obvious hurdle towards functional repair that requires participation in a neural network .
Secondly , given the lack of functional presynaptic output , we could not determine the neuronal subtype generated by the reprogrammed astroglial cells [ 7 ] .
This raises the conceptual concern of whether neurons derived from astroglial cells in a given brain region may be restricted towards the generation of a respective neuronal subtype .
During development of the forebrain in rodents , stem / progenitor cells in the dorsal telencephalon generate exclusively excitatory glutamatergic neurons , directed by Pax6 and Neurog1/ 2 [ 8 ] – [ 10 ] , while stem / progenitor cells in the ventral telencephalon give rise primarily to inhibitory GABAergic neurons , governed by the fate determinants mammalian achaete - schute homolog 1 ( Mash1 ) [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] and Dlx1/2 [ 13 ] .
Region - specific fate restriction also seems to apply for adult neural stem cells that are intrinsically specified towards the generation of distinct neuronal subtypes [ 14 ] .
This implies that despite their multipotent nature in regard to generating different glial cell types and neurons , the subtype identity of the neurons generated from these stem cells is predetermined ( see also [ 15 ] ) and is not altered following transplantation [ 14 ] .
This raises the important question of whether neuronal reprogramming of astroglia derived from the cerebral cortex , a region derived from the dorsal telencephalon , may be restricted towards the generation of glutamatergic neurons , or whether this region - specific bias could be overcome by forced expression of the appropriate neurogenic fate determinants .
Such an ability to generate both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons from astroglia may be a crucial step towards restoring a damaged or imbalanced neuronal network .
While exerting diverse functions within the brain parenchyma [ 1 ] , astroglia are remarkable in that they also function as neural stem or progenitor cells in specific regions of the postnatal and adult brain [ 2 ] , such as the ventricular subependymal zone [ 3 ] and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
This raises the possibility that even astroglia from non-neurogenic regions such as the cerebral cortex may be reprogrammed towards neurogenesis when provided with the appropriate transcriptional cues .
Indeed , we could previously show that astroglia from the early postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro towards the generation of neurons capable of action potential ( AP ) firing by a single transcription factor , such as Pax6 or its target , the pro-neural transcription factor neurogenin - 2 ( Neurog2 ) [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
These findings may open interesting avenues towards the potential activation of endogenous astroglia for neuronal repair of injured brain tissue .

Genetic Fate Mapping Demonstrates Reprogramming of Postnatal Cortical Astroglia into Glutamatergic Neurons
In order to ascertain the astroglial nature of the cells that gave rise to functional glutamatergic synapses following reprogramming by Neurog2 , we took advantage of a transgenic mouse line in which GFP expression can be induced in astroglia and is maintained in their progeny .
Heterozygous mice in which the expression of a tamoxifen - inducible Cre recombinase is driven by the astroglia specific L - glutamate / L- aspartate transporter promoter ( GLAST :: CreERT2 ) [ 23 ] were crossed to a reporter mouse line ( Z/EG ) [ 24 ] to generate double heterozygous mutants ( GLAST :: CreERT2/Z/EG ) that were used in the present study .
Cre-mediated recombination of the reporter locus was induced via tamoxifen administration from postnatal day 2 ( P2 ) until sacrifice ( P5 – P7 ) .
Astroglia cultures were prepared as described above and , 1 wk later , cells were passaged onto glass coverslips .
The vast majority of GFP reporter - positive cells were immunoreactive for GFAP ( 98.7 % ±0.7 % ) at 1 d after plating , with few cells being positive for the oligodendroglial markers NG2 / O4 ( 1.2%±0.7 % ) and none ( 0.1%±0.1 % ) for the neuronal marker βIII tubulin ( Figure 3A ; n = 3 independent experiments , n = 1,560 GFP - positive cells counted ) .
These data indicate that , under our culture conditions , most reporter - positive cells at the time of transduction possess an astroglial identity .
These cells largely remain within their astroglial lineage ( 86.9 % ±12.7 % of GFP - positive cells expressing GFAP ) when analysed at later stages ( Figure 3A ' ; n = 4 independent experiments , n = 1,363 GFP - positive cells counted ; 9 – 21 d following plating ) .
We noted , however , a slight increase in the number of NG2 / O4 - positive cells ( 13.0 % ±12.8 % ) , likely due to the expansion of few reporter - positive clones of oligodendrocyte precursors .
Also at later stages reporter - positive cells did not give rise to βIII tubulin - positive neurons ( 0.1%±0.1 % ; Figure 3A ' ) .

To determine the identity of fate - mapped astroglial cells following retroviral transduction , we performed immunostaining for GFP ( identifying cells of astroglial origin ) , DsRed ( identifying transduced cells ) , and either βIII tubulin , MAP2 , or GFAP ( identifying neuronal and astroglial cells , respectively ) .
Notably , the stochastic infection of the subset of genetically recombined cells results in a limited number of double - targeted cells .
When cultures of adherent astroglia were transduced with the control retrovirus encoding DsRed only , fate - mapped astroglial cells co-expressing GFP and DsRed remained in the glial lineage , as revealed by their astroglial morphology and GFAP expression 1 mo after transduction ( Figure 3B –3 B ” ) .
In sharp contrast , when cultures of tamoxifen - induced astroglia were transduced with the new retrovirus encoding Neurog2 and DsRed , most GFP / DsRed - double - positive fate - mapped astroglia were reprogrammed into neurons expressing the neuronal markers βIII tubulin and MAP2 ( 67.3 % ±12.7 % among GFP / DsRed - double positive cells at 8.0±1.0 DPI , n = 3 independent experiments , n = 217 double - positive cells counted ; Figure 3C–3 C ” ) .
Single cell tracking of GFP - reporter positive cells following Neurog2 - transduction allowed the direct visualisation of the glia - to - neuron conversion of fate - mapped cells over the time course of 5 d ( Figure 3D and 3D ' ; Video S1 and Video S2 ) .
Perforated patch clamp recordings of these fate - mapped astroglia - derived cells reprogrammed by Neurog2 revealed their functional neuronal identity as these cells fired APs following step - current injection in current clamp ( n = 8 ; Figure 4A – 4C ) .
In the next set of experiments , we assessed whether neurons derived from fate - mapped astroglia could give rise to functional glutamatergic autapses ( Figure 4D – 4I ) .
Step - depolarisation of GFP / DsRed - double - positive neurons at 0.05
Hz evoked a sequence of both autaptic and polysynaptic components ( 2 out of 8 cells recorded ) consistent with the excitatory nature of the recorded neurons ( average age of the cells : 18.1 ±2.2 DPI ; Figure 4D –4I , insets ) , while at higher stimulation frequency ( 1 Hz ) the autaptic component with a short decay time typical of glutamatergic synaptic transmission [ 25 ] could be observed in isolation ( Figure 4 F and 4I ) .
Consistent with their glutamatergic nature , fate - mapped astroglia reprogrammed by forced expression of Neurog2 also exhibited a dense labelling of vGluT1 - positive puncta ( Figure 4J and 4K ) .
These data clearly demonstrate that Neurog2 instructs fate - mapped astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex to acquire a glutamatergic identity .

Looks like only in superficial ways are Go interfaces like single parameter type classes ( constructor classes ) in Haskell .
Methods are associated with an interface type
Objects ( particular types ) may have implementations of that interface
It is unclear to me whether Go in any way supports bounded polymorphism via interfaces , which is the primary purpose of type classes .
That is , in Haskell , the interface methods may be used at different types ,
class I a where put :: a -> IO ( ) get :: IO a instance I Int where ... instance I Double where ....
So my question is whether Go supports type polymorphism .
If not , they 're not really like type classes at all .
And they 're not really comparable .
Haskell 's type classes allow powerful reuse of code via " generics " -- higher kinded polymorphism -- a good reference for cross-language support for such forms of generic program is this paper .
Ad hoc , or bounded polymorphism , via type classes , is well described here .
This is the primary purpose of type classes in Haskell , and one not addressed via
Go interfaces , meaning they 're not really very similar at all .
Interfaces are strictly less powerful - a kind of zeroth - order type class .

Howie Klein and I have been working the phones to try and persuade acts from performing in Arizona since they have contempt for a certain segment of their population .
Kris Kobach , the notorious cage f*&ker , has paved the way to damnation for Brewer 's state .
And no matter what you hear , they are feeling it .
Some of the musicians are locked at this point so they could n't pull out , but others are stepping up to the plate .
Mad props to Los Lobos for their principled stand against SB 1070 .
This just in from Los Lobos ' camp :
The band is canceling its performance at the Talking Stick Resort in Arizona 's Salt River Pima - Maricopa Indian Community on June 10 as a protest against the passing of the state 's controversial new immigration bill , SB1070 .
The band issued the following statement via its management : “ We support the boycott of Arizona .
The new law will inevitably lead to unfair racial profiling and possible abuse of people who just happen to look Latino .
As a result , in good conscience , we could not see ourselves performing in Arizona .
We regret the inconvenience this may have caused the Salt River Pima - Maricopa Indian Community , Casino Arizona , Talking Stick Resort and our fans , but we feel strongly that it is the right thing to do . ”
Cypress
Hill has already canceled their shows too .
And as Howie notes in his May 2nd post :
Meanwhile two industries that could suffer severely from Arizona 's decision to go the police state route are tourism and sports .
Frommers has already warned tourists to think twice before traveling to Arizona because of the self - righteous and violent nature of many of the inhabitants .
Conventions are pulling out of Phoenix , which has invested very heavily in that business .
The Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association said six organizations had already canceled conventions .
And now major league baseball is the next front in a growing war which is asking people who believe in American values to stay away from Arizona Diamondbacks games .
We 're still working on Bud Selig behind the scenes , and I 'll let you know when more actions are coming .
Yes there is the fighter but we dont get a good look at it .
Asgard are a great race , and I would love to add them in , but Im not sure how to incorporate them into the mod .
Im not sure if Im going to do a purely Pegasus Galaxy mod just yet , but thats what it looks like .
The Reason why Im hesitant of adding in the Goa'uld is that there is limited cannon designs ( yes i know each race has limited designs ) but the way the Hataks move and such would be difficult to simulate at the moment .
Ori are a completely different reason ...
We have only seen 1 real ship , this being the Toilet seat , umm I mean the Mothership .
Yes there is the fighter but we dont get a good look at it .
Asgard are a great race , and I would love to add them in , but Im not sure how to incorporate them into the mod .
Hmmm I think thats a problem with a majority of the races in Stargate to be honest .
I mean we have only seen about roughly 4 ship designs for the Wraith ( 5 if you count the transport ship in season 1 that was discontinued ) , 4 for the Asurans , 7 for the Goa'uld , 2 for the Ori , and 3 for the Asgard .
I think regardless some new designs would have to be made if most of those races are going to be used personally .
Oh and if you are interested , on the MGM website there is concept art for the Wraith Scout Ship that you hear about in " Aurora " , its a very cool looking bat winged design .
My suggestion for the Ori side is perhaps using variant designs for the Ha'tak but coloured more white .
The reason I say this is because in season 10 of SG - 1 we are introduced to a Jaffa faction called the Illac Renin who follow the promises the Ori .
So you could split it between smaller vessels crewed by Ori soldiers and converted followers while the higher ships are things like the Ori Mothership which are commanded by the Priors themselves .
So a mixture between the two .
Not sure about combating the effect of a Ha'tak moving through space in Sins though but thats my thoughts on it .
The Asgard I think would have some very powerful designs but all of them would need to be somewhat expensive .
Maybe it 's not so much a surprise that you hate your antivirus software 's notifications sometimes .
But did you know that it hates you right back ?

How ' Power ' Christians Ignore Jesus Editor ’s Note : Many American Christians are inclined to boast about the United States and its uni-polar power – a kind of geopolitical chant of “ we ’re number one ” – even as they put bumper stickers on their cars asking “ what would Jesus do ? ”
The contradiction between this muscular power projection of many Christians and the humble teachings of Jesus are so striking that retired Baptist minister Howard Bess wonders whether many of these believers understand what Jesus actually preached : Are Christians destined to be rulers ?
Over the past 2,000 years , the vast majority of the followers of Jesus have answered that question with a resounding “ yes . ”
With that answer , we have deserted the very leader we claim to follow .
Email
Printer friendly Among the aphorisms of Jesus is a simple message that his initial followers found troubling : “ If any among you would be great , let him be a servant of all . ”
This saying is found in both the Matthew gospel and the Mark gospel .
The two gospels set the story a bit differently .
However , in both versions , a dispute has arisen among Jesus ’s disciples , vying for first place after Jesus was expected to become a powerful ruler .
They were looking forward to the day when they would be top dogs in a powerful ruling kingdom .
But Jesus had a different vision .
The people of God were to be a servant people .
Jesus pointed out to his disciples that other people aspired to greatness by exercising authority , adding : “ It shall not be so among you ! ”
To buttress this point , Jesus quoted from the Isaiah writings of the Old Testament , a passage written during the period of the Babylonian captivity , arguably the lowest point in the ancient history of the Israelites .
Lower Palestine had been overrun by the Babylonians .
Most of its inhabitants had been carried off and scattered to the far reaches of the Babylonian empire .
The magnificent temple that had been built by King Solomon was leveled to the ground .
Except for a handful of Israelites , who were relocated to the city of Babylon , a once proud and powerful kingdom had disappeared from the earth .
This outcome was a terrible blow to the Israelite tradition which envisioned the children of Israel possessing authority and power , an attitude deeply imbedded in the psyche of a people who believed they were specially designated by God .
The symbols of that greatness had been their capital city , Jerusalem , and their temple .
Both were gone , seemingly forever .
Those who had been chosen to survive as slaves in Babylon were primarily of the priestly class and were educated .
During the 70 years of their life in Babylon , this small band of Israelite elite became prolific writers , rewriters and recorders of Jewish history and culture .
While some dreamed of a day when Jerusalem and the temple would be rebuilt , there was a small inner circle of writers who saw the people of God in a new role .
They saw the people of God as servants of humanity , not rulers .
These special writings became a part of the Isaiah material .
After 70 years , the descendents of this hardy bunch of slaves were allowed to return to their homeland .
They rebuilt a walled city on the site of old Jerusalem and eventually built a new temple as a home for God , and in which they could make their animal sacrifices .
The glory days of David and Solomon never returned , but the majority of the people did not give up their dream of being the ruling nation of the world .
At the same time , largely hidden and barely noticed , this other vision of the people of God being a servant people persisted .
That vision lurked in the shadows , waiting for the obscure rabbi from Nazareth .
The days of Jesus were not good days for a devout Jew .
The temple in Jerusalem was an unholy farce that had been rebuilt for political purposes by a puppet king who owed his allegiance to the Roman emperor .
The priests who cared for the day - to - day operation of the temple were corrupt and obeyed the puppet king rather than Jehovah God .
Jesus did not simply reject the temple system because of it corruption .
Confronting its corruption was incidental to his more profound message .
He proposed the establishment of a new kingdom on earth based on service rather than on authority and power .
There were other rebellious movements among Jews at the time of Jesus .
The Zealots were an organized movement that advocated removing corrupt power by military might .
Tradition presents the disciple Peter as one who had dabbled in the Zealot movement and who is pictured carrying a sword the night Jesus was arrested in Jerusalem .
Peter had not yet absorbed the servant ideal .
A key dramatic moment occurred when Jesus told Peter “ put up your sword . ”
Jesus may well have added : “ My followers do not resort to swords . ”
This core message from Jesus has left many Christians and Christian churches horribly conflicted .
( Some Christians prefer to view Jesus in the militaristic image from the Book of Revelation , the last book added to the New Testament , rather than from his actual teachings recorded in the gospels . )
But the message of service also shines through .
I am pleased -- and justly so -- with the services that Christians and Christian churches provide to many communities .
I could tell endless true stories of the good that is done every day in the name of Jesus : hospitality , food , clothing , medical care , education , friendship and generous giving of funds .
At the same time , we seem unable or unwilling to lay down our swords and give up the desire for authority and power .
Speaking of himself , Jesus said “ the son of man did not come into the world to be served but to be a servant . ”
His followers should do no less .

Cephalopod Fortune - Teller Paul the Octopus Picks Germany to Beat Argentina
Paul , an octopus in Germany , has made international headlines with his perfect record predicting the outcome of Germany 's World Cup matches .
On Tuesday , the cephalopod chose the national squad to defeat Argentina on Saturday .
But it could be a tight game .
A top Pentagon official ran a covert network of contractors that supplied the U.S. government surveillance information for drone strikes and assassinations in Afghanistan and Pakistan , according to a complaint filed by the Central Intelligence Agency and revealed by the New York Times .
The official , Michael D. Furlong , is a civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force with a decade - long record of running psy- ops propaganda programs for the military in Bosnia , Kosovo and Iraq .
Officially Furlong worked in strategic communications for Gen. David Petraeus , head of the U.S. Central Command .
In reality , the former 82nd Airborne Ranger was in charge of " CAPSTONE , " a project under which he hired civilians , mostly former CIA and Special Forces operatives , to gather intelligence on the whereabouts of " suspected militants and the location of insurgent camps . "
The information was then transmitted to high - ranking Pentagon and CIA officials for " possible lethal action in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "
Furlong funded the project under the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization , a Pentagon research organization tasked with reducing the threat from roadside bombs .
The $ 24.6 million stream of money was funneled through two obscure contracting offices : the Cultural Engagement Group at the Special Operations Command Central in Tampa , Florida ; and the Counter Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office in Dahlgren , Virginia .
With this money , Furlong hired a newly minted company , International Media Ventures ( IMV ) , of St. Petersburg , Florida , and attempted to sub-contract other individuals and companies to run surveillance operations in South Asia .
One potential sub - contractor was AfPax Insider , a subscription service run by Robert Young Pelton , author of The World 's Most Dangerous Places and Eason Jordan , a former chief news executive for CNN .
In late 2009 Pelton told CorpWatch that after he learned more about Furlong 's real intentions , AfPax opted out of the program : " When we suspected that he was doing ... we protested .
That moral stand cost us millions . "
Pelton said he was concerned that Furlong had set up IMV for clandestine operations , and told Furlong that " kinetic action " ( i.e. , drone strikes ) were incompatible with " the now accepted counter - insurgency strategy . "
The allegations remained unsubstantiated until March 15 when a New York Times front - page story documented how Furlong 's secret operation was exposed after the CIA filed an official complaint with the Pentagon 's inspector general .
Furlong boasted to unnamed military officials that " a group of suspected militants carrying rockets by mule over the border had been singled out and killed as a result of his efforts , " wrote reporters Mark Mazetti and Dexter Filkins .
Contract Spies
The Capstone contract was International Media Ventures ' first major business deal .
But before coming to IMV , current CEO Richard Pack had experience running special operations for an L - 3 subsidiary - Chantilly , Virginia - based Government Services Incorporated .
( GSI also provided the Pentagon with 300 intelligence analysts , including interrogators in Iraq , under a $ 426.5 million contract signed in 2005 .
See " Intelligence in Iraq : L - 3 Supplies Spy Support . " )
On IMV 's website , Pack , who once ran the elite U.S. commando unit Delta Force , also claims to have been a mission planner for an undated rescue of U.S. prisoners - of - war in Laos , the aborted 1980 rescue mission to free U.S. embassy hostages in Tehran , the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 , as well as operations officer for the Pentagon responding to the hijacking of a TWA plane to Beirut in 1985 .
Another company that Furlong sub - contracted was Boston - based American International Security Corporation ( AISC ) run by Mike Taylor , a former Green Beret turned private investigator .
A 1995 lawsuit by Massachusetts State Trooper Robert Monahan accused Taylor of helping drug traffickers by providing phony Greek passports , and even arranging a jailbreak in Florida .
AISC also employed Duane " Dewey " Clarridge , a former senior CIA official who was indicted in 1991 for his role in the Iran - Contra affair .
In 1992 , just before leaving office , President George H.W. Bush pardoned Clarridge .
In a previous scandal , Clarridge admitted arranging the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1984 to destabilize the leftist Sandanista government reviled by the Reagan administration .
" I was sitting at home one night , frankly having a glass of gin , and I said you know the mines has gotta be the solution .
I knew we had 'em , we 'd made 'em outta sewer pipe , and we had the good fusing system on them , and we were ready .
And you know they would n't really hurt anybody because they just were n't that big a mine , all right ?
Yeah , with luck , bad luck we might hurt somebody , but pretty hard you know ? " he told the National Security Archive .
Clarridge has long had a close relationship with Robert Gates , now the head of the Pentagon .
" If you have a tough , dangerous job , critical to national security , Dewey 's your man , " Gates is quoted as saying in a book by Joseph E. Persico .
" Just make sure you have a good lawyer at his elbow - Dewey 's not easy to control . "
The Pentagon's Propaganda Networks
Despite the fact that Furlong is now being portrayed as a rogue operator , running an illegal spying operation unknown to his superiors at the Pentagon , he has a long history of working at the highest levels of the military and creating propaganda networks for the Pentagon .
According to his official biography , his career in psy - ops started when he was appointed commander of the Joint Psychological Operations Task Force in Bosnia , where from 1995 to 1997 he established transmitting and broadcasting networks in former Yugoslavia .
After he left the military , Furlong took a job as the director of the Strategic Communications and Information Operations Division of San Diego - based Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
Founded in 1969 by physicist J. Robert Beyster , SAIC 's biggest source of income has always been surveillance for U.S. spy agencies including the CIA and the National Security Agency .
For example , in 2002 SAIC won the $ 282 million job of overseeing the latest phase of Trailblazer , the most thorough revamping in the NSA 's history of its eavesdropping systems .
It was also the principal contractor for the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Virtual Case File database project that was scrapped in 2005 .
" We are a stealth company .
We 're everywhere , but almost never seen , " Keith Nightingale , a former Army special ops officer , told the now defunct magazine Business 2.0 .
Furlong 's background in propaganda helped him set up a small media empire for SAIC with Pentagon funding , the Iraqi Media Network ( IMN ) .
It sat on the third floor of the Baghdad convention center , in a suite of offices tucked away from the bustle of American and Iraqi bureaucrats and soldiers who were using the sprawling complex as a nerve center to run the country in the weeks following the 2003 invasion .
The public face of IMN was the Al Iraqiya radio and television network .
In December 2003 , when I met with IMN 's second in command , Alaa Fa'ik , he denied that the Pentagon had any influence on IMN reporting .
The Iraqi American from Ann Arbor , Michigan , was dressed casually in a sweater , with short - cropped grey hair and glasses ; a military - issued badge hanging on a blue strap round his neck identified him as a SAIC employee .
He described his company as the wave of the future for Arabic media .
" Yes , we are getting money from the Department of Defense .
That is from you and me , the taxpayer .
Are you reporting the fact that the Ministry of Education is funded by the United States government , the Ministry of Health is funded by the United States ?
I do n't understand why when it comes to the media , you say , no , no , no .
So who is going to fund it ? "
Fa'ik may have believed that he was building democratic media institutions but his own employees had their suspicions about Furlong .
" He had some TV experience , but not much .
He was doing other stuff on the side , so he was running away from meetings .
He did n't establish a professional - running TV station , " one worker told the now defunct Baghdad Bulletin .
As a project , IMN was a failure .
Don North , who had reported from Vietnam , Washington and the Middle East for ABC and NBC News , called Al Iraqiya " Project Frustration " when he quit in July 2003 .
" IMN has become an irrelevant mouthpiece for CPA [ the U.S. provisional government in Iraq ] propaganda , managed news , and mediocre programs .
I have trained journalists after the fall of tyrannies in Bosnia , Romania , and Afghanistan .
I do n't blame the Iraqi journalists for the failure of IMN .
Through a combination of incompetence and indifference , CPA has destroyed the fragile credibility of IMN , " he wrote in Television Week .
SAIC removed Furlong from the IMN project in late 2003 .
Shortly after that he went to work for Virginia - based Booz Allen Hamilton , another major CIA and NSA contractor .
In August 2005 , Furlong returned to work with the Pentagon but as a senior civilian official - deputy director for the Pentagon 's Joint Psychological Operations Support Element ( JPSE ) out of the U.S. Special Operations Command in Florida .
At the time , he set up a $ 300 million contract in Iraq to hire three contractors for " media approach planning , prototype product development , commercial quality product development , product distribution and dissemination , and media effects analysis " - in other words , propaganda .
" " We 're looking at programs , for example , to counter suicide bombers , " Furlong told USA Today .
" While the product may not carry the label , ' Made in the USA , ' we will respond truthfully if asked " by journalists . "
The first contractor was SAIC , his old employer ; the second was L - 3 subsidiary Sy Coleman ; and the third was the Lincoln Group , a new outfit set up in Washington by Christian Bailey , a co-chairman of Lead 21 , a political group aligned with the Republican Party .
The Lincoln Group 's efforts ran into trouble when Mark Mazetti , then a reporter with the Los Angeles Times , revealed that the company was secretly paying Iraqi newspapers to publish stories written by U.S. troops .
Willem Marx , a former intern at the Lincoln Group , later described to the radio program Democracy Now !
how his boss worked : " He was choosing which of those articles would be published in Iraqi newspapers .
He was sending them to Iraqi employees , getting them translated into Arabic , getting them okayed by the command back at Camp Victory , and then having other Iraqi employees run them down to Iraqi newspapers , where they would pay editors , sub-editors , commissioning editors to run them as news stories in the Iraqi newspapers . "
Despite the controversy , the Lincoln Group continued to win more contracts to conduct " information operations " in Iraq as recently as September 2008 .
The AfPak program
When the attention of the new Obama administration and the Pentagon turned to Afghanistan , so too did Furlong .
In February 2008 Furlong left the U.S. Special Operations Command to take a job at the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas , where his official title was " Strategic Planner and Technology Integration Adviser . "
One of the projects that he was put in charge of that first year was CAPSTONE .
At about the same time Pelton and Jordan were meeting with Gen. David McKiernan , the top U.S. general in Afghanistan , to offer an information gathering service on Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The Pentagon bit and introduced them to Furlong .
Unknown to either Pelton or Jordan , Furlong then set up a contract with IMV to bring together at least six unrelated companies on the back of this proposal including AfPax Insider .
It remains unclear whether or not Furlong had approval from higher - level officials to provide covert information gathering program for drone strikes .
Some senior officials felt that Furlong was doing a good job .
In an August 2009 assessment , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , wrote that CAPSTONE contracts " should be supported as these will significantly enhance . . . monitoring and assessment efforts . "
But Furlong seems to have had a grandiose view of what he was doing , referring to Taylor and Clarridge as his " Jason Bournes " ( the fictitious assassin played by Matt Damon in the Bourne Identity series of films ) .
He also boasted about achievements that others said never happened .
For example he told Pelton that his people had helped David Rohde , a New York Times reporter who was kidnapped by the Taliban in Logar province in November 2008 , by sending an U.S. doctor to drug the guards and supply the rope for Rohde 's dramatic escape in June 2009 .
Pelton says these claims aroused his skepticism .
What made the situation complicated was that the New York Times had in fact hired Taylor and Clarridge to help it track down Rohde .
The newspaper revealed that relationship in the March 15 story , but insisted that the paper had no dealings with Furlong .
A senior New York Times staffer , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told CorpWatch : " The newspaper , Rohde and his family had no contact with Furlong .
They had not heard of Furlong until Dexter Filkins and Mark Mazzetti began working on their story .
As Rohde stated in the series , no one helped them escape .
Any claim by Furlong that he helped them escape is false . "
The day after the Times story broke , the Pentagon said it had placed Furlong under criminal investigation for his activities .
The investigation was sparked a couple of months previously when the CIA 's station chief in Kabul sent a cable to the Pentagon complaining about the covert operations .
Furlong 's bosses at the U.S. Strategic Command Joint Information Operations Warfare Center ( JIOWC ) voiced similar concerns .
( Exactly why the CIA was worried about Furlong 's surveillance operations when it was doing much the same thing is unclear , but there has been a long history of animosity between the two agencies . )
The question remains : Was Furlong running rogue operation under the guise of information gathering , or did he have tacit approval from his bosses ?
After the news broke in the March 15 New York Times , a Pentagon official told the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity , that it was " not apparent who authorized " the operation , but that the " potential for disaster " was obvious .

Jealous much ?
Do n't be .
I had to sacrifice my ears to the roaring engines at Silverstone last Friday , just for you lovely people .
While the Formula
One teams were taking a break from the Grand Prix practice sessions , I was able to sneak into the pit area and get up close to Vodafone McLaren Mercedes ' shiny stallions -- no touching allowed , naturally , but I did learn a thing or two about their pre-race preparation .
And to top things off , legendary driver Jenson Button also popped by to share some thoughts on McLaren 's F - duct system ( a cunning and legal trickery that lets the driver 's left leg redirect airflow over the rear wing in order to stall the flap , thus reducing drag when doing straights ) , as well as a few grumbles about the sharp corners on the recently renovated circuit .
Video's after the break , and be sure to crank up your speakers for maximum sensation .
According to the Minister :
“ [ If ] you were doing a banking transaction , or transmitting personal information , they could have hoovered it up , sucked it up into their machine ” .
I ’ll let the technical wizards from SAGE - AU explain , in the words of spokesperson Iain Robertson , why this claim is wrong :
“ While it is clear Google ’s Street View cars collected more data than necessary – a practice not condoned by SAGE - AU – Internet banking data is safe from collection due to the nature of the communications from web browsers to Internet banking servers .
“ Banking transactions conducted over the Internet use Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) encryption between web browsers and banking servers .
Such websites can be identified by the ‘ https ://’ part of a web address in the browser bar .
“ The use of encryption in this manner is a proven technology and is part of banking industry standard practice throughout Australia .
Even if portions of Internet banking communications were intercepted by Google ’s Street View cars , it is not possible for that data to be decrypted by unintended recipients such as Google . ”
The phone rang when I was shoeless and only a couple of sips into my morning coffee .
" Hi , it 's Novella Carpenter , " the caller said .
" My goat is giving birth . "
Twenty minutes later I was crouched in the hay at Ghost Town Farm , pushing away chickens and peering into the pen that housed the expectant mother , Bébé .
Her udder was so swollen she could n't get her hindquarters down .
Bleating , she clawed at the dirt with her right front hoof as if searching for a stash of Vicodin .
" Pass me the iodine , " Carpenter said .
" We better wash up . "
Similar birthing scenes have unfolded countless times in America 's agrarian past , but none , I suspected , had the soundtrack of the Ghost Town neighborhood in Oakland , Calif .
As Bébé 's cries reached an apex they were matched by the caterwauling of a police car siren on Martin Luther King Jr. Way .
Then came the intestine - undulating bass of hip - hop from a passing car .
Residents disagree on how Ghost Town got its name — for the isolation created when freeways cleft the neighborhood from the rest of the city in the 1950s ?
For the appallingly high murder rate ?
For the casket companies that used to be located here ?
More unanimously accepted is that Ghost Town is a singularly odd location for a homestead that hosts pigs , goats , geese , peaches , potatoes , spinach and bees .
Carpenter is living a version of the Laura Ingalls Wilder fantasy all right , but hers is Little House in the ' Hood .
Carpenter , the author of Farm City : The Education of an Urban Farmer , is , by her own admission , " a bit nuts . "
If so , she has company — similar farms have sprung up on city blocks in Los Angeles , New York , Pittsburgh and Detroit .
And food is hardly the only commodity that people are producing for themselves these days .
A small but growing number of American households generate all of their electricity using wind , solar or micro - hydro .
But off - the - grid living has come to mean something more nuanced than cutting all ties with utilities and society ; for many , it 's about finding creative ways to produce and conserve resources at home .
Hundreds of thousands of Americans capture rainwater in barrels , can food from their gardens , heat water with solar collectors and commute by bicycle .
We may be nearly a decade into the 21st century , but the self - reliant spirit of an earlier era — that of homesteading pioneers — has returned with gusto .
At Ghost Town Farm , Carpenter cleared the head - high weeds from a 4500 - square - foot lot and started planting .
She did n't ask permission .
When the lot 's owner discovered the squat garden he warned that he would soon develop the real estate –that was five years ago .
Now the lot is verdant with lavender , sage and thyme ; lime , rhubarb and raspberries ; artichoke , collard greens and avocado .
Strolling through the garden , I became overwhelmed by a feeling that could only be described as vegetable lust .
But something deeper than my appetite had been stimulated , too .
My grandfather once worked a small mountain farm in Greece .
He immigrated to California 's Central Valley in his 20s , opening a produce stand and then a grocery store , but he never totally severed his connection to the land .
I remember strolling through fruit - laden trees in his backyard as a boy .
Now , I was gearing up for major changes myself — the arrival of my first child , the purchase of my own home — and I had been thinking about what sort of sanctuary I could create for my own family .
The house I envisioned was solar - powered and garden - ringed , a little safer , smarter and more productive than the wasteful world around it .
I was deeply curious about the experiments of modern homesteaders because I wondered just how self - sufficient I could be , too .
In the pen Bébé continued to push and , with a little gentle guidance from Carpenter , the newborn 's head crowned .
Then the front legs were out .
Bébé gave a final , anguished cry and the kid was born , a female , soon to be named Hedwig .
Twenty minutes later , she had a brother , Eeyore .
The two Nigerian dwarf goats wobbled about on untested legs and , undistracted by a car alarm that had started to blare , tried to find their mother 's teats .
America is dotted with remote , off - the - grid homesteads .
Certain regions — including western Texas around Big Bend National Park ; the mesas outside of Taos , N.M. ; and pockets of the Sierra Nevada northeast of Lake Tahoe — host whole mini communities .
The Surprise Valley of northeasternmost California supports another .
There , where skyscrapers of light slant from the heavens to the mirror - flat floor of the desert , I was crouched on a mattress attached to a rope .
The other end of the rope was hitched to a Ford F - 350 .
The tires spun and soon I was hooky bobbing — surfing at 30 mph , a roostertail of dust in my wake .
I felt as gleeful as the Road Runner with Wile E. Coyote giving futile chase .
The truck stopped after a few minutes and , as I spat dirt clods from my mouth , a pretty young woman in a red plaid shirt and a white cowboy hat emerged from the cab .
" You 're lucky you 're just visiting , " Tierra Hodge said .
" If you lived here we would have set the mattress on fire . "
I 'd been introduced to Tierra through a tortured chain of connections — my wife 's cousin 's father 's friend 's daughter , or something like that .
She grew up off the grid on land near here , and had agreed to guide me around a place I never knew existed and introduce me to people who did n't necessarily want to be found .
The first stop was welcoming enough : a mountain homestead replete with mud , solar panels , semi-clothed children , and chickens .
Then we had lunch in the town of Eagleville with Ed and Wendi Lutz , trompe l'oeil painters who'd retired to build an off - the - grid retreat .
Tierra said the place was beautiful — circular , with deep wooden sills and colorful bottles embedded in the walls — but the Lutzes refused to disclose its exact location .
I 'd told them I was a journalist and might as well have said One World Government Spy .
" We have come to value our privacy , " Wendi said , eyeing me warily .
That afternoon we drove past a doomsday retreat , complete with its own private airstrip , belonging to a wealthy Bay Area businessman .
" He 's preparing for the end of the world as we know it , " Tierra said with an enigmatic smile .
I could n't tell if she was mocking him or applauding his foresight .
The specters of financial crisis , climate change , uncertain energy reserves and a fragile food supply loom large for the new generation of survivalists — and though I do n't share their apocalyptic mind - set , I find myself relating to the urge to run for cover .
In April , the top - selling action and adventure book on Amazon.com was Patriots : Surviving the Coming Collapse , a work described to me by its author , James Wesley Rawles , as a " survival manual dressed as fiction . "
Its plot appeals to those on the political right , who fear a too - powerful government — and the anarchy to come in the wake of its inevitable collapse .
Leftie off - the - gridders gravitate more to the " grow - local " approach championed by author Michael Pollan .
" We 're using up the world 's resources more quickly than you could imagine , " says Ruby Blume of the Institute of Urban Homesteading .
" I think we need to be prepared . "
Lately , homesteaders of all political stripes have settled upon a common concern : globalization .
The shock waves of any crisis — for instance , the subprime meltdown — now spread far , fast and wide .
Many doubt that major institutions can be counted upon to save the day .
" You 're on your own , your job is at risk , and a lot of the commodities you rely upon are vulnerable to disruption , " says John Robb , author of Brave New War , which describes how terrorists could exploit global systems .
To my ear , such statements straddle the line between reasonable advice and hyperventilated threat .
One day you 're sipping a frappuccino .
The next you 're using a pitchfork to fend off rioting mobs .
But even if I do n't fully agree with the dystopian diagnosis , I like Robb 's proposed cure : " You 're going to have to start doing more for yourself . "
The beauty of the DIY solution is that the exact problem does n't matter ; greater self - sufficiency makes sense to survivalists and eco-utopians alike .
In the early 1970s , Tierra 's parents established their own fully off - the - grid homestead in Mendocino , and later in Surprise Valley , with the thought that " when society crumbles , we 'll be able to raise our children in a safe environment , " Tierra says .
She and her sister , Celesta , grew up in a tepee ; her mom , Tina , and dad , Bill , supported the family by breeding llamas and selling medicinal herbs .
Instead of sitting in a classroom the Hodge girls were home - schooled , usually outdoors .
Instead of playing video games , they explored the mountains on horseback .
Growing up in the wild was idyllic but not always easy .
When Tierra was 15 a boy braved the long dirt road to the homestead to pick her up for a date to the county fair .
He emerged from the car looking spiffy in an all - white outfit only to have the Hodges ' pet raccoon pounce with muddy paws .
Then one of the llamas pegged him with a wad of saliva .
Tina , always on the lookout for free meals for wildlife she rehabilitates , shouted after the couple , " Goodbye , honey , have fun , and do n't forget to look for roadkill ! "
" I just about died , " Tierra recalls .
But in spite of their upbringing — or because of it — the girls turned out fine .
Tierra went to college .
And Celesta moved almost directly from the tepee to a penthouse in New York , gracing the cover of Cosmopolitan as a fashion model .
The day after hooky bobbing , I found myself standing ankle deep in llama poop with a shovel .
My job was to ferry wheelbarrows of the stuff up a hill to a garden , dump the smelly payload and then do it again .
And again , ad infinitum , until it got dark or my blisters burst .
It was raining , so I was damp , and the sodden manure was getting heavy .
Then the clouds broke , and the sun beamed down on the Hodges ' secluded mountain — 160 acres surrounded by protected wildlands .
The air was pine - scented and pulsing with the sound of a creek .
Rob Howard
Just as my back began to give out , Bill mercifully invited me to tour the family 's airy , three - bedroom house .
It was built earth - berm style , dug into the mountainside and covered by a living roof of soil and vegetation .
The ground temperature stays close to 57 F year round , which makes the house extremely energy efficient .
A small solar array provides enough electricity for lights , a refrigerator and a stereo .
Bill crouched beside an unfinished section of wall , where he pointed out a grid of 3/8 - inch rebar layered with steel mesh .
He had painstakingly covered the rest of the grid with a mixture of sand , cement and water — ferro - cement construction that was affordable , fire - and pest - resistant and exceptionally tough .
Bill bent the rebar before applying the mortar , which resulted in strong , gracefully curving walls .
The house had taken him more than two decades to complete — and should be there for a thousand more , he says .
That kind of work — the kind that results in dirt under fingernails — is back in vogue .
Not everybody builds his own home , of course , but people with office jobs are raising hens , bees and wind turbines , learning to weld and taking up quilting .
My blistered palms reminded me that manual work is still work , and tasks like shoveling manure can be just as mind - numbing as data entry .
But I could n't deny the appeal of creating something tangible and unique .
After the tour , Bill and I plopped chairs down outside and popped tops off of a couple of beers .
Purplish mesas flanked the horizon to the east .
To the west rose the snow - topped Warner Mountains .
He admitted that living off the grid on 160 acres was " a utopian thing " not many people could emulate .
As for Tierra , she moved back to Surprise Valley after several years away .
She started a fencing company and has built a small off - the - grid place of her own .
It has three tiny rooms that she shares with Sienna , her 4 - year - old daughter from a recent marriage .
The house has only enough solar power for a refrigerator , a few light bulbs and a boom box , but the desert view surpasses that of most million - dollar vacation homes .
Tierra is conflicted about her future and considering a move to the Bay Area .
After getting a taste of her life for the past few days , I had more than an inkling why :
It is lonely to live this far out of the mainstream .
I could n't do it myself , no matter how dazzling the mountain scenery .
And yet Tierra is proud of what she has achieved .
" There 's a resourcefulness to living this way , " she says .
" You know that if all else fails in the world , you 'll still be okay . "
Power generation does n't have to be a DIY enterprise .
Witness Oregon's
Three Rivers community , a subdivision with 250 solar - and wind - powered homes , or the Villages at Heritage Springs , 500 solar homes planned for Southern California .
Other all - solar real estate developments are in the works in Florida , Iowa and Colorado .
Clayton Homes , the country 's largest maker of mobile and prefabricated houses , has introduced the i-House , which includes solar panels and energy - efficient appliances , for little more than $ 100,000 .
Satellite Internet services have enabled people to stay connected even in remote areas .
Nick Rosen , who runs the website
Off - grid.net , spends several months each year living off the grid in the mountains of Majorca , Spain , but seamlessly continues his work as a writer and technology consultant .
The notion that painful sacrifices are mandatory has been toppled , he says .
Modern energy technologies , well - insulated homes and power - sipping appliances mean " you can live a fantastic , comfortable time off - grid . "
Curious to see how much luxury is possible , I arranged to visit the home of Thomas Beck , an architect in Estes Park , Colo .
Beck got his start in residential work before he hit puberty , building multistory treehouses complete with trapdoors and fireman 's poles .
He began studying environmental design in 1973 , just as the OPEC oil embargo hit , and attended the National Solar Energy Conference the following spring .
" I realized then that oil was a finite resource , but the sun 's going to be around for , what , 96 billion more years ? "
Beck says .
Yet it was n't until recently that he built his magnum opus : a 5800 - square - foot spread with a 270 - degree view of Rocky Mountain National Park .
" When most people think about an off - the - grid house I do n't think they 'd picture this , " Beck said when I arrived .
Inspired by the Arts and Crafts style of architecture , Beck used wood beams , stone and stucco to create multiple wings fanning out under long diagonal rooflines .
We passed through the front door , elaborately carved from standing dead hardwoods , and proceeded to the Great Room — a cavernous space with a flat - screen television , a dining table long enough for 16 and a baby grand piano .
Beams recycled from a century - old railroad trestle support the lofty ceiling .
In the kitchen , granite countertops could land a small plane .
Yet Beck 's only utility bill is for propane .
Outdoors , above a wood - fired hot tub , rise two wind turbines that can produce 800 watts of electricity .
Integrated photovoltaic cells on the roof contribute another kilowatt .
A few dozen yards from the front door stands the power house :
An array of solar panels on top generates 1.44 kilowatts and , inside , three inverters charge lead - acid batteries — 32 in all .
Three banks of evacuated - tube solar thermal collectors heat water for both domestic use and the 3.5 miles of radiant floor tubing that warms the house .
Beck stepped out to meet with a client and encouraged me to explore the house on my own .
I went downstairs , where a lap pool with 10,000 gallons of solar - heated water acts as a thermal reservoir to help stabilize the home 's temperature .
I was tempted to go for a quick swim — but then chickened out .
The whole place , in fact , screamed " look but do n't touch , " and I wondered what it might say about the broader movement for sustainability .
This eco-mansion took copious amounts of natural resources to construct .
I would love to live here .
But , environmentally , it seemed a bit like a biodiesel - powered Hummer .
While an impressive showcase for off - the - grid tech , Beck 's luxurious spread appeared no more realistic–for me anyway –than the Hodges ' bare - bones retreat .
The dream of living more independently from civilization is almost as old as civilization itself .
When Rome fell 1500 years ago , city dwellers fled to the countryside , becoming some of the world 's first back - to - the - landers .
The Diggers of 17th - century England and Depression - era Americans similarly tried to provide for themselves locally .
By the late 1960s and early 70s , as many as 1 million Americans , decrying consumerism and Vietnam , set out for what they thought would be a purer life in the countryside .
For inspiration they read Aldo Leopold and Henry David Thoreau ; for practical advice on everything from carpentry to compost they clutched issues of the Whole Earth Catalog .
However well - armed with information , though , most of the would - be pioneers lacked practical experience and abandoned small - farm living after learning that it was — as Novella Carpenter indelicately put it to me — " a s--- ton of work . "
Carpenter knows firsthand about the travails of the back - to - the - landers .
She spent her early childhood on a rural retreat in Idaho .
Directly emulating her parents horrified her , but the apple fell only so far from the tree .
" I recognized that if my parents were Utopia 8.5 with their hippie farm in Idaho , I was merely Utopia version 9.0 with my urban farm in the ghetto , " she wrote in Farm City .
A few weeks after the goats were born , Carpenter and I strolled past a graffitied warehouse across from the farm , then turned left on Martin Luther King Jr. Way .
Carpenter said that instead of tumbleweeds she sometimes spotted " tumbleweaves , " the lost hairpieces of prostitutes , blowing down the block .
When we stopped in a small park to pick pellitory , a nettle - like plant that the chickens love , Carpenter recounted a shooting she 'd witnessed there .
I really admired Carpenter , but I thought she was more than a little crazy .
What made her urban version of utopia any better than the rural approach of her parents ?
" I find the country incredibly lonely , " Carpenter said as we headed back .
Ghost Town was diverse and intriguing ; the menace of thugs was tempered by the support of the community .
We strolled past a bodega whose owner , a goatherd in Yemen before he emigrated to the U.S. , had taught her how to slaughter livestock .
And Carpenter pointed out a monastery occupied by Vietnamese monks , one of whom had helped her chase down a runaway pig .
Carpenter 's urban farm is doubtless an extreme case study .
But it also seems to me the most tenable future for self - sufficient , environmentally sustainable living .
Homesteading , to be sure , needs the sense of hardy independence that I 'd found in Surprise Valley .
And I certainly appreciated the appeal of some eco-luxury a la Beck .
But for homesteading to truly transcend niche status -- for it to have any appreciable impact on the world -- it must embrace the community spirit of Carpenter 's urban experiment .
Maybe I 'd drunk too much organic goat milk .
But after seeing everybody else , I knew that it is Carpenter 's city setup I want to draw from to create my own family 's future home -- minus the gun-toting teens and the tumbleweaves , of course .
" People are always like , ' I know where I 'm going to go when the s--- hits the fan , Novella - - to your house ! ' "
Carpenter says .
" And my response to that is , if it hits the fan , it 's going to hit the fan for all of us . "
We left the street and walked behind her house , where she scattered sawdust on the ground to cloak the livestock odors .
We tossed out the pellitory , and the chickens scrambled to gobble it down .

Image 1 of 5 Lance Armstrong 's jersey was ripped after his second crash of the stage .
( Image credit : Bettini Photo ) Image 2 of 5 Teammates try to take care of Lance Armstrong ( RadioShack ) ( Image credit : Bettini Photo ) Image 3 of 5 Lance Armstrong ( RadioShack ) explains how he lost over eleven minutes on the road to Morzine ( Image credit : Fotoreporter Sirotti ) Image 4 of 5 Lance Armstrong ( RadioShack ) had a bad day at the office ( Image credit : Fotoreporter Sirotti ) Image 5 of 5 Lance Armstrong ( RadioShack ) crosses the line in disappointment , alongside Christophe Moreau ( Caisse d'Epargne ) and Janez Brajkovic ( RadioShack ) ( Image credit : Fotoreporter Sirotti )
It was a black day for the RadioShack team .
In the words of manager Johan Bruyneel , " Everything that could go wrong went wrong . "
Lance Armstrong went down three times during the stage : first , after six kilometres raced , where he did not suffer any damage and was able to get back to the bunch quickly .
Then , a few kilometres before the Cat. 1 Ramaz climb , he crashed again and this time hurt himself , putting him in trouble on the decisive ascent .
A third tumble , due to an Euskaltel rider in front of him with 21 kilometres to the finish , topped off a day that the Texan will surely want to forget : it put an end to his chances of an eighth Tour de France victory .
" It 's definitely the end of the Tour de France , the end of Lance 's objective to win this Tour , " Bruyneel said in the finish in Avoriaz .
" He got held up in the beginning , then he really crashed badly 10 kilometres before the Ramaz climb .
He was in difficulty on the Ramaz afterwards . "
Armstrong lost one minute on top of the Ramaz climb , and never managed to come back - despite the help of his teammates Chris Horner , Janez Brajkovic and Yaroslav Popovych .
" Lance crashed again before the last climb in a roundabout , so we pulled really hard to come back with him , " Popovych told Cyclingnews at the finish .
" We did like eight kilometres à bloc to come back with Lance , but it was useless .
It 's a very bad day for Radio Shack . "
To Bruyneel , the reason Armstrong had to drop off the favourites ' bunch was an injury to the American 's hip suffered in the second crash .
" Physically , before the race , there was no indication to say that he would find it hard - to the contrary , his ambition today was to race in front .
On the last climb , he told me that he banged his hip badly and that it was impossible for him to put out maximal power .
" On the third category climb [ the last climb before the final ascent to Avoriaz ] , he crashed again .
It was like everything had to go wrong today . "
Matthew Lloyd from Davitamon - Lotto was in Armstrong 's group and witnessed that last crash .
" Unfortunately , Lance crashed , there were again lots of crashes today , " he said post -race .
" Euskaltel really needs to learn how to ride bikes .
It 's just shocking .
I do n't know whether that 's controversial or not , but I do n't care .
They 've probably caused every crash in this race ...
It 's really unfortunate for Lance because he wanted to finish this Tour de France in style , and now ... "
The third crash indeed was caused by two riders from the Basque team .
Egoi Martinez handed a food bag to his teammate Ivan Velasco , who lost control of his bike , taking down Armstrong with him .
Perhaps
Tour rookie Velasco was not paying enough attention , as his wife gave birth the night before to their first child , a baby boy , born prematurely at seven months .
In any case , that last crash literally made Armstrong " give up " , according to his team director .
" He gave up because he already lost time when he punctured on the pavé , he lost time in the crashes today .
It would have been very hard to come back as the race was just getting off during that moment , and the bunch certainly did n't wait .
On the Ramaz , he saw that it was impossible because of his hip injury .
" It was sad to see that .
But it 's the race , " Bruyneel said .
Apple is now using Gianduia , their own standards based framework , to create Rich Internet Apps instead of Flash .
According to AppleInsider , Apple introduced Gianduia last summer at the World of WebObjects Developer Conference .
Named after an Italian hazelnut chocolate , Gianduia is " essentially is browser - side Cocoa ( including CoreData ) +
WebObjects , written in JavaScript by non-js - haters , " according to a tweet by developer Jonathan " Wolf " Rentzsch .
" Jaw dropped . "
After he watched the NDA demo Apple gave at WOWODC last year , Rentzch also tweeted , " Blown away by Gianduia .
Cappuccino , SproutCore and JavascriptMVC have serious competition .
Serious . "
AppleInsider has learned that Apple Retail is already using the framework for several popular services such as the One - to - One program , iPhone reservation system , and its Concierge service for Genius Bar reservations and Personal Shopping .

I do n't miss 200 channels too much , but I do occasionally miss letting the TV make decisions for me — the feeling of " oh , what 's on ? " , no worry about my ( currently 140 - item ) queue .
Since I do n't surf , I stay away from most TLC reality shows — I watched an episode of Say Yes to the Dress on Netflix and I was disgusted , mostly by how riveted I was to the tube .
And I 've completely missed the show Police Women of Memphis .
There 's not a whole lot I have to say about PWOM as a show in general .
I think that glorifying a very problematic justice system as this show seems to do is probably not fantastic .
But , I like that it depicts ladies in positions of authority , being competent .
It 's also cool that many of these women are of color .
And one of the cops on the show is named " Virginia Awkward " , which is a pretty kickass name .
PWOM came to my atttention this weekend after I heard of its depiction of an almost radical act .
It portrayed women as being worthy of respect , and protection .
As not deserving of sexual harassment .
This in itself would be worthy of praise .
But this depiction is particularly worthy of singling out because the women being protected were trans women .
And in a media environment that generally depicts trans women as deceptive , predatory , disgusting , and generally less than human , that 's exceptional .
The episode " Rock Your Fusicha Hair " shows officer Joy Johnson actively protecting two trans women from degendering harrassment , telling the harrassers that the women 's presentation , gender and identity is none of their business and that they have a right to comfort , safety , and privacy .
Officer Jackson goes on to assure the women in question of their right to safety and comfort , and banters with them .
She compliments one girl 's fuischa hair and generally treats them as sympathetic individuals .
Officer Jackson is not shown to be particularly brave for this act .
The intro to the episode highlights not the trans status of the women she protects , but the boys who wo n't shut up about it .
Officer Jackson is not a hero or a savior , but an officer of the law protecting citizens and doing the business of her job .
While the trans factor is clearly the hook for the segment and it's clearly supposed to make Officer Jackson look sensitive , the women in this segment are not shown to be freaks , and their protection is not framed as an exceptional act of kindness .
Furthermore , the gender presentation of these women is not questioned , and is often presented without qualification .
Officer Jackson at first misgenders them by using the wrong pronoun , which is not good .
But through most of the segment , she refers to them as girls and ladies ( without any qualifiers ! ) and uses correct pronouns .
It 's also great to see women of color advocating for each other , as black woman are also marginalized by law enforcement and the media .
Police protection is far from an assumed right for trans women .
Trans women have to constantly confront oppression , whether it's at work , at school , in the media , or with the law .
In covering this episode , Monica of TransGriot contrasted this interaction with an example of police abuse of trans women in Memphis :
With all the notoriety that former Memphis Police Dept officer Bridges McRae brought upon the department with his jailhouse beatdown of the late Duanna Johnson , and the lack of progress toward arresting the perpetrators who murdered Ebony Whitaker and Duanna Johnson , it stands to reason that most trans people in and outside the city of Memphis have a negative view about the MPD ...
Officer Johnson , you are a good person as well .
Thank you for not only the job that you do as an MPD officer , but making the point that we transpeople need to be treated with respect as well .
Trans women are highly marginalized in modern society , particularly by law enforcement and media .
Police Women of Memphiss is not exactly representing the reality of police treatment of trans women , but this is one example of how police and media can treat trans women right .
May 12 , 2010  -- A
Dutch child is the only survivor of a fiery plane crash at Tripoli airport in Libya this morning that killed 103 people .
" All of the passengers and crew died except for one child , " a Libyan security source told Reuters at Tripoli airport .
Libya 's Transport Minister Mohamed Zidan said the 10 - year - old child , who holds a Dutch passport , was hospitalized .
" The little boy has now come out of surgery , he was treated for fractures suffered during the crash , " a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesperson told ABC News .
Officials said the boy had multiple fractures of both legs .
" We hope our colleagues will be able to see him soon to establish his identity , " she said .
Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen told the Associated Press , " We suppose he 's Dutch because he said ' Holland Holland ' to the doctor treating him . "
Officials said that 62 of the 93 passengers on board were Dutch and the plane was being used by two Dutch tour operators , according to the Dutch Foreign Ministry .
There were 11 crew members on board .
" Ladies and gentlemen , this morning we were shocked to hear there was a plane crash in Libya .
As you heard , 103 passengers have died .
We also heard this morning that several dozens of them are Dutch citizens " the Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said in a press conference this morning .
Thirteen hours after the crash , the prime minister voiced frustration at the scanty information arriving from Libya , including the lack of a final passenger list .
" We still do n't have the exact information that we need , " Balkenende said in a TV interview .
" Things are still being figured out -- and we 're in that phase . "
Dutch flags were lowered and campaigning for the June 9 parliamentary election was suspended in respect for the dead .

" People are calling us in a distraught state to find out more about their loved ones – we are now busy trying to arrange for the repatriation of the victims .
There is a lot to do , " Annelies Techelaar of the Dutch emergency services , told ABC News .
Multiple U.S. officials tell ABC
News that preliminary information leads the US to believe there were " likely " no Americans aboard the flight .
What caused the Afriqiyah Airways flight from Johannesburg to crash is still not clear but Libyan authorities have discounted terrorism .
According to a statement by the airline ,
" Our flight 771 had an accident during landing at Tripoli International Airport , " the statement said .
" At this moment , we have no information concerning possible casualties or survivors .

Africa 's Air Safety Record
The flight was a connecting flight , it left Johannesburg for Tripoli and was then going to fly onward to London Gatwick .
Transit passengers were then due to fly on to Germany , France and Belgium with a few disembarking at Tripoli , South Afircan airport authorities said in a press conference .
" We express our sincere regret and sadness and on behalf of the airline as well we would like to express our condolences to the relatives and friends on flight 8U771 , " Nicky Knapp , spokesperson for ACSA , the South African company that manages its major airports , told reporters in Johannesburg today .
Libyan television showed pictures of emergency workers sifting through the debris of the plane .
Footage indicates that the plane virtually disintegrated with only a chunk of the tail intact .
Airbus issued a statement confirming it had manufactured the plane involved in the crash .
" Airbus will provide full technical assistance to the authorities responsible for the investigation into the accident , " it said .
Plane crashes are not uncommon in Africa U.S. and international aviation experts estimate that airplanes in Africa are 15 times more likely to crash on average than in North America .
A U.S. Government Accountability
Office report from June of last year highlighted the fact that only four countries in all of Africa have airport and airline safety standards meeting the requirements to receive the most favorable rating by the Federal Aviation Administration ; North African countries of Egypt and Morocco , the tiny island West African country of Cape Verde and South Africa make the cut .

The solar power plant planned for Arizona may be the biggest in the world
Nearly $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) in loan guarantees will be given to two companies to kick - start the US solar energy industry , President Barack Obama has announced .
One of the firms , Abengoa Solar , says that it is planning to build the largest solar power plant in the world in Arizona .
Mr Obama said the projects would provide more than 5,000 new jobs .
The Arizona plant should power 70,000 homes and cut carbon dioxide emissions .
The money will come from government stimulus funds designed to boost the economy during the recession .
Outlining the " Solana " project at Gila Bend near Phoenix , Abengoa said it would have an area of 1,900 acres , using thermal storage - equipped parabolic trough technology , with 280 MW of power output capacity .
According to the company 's website , 1,500 new jobs will be created during the plant 's construction with 100 positions for staff to maintain it .
' Aggressive '
The second company , Abound Solar Manufacturing , will manufacture state - of - the - art thin film solar panels , the first time anywhere that such technology has been used commercially , the BBC's Jane O'Brien reports from Washington .
Plants will be built in Colorado and Indiana , creating 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs , the Associated Press reports .
President Obama had promised during his election campaign for the White House to create manufacturing and construction jobs in the green power industry .
" We 're going to to keep competing aggressively to make sure the jobs and industries of the future are taking root right here in America , " he said on Saturday .
The renewable energy industry in the US faces tough competition from developers in China .
Mr Obama also acknowledged the loans would not be an instant solution .
Around 125,000 jobs were lost in the last month , the government reported .
Enlarge By Tim Dillon , USA TODAY Advil , Motrin , Voltaren , Cataflam , Vioxx and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause cardiac problems , a Danish study finds .
SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH
Healthy people who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve minor aches and pains may raise their risk of dying from heart - related problems , a Danish study finds .
The American Heart Association and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already warn people with heart disease to be cautious about taking NSAIDs , which include ibuprofen ( brand named Advil , Motrin ) and diclofenac .
The new study is the first to show the same kind of increased risk among people without cardiac problems , says a report in the July issue of Circulation : Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes , published online June 8 .
" Very few studies have been designed to answer the important question :
Do NSAIDs also increase the cardiovascular risk among healthy people who use these drugs for minor complaints ? " said lead author Dr. Emil L. Fosbol , a cardiologist at Gentofte University Hospital in Hellerup .
" This study is the first to confirm that the cardiovascular risk is indeed increased when healthy individuals use some of the drugs . "
The risks for different NSAIDs — found in an analysis of national medical records of more than 1 million Danes from 1997 to 2005 — varied widely .
Participants , whose average age was 39 , who used ibuprofen had a 29 % greater risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke , compared to those who took no NSAID .
Use of diclofenac ( Voltaren and Cataflam ) was associated with a 91 % higher risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases , while rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) use was associated with a 66 % increased risk .
But the study found no increased risk of cardiovascular problems — indeed , a slightly lower risk of death — associated with naproxen , sold over the counter with brand names including Aleve .
For people taking the largest doses , diclofenac was associated with a doubled risk of heart attack , and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) was associated with a threefold increased risk of heart attack .
Vioxx was taken off the U.S. market in 2004 because of a study finding high rates of heart attack and stroke .
" These findings are completely consistent with what we have found in patients with cardiovascular disease , " Dr. Michael E. Farkouh , a clinical cardiologist at Mount Sinai Cardiovascular Institute in New York City , said of the Danish study .
" Drugs that elevate blood pressure and are associated with a thrombotic ( artery - blocking ) effect can be harmful in patients who are otherwise healthy . "
The percentage increases in the study were large , but the absolute overall risk in otherwise healthy people was small , Farkouh said .
Nevertheless , " before you take any medication , you should consult with a physician , particularly these medications , " he said .
That warning applies especially to people who exercise regularly and are thus more likely to take an NSAID for muscle and joint pain , Farkouh said .
Regular use of an NSAID increases the risk not only of cardiovascular problems but also of bleeding , a known side effect of the medications , he said .
In fact , the Danish study found an increased incidence of major bleeding events , some fatal , from all NSAIDs except celecoxib ( Celebrex ) .
Celecoxib did not appear to raise the risk of coronary death or stroke either .
The Danish findings are consistent with a 2007 American Heart Association ( AHA ) scientific statement about the increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with NSAID use , said Dr. Elliott Antman , professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , lead author of that paper , in a statement issued Tuesday by the AHA .
" The recommendations we made were based on our best estimates from the existing pharmacological and biological research available at the time , " Antman said .
" I find this new study reassuring because it endorses the recommendations we made using a large body of actual clinical evidence . "
Antman 's advice for anyone taking an NSAID regularly is that " it is advisable to discuss with your physician why it was originally recommended or prescribed , whether you need to continue taking it , and at what dose . "
It may be wise to consider alternatives , the study authors and other experts said .
" The majority of studies have shown that naproxen has a safe cardiovascular risk profile and that ibuprofen in low doses ( 1200 mg and below per day ) also is safe in respect to the cardiovacular risk , " Fosbol said .

A group of Lower Nazareth Township residents has threatened to sue Nazareth Area School Board if plans go forward for a proposed solar field at the
.
The district hopes the solar farm will reduce utility costs .
But the
residents , whose backyards border the school property , say it would ruin the park - like setting of the neighborhood .
John Elston , who spoke at Monday night 's school board meeting , encouraged the board to find an alternate site , such as the detention pond where the field would not abut anyone ’s property .
He said residents also want a tree buffer increased from 15 to 75 feet so the residents do n't have to look at the solar panels .
Bob Stocklas accused the board of decreasing property values .
He said
are designed for commercial , not residential areas .
School Superintendent Victor Lesky said no decision has been made , and he organized a two - hour meeting July 13 for residents to ask questions and raise concerns about the project .
Director Darrell Crook said the project could bring “ tremendous savings ” to the school district and the residents .

Though “ discreet ” and “ discrete ” look and sound similar , the minor difference in spelling represents a major difference in definition .
Both stem from the Latin word “ discretus , ” meaning “ to separate , ” but one refers to being cautious , while the other refers to something that is individual and separate .
How to Use Discreet
An adjective , “ discreet ” means self - restrained , prudent , cautious , or tactful , and often is used in reference to speech .
It is something that is done under the radar , and is unlikely to get attention or cause offense .
It can be used to describe someone who is private and cautious , or who understands the consequence of sharing certain or private information .
We might ask if someone is discreet , meaning we can trust them to not share information we would prefer to keep private .
The noun forms are “ discretion ” and “ discreetness . ”
How to Use Discrete
Also an adjective , “ discrete ” means individual , detached , or separate .
It is often used less than “ discreet , ” and is generally more technical .
The noun form is “ discreteness . ”
Examples
Invisible hearing aids are becoming more popular among those who want to be discreet about their hearing loss :
In this sentence , “ discreet ” is used to indicate that those who are losing their hearing want to keep this information private , choosing options that are subtle and unobtrusive .
In this sentence , “ discreet ” is used to indicate that those who are losing their hearing want to keep this information private , choosing options that are subtle and unobtrusive .
The average person can hold seven discrete bits of information in his or her head at a time :
Here , “ discrete ” indicates that a person can remember seven different pieces of information , such as the seven digits that make up a phone number .

When the company made an effort to hire younger workers , many other applicants called this ageism , arguing they should focus on discrete variables apart from age :
In this example , “ discrete ” means variables that are separate from age , as job applicants argue that birth date should not trump other qualities .

To subtly let Emilio know that his time was running out during his speech , Clara discreetly cleared her throat :
In this example , Clara is clearing her throat in a way that is tactful and understated , letting Emilio know to finish his speech without alerting the rest of the audience .

When the man was talking loudly on his phone while ordering his coffee , the barista and I exchanged discrete glances of irritation :
In this sentence , “ discrete ” shows how the glances were relatively unnoticeable to the man in question , able to communicate annoyance without letting him know .

To avoid anyone figuring out he was Batman , Bruce Wayne had to be very discreet about his activities :
In this example , Bruce has to make sure that his connection to Batman is not noticeable and that any behavior related to his secret superhero identity is under - the - radar .

Electricity is composed of discrete particles of equal size :
This sentence uses “ discrete ” to indicate that the particles composing electricity are distinct and separate , even if they are the same size .

The clients appreciated Sharon ’s discretion , trusting her with their more sensitive information : Sharon ’s ability to be prudent and reserved makes her more valued to clients , who know that she will keep their information private .
How to Remember the Difference
It ’s no surprise that the two homonyms are the subject of so much confusion : they both emerged in the 14th century , but “ discrete ” fell out of common usage for about 200 years — though its spelling did n't .
Those writing “ discreet ” spelled it in a variety of ways , including “ discrete , ” “ discreet , ” “ dyscrete , ” and “ discreete . ”
The difference between the two spellings only became popularized in the 16th century , when both ways of spelling and meanings became more defined .
Remember the difference by thinking of the placement of the “ e”s in both .
Unlike in discreet , in discrete , they are separate , and “ discrete ” means separate or detached .
It 's Time to Bid Adieu to Windows XP SP2 Posted by Sean @ 12:29 GMT
Today 's the day — July 13th — Windows XP Service Pack 2 has reached its end of support .
After today , Microsoft will no longer publish updates for SP2 and that also includes Microsoft software such as Internet Explorer , Media Player and Outlook Express .
Our telemetry indicates that about 10 % to 11.5 % of our customer base runs XP Service Pack 2 .
The numbers drop off during the weekend , due to corporate machines running idle .
Windows XP SP3 numbers range from 50 % to 54 % .
Not bad , just about 10 % of our customers are facing end of support issues .
But what about our readership ?
Back in May , we asked : Does your organization still use Windows XP SP2 as its primary OS ?
Approximately 44 % answered yes .
There are still plenty of Service Pack 2 computers out there in the world .
While this is n't yet a critical problem , there will eventually be exploitable vulnerabilities that affect these computers .
It 's going to be an issue sooner or later .
We recommend applying today 's updates :
And then schedule an upgrade to XP Service Pack 3 which can be downloaded from Microsoft 's Download Center .
The Government 's new legislation designed to target head shops makes it a criminal offence to sell pipes or any other objects used to take controlled or psychoactive drugs .
The Psychotropic Substances Bill also makes it illegal to sell objects used to cultivate drugs by hydroponic means and allows for penalties of up to five years in prison and fines of € 5,000 upon conviction .
The main points of new legislation published today make it an offence to sell , supply or advertise hallucinogenic drugs previously sold in head shops .
Doctors , dentists , nurses , pharmacists , vets and other professions or businesses as deemed by the Minister for Justice will be exempt from its provisions .
Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern said the Bill is designed to deal with those selling psychotropic substances .
The new Bill also gives gardaí new powers to get court orders to prohibit named individuals from selling , displaying , or advertising psychoactive drugs and to close head shops for up to a year .
They can also search suspected head shops , seize and destroy psychoactive material and seek to have the costs borne by the owner .
The Minister said : ' I am pleased that the recent ban on the sale of substances , such as mephedrone , has had a very significant effect on the operations of head shops .
' However , I am conscious that further action is necessary to deal with the emergence of potentially dangerous new substances not covered by the ban .
' Accordingly , I am proposing the Criminal Justice ( Psychoactive Substances )
Bill to ensure that the criminal law and the gardaí can deal quickly and effectively with those who sell psychoactive substances for human consumption .
' The Bill is being drafted as a matter of priority and I look forward to publication and enactment of the Bill as soon as possible . '

Talking Heads Singer Sues Fla . Gov , Seeks $ 1 M for Song Use in Attack Ad
A former lead singer for Talking Heads has sued Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , contending that he used the group ’s 1985 “ Road to Nowhere ” song in an online attack ad against Marco Rubio without permission , reports the County Grind blog of the Broward - Palm Beach New Times .
He is represented by attorney Lawrence Iser , who sued and settled with Republican presidential candidate John McCain on behalf of Jackson Browne in 2008 for making unauthorized use of his signature song , “ Running on Empty . ”
Rubio is the likely GOP nominee for an open U.S. Senate seat to which Crist is seeking election as an independent .
The suit seeks $ 1 million in damages , reports the Associated Press .
“ Besides being theft , use of the song and my voice in a campaign ad implies that I , as writer and singer of the song , might have granted Crist permission to use it , and that I therefore endorse him and / or the Republican Party , of which he was a member until very , very recently , ” says frontman David Byrne in a lengthy Journal blog post about his lawsuit .
The articles do n’t include any comment from Crist .
The issue of ' the troops ' has , of course , long been used as a stick with which to beat Muslims , a disciplinary tool .
If you do n't support the troops , and if you 're at all vocal about this , the media has already signalled that it is ready to treat this as treasonous conduct - ' extremist ' , ' fanatic ' , etc .
So when you get a story that shows Muslims participating in rituals lionising the troops , as if it 's inherently newsworthy , the temptation might be to exhale with relief .
At last , there 's a story that does n't completely and outrageously vilify Muslims .
At last , there 's a news item that talks about Muslims which does n't terrorise people , driving them round the twist with impotent fury about mad mullahs on benefits , or bombers who can't be deported , etc .
The BBC has fulfilled its public service remit by balancing out the hysterical racist trash with an understated human interest story .
But it 's more problematic than that .
Such news items actually reinforce the racist hysteria by playing the game of ' good Muslim , bad Muslim ' .
It lays out the kind of behaviour that is required of Muslims in order that they might not be subject to ritual denunciation and interrogation .
It is in essence no different from the kind of antisemitic ideology that counterposed the good ' National Jew ' from the malevolent ' International Jew ' .
The response it nakedly invites us " they 're not all bad , then " , which is a racist response .
In my racism article , I mentioned polls that detected higher ' identification ' with Britain than among the population as a whole .
Most people do n't really give a damn about patriotism .
It has little relevance to their lives , does n't explain anything , does n't get them any extra income or Nectar card points , and does n't improve their sense 0f well - being .
During the World Cup , a minority start to indulge a certain amount of flag - waving , which an even smaller minority with a nationalist agenda try to hijack , salivating about the " passion and pride " on display - attributes that certainly become more evident , if less obviously laudible , the more Tetley 's bitter is consumed .
But otherwise it's a minority of bullies and bigots who actually take nationalism at all seriously .
So when a majority of Muslims express identification with the UK , you know there 's something up .
And it 's very obvious what this is .
Newspapers in this country have long used push polls among Muslims to provoke certain kinds of reply that could be used to monger hate and fear .
Politicians , and the scum British press , are constantly hectoring Muslims about their alleged failure to fit in , to buy into " British values " and so on .
So when some polling agency comes asking stupid questions , the right answer is whatever will subvert these attempts at demonisation .
Of course , Muslims should n't have to feel any more patriotic than I do in order to have the right to go about their business unmolested , but that 's not how it works here .
Obviously another aspect of the BBC 's warm - hearted little story is that while reinforcing the good Muslim - bad Muslim dichotomy , and the racist ideology underpinning it , it also whitewashes the armed forces - far from being a racist mercenary force , it is a modern , multicultural , democratic army that is out to work alongside the ordinary decent people of Afghanistan and protect them from the bad Muslims who are causing such trouble .
Which merely adds to the hypocritical perversity of such ostensible auntie- racism .
In entirely unrelated news , the results from last week 's poll on patriotism are as follows : 44.5 % of 596 readers say that patriotism can best be defined as " petty , property - obsessed egoism masquerading as social solidarity " .
In a distant second , 20.3 % say it is " a free gift with every four pack of Carlsberg " .
As I explained last week though , ' the markets ' would determine the result whoever you voted for .
So what we 're going to do is form a coalition between the remaining three answers , who have 34.2 % between them , and with the first - past - the - post system they form an outright majority .
Now , unfortunately the exigencies of forming a stable , governing definition in these uncertain times means that they may have to abandon some of their promises , so what 's going to happen is that the definition of patriotism will now be : " A vital means of ensuring integration and civic cohesion . "
Do n't blame anyone but yourselves .
You , the public , failed to give a clear answer , and we had to sort out the mess you left us with .
True story .
From a blog called " Hey Edmonton ! " ( hey , Hey Edmonton ! ) comes an update on Gilbert Brule .
No , nothing contract - related .
Quite the contrary , it 's not about how much money Brule is making but how much he 's giving away .
You may recall back in May that Brule received positive press for donating $ 10,000 to an Edmontonian infant named Maddox Flynn , a two - year - old boy who needed surgery in New York to address a condition known as " lymphatic cystic hydroma " .
A lymphatic cystic hydroma is n't the sort of condition you 'll see in the newspapers too often : basically , they 're small , soft , benign tumours that predominantly appear on the face and neck , crop up during pregnancy because of a blockage in the foetus 's lymphatic system , and are disfiguring but rarely life - threatening .
In Maddox 's case it led to worse than merely being disfigured : the lumps dominated the left side of his face and were so severe they impaired with breathing , with eating , with speaking , even with his sight .
The two surgeries required , both expensive and experimental , would run about $ 100,000 .
Additional funds would be required for any follow - up surgeries for cosmetic purposes or in case of complications .
A fundraising effort wound up with $ 160,000 , and Brule was a big part both of donating the money and in getting the case into the press so the rest would come .
Flynn completed his first surgery in May , and his second will follow next week .
There are always complications in this sort of thing but the first surgery went well and all concerned seem to be optimistic .
Certainly , Brule has already done his good deed for 2010 .
Saving a youngster 's life is n't the sort of good deed many of us can match .
But apparently he is n't satisfied and will be flying to New York to visit the young patient before he goes under the knife for the second time .
Brule and his girlfriend fly out today .
Listen .
I 'm a cynical so - and - so , you all know that .
So take it for what it 's worth when I say that I feel a swelling in my heart towards Gilbert Brule that just might be pride .
GOP Rep Franks : Obama 's treatment of BP was " arrogant "
Here 's another one that Dems will jump on to continue making the case that Joe Barton 's apology to BP represents a commonly held view among Republicans .
GOP Rep Trent Franks , in a quote buried in a Politico piece , appeared to say that Obama was " arrogant " in demanding the $ 20 billion escrow fund from BP :
" It 's my opinion that Mr. Barton and Mr. Price 's comments were more of a reaction to the arrogance in President Obama 's speech , where he said he was going to ' inform '
BP that they would set aside this separate compensation fund to be controlled by a third party , " said Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) .
" Under our laws and Constitution , the president does not possess the power or authority to make such an arrogant command to a private company . "
Franks is going further here than merely refusing to condemn Barton 's apology .
He 's basically offering a justification for it : Obama's " arrogance " in using the White House to leverage BP in order to hold it accountable for the disaster .
As the number of Republicans condemning Obama 's rough treatment of BP mounts , the easier it gets for Dems to argue that this represents a widely - held position within the GOP .
Oakland 's police chief is making some dire claims about what his force will and will not respond to if layoffs go as planned .
Chief Anthony Batts listed exactly 44 situations that his officers will no longer respond to and they include grand theft , burglary , car wrecks , identity theft and vandalism .
He says if you live and Oakland and one of the above happens to you , you need to let police know on - line .
Some 80 officers were to be let go at midnight last night if a last - minute deal was not reached .
That 's about ten percent of the work force .
" I came her e to build an organization , not downsize one , " said Batts , who was given the top job in October .
That deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. Tuesday .
Here 's a partial list :
burglary
theft
embezzlement
grand theft
grand theft:dog
identity theft
false information to peace officer
required to register as sex or arson offender
dump waste or offensive matter
discard appliance with lock
loud music
possess forged notes
pass fictitious check
obtain money by false voucher

Negotiations are going on at Oakland City Hall in the mayor 's office .
Batts said the 80 officers slated to be laid off - mostly new officers - are " pretty sad and pretty depressed , " and those feelings are shared by the Police Department as a whole .
The Oakland City Council voted June 25 to eliminate the positions to help close the city 's $ 32.5 million funding gap .
According to the city of Oakland , each of the 776 police officers currently employed at OPD costs around $ 188,000 per year .
Most of the officers who will be affected by the layoffs were on the streets of Oakland when Johannes Mehserle 's involuntary manslaughter conviction caused riots last Thursday .
The sticking point in negotiations appears to be job security .
The city council asked OPD officers to pay nine percent of their salary toward their pensions , which would save the city about $ 7.8 million toward a multi-million dollar deficit .
The police union agreed , as long as the city could promise no layoffs for three years .
No dice , says city council president Jane Brunner .
" We wish we could offer them a three - year no layoff protection we just can't financially .
It would be irresponsible of us , " Brunner said .
The city agreed to a one - year moratorium on layoffs , but it is not enough for the union .
The problem is money .
In the last five years , the police budget -- along with the fire department budget -- have amount to 75 percent of the general fund .
After years of largely sparing those departments the budget ax , now it appears there are few other places to cut .
These are the last hours of negotiation and Brunner is hopeful that the city and police will find some sort middle ground .
" It 's been very good conversation and not a whole lot of grandstanding . "
Brunner said .
" There 's actually real conversations .
Each side understands the problem , " she said .
For Supreme Court watchers , following Bilski has been like following the World Cup .
Productivity has fallen and ulcers have grown .
Later this morning , the Supreme Court is expected to finally deliver some relief with a landmark ruling .
At the Free Software Foundation we are welcoming Bilski watchers to a lunchtime party to reflect on the ruling .
Anti-software patent campaigners will either be rejoicing together with some bubbly and news that software patents have been limited , or be crying into their beer discussing plans for the next stage in the twenty - year campaign to bring some sanity to the world of software .
Either way , we 're happy for like - minded visitors to join us .
The Bilski decision is expected to be a milestone , for better or worse , in the decades - long effort to rid the software world of the harmful effects of software patents .
The FSF 's own End Software Patents ( ESP ) campaign has been focused on the Bilski case from its beginning , attempting to bring consideration to software patents in a case that was originally about business method patents .
ESP submitted a strong anti-software patent brief for the 2008 hearing of the In re Bilski case at the CAFC .
After the CAFC gave a relatively hopeful ruling , ESP started building its wiki to collect information and resources for all campaigns against software patents .
To many people 's surprise , the Supreme Court decided in 2009 to review the CAFC decision .
ESP again submitted a brief , highlighting the CAFC 's continued misreading of Diamond v. Diehr and the real harm being caused in the USA by software patents .
The launch of our 2010 film " Patent Absurdity : How software patents broke the system " ( http://patentabsurdity.com) also helped explain the history of software patents — and the problems they cause .
The film has been downloaded more than 100,000 times since its release and has inspired other anti-software patent campaigners to distribute the movie to top US patent policy makers .
Whatever the Supreme Court decides , it 's clear that this issue wo n't end anytime soon .
Congress is considering a patent reform bill , and the US government has been working to push its software patent laws to other countries through treaties like ACTA .
The Surpeme Court has kept us biting our nails since the November hearing .
Today is the last day for the court to publish opinions this term .
If you 'd like to sit on the edge of a seat in the FSF office with the rest of us , you 'd be very welcome .
The FSF office is at 51 Franklin Street , 5th Floor , in downtown Boston .

JAMIE CARRAGHER is confident star players Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres will be at Anfield next season .
The pair have both been the subject of speculation all summer following the Reds ’ failure to qualify for the Champions League and the departure of Rafael Benitez .
Some observers believe retaining their services is one of the first tasks facing new boss Roy Hodgson but Carragher expects them both to remain at Anfield .
The 32 - year - old said : “ I think there is a lot of talk about this but the people who say these things , a lot of them are doing this to create a bit of pressure around the club .
“ I do n’t think anyone knows these people personally to come out and say that .
“ I am sure they will still be involved at the club next season and if they are the aim for the club will be to get back into the Champions League once again . ”
Hodgson stated at his unveiling that his goal for next season is to get Liverpool back into the elite European competition .
Carragher added : “ We did n’t just miss out , we finished seventh .
That is a big disappointment .
“ If we could get back in there that would be a great achievement for the club and the manager .
“ It is going to be a tough season but if we keep the players we have got and get back to where we were a few years ago I am sure we will give everyone a run for their money . ”
Carragher is looking forward to working with veteran boss Hodgson , who led Fulham to the Europa League final last season .
“ I think it is a great appointment by the club .
I am sure we can move on from this and it will go well . ”

Daniel Gross of Slate poses the question : How do we punish BP ?
The options he suggests – boycotting BP products , charging for the cleanup , even nationalizing the company – are less than satisfying .
Here ’s another possibility : How about barring BP from the federal trough ?
According to USASpending.gov , BP has received more than $ 9 billion in defense contracts since 2000 .
Contracts with Veterans Affairs , Transportation , Commerce and other federal agencies total additional millions .
Pro Publica reports that the Environmental Protection Agency is considering a ban on BP getting government contracts :
Over the past 10 years , BP has paid tens of millions of dollars in fines and been implicated in four separate instances of criminal misconduct that could have prompted this far more serious action .
Until now , the company ’s executives and their lawyers have fended off such a penalty by promising that BP would change its ways .
That strategy may no longer work .
The EPA issued a statement saying it could issue a ban after reviewing “ the frequency and pattern of the incidents , corporate attitude both before and after the incidents , changes in policies , procedures , and practices . ”
A total ban would not only cancel company contracts , but would prevent BP from drilling on federal land , including offshore sites .
The EPA had already been in talks with BP before the spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Agency officials confirmed to Pro Publica that the talks were suspended after the Gulf disaster .

Expanding on the Jerusalem master plans of 2006 and 2008 , the Jerusalem Planning Committee of the Israeli Ministry of the Interior has released the text of a new ‘ master plan ’ which they are scheduled to approve in the coming weeks .
The plan includes the large - scale expulsion of Palestinians from East Jerusalem , to be replaced by Jewish neighborhoods and tourism centers .
Even areas that had been previously designated as ‘ green areas ’ , such as places like Ir David , in order to justify the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in those areas , have been re-designated as Jewish settlements in the new Jerusalem master plan .
The plan is subject to a public comment period of 60 days , after which it will go into effect and the Israeli government will implement all parts of the plan .
Impacted Palestinians have no say , however , as they are unrepresented in the Israeli government or planning process .
The new Jerusalem master plan flies in the face of previous tentative steps taken by the Israeli government toward a partial settlement freeze , instead vastly expanding Jewish settlements on Palestinian land .
The U.S. government had requested a settlement freeze last year , but then backed off from this request after the Israeli government refused to adhere .
Most of the planned development will take place in East Jerusalem , which is where the majority of Jerusalem ’s Palestinian residents live .
In addition , this area is east of the ‘ Green Line ’ , which was the border set between Israel and Palestine in 1967 .
Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups point out that this planned expansion violates international law and signed agreements with the Palestinians , as well as the ‘ road map ’ , prepared as part of the peace process in 2000 .
On 6 April 2009 , an earthquake registering 6.3 on the moment magnitude scale hit the town of L'Aquila in Abruzzo , Italy .
This was a tragedy , and hundreds of people died .
It would be great if we could have firm predictions about every risk whose rare but tragic outcome cannot be accurately predicted , whether it is a flu outbreak , a murder , an illness , or an earthquake .
Most of us recognise that this is impossible .
But some find it harder to accept .
The L'Aquila prosecutor 's office has now leapt into action .
It has a Commissione Grandi Rischi after all – a " Commission on Big Risks " – and it 's full of seismologists .
If these people can't predict an earthquake , then what 's the point of them ?
And so these seismologists are now being indicted and investigated for manslaughter , on account of their failure to warn the population that an earthquake was coming .
You can join various fellows of various royal societies in protesting about this case at qurl.com / quake .
Clearly the Italian government would rather be informed by scientists who are happier to throw caution to the wind and make claims in excess of the evidence .
Oddly enough , though , that did actually happen , in the week before the earthquake .
Gioacchino Giuliani is a laboratory technician who became convinced that he was able to predict earthquakes by measuring the emission of radon from the ground .
He ignored the doubts of seismologists – he has never published his theories or evidence in an academic journal – and invested in several measuring devices to let him make his predictions .
Shortly before the earthquake struck , Giuliani became convinced something serious was coming .
He began desperately trying to warn the public , even posting a video on YouTube explaining his theory , and warning people to evacuate their houses urgently .
Vans loaded with loudspeakers were driven around the town to spread the warning .
Giuliani tried in vain to persuade the mayor that he was right .
But they did not heed this warning : instead , the local government reported him to the police for spreading unnecessary panic and alarm , forced him to remove his warnings from the internet , and forbade him from telling anyone anything about the coming earthquake .
In reality , of course , Giuliani made a lucky guess ( and he was out by 55 km ) .
Nothing has changed , and there is still no reliable or validated way to predict an earthquake .
Because of this , seismologists around the world are united in explaining that the best way to protect your population is not through an impossible early warning system , but rather by investing in preparedness , to mitigate against the damage done by one rare , unpredictable , horrific outcome .
So you use seismic hazard maps to reliably work out where the risk is greatest , rather than when .
You change the specifications in your building code so homes are less likely to collapse and crush people to death .
You insist on retrospective modifications to existing structures .
You make sure your population is educated in what to do when the worst happens , and you prepare your emergency services with enduring supplies of the appropriate equipment .
If , in a political emergency , you find you have failed to do all this to universal satisfaction : then you can charge some scientists with manslaughter .
But ideally this should be a last resort .
Series : Foreclosure Crisis How Banks and Government Fail Homeowners
Buried in the massive financial regulation overhaul that President Barack Obama signed today , two provisions force the Treasury Department to increase the transparency of its loan modification program .
One measure takes aim at the secret formula the government developed to test homeowners ’ eligibility for a modification .
Treasury will now have to post its details online .
The other measure requires that the government divulge far more data from the program .
Consumer advocates have long criticized the lack of transparency in the program and the loan modification process .
That lack of transparency is particularly critical , they say , because the banks and other companies that service mortgages frequently make errors .
As we ’ve reported , in the worst cases those mistakes lead to foreclosure .
Many homeowners are wrongly denied modifications “ because of the lack of transparency in the program , ” said Alys Cohen , an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center .
The new measures will help homeowners and advocates challenge errors by mortgage servicers , she said .
At the center of the loan modification program is a complicated — and until now , secret — formula called a “ net present value ” ( NPV ) calculation .
The formula , which was developed by the Treasury Department and other government agencies , determines whether modifying a homeowner ’s loan under the program is likely to be more profitable than a foreclosure .
The servicer is required to run the formula for each homeowner who applies for a modification .
“ A homeowner ’s fate hinges on the NPV score , so the American Dream is literally at stake here , ” said Rep. Mike Quigley , D - Ill. , who sponsored the amendment to add the measure to the bill .
Servicers often run the formula incorrectly .
Fifteen of the largest 20 servicers in the program have not followed “ various aspects ” of its rules concerning the formula , according to the Government Accountability Office .
Problems with servicers ’ use of the formula have added to the serious delays that homeowners have experienced .
Earlier this year , Treasury began requiring that servicers recheck denials based on the formula .
As we detailed last year , consumer advocates have criticized the Treasury for keeping the formula secret .
The new rule requires the Treasury to open up its black box .
Treasury must publish the “ methodology and computer model ” on the Internet , according to the new law .
Along with divulging the formula , the Treasury must provide a public “ net present value ” calculator so homeowners can run their own test to see if they qualify for a loan modification .
For homeowners who are denied based on the formula , the law also requires that servicers provide them with certain figures used in the calculation , such as the borrowers ’ income , so they can make sure the information is correct .
Rep .
Quigley said that , based on a recent meeting with Treasury officials , he is hopeful the new measures could be in place by the end of the summer .
The bill also beefs up the reporting requirements for the program .
For the first time , the Treasury Department will be required to release individual data on homeowners involved in the program .
Currently , servicers report around 150 different variables ( PDF ) for each homeowner , ranging from the credit score to the property valuation , but Treasury releases only a fraction of the information in its monthly reports .
Now , Treasury will be required to release this information , minus the parts it withholds to protect homeowner privacy .
ProPublica has been waiting for over a year to get this data , which we requested under the Freedom of Information Act .
Advocates and researchers have also been pressing for it , saying it ’s necessary for independent review of the program , including a fair - lending analysis .
“ By the time we get this data , which we have been asking for since the inception of the program , the program is already going to be set in stone , ” said Julia Gordon , senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending .
Gordon said the data will nonetheless be useful for a “ historical ” evaluation of the program and for policy makers looking to develop future foreclosure - relief efforts .
( Disclosure :
The center receives funding from the Sandler Foundation , the principal funder of ProPublica . )
Also , servicers will be required to submit monthly reports to Treasury detailing the number of modification applications they receive , process , approve and deny .
This month , Treasury began reporting the fate of the 539,000 homeowners who'd been rejected by the eight largest servicers , but the bill requires it to collect and share more information about applications to the program , such as how many homeowners have applied and are waiting for an answer .
Rep. Doris Matsui , D - Calif. , proposed the reporting requirements as an amendment to the House bill .
She said her constituency in Sacramento has been struggling with foreclosures .
“ The Making Home Affordable Program holds the potential to greatly reduce these figures , but without accountability , the lenders have failed to do so , ” Matsui told ProPublica .
The robot man is the successor to Sorina 1 , which was created in 2008 and " was able to read special texts , " according to the Islamic Republic News Agency press release .
The problem was that the garbage collector is required to traverse mutable arrays of pointers ( " boxed arrays " ) looking for pointers to data that might be ready to deallocate .
Boxed , mutable arrays are the main mechanism for implementing a hashtable , so that particular structure showed up the GC traversal issue .
This is common to many languages .
The symptom is excessive garbage collection ( up to 95 % of time spent in GC ) .
The fix was to implement " card marking " in the GC for mutable arrays of pointers , which occured in late 2009 .
You should n't see excessive GC when using mutable arrays of pointers in Haskell now .
On the simple benchmarks , hashtable insertion for large hashes improved by 10x .
Note that the GC walking issue does n't affect purely functional structures , nor unboxed arrays ( like most data parallel arrays , or vector - like arrays , in Haskell .
Nor does it affect hashtables stored on the C heap ( like judy ) .
Meaning that it did n't affect day - to - day Haskellers not using imperative hash tables .
If you are using hashtables in Haskell , you should n't observe any issue now .
Here , for example , is a simple hashtable program that inserts 10 million ints into a hash .
I 'll do the benchmarking , since the original citation does n't present any code or benchmarks .
import Control .
Monad import qualified Data .
HashTable as H import System .
Environment main = do [ size ] <- fmap ( fmap read ) getArgs m <- H.new ( == ) H.hashInt forM_ [ 1..size ] $
-> H.insert m n n v <- H.lookup m 100 print v
With GHC 6.10.2 , before the fix , inserting 10 M ints :
$ time ./A 10000000 +RTS -s ... 47s .
With GHC 6.13 , after the fix :
. /A 10000000 +RTS -s ... 8s
Increasing the default heap area :
./A +RTS -s - A2G ... 2.3s
Avoiding hashtables and using an IntMap :
import Control .
Monad import Data .
List import qualified Data .
IntMap as I import System .
Environment main = do [ size ] <- fmap ( fmap read ) getArgs let k = foldl ' ( \m n -> I.insert n n m ) I.empty [ 1..size ] print $ I.lookup 100 k
And we get :
$ time ./A 10000000 +RTS -s ./A 10000000 +RTS -s 6s
Or , alternatively , using a judy array ( which is a Haskell wrapper calling C code through the foreign - function interface ) :
import Control .
Monad import Data .
List import System .
Environment import qualified Data.Judy as J main = do [ size ] <- fmap ( fmap read ) getArgs j <- J.new :: IO ( J.JudyL Int ) forM_ [ 1..size ] $
-> J.insert ( fromIntegral n ) n j print =<< J.lookup 100 j
Running this ,
$ time ./A 10000000 +RTS -s ... 2.1s
So , as you can see , the GC issue with hashtables is fixed , and there have always been other libraries and data structures which were perfectly suitable .
In summary , this is a non-issue .
Note : as of 2013 , you should probably just use the hashtables package , which supports a range of mutable hashtables natively .
Today is the first of July and that means that Starbucks 's no-charge , registration - less and limitation - free Wi-Fi initiative officially goes live at all U.S. and Canadian retail stores .
Starbucks first revealed the news a little more than two weeks ago .
CEO Howard Schultz also announced that the company is working on its own Starbucks Digital Network in partnership with Yahoo .
The company is focused on introducing a seamless and entertaining web experience for all mobile devices , including the iPad .
Content from premium partners like The Wall Street Journal will play a huge role in the Starbucks Digital Network , offering customers both a reason to dive into the Journal and sip on another latte .
It 's a smart marketing move that will drive business and help finance the Wi-Fi initiative .
Given that many of us at Mashable write part - time in coffee shops , we 're excited about Starbucks 's restriction - free approach to offering free wireless Internet access .
If you 're out and about at a Starbucks store today , let us know what you think of the free Wi-Fi .

Most of us will be all too familiar with the consequences of night of heavy drinking .
But alcohol ’s effects on our heads go well beyond a mere hangover .
The brain suffers too .
A penchant for incoherent slurring aside , alcohol abusers tend to show problems with their spatial skills , short - term memory , impulse control and ability to make decisions or prioritise tasks .
Many of these skills are heavily influenced by a part of the brain called the hippocampus .
Now , Michael Taffe and researchers from the Scripps Research Institute have shown how binge - drinking during adolescence can cause lasting damage to this vital area .
The hippocampus is one of only two parts of the brain that clearly produces new neurons throughout adult life .
While other areas must make do with the set they had at birth , the hippocampus continually churns out a fresh supply .
This process may be important for learning and memory but it ’s seriously hampered by alcohol .
Taffe found that not only does heavy boozing kill off the hippocampus ’s neurons , it also weakens its ability to produce reinforcements .
Much like natural history documentaries and martial arts , Taffe ’s research was inspired by the antics of drunken monkeys .
Taffe gave seven adolescent rhesus macaques a tangy citrus alcoholic drink , which increased in strength from 1 % to 6 % alcohol over 40 days .
Having established their alcohol preferences , he allowed four monkeys to stick with the strong cocktail for an hour a day over the next 11 months .
The other three went back to a non-alcoholic version of the tangy beverage .
For the study ’s final two months , all of the monkeys went tee - total .
The blood alcohol limits of the four binge - drinkers clearly showed that they were knocking back their tipples .
If they ’d been humans , they would probably have been drunk , and certainly well over the legal limit for driving .
And their brains revealed more worrying signs of damage .
Chitra Mandyam , who collaborated on the study , found that regular chugs of the demon drink severely slashed the numbers of neural stem cells in the monkeys ’ hippocampi .
These are the cells responsible for churning out fresh neurons .
With alcohol cutting their numbers and compromising their ability to divide into more mature cell types , the monkeys ’ production of hippocampal neurons more than halved in the course of 11 months .
Even after two months of complete abstinence , Taffe found that each monkey ’s hippocampus had fewer traces of fresh , immature neurons .
Worse still , he found signs that the existing supply had started to degenerate .
By comparison , the tee - total trio had a healthy turnover of new hippocampal neurons and no detectable sign of neural death .
Studies with rats and mice have hinted at the same effect , but monkeys provide a far deeper understanding of the alcoholic brain .
They ’re incredibly similar to us , not just in terms of their mental skills , but also in the way that their hippocampuses produce new neurons , their lengthier window of adolescence , and the fact that they ’ll happily drink alcohol to the point of drunkenness .
If the same thing happens in humans , it suggests that alcoholism starts to wreak damage in the brain after a relatively short amount of time .
It starts to kill off the hippocampus ’s neurons while nixing its ability to make more .
This double - whammy could explain many of the mental problems that regular binge - drinkers experience .
Most intriguingly of all , the turnover of neurons in the hippocampus affects our learning and memory skill , and Taffe suggests that problems with this process could help to explain alcohol ’s addictive side .

Darren Aronofsky ’s Black Swan has been chosen to open the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1 in what must be déjà vu for the director who took home the top Golden Lion prize from the festival two years ago with Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler .
To coincide with the announcement , Fox Searchlight has released the first two images of Natalie Portman as Nina in her hauntingly beautiful Black Swan ballerina attire .
In the film , her dancing skills will be challenged by a new upstart dancer played by Mila Kunis .
It promises to be a “ thrilling and at times terrifying journey through the psyche of a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly perfect . ”
Black Swan also stars Vincent Cassel , Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder .
Check out the first look images of Nina as the swan queen below .
How I would re-design Facebook , Twitter , Brizzly , etc .
by phil on Saturday Jun 19 , 2010 11:47 PM
The sad thing about Twitter and other social update networks these days is that they become less useful as they keep growing .
Most of my friends and I can remember a short - lived golden age , when it was just a few of us on these networks , and everybody updated , and everybody read everybody 's updates .
Now , there 's too many updates from people who are unimportant ( but not unimportant enough to unfollow ) .
And to make matters worse , everybody 's scattered over a slew of networks , and it's hard to keep up with all of them .
And so I would like to propose a design change to the way that feeds are presented .
What you do is only show the most recent update from a user :
The above example is an exaggeration , but I applied it to a snapshot of my Tweets and got these results :
Or even better , what if a site could combine all my social feeds , and make sure that I only see the most recent update from a person across all their networks .
So if Lauren Ipsum updates her Facebook , but then checks - in on Foursquare or Gowalla , I should only see her check - in .
I applied this filter to all my networks and got this result :
So you take a user 's activity and collapse it into one item .
You could also include an expand button , to show their previous activities that you might have missed .
This design turns a stream of updates into more of a dashboard .
I was inspired by the way that Gowalla is designed , where I can , at - a - glance see where everybody has checked - in .
While I think Facebook and Twitter are too large to make such a radical re-design of their user flow , I think an upstart 3rd - party client like Brizzly could fill this space .
If someone came up with a site that organized my networks like this , I would sign - up immediately and tell all my friends .
Response to some common questions :
What about lists ?
I was initially excited about lists when they came out , but I have since stopped using them .
You still have the loud - friend problem , and it does n't give you that simple bird 's eye - view .
I go to these networks so I can , at a glance , see what my friends have been up to , with one or two clicks .
Also , I have trouble managing lists , because as I add new friends , I forget whether or not they 're on the " good " list .
And so I have to re-check , often going onto twitter.com ( which I hate ) , since many 3rd - party clients do not support the Twitter lists API yet ( or if they do , it 's half - assed ) .
Overall , I just do n't find them convenient , and I do n't know of too many people who derive much value from them .
Why do n't you just unfollow these people ?
That 's not how social networks work in the real world .
You have people on a spectrum of being very important to very unimportant that you follow .
And I want to see the important people without having to unfollow the only so - so important people .
Plus , the act of unfollowing requires work .
It 's like asking people to throw out all the items in their house that they do n't really need .
It 's impossible , and I believe that for most social network users , their friends lists are effectively monotonically increasing , until it gets too large that they hate the network , and then they just abandon it completely and start over somewhere else .
How would a " show more " feature work ?
I was introduced on Y Combinator to FriendBinder which has an attempt at grouping enabled .
The numbers with the arrows indicate how many " more " updates that person has :
Would n't a " show more " functionality get unwieldy ?
I did n't explore the details too much about the " show more " feature .
Would you list a count of the " unread items " from friends ?
Or would you need a slider that says " Show updates from the last 48 hours ? "
Then , would you need to couple this with some algorithm that bubbled up to the top the friends that you clicked " show more " on frequently ?
I 'm not sure about the answers to all these questions , so I 'll leave up to developers to figure it out .
What do you mean Phil ?
Are you trying to say I tweet too much ??
I 'm naturally inclined to update more often , but because I know about the loud - friend problem , I self - censor myself all - too - often .
If I knew people had a " Last Update " filter , then I would n't feel as guilty .

You put a lot of time into this post !
Enjoy your weekend .

Great concept .
Really wish someone would make this happen .
Tom said on June 20 , 2010 3:26 AM :
Hmmm , not quite sure if this realy helps .
Just look at your first and your last picture , they are nearly the same .
Even after collapsing all your friends you end up with 120 of them .
I think it 's an intrinsic ( not quite sure if spelling is right ; ) ) problem when using social networking that you can only get rid of by having less friends ( no option ) .
Maybe a relevance filter would be the right hint .
Another thing you pointed out could also help .
There are some friends on twitter that write things that i do n't want to read all the time .
But there 's no option to blind them out unless i completely unfollow them ( which i do n't want to do ) .
Nice idea , though .
Thanx for sharing it .
Thomas Martin said on June 20 , 2010 3:27 AM :
I most definitely would use a service like this , and have more than once thought about creating a third party application to do such a thing .
HCL said on June 20 , 2010 3:33 AM :
" So if Lauren Ipsum updates her Facebook , but then checks - in on Foursquare "
That in fact is a problem .
I might not be interested in the Foursquare - check - in information ( I myself rarely do ) but I do want to see the facebook update !
I would like to have something like in FB where you can " hide " certain applications , so I dont see anybodys tweets created by Foursquare .
… just my 5ct :)
nice , but said on June 20 , 2010 3:37 AM :
Great post , great idea , let down only by the grammar in the first image
' How my twitter stream looks like '
should be
' how my twitter stream looks '
OR
' what my twitter stream looks like '
Anyway , great idea , hope someone applies this .
vicky said on June 20 , 2010 4:18 AM :
there is already a way to do this using lists for Twitter .
try Listorious , either you can search for lists of people depending on your interests , or else sign up and make your own lists to follow

matthew said on June 20 , 2010 4:19 AM :
Why not use a more robust twitter client like HootSuit or TweetDeck .
Both are designed to organize your feed better .
Or start using Lists ?
I dont think the design elements you 'd like to see about are inherent problems within in the Twitter service design and are pretty easily done in an App or AIR tool that used the Twitter APIs .
This looks more like a new opportunity for a new kind of Twitter app than a design flaw .
There are a lot of different kinds of twitter users ( some of us keep very small networks and closed loops ; some of us want to follow a large number of people ; some use Twitter as a high - volume broadcast tool )
The genius of Twitter to me is that the service they offer will work for all those use cases and that the trick is designing an application on top of their API that customizes the flow of data into the right format .
Love the work you did .
Now find a developer to build it !

Like the idea of only the freshest tweets .
There is still the use of lists to constrain the flow of information however .
Equally we are in the realms of Dunbar here - are we fully connected to anymore than 150 folk in reality .
I still try to live by Annabel Bentley 's approach when she said that she uses Twitter like a radio - turning it on and off .
Much the same I wod suspect for other web based utilities

Do you have 500 friends and contacts who have something important to say ?
Just do n't follow so many people .

Good news - it does already exist !
Go and download the Reportage iPhone app and it will make you navigate by individual .
It is not 100 % what you propose about but it is at least 90 % .
I would like to see this idea developed further .
It would be nice to see what other things you could apply through this line of thinking .
Rian said on June 20 , 2010 6:15 AM :
Nice post .
I think the solution you came up with speaks to the need for having filters on Twitter .
However , I do n’t think “ freshest tweet ” is the right filter .
The problem is not that I do n’t want to see older tweets by someone .
The problem is that I do n’t want to see tweets I ’m not interested in .
For example , I might be interested in the article links someone posts , but I ’m not interested in the fact that they just checked in at a restaurant 5,000 miles from where I live , or the details of their child ’s volleyball game .
What I need is the ability to be selective about the tweets I see from a specific user .
I need to ability to filter out tweets that include the terms “ 4sq ” , or “ gowal ” , or “ volleyball . ”
And I need the ability to set this at a global level or at a specific user level .

My current solution is to ignore / stop following people who post too much .
If your design were implemented I could continue following these people and not have them flooding my update feed .
Thank you !!!
I hope to use this design somewhere somehow very soon !
Ruth said on June 20 , 2010 9:41 AM :
This is why Twitter gave us lists ( or rather , why clients gave us lists and then Twitter picked up on the idea ) .
If you can't unfriend the people you do n't care about , just list the people you do .
I have a Tweetdeck list that 's titled " People I Care About . "
Tweetdeck also lets you hide certain kinds of posts -- i.e. Foursquare - - with its global features .
I think you 're trying to build a solution for a problem that does n't exist unless you use the basic , original Twitter web instead of using a client or even using the features that Twitter web managed to come up with after clients did them first .
It 's good news for you , I suggest you start creating lists and / or use a desktop client !
Or just unfollow .
Problem solved .

winternett said on June 20 , 2010 9:54 AM :
Facebook / Twitter should have a simple " minimize " post function that makes the updates from users you normally pay less attention to [ in a smaller font ] that can be displayed [ in smaller font but still among ] the posts you read most .
It could be a selector option right next to each post next to your time - line with levels " 1 - 3 " for each poster which corresponds to Larger font sizes to Smaller font sizes for posts in a time - line view that gets saved for every account in a table that is used to filter each individual user 's time - line .
Might require more resources computing wise , but at least that way you could still see everyone 's posts .
Long live JQuery !

Karl Sakas said on June 20 , 2010 11:58 AM :
I like the idea of collapsing recent updates and de-duplicating content .
There are some people where I want to see all of their updates -- I use tailored lists to narrow the incoming flood of tweets .

Chris Wetherell said on June 20 , 2010 2:23 PM :
I like this idea .
In Google Reader we 'd always wanted to play with a last updated stream for feeds as well .
For those whom recency trumps completeness in their reading style I think it would work well as a view .
I suspect that a view optimized for a reading style where nothing can be missed is still needed , tho .
In this new view , we might find that high - volume accounts would always be pegged near the top .
People who followed lots of high - volume accounts then might only ever see those .
For some this still might be preferable to seeing all of those messages at once in a column .

Philip Dhingra said on June 20 , 2010 4:00 PM :
Thanks for the comments Chris .
Brizzly is my starting point for social networks right now .
A big picture idea that 's been developing is whether this just becomes an arms race , with social networks becoming more and more busy and our filters to organize them more and more convoluted .
In which case , Facebook 's voodoo " Top News " +
Mute - feature , becomes the optimal system , where the engineers just keep fiddling with their Top News algorithm as social network patterns change .
You 're right , in the " Last Update " filter , there might be a problem with the most vocal people just getting bumped up , which means every time you go to your dashboard , at the top you always see the same 3 - 10 loud friends .
A stream - mode , on the other hand , may shake things up a little more .
It 's hard to tell , though , without living with a " Last Update " filter for a couple weeks .
One way to mitigate this is to allow users to hit a " bump to top " button , which makes sure a particular user always stays on the surface , and so your feed is like two layers ( oil and water ) with the manually bumped people on one layer above .
This would be more convenient than Muting .
I have a couple problems with Mute .
On Twitter , muting is too close to unfollowing , so it seems redundant in a 3rd - party client to have that .
On Facebook , it makes a little more sense , because it 's often that you want to maintain access to someone 's profile but you do n't want to see their updates cluttering your feed .
With a " bump to top " button , if you get tired of seeing someone always pegged at the top , you can just " un- bump , " and down they go to the cheap seats .
However , again , I wonder if this just contributes to the arms race , and is only a temporary solution , or requires too much management .
For example , do people really want to do what is essentially upvoting and downvoting people , just for a little organizational improvement ?
In which case , Facebook 's attitude of " Look , we 'll take care of it " works better .
Ryan Humenick said on June 20 , 2010 4:34 PM :
@ Chris & @ Phil
There are numerous ways to overcome the high - volume feed problem with a product like Google Reader , Twitter , or whathaveyou .
One of the easier to implement methods would be to rate your friends / feeds based on how important they are / how often you want to see them , even if they do n't post often .
Then high - volume , low - or - un - rated feeds are cut back , or grouped into one most recent post like Phil suggested .
High - rated feeds could be weighted to the top , but you may not necessarily want your top friends list pegged to the top , unless it 's collapsable & new updates are reloaded to gradually uncollapse it ….
Additionally , you can record the user 's login times to ensure that new posts since the user last checked are given a higher position .
For instance , someone you " actually care about " may be on the other side of the globe and always post when you 're fast asleep and you often miss their posts completely with the current system .
You may also be able to detect a pattern of this happening by comparing their log - in history against the timing of new posts in the feeds they follow .
Of course , some of their posts may no longer be timely when you wakeup ...
So , like FriendFeed , I expect future services will use known data about users ' previous interactions with content to quickly rate that content to automatically determine it 's ranking to be displayed to others and what specific users it has more value to ( based on their history / profile ) , irrespective of the content being physically being " dugg " / voted up or down .
This should be especially easy for a product like Google Reader , and somewhat more difficult for microblogged content .
( Micro ) blogged Content Factors like : link click - throughs , time between link click - throughs ( assuming they read immediately and do n't open many links before reading ) , Retweets , followers and who they follow in common , mouseover content , click on non-link content in tweet ? , click - through to author 's profile rather than link ? , # of replies to author , # of comments , prefect link & determine relevance of content to user …
One great concern I have had for sometime about the current state of the social web is it 's over - emphasis in what 's popular , which I fear maybe homogenizing us rather than allowing us to spread and differentiate ourselves because it is just easier to have a list of " Most viewed articles " rather than " Most relevant / interesting to you " for each visitor , which may have never even visited the site before ...
Philip Dhingra said on June 20 , 2010 4:47 PM :
Hi Ryan , in response to your last paragraph , I could n't agree more .
I think this is an inevitable consequence of the site operators trying to explode their user - counts .
Facebook and Twitter are all gunning for an IPO by making their networks as buzzy as possible .
I was shown a refreshing example , though , in the case of Flickr , which already has the grouping functionality I mention !
And then I thought , well , that makes more sense for Flickr .
Because on Flickr , it is n't about spamming the most photos out there , or trying to maximize your follower count .
It 's about relevant and meaningful social interactions with the web ( and photography ) .
Which I think speaks to Flickr 's enduring value among a sphere of otherwise buzzword - heavy networks .
Ryan Humenick said on June 20 , 2010 4:58 PM :
@ Phil
Reading your comment about Flickr , led me to think about how I use both Flickr and Twitter to favorite what I find interesting .
By using Twitter to login to a website , that website may be able to analyze ( or a service may be able to analyze for that site ) the visitor 's favorite history and get some idea of what they find interesting to provide them with a custom recommendation of what is " Most relevant / interesting " to them on the site .

" By Sheer Pluck " , by George Alfred Henty , is set in Africa and features a sympathetic character patronizing Africans as " just like children " and declaring , " the intelligence of an average negro is about equal to that of a European child of ten years old ...
Left alone to their own devices they retrograde into a state little above their native savagery . "
Over the last decade , Art Robinson 's homeschool curriculum business has sold thousands of copies of the book .
Arthur Robinson has carved out a niche selling a Christian home schooling curriculum developed by his late wife , who according to Robinson compiled it curriculum from material culled from Christian homeschooling curricula published from Bob Jones University , the A Beka Book series , and other sources .
The Robinson Self Teaching Curriculum includes , as a reference for students , a 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica and a 1611 King James Version of the Bible which " is the foundational book of the Curriculum . "
As a 2001 article in The American Spectator described ,
[ Art Robinson 's ] family members have developed a home school curriculum consisting of over 250 books - among them the 30,000 - page 1911 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica — which the youngsters took turns scanning into computers .
The curriculum was transferred to 22 compact discs , which are sold in a box for $ 195 .
Over four years , 20,000 sets have been sold .
More recently , with typical single - mindedness , Robinson tracked down all 99 historical novels by the Edwardian writer G. A. Henty , and they in turn were optically scanned .
Three thousand Henty sets ( 6 CD'S ) were shipped in the first year .
They retail for $ 99 .
Here 's what Art Robinson 's Home Schooling Curriculum web site has to say about George Alfred Henty 's books :
Our initial printing emphasizes the wonderful collection of historical novels written by G. A. Henty .
While some of these books have been in print , two - thirds of them have been out of print and generally unavailable to home school readers .
G. A . Henty wrote at a time when the teaching of a deep Christian faith , high moral character , sound ethical principles , a strong work ethic , simple personal humility , and self - confidence based on real accomplishments were considered essential to the education of each young person .
This is in sharp contrast to today 's tax - financed schools where these values are deliberately excluded .
The Henty books provide training in history and in many of the highest aspects of human character , while holding the attention of the reader with tales of adventure written by a master story teller .
Not only do Henty 's heroes serve as excellent examples to people of all ages , his own vocabulary , grammar , and literary skills serve as outstanding examples to young writers , readers , and speakers of the English language .
In learning to write , as in learning to speak , the examples that children follow are the most important factors in their accomplishments .
American young people should read not a few Henty books , but all 99 of them .
Taken together , they constitute a superb course in world history and an education in some of the the highest aspects of human behavior in the heroes - and in some of the lowest aspects in the villains .
According to a PBS description of Henty 's numerous formulaic 19th Century novels geared towards adolescent boys , " Henty 's books are notable for their hearty imperialism , undisguised racism , and jingoistic patriotism . "
In his 1884 novel " By Sheer Pluck , " in a chapter titled " The Dark Continent " Alfred George Henty wrote ,
" the intelligence of an average negro is about equal to that of a European child of ten years old .
A few , a very few , go beyond this , but these are exceptions ...
Living among white men , their imitative faculties enable them to acquire a considerable amount of civilization .
Left alone to their own devices they retrograde into a state little above their native savagery . "
Signatory to A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism , a 2001 statement , from the creationist Discovery Institute , that challenges the Theory of Evolution , Art Robinson in 1986 co-authored with Dr. Gary North a book on how to survive nuclear war titled , Fighting Chance : Ten Feet To Survival .
The book advocated bringing back the so - called " Duck and Cover " civil defense approach promoted by the US government civil defense film " Duck and Cover " shown in US schools to schoolchildren in the 1950's and 1960's .
Gary North , a leading Christian Reconstructionist theologian , prolific author , and former Congressional staffer for Texas Congressman Ron Paul ( who has endorsed Art Robinson 's congressional campaign . )
In a November 23 , 2002 post at the web site LouRockwell.com , North described how Robinson had purchased an industrial printing press to print hard cover copies of the G. A. Henty boys ' novel series :
My friend Art Robinson , a scientist and the publisher of the Access to Energy newsletter , recently bought a used $ 3 million printing press and support equipment for about three cents on the dollar at an auction .
The owner had gone out of business .
There were few bidders for that press in a recession year .
Robinson uses it to publish a series of over a hundred boys ’ novels , based on world history , written in the 19th century by G. A. Henty .
Robinson had assembled a large mailing list of potential customers who had already bought all of Henty ’s books on Robinson ’s Henty CD - ROM for $ 99 – a terrific deal .
http://www.robinsoncurriculum.com
Now parents and grandparents can buy the hardbacks .
Gary North is a protege ' of founder of the Christian Reconstructionism movement founder Rousas J. Rushdoony .
In 1992 Rushdoony spoke at the inaugural event of the U.S. Taxpayers Party , later re-branded as the Constitution Party .
In 2008 Ron Paul endorsed the Constitution Party candidate for president of the United States , and current Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul keynoted a Minnesota Constitution Party rally in April 2009 .
Rousas Rushdoony advocated executing by stoning homosexuals , adulterers , and women who have intercourse before marriage , wanted to reimpose slavery , claimed that African - American slaves were lucky , was a Holocaust denier and a creationist , and maintained that the Sun rotates around the Earth .
Arthur Robinson 's homeschooling curriculum , for " parents concerned about socialism in the public schools , " contains several references to R. J. Rushdoony including a 51 minute audio recording of an interview with the now - deceased Christian Reconstructionist titan .

The women were ejected from the stadium
Fifa is considering legal action against a Dutch brewery it accuses of using women fans to advertise its beer at the World Cup .
Stewards ejected 36 Dutch supporters from Monday 's match between the Netherlands and Denmark midway through the second half in Johannesburg .
All were dressed identically in tightly hugging short orange dresses , sold as part of a gift pack by a Dutch brewery .
A brewery representative dismissed Fifa 's concerns as " ridiculous " .
The Cup 's authorised beer is Budweiser which pays millions of dollars for the privilege .
With a large chunk of Fifa 's revenue coming from selling marketing rights , it vigorously pursues anyone who tries to associate themselves with the tournament , the BBC's Jonah Fisher reports .
Earlier this year a local low - cost airline was forced to withdraw an advertising campaign which boasted that it was the " Unofficial National Carrier of the You - Know - What " .
' Clear ambush '
The women , seated near the front , were picked up by TV cameras .
" What seems to have happened is that there was a clear ambush marketing activity by a Dutch brewery company , " said Fifa spokesman Nicholas Maingot .
" What we are doing actually at the moment is that we are looking into all available legal remedies against this brewery . "
Mr Maingot said that none of the women had been arrested .
However , they were reportedly taken to a Fifa office where police quizzed them about the dresses and asked if they worked for the brewery , Bavaria .
Bavaria board member Peer Swinkels told Reuters news agency that Fifa 's reaction was " ridiculous " .
" Fifa does not have the monopoly on orange and people have the freedom to wear what they want , " he said .

The General Chiropractic Council , a UK - wide statutory body with regulatory powers , has just published a new position statement on the chiropractic subluxation complex :
The chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex is an historical concept but it remains a theoretical model .
It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease or health concerns .
They remind chiropractors that they must make sure their own beliefs and values do not prejudice the patient ’s care , and that they must provide evidence - based care .
Unfortunately , they define evidence - based care as
clinical practice that incorporates the best available evidence from research , the preferences of the patient and the expertise of practitioners , including the individual chiropractor her / himself .
[ emphasis added ]
This effectively allows “ in my experience ” and “ the patient likes it ” to be considered along with evidence , effectively negating the whole point of evidence - based medicine .

There are a great many reasons to love America .
For one thing , Freedom of Speech remains largely intact in the USA ( although the FDA has struck a serious blow to the principle with its ongoing censorship of free speech about nutritional supplements ) .
We also have a diverse culture of people who are by and largepeople .
This was brought home to me recently when I was traveling through the Gulf Coast region , talking to people on the street about the BP oil spill .
Virtually everyone was friendly , and I found I could walk right up to all sorts of people -- from the country fisherman in Biloxi Mississippi to the street - drumming entertainers in New Orleans -- and they were all happy to chat .
America offers a lot to be thankful for , but there are also some serious problems that are eroding the very things that make America great .
Those problems are the subject of my most recent CounterThink Cartoon called " America Today " which portrays six of the most serious problems threatening America 's future .
You can see the cartoon at : https://www.naturalnews.com/028944_America_Fe...
Or check out the complete collection of CounterThink Cartoons at www.CounterThink.com
Below , I explain each of these six big problems and why they threaten the future of America as we know it .
This is one of the most widely ignored problems in America today :
Whileare widely condemned and incarcerated for taking the wheel while inebriated , the epidemic ofis largely swept under the rug .
As much as one - third of all automobile accidents involve medicated drivers , I learned from a police captain in Tucson , Arizona .
The aggregate harm caused by medicated drivers is nowthan the harm caused by drunk drivers .
Police rarely test drivers for beingeven though many medications cause impaired judgment , lengthened reaction times and a loss of hand - eye coordination .
There is currently no national group focused on opposition to medicated drivers , either .
This is the big problem on America 's roads that no one is talking about ( except NaturalNews and a handful of other forward - thinking bloggers ) .
Remember : Popping pills and driving do n't mix .
By now , we all know that the Federal Reserve is counterfeiting the U.S. money supply by printing trillions of dollars ( creating money out of thin air ) to bail out rich Wall Street banksters .
If you or I did this , we'd be arrested for counterfeiting .
But when the Fed does it , somehow it 's all okay ... even though the Fed is n't even part of the federal government !
Ron Paul was right :
After all , why should the U.S. money supply be monopolized by a private corporation that does n't even answer to the People ?
The U.S. population has abandoned critical thinking skills to such an extent that even those people who manage to think just a little now appear downright brilliant .
Rather than a nation of critical thinkers , we have largely becomewho eat what they 're told , buy what they 're told , vote how they 're told and even believe what they 're told rather than thinking for themselves .
The result is a fundamental shift towards a " nanny state " where people want their government leaders to take control of their lives rather than deciding things on their own .
This , of course , will only lead us to socialism ... the great refuge of lazy minds .
No , I 'm not talking about the prostitutes in Washington D.C. who are probably running a more honest business than the metaphorical whores who sit in our nation 's capitol .
They are the politicians who take money from corporations to betray the People by favoring the legislative interests of Big Business .
It 's happening across the board , too , from Big Pharma and Big Tobacco to agriculture , chemicals , food companies , oil firms and defense contractors .
All the biggest industries have managed to tilt our elected representatives in their direction , abandoning the needs of the people they claim to represent .
If you are a parent in America , it is illegal to refuse to participate in the sick - care system of toxic western medicine .
When parents try to protect their children from toxic chemotherapy drugs or vaccines , they are threatened with arrest and imprisonment .
Child Protective Services steps in and threatens to steal their children away , and court Judges order parents to subject their children to these toxic therapies or flee and become fugitives from the law .
( I 've documented much of this here on Natural News .
Just search the website for stories on these topics if you want to learn more . )
It all makes you wonder :
How bad does western medicine have to become if it has to force compliance at gunpoint ?
What kind of system of healing subjects people to the tyranny we 're seeing right now in America 's " sick care " system ?
The answer is obvious : Western medicine does n't work , and as more people walk away from it , the State is increasingly forcing people to subject themselves to its rule as a way to mandate compliance for increased corporate profits .
I 've been writing about the toxic food supply since 2003 , when my first bookwas introduced .
( And many people before me were writing about it for decades . )
Now , all of a sudden , the mainstream media has become aware of the issue ( which is a good thing ) and even CNN is running reports about the toxicity of BPA , the " plastics " chemical .
It wo n't take too many more years before even mainstream scientists attack chemicals in the food supply in much the same way they once went after Big Tobacco .
It does n't take much thought to realize that if you want to support a healthy population , there 's no room in the food supply for toxic synthetic chemicals that disrupt hormones , promote cancer and interfere with normal physiological function .
will come when scientists one day realize that virtually the entire food supply is filled with toxic chemicals like MSG , aspartame , artificial colors , whiteners and flow agents .
Mark my words :
They will look back on 2010 in utter shock at how clueless our modern civilization was for feeding ourselves such poisons .
( Echoes of the Roman Empire 's lead poisoning come to mind ... )
While these six problems certainly present major threats to the future of life in America , there are many other threats that did n't make it into this particular CounterThink Cartoon .
In particular , there 's thecaused by drug factories dumping billions of doses of drugs down the drain .
This situation is now so bad that the fish near all major U.S. cities are intoxicated with pharmaceutical chemicals .
We 've also got other major problems with the political leadership of this country such as theand the prioritizing of selfish gain over the common good .
Virtually every elected representative in Washington now focuses most of their effort on staying in power rather than achieving practical advancements for the people who elected them to office .
Without question , America has lost much of what first made it great .
But with conscious effort , it can regain its greatness .
I believe the American people have the spirit and the resources to halt the downfall of their country .
The question remains , however :
Will theyto turn things around ?
Or will they instead settle for the path of comfortable degradation ?

The ongoing interrogation of passengers who were aboard the Marmara – the Gaza aid flotilla 's flagship – revealed that the majority of those who attacked the Israeli Naval Commandos boarding the ship have direct and indirect Global Jihad ties .
Israel 's investigation has revealed some 100 people infiltrated the peace and humanitarian aid activists making their way to Gaza , with the explicit design to attack Israeli soldiers using cold arms .

The majority of suspects are Turks , but some are Yemenites and Indonesian .
One Yemenite Islamist was photographed with a dagger in his belt prior to the raid .
The suspects are not cooperating with investigators .
Most of them have no identification papers , and Israeli authorities are still trying to ascertain their identity .
Nevertheless , it is clear that the majority were recruited by the same IHH handler who organized the flotilla .
Some of the suspects were found to be carrying large sums of money .
Others had Kevlar vests and gas masks ; and all were found to be carrying weapons such as knives , metal clubs and slingshots .
Several of the suspected were wounded by IDF fire .
Investigators have already concluded that this was the group that planned the violent resistance , which centered on the Marmara 's top deck .

Meanwhile , the Israel Navy has launched its own inquiry into the raid .
Senior officers told yet events probably went awry when the commandos lost the element of surprise – especially in regards to the people waiting on the top deck .
A senior IDF official said Tuesday night that " everything should be done in order to gather all the factual data and prove that the humanitarian sail had a semi-military body with a completely different goal . "
The officer added that the army was " working on it vigorously .
We understand the importance not just for the Navy but for all of us . "
Addressing the foreign detainees suspected of beating up Navy fighters during the raid , the officer said , " If we manage to create a criminal case against some people , we should act against them in a proper legal manner . "
He denied reports that the IDF did not provide medical aid to the injured foreign activists .
As for the next ship making its way to Gaza , the official said that the method of action would be determined after the lessons of the recent incident are drawn .
WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€
Under intense US pressure , energy giant BP presented a new plan to roughly triple the amount of oil it is capturing from a ruptured Gulf of Mexico well by the end of June , to more than 50,000 barrels a day .
“ After being directed by the administration to move more quickly , BP is now stepping up its efforts to contain the leaking oil , ” the official said Monday on condition of anonymity .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They have now outlined a path to contain more than 50,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of June , two weeks earlier than they originally suggested , ” the official said .
The oil company is currently siphoning up about 15,000 barrels of oil a day to a ship on the surface , about half of the 25,000 to 30,000 barrels believed to be streaming into the Gulf .
In a letter , BP outlined plans to bring a vessel for producing and storing oil from South America , two additional tankers from Europe and a 3,800 - foot , six - inch flexible pipe from Brazil to reinforce the existing efforts to suck up crude from the leaking well .
The outlines of the plan were produced as President Barack Obama was to depart on his fourth visit to the Gulf since an April 20 explosion destroyed a BP - leased deepwater rig , unleashing the worst oil spill in US history .
Obama is to address the nation in a speech from the Oval Office on his return on Tuesday , the official said .
ADVERTISEMENT
With new estimates showing that the oil is gushing into the Gulf at a rate double what was previously thought , the administration on Saturday said it had given BP 48 hours to come up with a revised plan to contain the leak .
Under its original plan , BP said it could expand its containment effort to capture between 20,000 to 28,000 barrels a day by mid-June and 20,000 to 50,000 barrels by mid-July .
The revised strategy would increase the capture of oil to a range of 40,000 to 53,000 barrels a day by the end of June , which would grow to 60,000 to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July , according to the administration official .

However , BP cautioned in its June 13 letter to Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson , “ The quoted numbers represent installed design capacities and any unplanned events will impact actual delivery . ”
The administration official said : “ We will continue to hold BP accountable and bring every possible resource and innovation to bear . ”

There seems to be a double standard in the application of the principles in the War on Terrorism .
The inhuman acts that unbreakable allies perpetrate upon defenseless humanitarian aid givers , are apparently perfectly fine and good .
It seems it is the activists � word , versus the Likudnik government of Israel at this point , and the Obama administration � like finely tuned clockwork � appears to be siding with the latter of the two .
The Goldstone Report , of course , made us all acutely aware of the kind of treachery , that the state of Israel is capable of enacting upon a near defenseless people .
Complete with using innocents as human shields , and firing illicit weapons at civilian targets , en route to an unconscionable loss of human life .
This seems to be , more or less , just act II of the same old tired practice .
So far as we know , these acts will keep coming , until the state of Israel falls out of favor with it�s most trusted confidant � and benefactor � the United States regime .
But as the U.S. recently fought vociferously to keep an ' exigent� military base in Okinawa ; the United States military base , the state of Israel , will not be very easily loosened from the grip of the empire as well .
Of course , one wonders if the dog wags the tail , or if the reverse is the case in this instance .
Though the United States has made nearly as many enemies � throughout the world � as its sister state Israel ; one would think this sort of practice of civilian slaughter , would turn even the superpower pariah�s hardened stomach .
It �s not like the U.S. hasn�t used white phosphorus before , or attacked civilian targets ; and although many are raising the question of whether or not , we are watching the beginning of the end for the state of Israel ; who is raising that identical question about the U.S. ?
Of course , the U.S. subsists on power , fear , bribery , and sheer , brute chutzpah .
So at least some � if not all � of these factors , will still be at the United States � disposal ; even if it falls to an all - time nadir .
And Obama was supposed to embark upon a new kind of presidency .
One where soft power , and multilateral action were supposed to make U.S. imperial mandates not as unpalatable to the rest of the world � and such that the rest of humanity might even like what it is that the U.S. is presenting .
Well , Israel with its intransigence in settlement building � and now murdering innocents � appears to be raining on Obama�s imperial grandstand .
And at least as mercilessly , as a broken oil pipe in the Mexican Gulf .
Therefore , I think that one has to wonder , how unbreakable , that unbreakable is , when it comes to the U.S. special relationship with its ' interminable � ally Israel .
And if Israel sinks to depths , where Obama finds that he can�t master the currents ; will Israel be left out in the cold , like so many client states , that no longer serve their imperial raison d�etre ?
Nothing has shown this massive capability before this unparalleled moment in Israeli - American history ; but what other than the senseless murder of those who can only defend themselves with whatever they could muster up from the starboard or galley � of a humanitarian aid vessel � could be capable of such a tectonic shift in a seemingly indestructible union .
This article describes how to render a ridicuously large 500 Megapixel Buddhabrot with iteration depths in the range of millions .
Lisp source included .
Scroll down for the final image .
Why would you want to do this ?
To have it printed and on your wall , of course ( see pictures below ) .
I will begin by outlining the general idea of the Buddhabrot ( see the Wikipedia article for more ) , then talk about my optimizations and rendering choices .
The Buddhabrot
You typically render a Buddhabrot by choosing a set of starting points in the complex plane ( i will call them " samples " from now on ) , run each sample c trough the iteration z_k +1 = z_k ^2 + c with z_0 = 0+0i and for those that grow very large after some time ( i.e. those that are outside the Mandelbrot Set ) remember all the z_k that have been visited during the iteration .
All those visited points from all the escaping samples form a point cloud in the complex plane that is usually called a Buddhabrot when visualized .
You need a maximum iteration depth n ( sometimes called the Dwell Limit ) because many samples will be within the Mandelbrot Set and you would run the iteration indefinitely for those .
Whenever the maximum iteration depth is reached , the sample is considered to be inside the Mandelbrot set - although it possibly is n't and after another 1000 Iterations it would have escaped .
There is no way to be sure .
We now consider only those samples " good " whose iteration escaped before reaching the maximum iteration depth , i.e. those who are definitely outside the Mandelbrot Set .
Each good sample gives a set of points whose magnitude is equal to the number of iteration steps i that it took for us to find out that it was outside the Mandelbrot Set .
Sometimes this is a very small number like 2 or 3 , but samples nearer to the border of the Mandelbrot Set take much longer .
A sample can take thousands or millions of iterations before escaping , thus leaving a much larger footprint in the resulting point cloud .
It seems that for each Natural Number n there is a sample that takes at least n iteration steps , although for higher values of n it becomes harder and harder to find one .
Deep Iteration
It has been observed by many people that just rendering the Buddhabrot like this - using all the escaping samples ' visited points - gives a nebula - like image but that a more interesting image can be made by considering only those samples as " interesting " whose iteration time i exceeds some minimum iteration time k with k < n .
For example , you could use k = 1000 and n = 10000 , i.e. keep only those samples that do not escape before their 1000th iteration but do escape before their 10000th iteration .
If you look at one of those more deeply iterated good samples ' visited path in the complex plane you will note some pattern : it forms some kind of orbit , sometimes some kind of circle or a set of circles or other shapes .
I have no idea why the orbits are shaped this way and i do n't know if anyone else does .
Here is a part of the orbit of the sample - 0.9114822433916717 + 0.2523940788714053i , for example ( containing nearly five million points ) :
Incidentally , all interesting samples like this one are located very very close to the border of the Mandelbrot Set and make good targets to zoom into with your favourite fractal explorer .
Try it .
Since the longer orbits look nice we will try to find only " interesting " samples that take a long time to finally escape .
There have been several approches to find them .
The most obvious one is of course just choosing a sample randomly and seeing how it goes , which means throwing away something like 99.999 % of them .
You could also use a regularly spaced grid of samples which basically means the same .
The interesting samples are all located near the Mandelbrot Set 's border , so there must be some spatial pattern to their distribution which might help us find them .
If you ever played around with the Set a bit you probably know that the border is infinitely long and calling it " complex " is a bit of an understatement , but surely we can do better than just randomly sample the plane ?
Optimization
Rejecting all samples from within the two biggest parts of the Mandelbrot Set , the " Main Cardioid " and the circular " Period - 2 - Bulb " , is a must - have .
This simple check removes a large amount of all the points in the Set which are very costly because they will iterate until the dwell limit is reached .
I just used the formula from the Wikipedia article .
The areas removed by this test are shown in red on this image of the Mandelbrot Set ( my output images are rotated clockwise by 90 degrees , do n't get confused ) :
People have also used the Metropolis - Hastings Algorithm , considering the mapping c -> i a propability density function .
The method is especially useful for rendering a small detail of the bigger image , but does not work too well for the whole image with very big values of k .
I kept finding many interesting samples with it , but their orbits turned out to be very similar because several good samples that are very close to each other produce orbits that are almost identical - giving an image of a single blurred orbit .
I increased the mutation distance enough to produce sufficiently distinctive orbits , but then the speedup was gone .
In the end i did n't use this method .
Probably it is more useful for rendering the " normal " Buddhabrot or a detail of it without the minimum iteration constraint .
To partly remove some of the costly larger areas ( like the non-circular bulbs labeled " 3 " and up in the image above ) from within the Set i divided the plane into rectangular cells and chose random samples only from those cells that contained some part of the border of the Mandelbrot Set .
Depending on the cell grid resolution and the iteration depth this gave a speedup of 3 to 8 .
" The " Buddhabrot
Since we still choose our samples randomly , every rendering will look different - depending on which orbits your random search finds .
There is no " the " Buddhabrot ( see Melinda 's comment below - rendering for an infinite amount of time yields " the " Buddhabrot ) .
This also means that the image is not symmetic on the small scale which is a good thing if you ask me .
You could of course get a symmetric image of the same quality in half the time by mirroring it , but i think it 's worth waiting for the asymmetric one .
On the right is a part of the final rendering that exhibits superficial symmetry , but is composed of asymmetric orbits .
Click it to view this detail in the final resolution .
If i had had my renderer run for much longer ( maybe a week or a month ) , more and more orbits would have shown up , occluding each other and finally blurring the whole thing into the standard nebula - like buddhabrot .
The key is to render just long enough until a sufficient amount of orbits have appeared and then stop .
Lisp Implementation
The renderer is written in Common Lisp which is not your classic number crunching language .
If the goal was to do it as fast as possible , you 'd probably end up doing it in C with inline assembly or on the GPU .
On the other hand , i had never really optimized any lisp code to the limit and wanted to do just that : see how far you can get .
One long night of low - level optimization at entropia with the help of some friends later there was is only a factor of 2 left compared to the C implementation that one entropian made .
Which is quite okay , considering the cumulative speedup of about 2000 compared to my first implementation .
Trading of sbcl 's builtin complex numbers for traditional pairs of floats , declaring all types , working in - place instead of on the stack , considering cache efficiency , prompting usage of inline arithmetic instead of jumps to costly sbcl functions , etc. gained us a factor of about 3 to 5 while the big rest was due to the algorithmic improvements .
The renderer uses double - floats throughout .
I think i can safely say that the orbits ' shapes are not due to cumulative floating - point errors ( which i had suspected at some time ) because tiny variations in the starting value usually do not produce significantly different orbits .
Orbits are not chaotic systems .
Since tracing the few good samples is quite cheap compared to finding them , the renderer first multithreadedly collects some good samples by randomly sampling from the grid cells ( see optimizations above ) and only afterwards processes them to keep track of their jumping around on the complex plane .
Their path is recorded in a big 16 bit greyscale image which is repeatedly written to disk .
Postprocessing , Color and Noise
Converting this greyscale HDR image to a LDR image with color has to be done by hand which is a nontrivial task for most image manipulation programs because 20000x25000 is not exactly your standard image resolution .
Gimp and Cinepaint both crash or freeze ( and Gimp can't handle 16 - bit images ) , but Photoshop worked for me .
I also cheated a bit by gently surface - blurring the image , removing some noise .
The noise is the only reason you need the really large iteration depths in the range of millions that i used .
If you increase both the minimum iteration time and the maximum iteration limit , your orbits will consist of more and more points , allowing you to choose a higher resolution .
If , on the other hand , you get less than , say , five hits per pixel in the darker regions of the orbit you will start to notice that some pixels may get only two hits and their neighbour pixel may get ten hits which will be visible as noise in the output image .
If you iterate more deeply , this effect evens out and the signal - to - noise ratio increases .
To remove noise , you can always downscale the output image or , as i did , selectively blur the image a bit to improve the look of the noisy areas .
For the output image that i consider the most successful one i used a minimum iteration time of 1000000 and a maximum iteration depth of 5000000 .
it took about 16 hours on my university 's 8 - core Xeon machine which i abused for this task overnight .
Results
Here is a scaled version of about 5000x6000 pixels for your firefox 's non-crashing convenience .
I am quite satisfied with the digitally printed one as well , although some of the darker reds lose their saturation .
Do not open the large image in your browser .
It is a 93 MiB JPG file of 20000x25000 pixels which consumes 1.5 GiB of RAM when opened .
Do n't try this at home .
I warned you .
You can also have a look at the Lisp source .

​ Any eligible patient in the United States may now obtain a medical marijuana card in Oregon .
The Oregon Politico .
Applicants formerly needed to supply proof of residency as well as Oregon identification as part of their application .
However , OMMP was informed by the Department of Justice that such a requirement was inconsistent with the language of the bill .
Tawana Nichols , OMMP manager , said while the program was created with the intent of specifically benefiting Oregonians , there was no requirement of Oregon residency written into the bill , so they could not lawfully require it .
The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program ( OMMP ) may no longer require Oregon residency as a part of the medical marijuana permit application process , reports Rachel Cheeseman at
While Oregon residency will not , for now , be a requirement , patients still must be authorized to use medical marijuana by a licensed Oregon physician holding either an MD or a DO ( doctor of osteopathy ) and obtain their cannabis within the state .
The protection afforded by the program does not extend beyond Oregon ’s borders .
What began almost three years ago in New Jersey as a routine driving while impaired conviction , has slowly escalated into a state Supreme Court case and a rallying cry for both advocates and opponents of increased language assistance for immigrants across the nation .
Police arrested New Jersey resident , German Marquez , on September 20 , 2007 , after he rear - ended another car while driving impaired .
Authorities convicted Marquez of driving while impaired ( DWI ) , careless driving , and refusal to take the breath test .
This week , the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey ruled that officers must provide instructions in suspects ’ native languages .
The case , which started in Plainfield , New Jersey ’s , municipal court , revolved around Marquez ’s refusal conviction .
Marquez , a Limited English Proficient citizen , admitted to both the DWI and careless driving convictions , but he said he did n’t understand the officer ’s breath test request at the accident scene because he did n’t speak enough English .
New Jersey ’s Chief Justice Rabner delivered the opinion of the Court , stating :
The statute ’s obligation to “ inform ” calls for more than a rote recitation of English words to a non-English speaker .
Knowledge cannot be imparted in that way .
Such a practice would permit Kafkaesque encounters in which police read aloud a blizzard of words that everyone realizes is incapable of being understood because of a language barrier .
That approach would also justify reading aloud the standard statement to a hearing - impaired driver who cannot read lips .
We do not believe that the Legislature intended those absurd results .
Rather , its directive that officers “ inform , ” in the context of the implied consent and refusal statutes , means that they must convey information in a language the person speaks or understands .
New Jersey is one of the country ’s most culturally and linguistically diverse states .
It ’s also among the states that offers the driving test in the most languages– Arabic , Chinese , English , French , Japanese , Korean , Polish , Portuguese , Russian , and Spanish .
Is it misleading , or even a double standard , to expect a driver who was allowed to take the driving test in a language other than English to fluently understand English when pulled over ?
Many commentators have used this court case as an opportunity to rehash old anti-immigrant arguments .
Writing about the court decision for The Star - Ledger , George Berkin states :
Marquez was arrested in the United States .
And here , in New Jersey , the official language is English .
In the past , the unspoken “ agreement ” was that immigrants will assimilate — that they will become fully Americans …
The court ’s ruling is neither good public safety policy , nor helpful in encouraging immigrants to become full participants in our national life .
Berkin ’s judgment on the case ’s effects on public safety policy are dubious at best .
It ’s inaccurate to interpret this ruling as an invitation for intoxicated drivers to overtake New Jersey ’s roads .
Already , recorded interpretations of the breath test request have been made available to state officers , and soon officers will receive printed copies of the instructions and warnings in the state ’s most common languages .
In effect , the ruling on Marquez ’s case prevents future citizens from becoming the victims of unlawful convictions .
And a guarantee of equal civil rights ( contrary to Berkin ’s argument ) might even give immigrants a renewed reason to become “ full participants in our national life . ”
Nevertheless , sentiments similar to Berkin ’s continue to spread throughout the nation .
Tim James recently ran his gubernatorial campaign on a promise to limit the offered driving tests in Alabama to only English .
In April , the Arizona Department of Education announced its crackdown on accented teachers in classrooms learning English .
And only a day after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling , the 30,000 person Homer Township in Illinois symbolically adopted English as its official language .
Officials in Homer Township also declared support for the recent Arizona Law - or “ Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act ” — which is one of the strictest pieces of anti-immigration legislation in US history .
It ’s difficult to pinpoint what ’s causing all this national linguaphobia , but it ’s safe to say that many of its manifestations have been misguided or aversively racist .
Only a minority will argue that immigrants in the US should n’t learn English .
So , these discussions should be dominated by the different methods currently available for immigrant language education .
Organizations like New Jersey ’s Diversity Dynamics , recognize that English might not be the official language in the United States , but that it remains integral to success in the nation .
Diversity Dynamics , which provides resources on the topic of immigrant adult education , states :
The ability to understand , speak , read , and write English as the nation ’s common language is crucial to the successful integration of immigrants into our society .
Without English , immigrants are locked into low wage jobs , blocked from advancing on the job , denied full access to health and other services , and shut off from contact with the larger society .
Should both the national government and local governments promote more language assistance plans for immigrants and make foreign language interpreters and translators more readily available ?
We can look at such services as crutches for new immigrants , or we can look at them as gateways to healthy assimilation .
We can argue that our parents ’ or grandparents ’ generations did n’t have or need these services , or we can argue that for every generation , issues surrounding immigration deserve a fresh and progressive approach .
I was reading Tim Carstens ’s post about Haskell features he ’d like to see in other languages , and one of those features was rank - 2 types .
Tim says that the killer application for this to ensure the safety of resource access , in the type system .
In short , this feature enables us to make sure that if we have a value of a particular type , then it represents a system resource which can be safely accessed , and that it ’s a compile - time type error to access a closed or unopened resource .
I find it really fascinating that we can get this kind of assurance from a type system .
First , a brief explanation of rank - 2 polymorphism .
A regular ( rank - 1 ) polymorphic function in Scala might look like this :
def apply [ A ] ( f : A => A , a : A ) : A = f(a )
This will apply the given function to a given value of any particular type , and it ’s ensured that the argument and return types of the function are the same as the value to which it is applied .
There ’s only one type involved here , but it can be any particular type .
But what if we wanted to say that the function f should work for all types ?
For example , a function that puts its argument in a list .
Such a function should work for all types , as long as the input and output type match .
For example :
def singletonList [ A ] ( a : A ) : List [ A ] = List ( a )
Now say we want to take such a function as an argument to another function .
With just rank - 1 polymorphism , we ca n’t do this :
def apply [ A , B ] ( f : A => List [ A ] , b : B , s : String ) : ( List [ B ] , List [ String ] ) = ( f ( b ) , f ( s ) )
It ’s a type error because , B and String are not A .
That is , the type A is fixed on the right of the quantifier [ A , B ] .
We really want the polymorphism of the argument to be maintained so we can apply it polymorphically in the body of our function .
Here ’s how that might be expressed if Scala had rank -n types :
def apply [ B ] ( f : ( A => List [ A ] ) forAll { A } , b : B , s : String ) : ( List [ B ] , List [ String ] ) = ( f ( b ) , f ( s ) )
That ’s not legal Scala code , so let ’s see how we could work around this .
Note that a method can be polymorphic in its arguments , but a value of type Function1 , Function2 , etc , is monomorphic .
So what we do is represent a rank - 2 polymorphic function with a new trait that accepts a type argument in its apply method :
trait ~ >[ F[ _ ] , G[ _ ] ] { def apply [ A ] ( a : F [ A ] ) : G[ A ] }
This trait captures something more general than Function1 , namely a natural transformation from functor F to functor G .
Note that A appears nowhere in the type and is n’t given until the apply method is actually called .
We can now model a function that takes a value and puts it in a list , as a natural transformation from the identity functor to the List functor :
type Id [ A ] =
A val singletonList = new ( Id ~> List ) { def apply [ A ] ( a : A ) : List [ A ] = List ( a ) }
And we can now take such a function as an argument :
def apply [ B ] ( f : Id ~> List , b : B , s : String ) : ( List [ B ] , List [ String ] ) = ( f ( b ) , f ( s ) )
I wonder if we can use this to get static guarantees of safe resource access , as in the SIO monad detailed in Lightweight Monadic Regions .
Federal officials have arrested an Army intelligence analyst who boasted of giving classified U.S. combat video and hundreds of thousands of classified State Department records to whistleblower site Wikileaks , Wired.com has learned .
PFC Bradley Manning , 22 , of Potomac , Maryland , was stationed at Forward Operating Base Hammer , 40 miles east of Baghdad , where he was arrested nearly two weeks ago by the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division .
A family member says he 's being held in custody in Kuwait , and has not been formally charged .
Manning was turned in late last month by a former computer hacker with whom he spoke online .
In the course of their chats , Manning took credit for leaking a headline - making video of a helicopter attack that Wikileaks posted online in April .
The video showed a deadly 2007 U.S. helicopter air strike in Baghdad that claimed the lives of several innocent civilians .
He said he also leaked three other items to Wikileaks : a separate video showing the notorious 2009 Garani air strike in Afghanistan that Wikileaks has previously acknowledged is in its possession ; a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat , which the site posted in March ; and a previously unreported breach consisting of 260,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables that Manning described as exposing " almost criminal political back dealings . "
" Hillary Clinton , and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning , and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , in searchable format , to the public , " Manning wrote .
Wired.com could not confirm whether Wikileaks received the supposed 260,000 classified embassy dispatches .
To date , a single classified diplomatic cable has appeared on the site : Released last February , it describes a U.S. embassy meeting with the government of Iceland .
E-mail and a voicemail message left for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on Sunday were not answered by the time this article was published .
The State Department said it was not aware of the arrest or the allegedly leaked cables .
The FBI was not prepared to comment when asked about Manning .
Army spokesman Gary Tallman was unaware of the investigation but said , " If you have a security clearance and wittingly or unwittingly provide classified info to anyone who does n't have security clearance or a need to know , you have violated security regulations and potentially the law . "
Manning 's arrest comes as Wikileaks has ratcheted up pressure against various governments over the years with embarrassing documents acquired through a global whistleblower network that is seemingly impervious to threats from adversaries .
Its operations are hosted on servers in several countries , and it uses high - level encryption for its document - submission process , providing secure anonymity for its sources and a safe haven from legal repercussions for itself .
Since its launch in 2006 , it has never outed a source through its own actions , either voluntarily or involuntarily .
Manning came to the attention of the FBI and Army investigators after he contacted former hacker Adrian Lamo late last month over instant messenger and e-mail .
Lamo had just been the subject of a Wired.com article .
Very quickly in his exchange with the ex-hacker , Manning claimed to be the Wikileaks video leaker .
" If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8 + months , what would you do ? "
Manning asked .
From the chat logs provided by Lamo , and examined by Wired.com , it appears Manning sensed a kindred spirit in the ex-hacker .
He discussed personal issues that got him into trouble with his superiors and left him socially isolated , and said he had been demoted and was headed for an early discharge from the Army .
When Manning told Lamo that he leaked a quarter - million classified embassy cables , Lamo contacted the Army , and then met with Army CID investigators and the FBI at a Starbucks near his house in Carmichael , California , where he passed the agents a copy of the chat logs .
At their second meeting with Lamo on May 27 , FBI agents from the Oakland Field Office told the hacker that Manning had been arrested the day before in Iraq by Army CID investigators .
Lamo has contributed funds to Wikileaks in the past , and says he agonized over the decision to expose Manning – he says he 's frequently contacted by hackers who want to talk about their adventures , and he has never considered reporting anyone before .
The supposed diplomatic cable leak , however , made him believe Manning 's actions were genuinely dangerous to U.S. national security .
" I would n't have done this if lives were n't in danger , " says Lamo , who discussed the details with Wired.com following Manning 's arrest .
" He was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could , and just throwing it up into the air . "
Manning told Lamo that he enlisted in the Army in 2007 and held a Top Secret / SCI clearance , details confirmed by his friends and family members .
He claimed to have been rummaging through classified military and government networks for more than a year and said that the networks contained " incredible things , awful things ... that belonged in the public domain , and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC . "
He first contacted Wikileaks ' Julian Assange sometime around late November last year , he claimed , after Wikileaks posted 500,000 pager messages covering a 24 - hour period surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
" I immediately recognized that they were from an NSA database , and I felt comfortable enough to come forward , " he wrote to Lamo .
He said his role with Wikileaks was " a source , not quite a volunteer . "
Manning had already been sifting through the classified networks for months when he discovered the Iraq video in late 2009 , he said .
The video , later released by Wikileaks under the title " Collateral Murder , " shows a 2007 Army helicopter attack on a group of men , some of whom were armed , that the soldiers believed were insurgents .
The attack killed two Reuters employees and an unarmed Baghdad man who stumbled on the scene afterward and tried to rescue one of the wounded by pulling him into his van .
The man 's two children were in the van and suffered serious injuries in the hail of gunfire .
" At first glance it was just a bunch of guys getting shot up by a helicopter , " Manning wrote of the video .
" No big deal ... about two dozen more where that came from , right ?
But something struck me as odd with the van thing , and also the fact it was being stored in a JAG officer 's directory .
So I looked into it . "
In January , while on leave in the United States , Manning visited a close friend in Boston and confessed he'd gotten his hands on unspecified sensitive information , and was weighing leaking it , according to the friend .
" He wanted to do the right thing , " says 20 - year - old Tyler Watkins .
" That was something I think he was struggling with . "
Manning passed the video to Wikileaks in February , he told Lamo .
After April 5 when the video was released and made headlines Manning contacted Watkins from Iraq asking him about the reaction in the United States .
" He would message me , Are people talking about it ?...
Are the media saying anything ? "
Watkins said .
" That was one of his major concerns , that once he had done this , was it really going to make a difference ?...
He did n't want to do this just to cause a stir ....
He wanted people held accountable and wanted to see this did n't happen again . "
Watkins does n't know what else Manning might have sent to Wikileaks .
But in his chats with Lamo , Manning took credit for a number of other disclosures .
The second video he claimed to have leaked shows a May 2009 air strike near Garani village in Afghanistan that the local government says killed nearly 100 civilians , most of them children .
The Pentagon released a report about the incident last year , but backed down from a plan to show video of the attack to reporters .
As described by Manning in his chats with Lamo , his purported leaking was made possible by lax security online and off .
Manning had access to two classified networks from two separate secured laptops : SIPRNET , the Secret - level network used by the Department of Defense and the State Department , and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System which serves both agencies at the Top Secret / SCI level .
The networks , he said , were both " air gapped " from unclassified networks , but the environment at the base made it easy to smuggle data out .
" I would come in with music on a CD - RW labeled with something like ' Lady Gaga , ' erase the music then write a compressed split file , " he wrote .
" No one suspected a thing and , odds are , they never will . "
" [ I ] listened and lip - synced to Lady Gaga 's ' Telephone ' while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history , " he added later .
" Weak servers , weak logging , weak physical security , weak counter - intelligence , inattentive signal analysis ... a perfect storm . "
Manning told Lamo that the Garani video was left accessible in a directory on a U.S. Central Command server , centcom.smil.mil , by officers who investigated the incident .
The video , he said , was an encrypted AES - 256 ZIP file .
Manning 's aunt , with whom he lived in the United States , had heard nothing about his arrest when first contacted by Wired.com last week ; Debra Van Alstyne said she last saw Manning during his leave in January and they had discussed his plans to enroll in college when his four - year stint in the Army was set to end in October 2011 .
She described him as smart and seemingly untroubled , with a natural talent for computers and a keen interest in global politics .
She said she became worried about her nephew recently after he disappeared from contact .
Then Manning finally called Van Alstyne collect on Saturday .
He told her that he was okay , but that he could n't discuss what was going on , Van Alstyne said .
He then gave her his Facebook password and asked her to post a message on his behalf .
The message reads : " Some of you may have heard that I have been arrested for disclosure of classified information to unauthorized persons .
See CollateralMurder.com . "
An Army defense attorney then phoned Van Alstyne on Sunday and said Manning is being held in protective custody in Kuwait .
" He has n't seen the case file , but he does understand that it does have to do with that Collateral Murder video , " Van Alstyne said .
Manning 's father said Sunday that he 's shocked by his son's arrest .
" I was in the military for five years , " said Brian Manning , of Oklahoma .
" I had a Secret clearance , and I never divulged any information in 30 years since I got out about what I did .
And Brad has always been very , very tight at adhering to the rules .
Even talking to him after boot camp and stuff , he kept everything so close that he did n't open up to anything . "
His son , he added , is " a good kid .
Never been in trouble .
Never been on
drugs , alcohol , nothing . "
Lamo says he felt he had no choice but to turn in Manning , but that he's now concerned about the soldier 's status and well - being .
The FBI has n't told Lamo what charges Manning may face , if any .
The agents did tell Lamo that he may be asked to testify against Manning .
The Bureau was particularly interested in information that Manning gave Lamo about an apparently - sensitive military cybersecurity matter , Lamo said .
That seemed to be the least interesting information to Manning , however .
What seemed to excite him most in his chats was his supposed leaking of the embassy cables .
He anticipated returning to the states after his early discharge , and watching from the sidelines as his action bared the secret history of U.S. diplomacy around the world .
" Everywhere there 's a U.S. post , there 's a diplomatic scandal that will be revealed , " Manning wrote .
" It 's open diplomacy .
World - wide anarchy in CSV format .
It 's Climategate with a global scope , and breathtaking depth .
It 's beautiful , and horrifying . "
Update : The Defense Department issued a statement Monday morning confirming Manning 's arrest and his detention in Kuwait for allegedly leaking classified information .
" United States Division - Center is currently conducting a joint investigation " says the statement , which notes that Manning is deployed with 2nd Brigade 10th Mountain Division in Baghdad .
" The results of the investigation will be released upon completion of the investigation . "
Christopher Hitchens , Author of ' God is Not Great , ' Battles Cancer Doctors say alcohol , cigarettes can add to esophageal cancer risk .
July 2 , 2010  --
Author and provocateur Christopher Hitchens , 61 , announced this week he would cut short a book tour for his new memoir , " Hitch - 22 , " because he will undergo chemotherapy for esophageal cancer , a serious diagnosis that rarely has a happy ending .
The disease kills 14,530 Americans a year and one type -– squamous cell carcinoma -– is associated with smoking and drinking , habits Hitchens extolled as virtues in essays and features for Vanity Fair magazine .
" It tends to be an aggressive cancer , " said Dr. Richard Battafarano , chief of thoracic surgery at the University of Maryland .
" By the time a person knows he has esophageal cancer , it 's already moved to stage 3 or 4 .
By the time people go to the doctor because their voice has changed or their swallowing has changed , the tumor has advanced . "
Speculation has already begun on what role Hitchens ' self - proclaimed hedonistic lifestyle played in his diagnosis .
" The fact that people are also calling it throat cancer tells me it's high up behind the voice box , " said Battafarano .
" We know he had a prolific consumption of alcohol and cigarettes and he had quit smoking , but it might be a little late . "
The British - American author 's statement on his publisher 's website had little detail .
" I have been advised by my physician that I must undergo a course of chemotherapy on my esophagus , " he wrote .
" This advice seems persuasive to me .
I regret having had to cancel so many engagements at such short notice . "
If the cancer is localized and has not yet spread , Hitchens would likely not get chemotherapy alone , according to Battafarano .
At the same time , he may have refused surgery , which can damage the nerves around the voice box .
" He could have told the surgeon , No way I am risking my voice box , ' " Battafarano said .
" It 's hard to guess .
If it 's outside of the esophagus and he 's getting chemotherapy because [ the cancer ] has metastasized , that 's not good .
It they are using a strategy that starts with chemotherapy and moves into radiation next , it could be localized . "
" [ Hitchens ] is being very private , as he should be , " said Battafarano .
" We could be wildly wrong or right on . "
The writer 's memoir , " Hitch - 22 , " is on Publishers Weekly 's bestsellers list , and his book lambasting the world 's major religions , " God is Not Great , " was a commercial success in 2007 .
As the author of more than dozen books and magazine features , many of them about his personal proclivities , Hitchens often celebrated his love of Johnny Walker Black .
Christopher Hitchens , Provocative Author , Battles Cancer
" What the soothing people at Alcoholics Anonymous do n't or wo n't understand is that suicide or self - destruction would probably have come much earlier to some people if they could not have had a drink , " he wrote in a 2003 essay on booze , " Living Proof . "
Hitchens gave up tobacco in 2008 , but had been seen sneaking a puff or two , according to the Washington Post .
His wife Carol Blue said it was " fear " and a desire to " live to see his political enemies defeated . "
Another drinker and chain smoker , Humphrey Bogart , died of esophageal cancer at age 57 reportedly uttering the famous last words " I never should have switched from scotch to martinis . "
Other celebrities who died of the disease included Texas Governor Ann Richards and actor Ron Silver .
There are several types of esophageal cancer , all of which form in the muscular tube where food passes from the throat to the stomach .
The most serious forms of the disease are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma .
Studies have shown smoking and drinking can contribute to the risk of squamous cell esophageal cancer , but statistically that may not be the case with Hitchens .
Most of the time , white middle - aged men succumb to adenocarcinoma , which can be caused , in part , by acid reflux , according to doctors .
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) reports that 16,470 new cases of the disease were reported in 2009 .
" It 's one of the worst cancers and the reason is because it 's so easy to metastasize , " said Dr. Fritz Francois , assistant professor at New York University and a gastroenterologist who does research on esophageal cancer .
" If you think about it as a tube and on the outside is a network of blood vessels and lymph nodes . "
Those age 65 years or older are at the highest risk of getting esophageal cancer , according to the NIH .
Men are three times as likely to develop the disease , especially those who drink more than three alcoholic beverages a day ; smokers , too are at high risk , and the combination of the two increase the chances of developing the disease exponentially .
The main function of the cells in the esophagus are to protect the rest of the body .
Christopher Hitchens , Provocative Author , Battles Cancer
" Not only do the cells protect against the stomach acid coming up , things move forward and we swallow a lot of things we should n't , " said Francois .
" If you are a smoker , although the smoke goes to the lungs , anything that coats your mouth , you can swallow and expose the cells to carcinoma . "
" Think about them like pancake layers , one stacked on top of the other , ' said Francois .
" There are about 40 of them stacked on top to form a barrier on the esophagus . "
The rate of squamous cell carcinoma is highest in African American men – about 28 cases out of 100,000 as compared to 3 out of 100,000 in the general population .
The second major type of esophageal cancer is adenocarcinoma , which occurs in the gland - forming cells near the swallowing tube 's junction with the stomach .
That disease is associated with acid reflux damage .
About 2 to 3 in 100,000 will get this type of esophageal cancer ; the risk is double -- 5 in 100,000 -- for white men , according to Francois .
As the tube approaches the stomach –- at the gastroesophageal junction –- the cells of the esophagus transition to the cells of the stomach and become more column - like .
It is there that adenocarcinoma strikes .
" Those cells stand taller and their function is different , " he said .
" That lining has other specialized cells that work like a team , like a basketball guard that makes acid cells and other protein . "
In a condition called Barrett esophagus , abnormal cells develop to protect the lower esophagus from acid , increasing the risk for adenocarcinoma .
Most people do n't know they have it , according to Francois .
Symptoms for both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma include difficulty in swallowing , weight loss , pain swallowing or anemia .
In some cases , patients vomit up blood .
" At that point , the thing has been there for a while , and our chance of picking it up at an early stage is rare , " he said .
The reason survival rates are not as good as other cancers is that patients are often diagnosed too late .
" If the person is lucky , they are there for another reason and we pick it up early at stage 1 , " he said .
At stage 1 , the cancer is just on the surface of cells ; stage 2 the disease has entered the muscle wall ; state three it has gone through the entire wall ; and in stage 4 , the cancer has spread .
" Most of the time , it 's picked up in stage 3 or 4 , " he said .
Esophageal cancer , depending on its type or stage or other factors , can be treated with surgery , chemotherapy or radiation .
Squamous cell cancer seems to be more receptive to radiation .
Early studies have shown that patients who get radiation treatment alone in this early form of cancer have a survival rate of 60 percent , according to Francois .
As in all cancers , three factors are involved in assessing a person 's risk : genetic make - up , environmental factors like toxins ( including smoking and drinking ) ; and perhaps , new studies are showing , microbacteria in the stomach , like H - pilori .
Interestingly , stomach cancer is associated with H - pilori , according to research , but the bacteria seem somewhat " protective " for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus .
" For the average American , I would n't recommend screening , " said Francois .
" However if you have symptoms of acid reflux and they are not going away and not being treated with acid blockers , I would see a doctor to be evaluated . "
Those with trouble swallowing or who have had symptoms of acid reflux for more than 10 years and are in a high - risk group like white males , should seek a one - time endoscopy to evaluate for Barrett 's esophagus , said Francois .
" Then we can follow you and make sure it does n't transition to cancer , " he said .
There are no such tests for squamous cell cancer , short of a biopsy of the esophagus , for heavy smokers and drinkers like Hitchens .
Those who do drink should consider cutting back , something Hitchens -– in his own inimitable way -– said that he has done .
" There was a time when I could reckon to outperform all but the most hardened imbibers , but I now drink relatively carefully , " he wrote in " Hitch - 22 , " describing his working day .
" At about half past midday , a decent slug of Mr. Walker 's amber restorative , cut with Perrier water ( an ideal delivery system ) and no ice .
At luncheon , perhaps half a bottle of red wine : not always more but never less .
Then back to the desk , and ready to repeat the treatment at the evening meal .
No ' after dinner drinks ' -- most especially nothing sweet and never , ever any brandy .
' Nightcaps ' depend on how well the day went , but always the mixture as before .
No mixing : no messing around with a gin here and a vodka there . "
I mention this , because there is a certain amount of the clean - up now going on in the Gulf that can be done with waterjet lances , and some parts of the spill can be cleaned up with suction hoses .
( And I have some experience with both , courtesy of helping in the development mentioned in the first paragraph ) .
One of the classes that I have taught involved the use of pressure washers in a demonstration laboratory that supported the class lectures .
So I thought I would take a moment to mention some of the things that need to be considered when using pressure wands and suction hoses .
One of the more innovative recent technical advances that you have likely never heard of is called Hydro- excavation .
It combines the use of a water stream of the sort you find at a car wash ( i.e. 2,000 psi water at about 2 gpm ) with a vacuum hose attached to a vacuum truck .
It turns out to combine into a new tool that is quite effective for disaggregating soil and removing it to leave a relatively dry cavity down to significant depth , quite fast .
It has a lot of advantages if you are excavating in an area where there are fiber - optic cables and other underground conduits that might take unkindly to the use of a back - hoe , ( including gas lines ) .
The first obvious , but neglected point , is that the operator rarely can judge exactly where the tip is relative to the surface being cleaned .
This is actually quite critical because the average pressure wand comes with a fan tip on the end .
The tips come with different angles of dispersion of the jet , and having photographed a fair number , most jets are about 5 degrees broader than the jet pattern stamped into the nozzle .
The second point is the one that is usually missed , but which relates to the distance of the nozzle from the surface .
When the jet comes out of a fan jet nozzle , the shape of the nozzle forms the stream into a sheet that gets wider with distance .
Because the volume of water coming out at one time does n’t change , the jet therefore gets thinner the further that it gets away from the jet .
Flash Picture of a fan jet
With a typical nozzle ( usually called a tip ) the sheet gets thin enough somewhere between 2 and 4 inches that the sheet perforates , and just as with a balloon when it pops , the material pulls back from the hole .
In the case of the water sheet , this creates circles of larger droplets that continue to move forward .
It is at this point that the jet is at its most effective , in many applications .
However , those droplets that are moving originally at about 550 ft/sec are moving into air that is relatively stationary .
It breaks these large droplets up and decelerates them over the next couple of inches .
As a result , the jet becomes virtually powerless within about 6 - inches of the nozzle .
( The distance varies with nozzle manufacturer , design flow rate and operating pressure – but that distance is typical ) .
If you hold the nozzle further away from the target than that you are merely getting the surface wet , and not moving anything but surface dirt .
The problem that you , as an operator , have is that it is very difficult to judge that 6 - inches .
( Making it easy to “ catch the student in error ” at the beginning of the lab and reinforce the lesson ) .
So the simple way to resolve the problem , is to touch the target surface before you start , position your feet accordingly , and then back the lance off a little and you are likely to be much more effective .
Having cleaned a wall of my house with an 18 - ft extension lance to the normal pressure washer last week , I can also add that trying to maintain a 2 - 4 inch standoff while holding the lance above your head is an art that has to be learned .
OK , now the next problem is that most of the material being removed is going to be some form of hydrocarbon ( oil. Oil emulsion or something similar ) .
Some of these are quite sticky and hard to remove with just water pressure .
In this case if the water is heated to about 185 deg F it will cut through and remove those coatings a lot more easily than at a lower temperature .
You do n’t want to heat it all the way to steam , since that loses the pressure of the jet at the nozzle too quickly , but with hot water the range can be extended .
One other way to extend the range is to use a spinning round jet nozzle ( sometimes called a 0 deg tip ) .
There are a number of these on the market and the cone of the jet is created by rapidly spinning the cylindrical jet that comes out of the nozzle .
Depending on the quality of the nozzle ( and diameter and pressure ) these can increase the jet range to a foot or more .
If you work out the amount of energy and water required to clean a surface both our group and some folks in Germany have shown that using this rather than a fan - jet can drop the amount of energy and water that you use to clean that surface by up to 90 % .
The final point I want to make deals with the use of suction hoses .
These are now appearing more frequently in some of the locally made systems being fielded along the Gulf .
While the same basic argument about the operator not knowing where the tip is , still applies , there is a different reason as to why this is important .
In most cases the object is to pull a relatively thin film of oil from the surface of the water .
The ideal place to hold the end of the hose is just above the oil : water level ( less than half - an - inch ) .
The air drawn into the gap helps pull the surface layer into the hose , and you do n’t pull in a lot of water .
Unless you have really good control of your position ( bearing in mind you are looking along the hose at the water ) this is very hard to sense .
If you push the hose into the water hardly at all then you pull in too much water and not that much oil .
If you tilt the hose then it tends to pull in a lot of air , and not a whole lot of water or oil .
The best way to control the position is to have the end of the hose attached to a piece of foam that will float and in this way the mouth of the nozzle can be placed where you want it .
It is easier to do this if you bend the hose so that most of it is lying on the foam , and not pushing it into the water , but in this way , depending on the amount of oil , you can slide the nozzle up and down in the foam to get the best distance to recover the oil .
That half - inch distance is fairly critical for best performance , especially if you can keep just below it .
( Yeah we actually did experiments where we adjusted it ) .
There are now whole books on this technology , and some safety recommendations on how to use some of the equipment , as the industry continues to grow .
Hopefully this has been of some help .
What one learns in one application can be quite usefully applied , often in others .

Mr. Prechter , 61 , lives in Gainesville , Ga. , where he runs Elliott Wave International , a forecasting and publishing firm .
He graduated from Yale as a psychology major in 1971 , dabbled as a singer , drummer and songwriter in a rock band and became a technical analyst for Merrill Lynch .
He became fascinated by Mr. Elliott ’s writings , which suggest that the market moves in predictable if complex patterns .
Along with A. J. Frost , Mr. Prechter wrote “ Elliott Wave Principle , ” a 1978 book that predicted the emergence of a great bull market  a forecast that was largely fulfilled .
By 1987 , he was widely regarded as an expert in technical analysis .
Articles in The New York Times said he was known as “ the market ’s leading technical guru ”  and more .
An article in October that year said he had “ emerged as both prophet and deity , an adviser whose advice reaches so many investors that he tends to pull the market the way he has predicted it will move . ”
He has far less day - to - day influence now , after years spent developing a theory he calls “ socionomics , ” which holds “ social moods ” as the cause not only of market cycles but also of economic and political events .
A grand cycle is ending , he says , and the time for reckoning is near .
In 2002 , he published “ Conquer the Crash , ” which predicted misery ahead .
Even so , he said in 2008 that the market would soon rally sharply  then said late last year that stocks were about to fall and that the great decline would resume .
Since 1980 , the advice in his investing newsletters , when converted into a portfolio , has slightly underperformed the overall stock market but has been much less risky , losing money in only one calendar year , according to calculations by The Hulbert Financial Digest .
Mr. Prechter said he disagreed with the methodology used in these measurements , but offered none of his own .
For his part , Mr. Acampora says that the Elliott Wave has some validity as an indicator but that “ it ’s only part of the story ” of technical market analysis , which also needs to be buttressed by economic and fundamental research .
Mr. Prechter says his unifying theory , socionomics , is a “ young science . ”
“ We ’re quantifying it , ” he said .
“ We ’re working on it . ”
In the meantime , he contends , it has enabled him to “ look around the corner ” and prepare for a dangerous future .
WASHINGTON
Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A New York Democrat argued that failing to prosecute former Bush administration officials complicit in the use of torture would create a dangerous precedent and place America on a path to “ tyranny . ”
In an interview with Raw Story , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) invoked a “ supremacy of laws ” when critiquing President Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s decision to “ look forward and not backwards ” on his predecessorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s abuses of power .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Those who misuse government power to break the law and subject people to improper pressure or torture ought to be prosecuted , ” said Nadler , chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties .
“ That Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why we have laws . ”
The Brooklyn - born Nadler , who has represented New York City since 1993 , has taken a special interest in championing civil liberties during the last decade .
He rebukes the Patriot Act .
He opposes FISA wiretapping .
He rejects the partial suspension of Habeas Corpus to fight terrorism .
“ Since the Patriot Act , I think we ’ve gone overboard , ” Nadler said .
“ Not that we ’ve gone overboard on security , we certainly need the security , but we ’ve done things that are unnecessary to do in terms of restricting civil liberties . ”
The Obama administration has declined to launch an investigation into illegal activities carried out during the Bush administration — such as the practice of waterboarding , which is widely considered a form of torture , on terror suspects .
“ If you do nÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t prosecute , or if you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t investigate , then what you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re saying is government can do anything , ” Nadler argued .
“ And that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a formula for tyranny .
So I think itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s very important . ”
As for looking forward and not backwards ?
“ By that standard you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢d never prosecute any crime . ”

White House officials and some analysts fear that a drawn - out investigation , which would be virulently fought by Republicans , would drain the capacity of Democrats to advance their domestic agenda .
Nadler argues that to sustain a democracy , it ’s vitally important to hold lawmakers accountable for their crimes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even more so than with private citizens .
“ People who break the law , ought to be held accountable , ” he said , “ especially if theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re in government , because they have more power . ”
Though he is among a Congressional minority on some civil liberties issues , Nadler continues to speak out against what he deems gratuitous expansions of executive power that began under the Bush administration and have persisted under Obama .

“ I do not believe that they add to national security , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
“ National security has to be protected , but protected right . ”

At what age should children be allowed to cycle unsupervised ?
For paranoid parents , maybe never ; for others , perhaps nine or 10 .
But for one south London couple it 's even younger : Oliver and Gillian Schonrock allow their two children to cycle to school together – aged only five and eight .
Not for much longer , perhaps : the Schonrocks were censured last week by their school headteacher for allowing them to ride unsupervised the mile - long distance between Alleyn 's junior school and their Dulwich home .
The Schonrocks say they merely want " to recreate the simple freedom " of their own childhoods ;
Alleyn's headmaster Mark O'Donnell thinks it might be a matter for the social services .
Who 's right ?
For the department of education , it 's a grey area : there are no official guidelines .
But for Oliver James , child psychologist and author of parenting manual How Not To F***
Them Up , the issue is more clear - cut .
" I 'm pretty gung - ho when it comes to my five - year - old , " he says , " but I would n't let him ride alone .
I think it 's a pretty odd thing to do .
It should be banned really , though I could n't say at what age . "
James is also concerned that the Schonrocks ' children are at risk from attack .
" Not from adults – there 's a huge exaggeration in people 's minds about paedophilia – but from other children .
It depends on where you live , but other children pose a genuine threat in terms of knives and muggings . "
Justine Roberts , who runs parenting website Mumsnet , is more worried about the cars : " For me the biggest risks are n't the strangers , but the traffic .
Personally , I would n't let my four - year - old cycle to school even with me in tow .
But all children are different , and in the end we ought to trust the parents . "
According to Professor Frank Furedi , a sociologist known for his opposition to paranoid parenting , the Schonrocks should be praised .
" Riding along the pavement is obviously well within the capability of many eight - year - olds , " he says .
" And some five - year - olds will definitely be mature enough to start to go to school on their own .
Of course there are some children you would n't even let near a bicycle , but it sounds like these particular children will have benefitted tremendously from the responsibility . "
BEIJING , June 2 ( Reuters ) -
The Iranian central bank has announced that it will sell 45 billion euros from its foreign exchange reserves to buy dollars and gold , China ’s official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday , citing unspecified Iranian media reports .
Xinhua said that the sales would be conducted in three stages and that the first had already begun , citing unnamed sources .
It also said that other Gulf states had also started cutting their euro holdings .

It ’s been a while since we got together to do a verdict .
That splendid Deus
Ex anniversary seems like the right kind of time to do so .
Below we judge the game , ten years on .
Does it live up to the legend ?
Jim :
Are we ready to talk about Deus Ex being ten years old ?
Alec : 10 years ?
it does n’t look a day over nine and a half
Jim : Kieron , you ’re probably the best person to sum things up .
What is Deus Ex ?
Kieron : I will never escape the duty of custodian of the Deus Ex flame .
Deus Ex is Ion Stom Austin ’s 2000 PC Game .
It ’s the thing which prevents Ion Storm being looked at nearly as badly as it was looking for a while .
Where Daikatana was a famous disaster and Anachronox was a visionary if niche underperformer , Warren Spector ’s team made Deus Ex the state of the art of videogames .
There ’s some who ’d argue it ’s still , in its ambition and achievement , the state of the art today .
As in , we have n’t gone further .
It ’s a first person RPG – what was later termed by Ion Storm as “ The Immersive Sim ” .
In the lineage of Ultima Underworld , it models a realistic physics - based universe and sets you forth to have an adventure .
In this case , a 21st century cyberpunk / Conspiracy - theory thriller .
It ’s notable for two main reasons .
Firstly , it ’s the aesthetic inverse of Thief in terms of the lineage .
Thief concentrated to one aspect of the immersive sim – stealth – and made the whole game about it .
Deus
Ex included everything – from stealth to conversation to violence – hell , to multiple ways of violence .
Secondly – which leads on from the first – it was the game which brought the concept of freedom of choice far more to the forefront that other first - person games .
Levels were open places for expression of your skills .
You made it up as you went along .
Rather than a level saying what you should do – a puzzle to be solved – often Deus Ex presented a problem , gave you the tools and let you at it .
It also had terrible voice - acting .
That ’s Deus Ex .
Alec : Do n’t forget the Greasels
Kieron : I was saving that for Jim.
Custodian of the Greasels
Jim : Fucking greasels !
But let us not dwell on them .
Kieron : Probably best to start with saying everyone ’s experience of DX .
Jim : Alec , you want to go first ?
Alec :
My experience of Deus Ex was buying based on – egads !
– a PC
Zone review , then leaving it on the bus on the way home .
So I copied it from a friend , and played it over the course of the following 18 months .
It was the first game where I combed every single corner , tried every permutation ( via savegames ) , because I was so amazed at the possibilties , the depth .
I thought you just played games to get to the end .
Deus Ex changed that .
But I never invested many points in swimming , which means there ’s still some manner of goodie at the bottom of the canal which I ’ve never found .
One day .
One day .
Jim :
My experience was a little strange , I think , because it was based on Kieron reviewing it .
Kieron : Man !
Jim :
It was the game Kieron was reviewing when I started work at PC Gamer .
But I could n’t play it myself , so I was simply getting all these hyperbolic reports about what had happened , why it was exciting , and so on .
I think the 95 % scored review was sent to press at the start of my second week on the mag .
That , I thought , was what being on PC Gamer was going to be like .
Kieron : Oh , man , heartbreaking .
My first game I reviewed was Thief : The Dark Project .
It totally gives you a false impression .
Jim :
And actually at the time , I just assumed that games were going to be like that in the future .
Alec :
What was the first game they gave you to review , Jim ?
Jim : An Army Men game .
I ca n’t remember the name .
Anyway , the original System Shock at basically signposted the future , as far as I was concerned , DX seemed like just another waypoint on the road to our immersive sim horizons .
I went on to get Deus Ex when it came out a few weeks on , and I played it through , even playing it at a Quake 3 LAN i went to , instead of the matches I should have been playing .
John :
The first game I reviewed for PC Gamer was Minigolf .
I gave it 3 % .
I had a very accurate impression of the following eleven years .
Jim : I am playing it again at the moment and , I think , enjoying more this time .
Alec : I admit I ’ve only dipped in and out of DX since .
Too many videos of the bad acting , too many write - ups claiming impossible things , too much hyperbole .
I want to cling to my memories and experience , not have it tainted by age , creakiness and other people ’s bluster .
Even looking in on it last night , I was horrified by how not - huge the levels seemed now .
I did n’t want to destroy their grandeur in my memory , so I could n’t stay for long .
Kieron : I suspect we ’re going to come back to the idea of Deus Ex as an ambassador of what we though would be the future .
John : I ’ve only played DX through once .
I ’ve played the start of it a lot of times since .
But part of me does n’t want to replace the memory I have of it .
For me it does n’t really get stored in the “ A game I played ” category in my head .
It has its own unique folder .
I remember it like someone might remember a three month interailing trip .
So playing it again would be like revisiting those places in the hope of recapturing those old memories .
Alec : “ Remember when we stayed here ?
They had those nice biscuits . ”
Jim :
There is a lot of random food in DX .
Kieron : I ’m still annoyed at how fast Cigarettes kill you .
Alec : Deus
Ex is a signpost to our anti-smoking game future .
John : Plus , how could I approach it without cynicism ?
For me , playing it through , it was an unfolding mystery .
I was , and this is the most crucial thing , making decisions .
I ’d not be making decisions another time .
I ’d be making calculated choices .
Kieron : I dunno – Like Jim , I ’m replaying it at the moment , and there ’s a sort of joy to playing with some of the options .
I blew up Anna Navere last night .
With the LAM - on - the - way - into - the - jet trick .
Which is the sort of thing everyone talks about , but I finally got around to trying it myself .
It ’s been so long that I ’m fine with it .
John : This is my point .
It would be about trying things out .
Rather than a truly honest experience .
Which is awesome – I ’ve done the same with KotOR and so on .
But I kind of do n’t want to do it to DX .
Kieron : DX is less about the emotional options though , rather than mechanic expression – which I suspect we ’ll get onto in a minute .
Me though : I have n’t actually completed it a second time either oddly – which means none of us have , which is interesting .
As Jim said , I reviewed it – and may write a little about the whole story to do with that period then – and ended up getting involved with the SDK with a mod called The Cassandra Project .
So even though I ’ve never played it all through again , I ’ve been deep into the guts of the beast .
I suspect that also contributed to me not doing another complete playthrough .
I ’ve seen DX in a way which none of you guys have .
Kieron : Okay , why the hell does DX matter ?
I mean , really .
There ’s 10 year anniversaries all the time .
DX is the only game we ’ve even considered doing .
Not Planescape , not Longest Journey or Quake 3 or anything which is our touchstones .
But we ’re doing DX .
Why ?
John : I considered doing TLJ .
But then I forgot .
Alec : Deus
Ex is generationally important to us , as PC gamers in our early 30s .
And it turned up in an age where games were looking fairly pathetic and meatheaded , saying “ no – this is not good enough . ”
It hit at a time where we wanted more , where we wanted to validate both our hobby and our career choice .
Jim : I ’ll venture something .
I suspect I ’m the person who likes DX the least out of the four of us .
I was very critical of it at the time .
There ’s a lot I did n’t like about how it worked .
And I think that ’s because I did n’t like how a lot of the different tools it provided worked , and lots of the mechanical bits annoyed me .
Ladders , fucking Greasels .
Even guns and skills .
But , and this is the bit about importance , the issue was that it * had * all those tools .
It was a big box of things , all done to different degrees of proficiency .
Rather than a couple of things done well .
Deus
Ex is broad in a way I think we ’d like lots of other games to be .
And yet they are n’t .
Designers prefer to get a few things right .
Kieron :
This is the reason why Deus Ex would only get a 9/10 in Edge .
There ’s a whole school of thought based on games which would argue that is a failing .
To the school of thought who ’d argue against that , it ’s the Ocarina of Time .
Alec :
Well , you could also argue it led to things like Pathologic , which are almost unplayable .
Kieron : Pathologic as a true son of DX is an interesting one to think about .
Though I bristled a bit at Alec ’s suggestion .
Before deciding he ’s right about it being a game which was * just * a bit more grown up .
I do n’t think it was a complete oddity , but seeing a game which had clearly read a whole load of the same books I had was a startling joy .
( I mean , was Silhouette informed by the Situationalists ?
I never had the heart to ask Warren or Harvey )
Alec :
But what I really think is that its absolute multitude of possibilites led to a splintering of exploration from all its ideas , Pathologic being just one .
John : Yeah , that ’s the thing .
I think its mechanics were splendid , but I do n’t think the combination of FPS and RPG was why it was special .
It was special because it was smart , and it made me smarter for playing it .
It was well read , it was eloquent , and it was proud of that .
Jim :
The importance , though , was probably in its unique position , appearing at a crucial time for shooters , and a crucial time for RPGs .
It took elements from them all and put them together in a way that did n’t really have too many parallels .
( totally disagreeing with John ! )
John : Let ’s fight !
Jim :
We can settle it with a game of DX multiplayer , later .
Kieron : I suspect this is showing your biases , if you know what I mean .
John : I ’ve said this before , but it was playing DX that made me realise I did n’t know anything about politics , and it started me off in the direction of learning .
Alec : I had read none of those books , nor indeed any cyberpunk .
Which made it doubly amazing to me , and I had no qualms or questions about what it was telling me at the time – it was a whole new , bewilderingly incredible world .
But yes , as with John it was effective in making me really question government for the first time .
Kieron : Deus Ex as Public Enemy .
Never thought of it like that .
Alec :
Do n’t believe the hype ( about new labour )
Like I say , this is the importance for me – the right game at an incredibly formative period of my life .
The period where my brain started to grow .
If I had n’t played Deus Ex , if I ’d have an N64 instead … I shudder to think .
Jim :
It ’s an incredibly rich storyworld , really .
And not one set in a fantasy land , but in the real world , a bit further down the road .
I think , actually , it is worth playing it again now for precisely that reason .
I “ get ” more of it now than I did when I was 21 .
Kieron :
Yes – I ’ll agree with that .
I was actually kind of bewildered how sledgehammer it was .
In the same way – but opposite aesthetics – I got from playing Sacrifice , that I ’m a better gamer now makes it a better game .
Jim :
Interesting – perhaps that ’s it ’s real value ?
A game we can agree was edifying , rather than , eugh , “ fun ” .
Alec :
A game that taught us to think bigger , even as we clubbed greasels to death
Kieron :
The reason why it ’s such this touchstone is because * this was the next logical step of how we of a generation saw games going * .
As in , Deus Ex was natural .
Jim McCauley reviewing it deliberately positioned it as “ The best game in the world ” .
And presented the idea that it was a lineage , like Best Boxer or whatever
Jim : Goddamn greasels .
Kieron :
And anyone who believed in a certain way of games would agree with it .
The reason why DX is remembered … is that in those terms , in that idea of what games “ should ” be like , it ’s never been superceded .
As in , it was a gateway into the future .
We all believed it would be , because that ’s what happens .
And then it did n’t .
John :
It ’s the Half - Life 2 of , um , games that are n’t Half - Life 2 .
Kieron :
And the future we were expecting and then the future did n’t happen .
It ’s our “ Where ’s our rocketpacks ? ” : Where ’s our Deus Ex 2 !
Alec :
It was very much The Game Of Its Time .
Jim :
But it ’s down to design philosophy , I think .
Games have been pushed to do fewer things , and to do them better .
Kieron :
The crowbar was a nod to Half - Life , of course .
It was n’t a game that was just at the apex of the Looking Glass tree – it was a game which also sublimated the id - derived culture .
Jim : Deus
Ex feels like the last time doing a lot of things was really okay .
Even big games RPGy like Fallout 3 lack the broad messiness .
John :
Is that a financial thing ?
Did LG hit a sweet spot where it was affordable to be good at a lot of things ?
And now to focus that broadly would push you over the $ 100 m mark ?
Kieron : John ’s basically right .
I ’m talking to a load of devs for interviews at the moment and the question I ’m asking them all is “ The 00s trend was basically you trying to work out a way to make a game which used DX ’s ideas , but sell enough to justify it ” DX ’s 500 k is n’t enough .
Jim :
But is n’t that down to marketing ?
That * also * suffers from deliberate simplification .
Alec : I was intervewing THQ’s Danny Bilson for GI the other day , and his stance was that all their games have to be blockbuster or bust now .
That ’s the philosophy .
RIsks can be taken , but only within the shell of something palatable to COD players .
Jim :
The assumption is that gamers do n’t want complexity .
Kieron : I do n’t think Jim ’s right .
I just think there ’s complex and there ’s complex .
I think it ’s just about the money .
The problem with a DX game is that it needs AAA - aesthetics .
( Not that DX was cutting edge at the time )
Alec : Y’know , I ’m not sure it does .
Jim :
The Witcher sells a million copies , a DX style game could easily do the same .
Kieron :
It needs to be comparable to whatever a FPS game is doing
Alec :
A cheap deus ex would have to avoid trying to be photoreal , but a Russian studio could totally do a king ’s bounty on something interesting
Kieron : Witcher outsold DX1 in the same time , it ’s worth noting .
But yeah – if a development studio worked in that space , it could .
Jim :
It ’s interesting to see a few people in the RPS comments saying “ Stalker is the only thing that holds up DX heritage ” , which is basically “ give a shooter a sandbox and an inventory ”
Kieron :
That ’s the other thing I find interesting : very few studios try it .
Though Central / East Europeans do try it .
I mean , Boiling Point .
John :
Well , how smart do you have to be to get it right ?
Genuine question .
Were Looking Glass / Ion Storm exceptionally clever ?
Does it take that level of intelligence to be able to pull this off ?
Kieron : I think they ’re enormously hard games to design .
I say this from experience .
Or close enough .
Jim :
Very smart , but I am not sure that ’s got anything to do with trying to make it .
I think people make a ) what they think people want to play , and b ) what they themselves want to play .
I do n’t think DX is what most dev teams would * want* to make .
A few do , as we will see from the interviews this week , but they are in the minority .
Alec : yeah , it ’s about resources , being able to investigate , test and fix every permutation .
That ’s why these risks are n’t taken , devs have to cater for every possible place a player can be , and every possible situation they could be in .
With budgets and graphical assets and team - sizes ever - rising … well , it becomes a terrifying task
Kieron : DX totally accepts that occasionally crazy shit will happen .
Jim :
And that ’s why it works .
Kieron : Okay – let ’s step away from the myth to the actuality .
How does it hold up now ?
Jim :
It remains ludicrously ugly , but that ’s somehow ok .
Alec : I quite like the ugly , but the darkness is comical , given how much we snigger at brown games now .
I do n’t think any of it is in daytime , is it ?
Jim :
No blue skies .
Alec :
The first level remains a marvel .
A whole lot of talking and urgency , but you ’re almost immediately let off the hook to wander .
Terrorist attack , but I ’m busy breaking into a unatco basement for minor toys .
Jim :
The painful thing , going back , is that is it really is so refreshing to play with tranquiliser darts and trip bombs and batons and sniper rifles .
So much stuff !
From the start !
Kieron :
The first level is fascinating .
At the time , it was viewed as a problem , as in , something which turned a lot of people off .
Looked at today , and it ’s a fucking masterpiece .
Jim :
There ’s so much there .
Patching up different parts of your body .
Having your legs shot off and not being able to reach the medkit on the table .
So many variables .
Alec : Stealth right off the bat too , and it ’s sort of hard – for an opener , it throws so much of the game right at you immediately
Kieron :
The stealth ’s terrible , bless it .
And yeah , that ’s why it tripped everyone up – that it * does * throw so much at you .
Jim :
Actually the first level annoyed me when I originally played it .
I felt like the way I bodged through was clumsy and inelegant .
Alec :
And the running noise .
Is he in high heels ?
Jim : heh
Kieron : Deus Sexy !
Jim : Future fashions for men .
Kieron : I ’m really enjoying playing it , but fuck me , is it twitchy .
Some of its boundaries are just so ill - defined .
I ’m playing much more deadly than I did back in the day because Stealth is so twitchy .
Alec : Oh , and I love the casualness of the robot .
It starts you on a wooden dock , filled with FPS - trad crates and then – hey - giant robot , just wandering about .
Not mentioned , not interacted with , just there .
Here Is Your World .
Jim : I did much better this time .
But originally it was the gas station level , I think , that really made it for me .
Because it was short , and I replayed it .
And it was totally different each time .
And I really began to realise how the game could throw things down differently .
Kieron :
That ’s a lovely level .
What do you think about the skill - mechanics now ?
As in , how the reticule ties to your character ’s skill ?
A couple of mechanic things – it ’s interesting how that if you stand still , basically you end up with a nearly perfect aim .
It ’s an incredibly badly done “ skill ” system .
In terms of its stated aim .
But playing now , once you accept it , it works .
Jim : Yeah , that was one of my original gripes , I think .
The game felt messy .
But when you see that taken away , you realise the value in it .
Kieron :
The health is the other thing – I ’m actually not sure the body stuff really matters that much .
In DX , generally speaking , you ’re either dead or alive .
Alec :
It does want to stop you from just running around shooting wildly .
Even though choice obviously remains within that , it ’s pretty up - front about not letting you be Doomguy .
You * have * to be an agent .
Kieron :
But you can be doomguy if you ’re standing still !
It ’s quite mental in that way .
Alec : Doomguy = strafin.g
Kieron :
Well , half - life guy ( i.e. String of perfect head - shots )
Alec : Yeah .
But then , Denton is an agent .
John : Can we talk about the twist ?
Kieron : Er… I suspect we ’re boring john here .
You got anything you think we should be talking about ?
Jim :
Yes , the story , does that hold up too ?
Kieron :
Well , the twist is n’t .
You watch the intro and you know who ’s the bad guys .
You know all the conspiracies are true .
John : I have a story about that .
Kieron : HIT US
John : Back then , I was doing youth work .
And this older kid , around 17 , had also played it and he was very right wing in certain respects .
And he was really cross about it .
He believed that the government were distributing the vaccine correctly .
And he felt like he had been forced into this change of sides , and was trying to help the government from the other side .
But the game does n’t really endorse this nearly as well .
Do you think it ’s a very biased narrative ?
Kieron : Yes .
Jim : Goddamn Liberal agenda !
John :
It ’s an interesting way in which the game really does n’t support choice .
Kieron :
It ’s a conspiracy about a government falling into a fake - disease with a fake - vaccine
Alec : I like that nice Bob Page .
He has a lovely smile .
Kieron : I talked to Warren Spector about this once , as in , about the game having a pro-pacifist bias .
Because while characters respond to you if you kill or not .
The characters who are likeable like you if you ’re good .
Or less violent .
And the moral monsters like you if you use force .
In other words “ You are like us ”
Alec : yes , you ca n’t be mates with Page or Simmons
Kieron :
It ’s a game which is very happy to give you choice … and then judge you on it
Alec : Although you can horrify Simmons , interestingly , if you murder the prisoners near the start .
Kieron : i.e . If Anna Navere likes me , something ’s probably wrong .
I do n’t think its bias is a problem .
I mean , 1984 is n’t any weaker because it does n’t argue for the system .
It ’s a game with something to say .
Alec : “ If only you could talk to the monsters . ”
Kieron :
And it ’s a fine example of how player - choice does n’t actually mean the game ca n’t be about a developer ’s expression too .
Actually – can I say Ste ’s riposte to that ?
The “ If only you could talk to the monsters ” ?
Alec : I suspect you ’re going to anyway .
Kieron :
He noted that … well , Deus Ex is Doom … if you could talk to the monsters .
And it * is* something .
Deus
Ex is the game which proved that Edge 7/10 review right , basically .
Alec : “ If only you could teach the monsters the errors of their ways ”
John : Is DX3 going to scrape the legacy ?
Alec : DX3 may pick up where DX left off , but we ’re still missing 10 years of progress .
Jim :
We ’re missing ten years of something , but perhaps it something that needed time .
After all , we ’re seeing the legacy of UO and Eve in MMOs again now ( Mortal , Darkfall , Perpetuum , Earthrise ) .
Perhaps the legacy of DX is simply taking time to make itself known .
Kieron : I do kinda half wonder whether when the kids who were 18 in 2000 get to positions of power – which should be in the next 10 years – we ’ll be seeing stuff .
Look at me be optimistic .
John : Go Kieron !
Alec : Is n’t that people like Clint Hocking ?
Jim :
We ’ll come to that , later in the week !
Kieron :
What a shame .
Our verdict : SALE !
Global Trend : The Rich Are Getting Richer
According to a report published by Capgemini and Merrill Lynch , in 2009 the wealthy got wealthier worldwide despite the global economic downturn .
Globally , the number of millionaires rose by 17 percent in 2009 .
Meanwhile , the middle class and the poor are getting increasingly squeezed as the result of the 2008 global financial meltdown , which translated quickly in a persistent lack of employment , especially in the US and Europe , a sharp drop in real estate value , cuts on social programs , retirement and pension benefits , and last but not least a much tighter credit from financial institutions .
In other word , as a global society , we have not learn anything from the economic meltdown of 2008 .
And if the report shows some sign of global economic recovery , it also demonstrates that the key systemic problem of obscene concentration of wealth has not been tackled whatsoever , and that we are still functioning in the same unsustainable logic of “ shock Capitalism ” with too much wealth concentrated into too few hands .
As most of us , worldwide , are struggling for such basic needs as feeding our families and keeping a roof above our head the gap between the super - wealthy and the rest of us is growing with no end in sight .
For example , India , which is one of the country who saw the sharpest rise in millionaires in 2009 , remains a country plagued by extreme poverty and social injustice .
In 2009 , the Asia - Pacific region saw the sharpest rise in the club of the super - wealthy since 2008 with a rise of 26 percent .
The region , with Hong Kong and India in the lead , now has as many millionaires as Europe with three million .
The number of millionaires in the Middle - East rose by 7.1 percent , to some 400,000 , last year back to the level before the global financial crisis .
The number of super - rich went up in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain , but dropped sharply in the United Arab Emirates due to the Dubai debt crisis .
From 2008 to 2009 , the number of people with at least one million US dollars in assets , excluding primary residences , expanded to 10 million from 8.6 million in 2008 .
After Asia , North America had the second biggest increase , 17 percent , to 3.1 million , which is the largest increase for a single region .
Global wealth held by the super - rich rose by 19 percent , to about $ 30 trillion , after falling more than 19 percent in 2008 following the financial meltdown .
Wealthy investors increased their relative share of holding in markets outside their home regions reversing a trend that began in 2006 of increasing investment in their home countries .
According to the report , in 2009 the US had 2.87 million millionaires , followed by 1.65 million in Japan and 861,500 in Germany .
A group of artists has been asked to lighten the faces of children depicted in a giant public mural at a Prescott school .
The project 's leader says he was ordered to lighten the skin tone after complaints about the children 's ethnicity .
But the school 's principal says the request was only to fix shading and had nothing to do with political pressure .
The " Go on Green " mural , which covers two walls outside Miller Valley Elementary School , was designed to advertise a campaign for environmentally friendly transportation .
It features portraits of four children , with a Hispanic boy as the dominant figure .
R.E. Wall , director of Prescott 's Downtown Mural Project , said he and other artists were subjected to slurs from motorists as they worked on the painting at one of the town 's most prominent intersections .
" We consistently , for two months , had people shouting racial slander from their cars , " Wall said .
" We had children painting with us , and here come these yells of ( epithet for Blacks ) and ( epithet for Hispanics ) . "
Wall said school Principal Jeff Lane pressed him to make the children 's faces appear happier and brighter .
" It is being lightened because of the controversy , " Wall said , adding that " they want it to look like the children are coming into light . "
Lane said that he received only three complaints about the mural and that his request for a touch - up had nothing to do with political pressure .
" We asked them to fix the shading on the children 's faces , " he said .
" We were looking at it from an artistic view .
Nothing at all to do with race . "
City Councilman Steve Blair spearheaded a public campaign on his talk show at Prescott radio station KYCA - AM ( 1490 ) to remove the mural .
In a broadcast last month , according to the Daily Courier in Prescott , Blair mistakenly complained that the most prominent child in the painting is African - American , saying : " To depict the biggest picture on the building as a Black person , I would have to ask the question : Why ? "
Blair could not be reached for comment Thursday .
In audio archives of his radio show , Blair discusses the mural .
He insists the controversy is n't about racism but says the mural is intended to create racial controversy where none existed before .
" Personally , I think it 's pathetic , " he says .
" You have changed the ambience of that building to excite some kind of diversity power struggle that does n't exist in Prescott , Arizona .
And I 'm ashamed of that . "
Faces in the mural were drawn from photographs of children enrolled at Miller Valley , a K - 5 school with 380 students and the highest ethnic mix of any school in Prescott .
Wall said thousands of town residents volunteered or donated to the project , the fourth in a series of community murals painted by a group of artists known as the " Mural Mice . "
The public art , funded by a $ 5,000 state grant through the Prescott Alternative Transportation Center , was selected by school students and faculty .
" The parents and children love it , " Lane said .

David Miliband has said the era of New Labour is over and the party must look to the future if it is to recover .
Officially launching his bid for the Labour leadership , the ex-foreign secretary warned his party about " re-fighting the battles of the past " .
Ed Miliband , David 's younger brother , is the only other person to declare their candidacy so far .
But others , such as Ed Balls and Andy Burnham , are expected to enter the race in the next few days .
Labour sources have said a new leader could be in place by the end of July although some have urged the party to take its time to ensure the party has the fullest debate possible .
' Battle of ideas ' Speaking in his South Shields constituency , Mr Miliband said Labour was still the " home of progressive politics " in the UK but said that voters had seen the party as the " old order " .
Although it should be " proud " of its record in government , Mr Miliband said Labour had not been " humble " enough about its mistakes or " clear " enough about its offer , particularly over issues like immigration , housing and political reform .
It must accept that it lost the election " badly " .
" We have got to understand the depth and breadth of the defeat , " he said .
The Blair - Brown era is over .
New Labour is not new any more
David Miliband
Labour leader : runners and riders Harman is acting Labour leader Send us your comments " The Labour Party must reform , repair and rebuild in opposition and prepare to fight and win a general election in future , " he said .
" We have to win the battle of ideas again .
We have to earn the right to change the country again . "
Labour needed to look to the future in terms of its policy and its organisation and draw a line under previous battles , he told party activists .
" The Blair - Brown era is over .
New Labour is not new any more .
New Labour did fantastic things for the country but what counts is next Labour . "
Mr Miliband said Labour must play a " constructive " role in opposition but be " passionate and determined " to stand up for what it believed in and to hold the new government to account .
Out of the race After consulting colleagues over the weekend , former Schools Secretary Ed Balls is expected to enter the race in the next few days while former Health Secretary Andy Burnham is also considering his options .
Jon Cruddas , who has trade union backing and turned down a job in Gordon Brown 's government after coming third in Labour 's deputy leadership contest , said he had received many e-mails and texts urging him to stand .
A string of senior Labour figures have ruled themselves out of the contest including Jack Straw , Alan Johnson , Peter Hain and Yvette Cooper .
Former Chancellor Alistair Darling did the same on Monday , saying he " should be back on the back benches by the time " the name of the next leader is known .
Both the Milibands have called for the widest range of candidates to enter the contest as possible so the party can have the fullest debate about its future direction .
Gordon Brown was elected without a challenge in 2007 .
The new leader is chosen by an electoral college where the votes of MPs and MEPs count for a third of the total , the votes of Labour Party members count for another third , and votes of trade unions and other affiliate organisations ' members count for a third .
Deputy leader Harriet Harman has taken over as acting leader after Gordon Brown 's resignation last week .

Evolution of user interfaces in Haiku and other Operating systems
This blog post talks about the changes that have been hapenning in recent versions of others Operating Systems , and wether Haiku should copy them or not .
A long time ago , in 1984 , Apple designed the user interface of the Macintosh .
This was not the first one , ( the first was at Xerox PARC ) but it was widely known and set the standard for many other OSes .
Amiga Workbench and GEM borrowed the menu at the top of the screen , everyone started to use cursors and icons , and titlebar for windows with buttons to close and resize them .
BeOS , of course , also got a lot of inspiration from this user interface being created partly by former Apple employees .
However , each of these systems grew up its own way , keeping many differences with the others .
Amiga had a system of screens , where each application had a desktop on its own and windows inside it ; GEM kept single - task and most applications ran full screen instead of using windows , mac tried to integrate some multitasking while keeping the GUI as simple as possible .
In 1995 , there was a new version of Windows , introducing a bar at the bottom of the screen , and allowing to switch between applications more easily .
It also included a start button to run more apps , without having to find the “ Program Manager ” .
Most modern Linux Desktop Environments are based on this layout ( Gnome , KDE , XFCE and LXDE , at least ) .
The deskbar in BeOS and Haiku is also somewhat similar .
In 1999 , Apple released Mac OS X , featuring a big update to the previous UI : the dock .
It allowed to see all the available apps , and lauch them by a single click , or raise an existing instance if there was one .
Note the dock had been available for several years in NextStep .
Finally , we now have Windows 7 , which borrowed the dock idea from Mac OS X , but also brought in some other changes .
Over all these years , we can see that Mac OS and Windows have changed a lot , while Haiku is still really near to the old BeOS .
Should we get some of the ideas from other OSes , or is it better to keep going our own way ?
Document - Centered interfaces
An important change in the way we use computer is that there is now a lot more multitasking .
In the first days of the Macintosh , it was not possible to run more than one application at a time .
It is now common to have a lot more .
At the beginning , people used computers a bit like typewriters : only one document at a time , and the others available on the desktop for reference .
But now , most documents are inside the computer , and you often have more than a single one open at a time .
This creates a distinction between an application , a window and a document .
An application may have multiple windows open at a time , and each window can show one or more documents .
For example , in a word processor , it is common to have one separate window for each document , while in a web browser , it ’s more common to use tabs inside the window .
To the user , it makes more sense to have a document - centered interface , where a window is bound to a document .
However , this can quickly get messy on the desktop if one opens a lot of web pages .
Fortunately , we already have a solution for that , one that most other operating system are missing : it ’s Stack and Tile .
Stack and Tile will allow to stack a lot of windows to make them part of the same frame , and act like tabs .
This allows each window to still be a document , while having the tabbing to keep them in a manageable order .
The other part of this is the adoption of the dock system .
The dock is a fusion of the deskbar with launchbox .
It hides the difference between a running application and a not running one .
This distinction is not really important anymore , and it will disappear in the future .
Applications are launching really fast in Haiku , so it does n’t matter if you have to load the app from disk or just raise a window .
Moreover , we ’re going to a system where apps are always running .
PalmOS has been doing it for years , when you quit an app , it ’s just snapshotted to disk , and you can reload it later to find it exactly like you exited it , even if you rebooted the computer in between .
Speaking of rebooting , this also means that shutting down your computer will be the same thing as putting it in “ deep hibernation ” state .
The end of the Title and Menu bars
In windows 7 , Microsoft decided to rework a lot the way things are working .
The most important changes , apart from the adoption of a Mac OS X similar dock , is the removal of menus and , to some extend , of title bars .
The idea behind the removal of menus is to give more exposure and easy access to the features of an application .
You can immediately see what you can do .
It makes the app easier to use if you 're not at ease with a mouse .
And it is also a lot simpler when you use a touchscreen , which is becoming more common every day .
However , menus are still much more simpler to use so , I do n't think this is a feature we should keep .
The other part of this change is that it allows applications to play a little more with the title bar .
For example , the Opera web browser chose to draw tabs inside the title bar itself .
This somewhat reminds Stack and Tile , and gets back to the idea that a window is a document , but that windows can be sticked together .
Features that got lost over time : Amiga Screens
I find the Amiga really interesting , because they really developped their own system about the same time the Macintosh was being created at Apple .
The two systems are similar , but still different .
And the guys at Commodore did n't always copy the features from Apple .
One of the really interesting things in the Amiga is the screens .
They are a bit like Haiku 's workspace , but pushing it further , you can grab a screen and move it to see the one behind .
An application usually runs in its own screen , but it is possible to move windows from one to another .
Screens have an user - defined name and it is possible to cycle through them with a small button at the top right of the screen .
This button is sometimes much more practical than the workspace switcher : it takes a lot less space , and allows you to reach your target easily .
As apps always open in their own workspace , it 's easier to make use of the feature : you do n't have to think about it and decide where to put the windows yourself .
The ability to split the dispay and see multiple screens at a time allows you to quickly navigate from one application to another , without having to endlessly switch workspaces .
It is also possible to keep a small screen always on top , with some status info , and use the rest of the display space for the app you want to see .
Overall , Haiku has the chance of being a fully integrated system , so it can move a lot faster than most others , particularly UNIXes with a lot of different graphical toolkits .
So , it ’s time we switch to a document - centered intreface and see where it brings us .
In the end , we ’re left with two things to look at : Smalltalk and NextStep .
They already did most of what I ’m talking about .
Within a decade , computers will be able to plough through scientific data looking for patterns and connections – then tell scientists what they should do next
Move over scientists – computers will be asking the questions from now on .
They will trawl the millions of scientific papers on the web and suggest new hypotheses for humans to test , according to an article in tomorrow 's issue of Science .
Scientists are drowning in data .
Whether it 's high - speed genome sequencing , simulating the early universe or testing complex mathematical proofs , there are often more numbers to crunch than there are people to crunch them .
But help is on the way in the form of " automatic hypothesis generation " , argue James Evans and Andrey Rzhetsky of the University of Chicago .
" Computer programs increasingly are able to integrate published knowledge with experimental data , search for patterns and logical relations , and enable new hypotheses to emerge with little human intervention , " they write .
" We predict that within a decade , even more powerful tools will enable automated , high - volume hypothesis generation to guide high - throughput experiments in biomedicine , chemistry , physics , and even the social sciences . "
Evans foresees a time when computers crawl the millions of scientific papers online , linking and analysing data and concepts , then suggesting new hypotheses to test .
" Would n't it make more sense to extract information from the huge corpus of previous research and put it together [ to form new hypotheses ] ? " he told me .
For more than 20 years cosmologists have been using computers to test models designed by people .
" The new twist here is that the computer can be given information and told to find its own model explaining the data or the connections between different pieces of data , after some ' ground rules ' are set by the user , " said Carlton Baugh of the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham University , who uses whole armies of computers to run " massively parallel " calculations of how different structures form in the universe .
" With pattern finding , the computer is asked to uncover a connection or relation defined by the user within a dataset .
With hypothesis generation , the computer has more flexibility to come up with different patterns to test . "
Automatic hypothesis generation may also prove invaluable in genetics .
Increasingly , geneticists can conduct studies from their computers .
In genome - wide association studies , they compare all the genes of people who have a disease with those of a healthy control group to find mutations related to the disease .
Studies like this have identified risk genes for type 2 diabetes and breast cancer , for example .
There are millions of human DNA sequences stored in online databases such as GenBank , and dealing with this information has spawned a new discipline called bioinformatics , which involves applying statistics and computer science to biological problems .
Automatic hypothesis generation could take it one step further .
Dawn Field , head of the molecular evolution and bioinformatics group at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford , says Evans and Rzhetsky are on the right track .
" This will become more and more possible in the future .
We are just experiencing the beginnings of this field of endeavour . "
Some argue that new knowledge will emerge by mechanically applying algorithms to find patterns in large datasets .
But pattern - finding without knowing the theoretical context of a field has potential pitfalls , write Evans and Rhetsky .
They compare it to the task of an explorer in an unfamiliar jungle without a guide : " With no sense of what is already known about the environment or its perils , [ the explorer ] is likely to misclassify what she sees – fearing the intimidating but harmless snake ; ignoring the tiny lethal frog . "
Dr Dietrich Rebholz - Schuhmann of the European Bioinformatics Insititute told me the question was whether a computer can generate hypotheses that can be validated easily .
" A computer can propose experiments in combination with a hypothesis in such a way that the hypothesis can be validated in the experiment .
This is an important step , but still far away from what humans do . "
Automatic hypothesis generation may also have a role in identifying bridges between disciplines .
" [ Finding ] amazing links between facts coming from different disciplines is the most exciting possibility , " said Field .
" It is hard for working scientists to have more than a shallow knowledge of subjects not in their direct area of expertise and yet there are often many ' low hanging fruits ' at the intersection between two fields just ready for the picking . "
Within a given field of scientific enquiry , write Evans and Rzhetsky , unpublished connections are likely to represent " negative knowledge " – ideas considered implausible by scientists in that field .
Between fields , however , those unpublished connections might turn out to represent unanswered questions .
Automatic hypothesis generation is one way of finding those unanswered questions , they argue .
Linking disparate fields of research automatically will be no easy task , however , not least because different terms mean different things to different scientists .
Semantic integration – speaking a technical language that all the fields have in common – is important .
" There 's no question that semantic integration is a major challenge , " said Evans .
" But looking at associations between terms also ends up being an opportunity . "
Of course there are pitfalls with the automated approach .
Computers could find a promising pattern that leads to nothing , for example , or even suggest blind avenues .
" There is still a need for a scientist with a basic understanding of the problem to design the framework of such experiments and to interpret the results , " said Baugh .
Large - scale computation of this sort is already being applied to problems of " systems thinking " .
" This is when you have enough experts all thinking together across disciplines that the ' big picture ' emerges and you can solve ' big problems ' , " said Field .
" You can unravel a long trail of causality .
X causes Y causes Z etc ...
This is especially hard to do unless you have cross - discipline thinking . "
She said efforts to tackle global issues such as climate change and the long - term conservation of biodiversity could benefit from this approach .
If computers could start to pull together global patterns and trends , then make predictions or or suggest solutions , said Field , " it would be amazing " .
Watch this cyber space .
Do you deal with large datasets ?
Do you share Evans and Rhzetsky 's optimism for automatic hypothesis generation ?

Whistleblower website Wikileaks has made contact with the US government over claims that an American serviceman is one of its sources .
Soldier Bradley Manning has been held for three weeks without formal charge .
The US is investigating claims that he passed confidential information to Wikileaks .
Site editor Julian Assange told BBC
News that , so far , the US authorities have not yet been in touch with him .
He said that lawyers representing Wikileaks have been in touch with the US administration but that neither the Department of State nor the Department of Defense had made any attempt to approach the site .
In spite of the silence from the US , Mr Assange said he felt it was " important to have a channel open in these matters " .
No conversations could take place which might reveal the identity of any source , he added .
Mr Manning was identified as an alleged Wikileaks source after former hacker Adrian Lamo , in whom he had confided , contacted the authorities .
During a series of conversations conducted online , Mr Lamo claims that Mr Manning revealed he had passed 260,000 US diplomatic cables and two confidential military videos to Wikileaks .
US state department spokesperson PJ Crowley has said that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was examining one or more hard drives used by Mr Manning in Iraq .
Not proved
Wikileaks said it did not know whether Mr Manning , who had served in Iraq as an army intelligence analyst , was the source of the leak as the website does not keep personal records of the people who approach it .
One of the videos he allegedly leaked was released by Wikileaks in April .
It contained footage from a 2007 attack by US forces in Baghdad in which 12 people died including two Reuters employees .
In the immediate aftermath of Mr Manning 's exposure as the alleged source , reports appeared online claiming that the Pentagon was actively seeking Julian Assange .
On Monday he appeared as a panelist at a seminar on free speech held in the European Parliament and organised by the Alliance of Liberals And Democrats for Europe .
At a press conference ahead of the seminar Mr Assange spoke about the risk of action against Wikileaks by the US .
" The signals from the US authorities initially were mixed , however , they seem to clarifying now and I think the United States understands that it must obey the rule of law , " he told reporters .
When asked by the BBC whether he was concerned that other people involved with Wikileaks might be vulnerable he said : " We are concerned to make sure that our volunteers in particular are protected . "
We are concerned to make sure that our volunteers in particular are protected Julian Assange , Editor , Wikileaks
He added that Wikileaks would " always try and represent alleged sources " .
Mr Assange said that the site had contacted three lawyers to help defend Mr Manning .
Mr Manning has to date not been formally charged , and the Pentagon has declined to comment on the case while the investigation continues .
In an e-mail sent to press and supporters last week , Julian Assange said Wikileaks planned to release another US military video showing a 2009 attack on a village in Afghanistan in which numerous civilians died .
Given the current debate over whether Mr Manning is the source of the US military videos possessed by Wikileaks , Mr Assange said he was " a little more concerned " about this release .
He added that Wikileaks would " always try and represent alleged sources " .
However he was confident that Wikileaks could protect itself from any action by the US government .
Mr Assange had been heartened by a groundswell of support for Wikileaks from the online community as well as prominent journalists and politicians , he said .
" I 'm sure , through their support and the integrity and correctness of what we 're doing we 'll be fine . "
There were tons of games unveiled at E3 2010 , but none tickled my cortex as much as Rock of Ages , a downloadable game that stars a rolling boulder , a narrow alley , and two opposing castles .
It seems simple , and for the most part , it is .
But you have to look at the game from the perspective of the dudes doing it : ACE Team , the studio behind Zeno Clash , a brooding and visually compelling title that made no sacrifices to its artistic vision .
I fell in love with it hopelessly and am more than excited for Rock of Ages as a result .
I recently got a chance to talk to ACE Team 's Andres Bordeu about the game .
He revealed a host of essential info left out by its announcement trailer , including how we 'll defend our castle from the evils of the boulder ( yeah , it has a personality ) , and spoke at great length about the art , strategy , and multiplayer .
I 'm down with this .
My backyard in six months .
I 'm not sure what happened here , but I like it .
Just guessing that paper dudes do n't fair well when hit with rolling stone .
KILL .
Quick fact : war elephants are my one and only favorite animal .
Check out the face .
I think the Assassin is in the tree .
YES .
== TEASER ==Not really , because despite Rock of Ages being a very different game both share several elements which we prioritize when we develop our concepts .
To begin with , we wanted to once again deliver a game which is inspired by art that is not traditionally used in games .
Second , we wanted to deliver fresh game mechanics in a genre that is n’t straying too much from the classic formulas .
I think it ’s not a coincidence that the reaction we are getting from the unveiling of this game is being very similar to the one we got when we first showed Zeno Clash .
Many people are genuinely surprised by the original presentation and the fresh new approach to the tower defense genre .
The majority of our efforts are being focused on Rock of Ages , though we are working on another project which we are keeping under cover for now .
Andres Bordeu : During the development of ‘ Zeno Clash : Ultimate Edition ’ we started brainstorming all sorts of concepts of what we could do for a completely new game .
We want to continue bringing unique and exciting ideas to the gaming industry -- not stay anchored in the same place where we started .
We decided to create something for a broader audience that had an arcade feel and a strong multiplayer component while still keeping a fresh artistic approach .
All these concepts were planned exclusively for this game .
Yes , that is correct .
As I mentioned we want this game to have a broader reach than Zeno Clash .
The art style and presentation , while uncommon and atypical for a game , is still very recognizable by any player .
Who has n’t seen a classic painting from the Medieval or Renaissance periods ?
By also making it comical it has a much ‘ lighter tone ’ that can be enjoyed by anyone .
Zeno Clash was developed for a more niche audience .
As for game mechanics , this is also a game that will be much simpler to play .
Zeno Clash featured complex interactions in an already complex genre .
Rock of Ages should be much easier to pick up because it is designed around game mechanics that are very familiar to many players .
This does not mean that the game will be devoid of challenge .
We anticipate that there will be a strong learning curve and players will develop all kinds of different strategies to beat their opponents .
Many of us are fans of the Monty Python and their excellent short animations by Terry Gilliam .
When we started elaborating the concept for Rock of Ages , which was initially named just ‘ Boulder ’ , we thought that the visual style of those short animations would be an excellent match for our game idea .
We ’re obviously going to add a lot of our own ingredients to the mix so everyone can look forward to some really creative settings .
The game will feature art from the Ancient Greek , Medieval , Renaissance , Rococo & Romanticism periods .
We could decide to add other styles as DLC , but that ’s getting a little bit ahead of things .
The art will definitely be a very important part of the experience .
We want all our games to highlight in that area .
We are making sure that the artistic concept is reflected in all the audiovisual areas , so you can expect the same level of treatment to the music , the sounds , the menus , etc .
There are still a lot of things we have not revealed and I ’m sure people will be excited when they see the future materials we will be releasing .
I think it ’s going to definitely be one of those games that draws attention by how it looks .
Yes , both the castles and the boulders will have some sort personality .
It ’s not accidental that we rendered a face on our giant boulder .
The castle gate , which features a giant lion ’s head in the trailer , will also display some cool animations and interactions , but you ’ll have to wait a little more before we show any of those features .
The player will have full control of the boulder during the offensive portions of the game .
The offensive part plays somewhat like a ‘ Marble Blast ’ game only that you are rolling down an obstacle course designed by your adversary .
The most important difference from this game to other tower defense games is that you are protecting yourself from a single very powerful opponent instead of defending yourself from hordes of enemies .
Players will have to rely on both strategy ( placing defensive units ) and skills ( rolling the boulder ) to defeat their opponents .
We have eight “ categories ” each with 3 different units or structures .
One category is for defensive towers ; siege towers , tall towers ... these are static obstacles which slow down the enemy .
Another category is for moving obstacles ; you can place small herds of cows on the boulders path , or you can place elephants which will run towards the boulder .
There are also blowing structures which will try to blow the boulder out of the path .
Projectile shooting units like catapults , trebuchets and ballistae shoot and damage the boulder .
There are flying units , explosive units , etc .
I do n’t want to mention all of them yet , but there will be a diverse set of obstacles for the defending player to design creative combinations and traps , we want to make sure all units are different and are useful in different situations .
There will also be “ super - units ” which you earn by finding special items on the hill ( you cannot simply build them using your resources as you do with other units ) .
One of these super units is ‘ The Bull of Heaven ’ , a gigantic bull , twice as high than the tallest tower unit , and this bull is obviously very dangerous for the attacking boulder .
All your units , your defense towers , soldiers , catapults and war - elephants are expendable ; their only goal is to stop the enemy ball from hitting your castle gate .
Many of them might be crushed , but every bit of rock the enemy boulder looses when it collides your defenses is good for you , because it means a smaller boulder is going to crash your gate .
There are also some units which are trickier ; a blowing unit , a slippery floor or an explosive , these could drop the ball out of the path and make it fall into an abyss .
Once the castle gate is destroyed , there is nothing stopping the giant boulder from crushing the opposing team ’s king .
I think it is very satisfactory that after all the major destruction during the round , you get to squish the hopeless little king .
As I previously mentioned , the control over the ball is complete .
You can roll it in any direction and jump to attempt to avoid enemy defenses or even reach some hard to reach shortcuts .
You lose control of the boulder if you land a blow against the opponent ’s castle gate or you fall off the path .
During these moments the player has to spend time reinforcing his side of the hill .
The essence of the game is reaching the castle gate as intact as possible and in the less possible time .
The boulder will suffer damage on its way down the circuit and a cracked rock does n’t hit as hard as a solid one .
We want this game to have a strong multiplayer component .
We think people will really enjoy elaborating their own strategies and since the obstacle courses are designed by your adversary every run through a level will feel different depending on whom you are playing against .
We expect the game to develop a lot of competitiveness .
We do n’t know if it ’s going to be a ‘ healthy good sport ’ competitiveness or ‘ anything counts ’ kind of competitiveness , but we ’d definitely feel we ’ve accomplished our goal if we see people enjoying some intense matches in the future .
We ’re going to release more information about the multiplayer features and additional game modes in the future .
We ’re not ready to share them yet .
We anticipate that a match may vary between 5 and 10 minutes , but it ’s really early to say because we ’re still in mid development and not everything is functional at this point .
It may end up straying from those values .
The game will feature a single player campaign against computer controlled adversaries , but the highlight of the single player portion will be some awesome boss battles where you will get to battle some colossal creatures that are distinctive from each art period .
Each period will be composed by a set of levels where the boss is located in the last level .
Not all the platforms are confirmed , but we ’re aiming for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and PC Hopefully the people that dig it will have a blast playing against their friends .
The initial media and fan response has been very positive and we want to continue to surprise everyone .
The fans and the press really contributed to make Zeno Clash a recognizable title and we hope the same will happen with Rock of Ages .
If we can continue to amaze people with our new proposals we ’ll feel we ’ve done our job right .
We really believe we will be able to deliver something special , so we hope the players will think the same .
So , it is indeed going to be May 5 , as I wrote in breaking the news , last week .
The battle - lines are already being drawn – it is clear that there will be big money behind the campaign to stop change , and retain the status quo .
Beside the predictable nonsense from these wreckers , some of ‘ the forces of conservatism ’ are also ( rightly ) pointing out some problems with the government ’s plans – such as the reduction in seat - numbers , which is liable to be anti-democratic , especially in a country whose population is continuing to rise .
But it is important to be clear that , when it actually comes to the referendum , those problems will no longer be relevant .
Parliament will decide them one way or another , and the issue that goes to the people to decide on May 5 is simply whether to stick with FPTP or to change to AV .
That therefore is the main issue that ought to pre-occupy those concerned with the state of democracy in our kingdom , and with starting to take back Parliament .
That is the question on which each of us has to decide :
Which side are you on ?
There are those who take themselves to be radicals who oppose AV on the grounds of purism : on the grounds that it is not PR .
One such is Derek Wall , former Male Principal Speaker of the Green Party .
So , in terms of parties : on the No side are the Conservative Party and Labour tribalists , and maybe some Greens ( if the opposition to AV of Derek et al continues ) .
On the Yes side are the Liberal Democrats , Labour pluralists ( including Compass , the Millibands and Diane Abbott ) and certainly some Greens .
The Green Party will make its decision on where it stands at our Autumn Conference .
We are a small party , but it could be an important decision .
For , while the Lib Dems and Labour lost seats at this General Election , the Green Party entered Westminster for the first time .
There is some momentum behind us , and a lot of respect for our Leader , Caroline Lucas MP .
It seems to me that it would be extremely unfortunate if there were to be a group of ‘ PR purists ’ opposing AV on the grounds that it is n’t radical enough .
The grave danger is that , by dissing AV , such people will give respectable ‘ cover ’ to those implacably opposed to any reform of our electoral system .
Those who will benefit from such ‘ purism ’ will be Labour tribalists represented by the likes of Prescott , Burnham and Balls , and ( above all ) the Tories .
That is why I along with several senior elected Greens will be putting the case at a motion at our September Party Conference for supporting AV in the referendum .
AV eliminates the wasted vote argument , it largely eliminates tactical voting , it drastically reduces the number of safe seats .
It allows the electorate to express their preferences and thus potentially speeds up the process of parliamentary change at a time when Parliament desperately needs to be ready to respond rapidly to environmental change .
And it is a start .
It is a significant step in the right direction .
To stand in the way of it when the referendum comes will only benefit those such as Lord Ashcroft who are going to put their considerable resources behind the campaign to preserve the present system that has served them so well …

The band , with Gray ( far right ) won a Grammy Award in 2006
The death of Paul Gray , bassist for US metal band Slipknot , was due to an accidental overdose , an autopsy shows .
Toxicology tests showed a fatal level of morphine and fentanyl , a synthetic morphine substitute , in his blood .
Police said there was no evidence of a prescription for either drug .
His body was found by an employee at a hotel in Des Moines , Iowa , on 24 May .
The band , famous for their ghoulish masks , won a Grammy Award in 2006 for the song Before I Forget .
The autopsy also revealed signs of significant heart disease , police in Urbandale , a Des Moines suburb , said .
A spokesman for the Urbandale police said they were trying to find out how Gray obtained the drugs .
The spokesman said charges were possible .
The band formed in 1995 in Des Moines and remained based in the city .
The nine members of Slipknot wore Halloween masks in public and referred to other bandmates by numbers - Gray was number two .

( CNN ) --
A year ago Sunday , Neda Agha - Soltan died of a single gunshot wound to the chest .
Her last moments -- captured on a cell phone camera and shown around the world -- catapulted her into the symbol of the postelection reform movement in Iran .
Today , the Iranian regime 's crackdown seems to have driven protesters off the streets .
But the movement is not weakening , some analysts say .
Instead , it 's evolved into an online underground civil rights struggle , they say .
" I think they 're going to continue to move forward , whether in the form of a green movement or another type of movement , " said Karim Sadjadpour , a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
" It 's just , basically , this march of history . "
Agha -Soltan , 26 , was at an anti-government demonstration in Tehran when she was felled by a single bullet to the chest .
" She has been shot !
Someone , come and take her ! " shouts one man in the shaky cell phone video that has since been seen around the world .
The video then shows blood streaming from her mouth , then from her nose .
Her eyes roll to her right ; her body is limp .
A man , who had accompanied her to the rally , is then heard pleading with her by name .
" Neda , do not be afraid , do not be afraid , " he repeats .
Agha -Soltan was taken to a nearby hospital and , within a day , she was buried at Behesht Zahra , the city 's largest Muslim cemetery , on the outskirts of the capital .
Immediately afterward , she emerged as the face of the anti-government movement .
Even world leaders took notice .
" We 've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats and we 've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets , " said President Barack Obama .
Eight days before Agha - Soltan 's death , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory unleashed massive demonstrations in the country .
Thousands of green - clad protesters took to the streets , accusing the government of rigging the elections .
Iran 's leaders called the uprising a foreign - led plot to overthrow the regime .
It cracked down on the protesters -- with many killed and even more jailed .
Images of the bloody crackdown fueled worldwide outrage .
Agha -Soltan 's pictures are still carried on placards at rallies outside Iran .
" She will become the image of this brutality , and of the role -- the truly significant role -- that women have played in fighting this regime , " said Abbas Milani of Stanford University in California .
" I think that women are the unsung heroes of the last few years .
They are the ones who began chipping away at the authority , the absolute dictatorship of the mullahs . "
Iranian authorities continue to deny that security forces were responsible for killing Agha - Soltan .
Instead , they have offered at least three separate explanations .
They have blamed the CIA , terrorists and supporters of the opposition movement themselves .
One year after Agha - Soltan 's death , Iranian officials have yet to announce a single arrest in connection with her killing .
Here it is for you in plain sight .
The retailer , Progear is selling it for $ 11,199.00 New Zealand dollars .
Convert it to US and it goes for $ 7,637.99 .
The camera will have 32 MP and will most likely be a full frame sensor as the 1Ds series usually is .
Other features I ’m betting it will have is some phenomenal HD video , faster frame rates , Dual DIGIC 4 ( or even DIGIC 5 ) processors and there are bound to be loads of other stops Canon is going to pull out .
Edit :
The camera is now getting into medium format territory .
The Hasselblad H3dII 31 shoots at 31 MP .

Authors interview Authors :
Diane Johnson shares with Rosalia Gitau for Paris Writers News
Diane Johnson is a pretty big deal as far as writers go .
She ’s the type of writer with multi-book contracts and movie deals , the type of writer whose work you likely own without perhaps knowing it .
This is because Diane Johnson is a writer - that ’s it , she writes .
Writers who have reached her status are often celebrities in their own right - the kind of people you recognize sipping champagne with Lindsay Lohan in some very hip New York nightclub , shakily straddling their obligations of the pen with publicity .
But Diane Johnson seems to shun that attention .
She is a true academic parsing our profundity in life ’s seemingly mundane social rituals .
As she explains , she lives the life of a writer and not an artist .
Her coterie of work , rather than a reflection of her life , stands alone and speaks all for itself .
I met Diane Johnson at Les Editeurs cafe , an old haunt of the Saint - Germain writers ’ scene .
She ’s just finishing a Proust lesson with her tutor , in French of course .
* * * * * * * * * * * *
RG : What made you want to read Proust in French ?
DJ : Everyone wants to read Proust , I think .
You know , it ’s very amusing .
It ’s such a wonderful view of 19th century France and since I ’m interested in 19th century literature , generally , it ’s just kind of an addition to my life .
RG : What is your background ?
I heard you went to UCLA - is living in LA what got involved in screen - writing ?
DJ : I went to a woman ’s college in the mid-West , Stephens College , and then I went to UCLA for grad school .
I have n’t written many screenplays … only one that was made into a movie .
It was Stanley Kubrick ’s The Shining .
RG : How did you get involved with that project ?
DJ : Stanley Kubrick was thinking of making this horror film of my novel the The Shadow Knows , and so we got acquainted while we were thinking that over , and then he decided to do the Stephen King [ book ] but he just asked me if I would [ write the screenplay ] .
RG : Were you always a writer ?
DJ : I started as a child .
RG : You have obviously published a lot - how did that whole process come about ?
DJ : I was publishing already by the time I went to [ graduate ] school .
I had married quite young and had little children .
I was 19 [ when I married ] which was sort of the fashion in those days .
So I had these four little children and I needed a reason to get out of the house .
I took classes at UCLA , and if you take enough classes you get your PhD .
RG : And did you teach ?
DJ : Yes , I taught at Davis for a bunch of years .
I published a couple of novels [ whilst there ] .
RG : And how old were you when you published your first piece ?
DJ : I was about 28 , I was maybe 28 when I wrote it …
I ca n’t remember when it was published .
So I was continuing my creative writing at the same time that I was in graduate school .
RG : A lot of life has to do with chance .
I had n’t pursued writing for a long time because I feared risking everything on chance .
Do you think pursuing and succeeding at writing is a luck of the draw ?
DJ : There is luck involved .
In my case one of my professors at UCLA was a novelist so he knew an editor , and so on .
For me , it was not a difficult process .
RG : Did you just get to work then ?
DJ : Yes , it was more like that .
I did have the good luck of having a professor who knew an editor he thought highly of and he just kind of sent this novel to this editor .
So that was a ‘ big break ’ .
But after that , it was cumulative , just doing the work .
RG : After you published your first book , was there a lull until your next publication ?
DJ : No , I was just writing the novels and having a literally life .
Doing your work and publishing .
I write for the New York Review of Books so that ’s a sort of the critical side that I quite like .
RG : What have you critiqued lately ?
DJ : I have two assignments at the moment - one of them is about [ three ] books about marriage .
Elizabeth Gilbert is one of them - it ’s her second book , I guess - and the other is Lori Gottlieb , and [ the last ] is about a sociologist or statistician of some kind with statistics on American marriage .
RG : I have to say , I ’m not surprised that you were chosen to critique a handful of books about marriage .
In you ‘ trilogy ’ [ Le Divorce , Le Marriage , and L’Affaire ] you paint a very complex picture of marriage .
I found this interesting because you have been married for so long .
DJ : I would not have said that my books were about marriage at all - even when it is called Le Mariage …
I think that one observes .
The story in Le Divorce was a story I heard over and over again from other people about American girls who come to Paris , marry the Frenchman and either get dumped or break up for whatever reason and then they stay .
And so that was kind of a universal story .
But the things I write about I think about more as political : Americans abroad and what some of their assumptions are .
RG : Are we , as American women who move to Paris and fall in love with a Frenchman , doomed to repeat the same mistake ?
DJ : I do n’t think so .
Sometimes it works out …my daughter however is still married to her French husband .
They came here [ to Paris ] they lived together and they had kids and it seems pretty stable , I hope so .
It ’s lasted 20 years .
RG : So these books you ’re critiquing …
DJ : So , I wanted to actually ask you about something : what really has surprised me about them is the huge change of sensibility since I was getting married and settling down .
In , let us say , the ‘ world–as - described - by - Betty - Friedan ’ , where women were expected to stay home and if they worked , they would just work until they got married , or that they would have some career but not really after they had children .
It was more what we think of as ‘ traditional ’ .
And then with the sort of ‘ empowerment of women ’ , women now expect to work … and not only to work , but they expect to have children [ and ] to have careers .
But Lori Gottlieb presumes that women are now very fussy because they come from a position of strength , they have an agenda and if the guy does n’t quite measure up to this they will move on .
RG : Are you referring to the Atlantic Article [ by Lori Gottlieb ] about settling ?
DJ : It is .
It created a stir .
[ However ] what she is saying is nothing revolutionary : it ’s ‘ look around at the guy you have always liked that you ’ve been coffee with for ten years .
Yes , he ’s losing his hair but why not look again ? ’
RG : The reason it caused such a stir , I think , is because she was n’t just saying settle for whatever is around but rather look at the expectations you [ as women today ] have created .
It ’s not them , it ’s us …
DJ : That ’s Lori Gottlieb ’s [ idea ] , this idea of entitlement , but also self - regard .
People have been taught to think well of themselves and to not sell themselves short , there ’s a buzz - phrase which is escaping me .
It ’s not self - regard , it ’s self - esteem , that ’s it , that has gone too far and [ consequently ] people have unrealistic self - esteem .
In fact they ’re not seeing their own position … and then they ’re 30 and their biological clocks are ticking and then they ’re 40 and panicked and it has all these consequences that people have n’t thought through because they have unrealistic expectations .
RG : I ’m curious where these expectations come from .
DJ : Well , me too because it is a great change in sensibility among women since my time in college .
DJ : Where do you think that these women get these criteria ?
RG : Sex and the City .
They buy into the four single girls living in the city looking for love .
DJ : And having great clothes .
RG : If you ask young women today who is the male character on the show whom they prefer , they will almost always say Mr. Big .
For me , he was the worst of the lot .
If I met a guy like that on the streets , I would run .
DJ : What I ’ve got to do is rent some DVDs of Sex And The City .
RG : I think you ’ll better understand what these women want .
They run after these aloof men in the hopes that one day , he will turn around and say …
DJ : It is you I always loved .
RG : Funnily enough , that ’s actually how the series ended .
When Mr. Big finally tells the protagonist Carrie : ‘ you ’re the one ’ .
DJ : That is so interesting .
RG : Unlike the tidy ending of Sex and the City episode , in your books , you do a really good job of laying out a story with seemingly disparate elements that always seem to come together in a unique way at the end .
As a writer , do you start off with a plan ?
DJ : I think as a writer it helps to have as much of a plan [ as possible ] so you start out with clarity .
It ’s going to change and you ’re gong to make discoveries along the way and there will be a whole lot of changes … but to get yourself started and to know the basic thing , like the narrative , is important because otherwise you ’ve got an infinity to work with in terms of subject .
You should know your characters , where it ’s set and you should know basically what its about , and then maybe there ’s something else you want it to be about too , so … set up another kind of plot that ’s going to elaborate about some other issue - some related issue .
RG : Do you draw this out ?
DJ : I do because I like diagramming , so I try to make a little plan .
RG : Do you know all your characters ahead of time ?
DJ : Yeah , pretty much .
It helps to get them in place .
RG : You use a lot of recurring characters - do you have a favorite ?
DJ : No …I usually like [ all of ] them .
I bond with them and I do n’t like to give them up - even the villains .
RG : Just to tie up some loose ends : may I ask what happened at the end of L’Affaire - why did Amy Hawkins ( the book ’s protagonist ) suddenly disappear ?
She was n’t done with her studies yet .
DJ : No , she was n’t done with her studies yet , though she probably had to go back to her ‘ real life ’ and Paris had just been a fantasy .
She ’s got this on - going boyfriend that she ’ll see , I think it does say they will meet over the years .
I did n’t think that she should get married .
RG : So is this [ Paris ] a fantasy ?
DJ : Being a dot com millionaireness is ( smiling ) .
RG : One of the things I really like about L’Affaire is your discussion of French women and their toiletry rituals .
Do you do perform ‘ toiletry ’ as described in the book .
DJ : I suppose the more I ’m in France , the more I ’m in French life .
I do n’t think I have any perfume with me [ right now ] but yes , it becomes the ambience of the zeitgeist .
I think , you get comfortable with your Americaness and you realize you ’re not going to be French .
But then you find a good balance of taking the best of both .
RG : Do you have French girlfriends ?
DJ : Yes .
RG : What do you find different about your friendships with French women and other women .
DJ : They are a little more guarded .
And that may be just because they ’re more used to competition between women rather than sisterhood .
RG : Why do you think they ’re competing ?
DJ : For male attention .
I have this theory but I do n’t know if it ’s true because I do n’t really know the details … but it ’s true in both England and France that the divorce laws and basic protections for women are rather inferior to America .
And so , still a great part of their [ French women ] security is related to their relationship to men .
They pretty much have to get married or live together in some sort of [ arrangement ] .
They do n’t have security that we [ American women ] have , they do n’t have jobs as high - ranking .
[ Ffor example ] there are hardly any French female executives .
They just do n’t have as secure a place .
I think that ’s one of the things sort of in a transition now .
RG : And is that one of the reasons why the French women in your book seem as though they are settling - you often refer to them practical .
DJ : Yeah , I think so .
See what you think as you get to know more French women .
RG : What are you working on now ?
DJ : I ’m working on a kind of a memoir collection ; it ’s stuff I ’ve already written and someone said ‘ you should really put that together ’ .
So I started to put that together and I thought ‘ well , this is really interesting to do ’ .
It ’s a collection of short pieces that might be about different things like a Morgan car that I once had or a particular uncle or my mother ’s hometown and I ’m trying to make them fit together in a sort of way that will say something about the mid-West - which is where I grew up - and about the insularity of Americans .
RG : What do you mean by ‘ insularity ’ ?
DJ : Just the fact that most Americans - if you look at political movements in America , like the Tea Partyists - they are [ comprised ] generally [ of ] people who have never left America , who have no perspective of the world or how other societies might do things better .
Trains , for example , that ’s my example , in something I have written [ about ] .
They are just very very ‘ deleted ’ and this is some of the [ stuff behind the election of ]
George Bush - and that was a disaster for the country .
So , without sticking to that point specifically , I ’m trying to comment on the country .
RG : Do you see yourself as a writer more than an artist ?
DJ : I ’m a writer .
If I understand the distinction , I consider what I do art , because I consider writing an art .
I consider myself a professional writer … but it ’s about the work .
It ’s not about living the life of an artist .
And I agree that there are people who really want to live an artistic life maybe without doing the work .
My concern is not with the artistic life .
RG : I keep hearing people critique my writing saying that there is a restraint .
I wonder if I stopped living such a restrained life , would it be reflected in my work ?
DJ : If [ no restraint ] means taking a lot of opium and having opium dreams , that is not good - it ’s going to have the opposite effect on your writing .
Losing restraint in your writing is something you will have to learn .
I consider for example that there is something restrained in my writing .
But I could
say much more in my writing that I could say in person or in a social setting .
In other words , you can learn to be self - revealing , or frank , or expressive in writing .
RG : How did you learn that ?
DJ : You just get comfortable .
First , there are these social restraints , and then you learn to be less inhibited and more expressive just by doing it and bearing it in mind as a goal .
So I do n’t think you have to wear bohemian clothes .
If you feel like doing that some times , good .
But I do n’t think its necessary .
But if it is necessary then you ’ll probably do it .
But if it ’s not you - you ’re not going to pull it off anyway .
If you really feel all that inside and you ’ve been keeping it back , then you have to learn .
RG : Is that where your stories come from - a kind of internal bubbling that comes to the surface ?
DJ : I do n’t know where the impulse to write comes from , it comes from somewhere and writers all have it .
People all have some urge for self - expression .
RG : So what ’s next ?
DJ : I ’m going to write another novel , after I ’m done with the [ collection ] … I think it ’s going to be about an American going back to America , who has lived abroad for a long time and she goes back and finds that there are ‘ girls with lists ’ [ there now ] .
A bloodless coup to take control of an Arab Gulf state is being plotted by an unlikely alliance that includes a powerful firm of US lobbyists and a provincial English high - street solicitor .
Peter Cathcart , a 59 - year - old lawyer from Farnham , has been hired by the ousted crown prince of Ras al - Khaimah ( RAK ) in the United Arab Emirates to co-ordinate the plot aimed at returning him to power after seven years in exile .
Documents seen by the Guardian show that Cathcart has acted as a paid agent for Sheikh Khalid bin Saqr al - Qasimi in a multimillion - pound campaign to " undermine the current regime 's standing " and to force the leadership of the UAE in Abu Dhabi , which has powerful influence over the emirate , to " make a change " .
RAK is a strategically important part of the UAE , 50 miles from Iran across the Strait of Hormuz , through which 17 million barrels of oil are shipped each day .
Sheikh Khalid , 66 , was ousted by his father and brother as de facto leader in 2003 .
The campaign alleges the regime presents an international security threat because the kingdom has become " a rogue state and gateway for Iran " , allowing the shipment of weapons , including nuclear weapons parts , drugs and blood diamonds as well as military personnel and terrorists from al - Qaida and other networks .
Cathcart , a miniature steam train enthusiast and chairman of his local parish council who operates from modest offices in the outer London suburbs , cuts an unlikely figure in the plot , which involves highly paid US PR consultants , Washington lobbyists and former US - special forces strategists hired at a cost of at least $ 3.7 m ( £ 2.6 m ) .
They include BSKH , the lobbying firm which helped Ahmed Chalabi , the Iraqi politician who opposed Saddam Hussein and was widely blamed for providing unsubstantiated evidence about weapons of mass destruction used as justification for an invasion of Iraq .
It is not suggested that Cathcart 's involvement is unlawful .
The plotters have claimed the RAK regime is implicated in an alleged terror plot to blow up the world 's tallest building in Dubai , and a possible Iranian attack on US participants in the America 's Cup yachting race , due to take place in the emirate but later cancelled .
The campaign to return Sheikh Khalid to power comes amid international concern about Iran 's nuclear programme , and the deposed sheikh 's focus on links between RAK and Iran appears calculated to turn international opinion , particularly in Washington , against the family who rejected him .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , is among the US politicians including more than a dozen congressmen from whom Sheikh Khalid has sought support .
In February , he made a speech in Washington in which he stated : " I am troubled that the current regime has allowed RAK to devolve into a rogue state and strategic gateway for Iran .
Published reports in the Gulf region have repeatedly indicated that Iran has taken advantage of our free trade zones , using them as a transfer point to smuggle cargo , including arms , electronics , weapons parts , drugs and even humans to Africa , Europe and Asia . "
His US communications team insists the claims are " well sourced " , but they were rejected by the UAE embassy in London .
The UAE also denied the Sheikh 's claim that RAK has links to Iran 's nuclear programme and that a port in RAK has in effect become an Iranian base , allowing Tehran to avoid international sanctions .
" These appear to be old , scurrilous rumours which Sheik Khalid has made on numerous occasions , " a spokesman for the UAE said in a statement .
" His claims are baseless and without foundation and should be seen in the context of his long - standing dispute with his family .
We are surprised that these old allegations are now being rehashed once again . "
Sources close to the plot believe it is now entering its endgame .
Sheikh Khalid is understood to have returned to the UAE from exile in London last month and has been in Abu Dhabi meeting officials from the UAE federal government , they said .
The ruler of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan , is the UAE president and ratifies changes to the leadership of the emirates .
The plot has been under way since at least 2008 , according to the documents seen by the Guardian .
They show that Cathcart has overseen the disbursement of several million dollars to fund the plot and acted as an intermediary between PR consultants , lobbyists and Sheikh Khalid .
Cathcart has also met congressmen in Washington DC on behalf of the sheikh and oversaw requests for new appointments to the team .
On one occasion he was asked to approve win-bonuses for would - be US advisers of $ 250,000 per person if the sheikh returns to power .
Cathcart declined repeated requests by the Guardian to comment on his role .
Asked by the Guardian if " regime change " was a legitimate goal , the sheikh 's communications team replied : " If you believe in the peace , prosperity and security of the region and in protecting US national security interests , of course .
If you are pro-Iranian or believe that the questionable activities in RAK should be allowed to move forward without any concern , then you would probably not approve of our activities . "
Ryan North has been one of the long - term contributors to the webcomics community through Dinosaur Comics and later through the online advertising network he founded , Project Wonderful .
The latter came about when North was looking for an appropriate online ad network for his nascent website .
Unhappy with the choices , he decided to make his own based on what he wanted .
Frustrated with the Google Ads model ( pay based on views and clicks ) his idea was to essentially auction blocks of time on sites while giving publishers the right to control who is able to advertise on their site .
I had a chance to speak with Ryan over the phone about PW .
We specifically spoke about the values and ethics involved in creating an online network , respecting readers and how webcomics are connected to the principles of the print comics tradition .
Importantly , Ryan managed to complete this interview ( posted below in abbreviated format ) despite a child coming up to him and play - stabbing him in the park .
That ’s right , he was stabbed and he still wanted to talk about these things .
So you have certain standards for Project Wonderful , can you go through that process and reasoning ?
… Well we look at a site and we tell you this is what other advertisers have been willing to pay for this in the past .
You can figure out ‘ is this worth it ’ , based on information that ’s given upfront .
But we get tons of offers from people saying , ‘ hey can it look like we ’re paying a dollar but we ’re actually paying fifty cents ?
That would be great for us ’ .
And no , no , that ’s toxic to the network .
That ’s unfair to everyone else on the network .
But it ’s like this culture clash in the industry , I guess .
But yeah , when people are planning to join Project Wonderful we do a review of their site and we look for stuff like pop-ups , are there scamming links , are they doing sponsored content ?
I discovered this thing called sponsored content , which is awful .
It ’s blogs posting about whatever and suddenly they ’ll be posting about this great online casino they found .
And every time you see ‘ online casino ’ you know it ’s paid for .
It ’s weird , we get angry e-mails from people who are rejected saying ‘ how can you reject me , you ’re an advertising company ’ .
We ’re an advertising company , sure , but we… want to have sites that are … good .
And I see websites as having an implied contract between you and the audience .
You ’re saying look , you ’re giving me time and I ’m giving you entertainment or knowledge or something , and there ’s a back and forth there .
Like if you put up full screen pop-ups or obnoxious advertising you ’re telling your audience ‘ you ’re a commodity that I ’m selling ’ .
And it feels cheap and … gross ?
( laugh )
That does n’t stop you from doing advertising , it just means you do it in a way that feels reasonable .
So would that be part of the reason why you find the Internet to be an attractive place to build a community ?
Because you can filter out those unbecoming parts ?
Yeah , I ’ve talked about this with Dinosaur comics too .
The nice thing about websites is that they tend to be self - selecting .
And Dinosaur Comics would be a total failure as a newspaper strip because let ’s say 1 in 10 like it online , they tell their friends and it spreads and you get a substantial audience that loves it and that ’s fantastic .
For a paper , what you wind up with is one person who loves it and 9 people who complain to the paper that Dinosaur Comics is terrible .
You have to appeal to a mass audience .
And I think with Project Wonderful you have a lot of sites who do n’t like our model or , I do n’t know , they just think it ’s simple or limited or I do n’t know what .
I think it ’s a great model ( laughter ) .
It ’s hard to criticize here .
But , there are limitations to what you do .
And if you ’re in a situation and you think a website is unethical or doing shitty things you lose out on some business and you do n’t sell yourself out .
It ’s a network that we ’re trying to make ….
not …terrible .
A lot of advertising networks do n’t seem to mind doing terrible things if they ’re making money .
To shift gears slightly , a lot of these values we ’re talking about : transparency , openness , not bombarding people with ads , being true to yourself , it sounds like a lot of the ethics we see in comics , in both the underground and alternative tradition .
How do you see webcomics as an extension of that , or is it separate ?
I think there ’s definitely a relation between the two .
I mean webcomics is very much an indie phenomenon where you make your comic , you put it up and you do it all yourself and you ’re in full control , it ’s your creative vision .
And Project Wonderful is similar .
You put up the code for your site , you can choose which ads to carry , you can cancel what you want , but we go over the entire thing and you ’re never locked into anything you do n’t want .
No ads anymore , you can take the code off your site and that ’s it .
We ’re fine , it ’s designed to be flexible .
So there ’s definitely parallels in the way they work .
And I think the culture , at least in terms of online comics , is very community - based .
People talk to each other , link to each other , have parties and get along .
I like to think that Project Wonderful has that community aspect of comics by not being a faceless network but enabling people to upload pictures , have a profile , make it more of a community too .
That ’s an interesting way of framing it in terms of community and I really get that sense when you form a subreddit and it has 400 people in a couple of days .
In a way , this connects to the fanzines that comics emerged from , where people would post their addresses and communicate with those who had like - minded niche interests .
With that said , what do you think of the- not hostility - but separation between print and online ?
I think a lot of that is kind of built up .
I think … and this is going to sound terrible , it ’s a bit one - sided on the print side .
I think a couple years ago , yeah , there was a schism and you were either in print or online and they ’re different worlds .
But so many online cartoonists reach a point where they have 400 comics and it ’s super easy to just print them to make a book .
So you ’re moving to print so easily it ’s almost funny .
And if you print a book , it ’s not hard to make a website and have a couple years worth of material .
So it ’s not really entrenched camps , I mean there are some who are vehemently anti-online or anti-print .
It ’s kind of a non-issue , it ’s like asking people if they ’re pro painting or pro pencilling .
Well , whatever gets the job done .
What I think is more important is the sense of community .
I link to a lot of comics on the site , and it ’s basically saying ‘ if you like my site and my sense of humour , well I like these comics because they make me laugh ’ .
You ’ve already crossed one hurdle .
How do you go about building a community online ?
What are the steps you take , what are the values you need ?
I wish I had a failsafe answer for you ( laughter ) .
I used to have a forum I hosted called Truth and Beauty Bombs .
That was super awesome for 2 - 3 years , and then kind of awesome for 1 year and then not so great anymore .
And it ’s weird , the culture changed as more people joined , it ’s not just a group of friends it ’s a group of friends and some strangers .
Truth and Beauty Bombs became its own thing and I was like ‘ that ’s awesome , you guys can run with that ’ and it ’s no longer something I feel relates to the comic I guess .
But the thing on Reddit , I just made a subreddit and posted the link and so far it ’s been great .
I think my comic attracts awesome people … ( laughter ) and then they can talk to each other .
Speaking of that you have your big day on Saturday , your “ Look at Me I ’m Wearing an Awesome T - Shirt and so are you so Let ’s Be Friends ” day .
The name kind of changes every time it ’s mentioned .
But yeah , the idea is everyone wears their Dinosaur Comics t- shirt on Saturday and if you see someone else who does , you can take that as an invitation to go say hi and talk to them .
So it ’s sort of translating this community out of the computer and make the world we live in kind of special .
Because … it ’s kind of hard to talk to strangers , but here ’s a chance where if you see a stranger , you can say ‘ awesome , cool shirt ’ and you sort of have an in and it ’s this day where they ’re open to the idea .
I tried this once before on one day ’s notice last month and got a couple of e-mails saying that they made new friends basically and a lots of e-mails saying ‘ man , I wish I had more time , give me more notice ’ .
And so hopefully on Saturday we ’ll get some good stories out of it .
And you might sell some more t- shirts too .
That ’s what I was really worried about for the first one .
That ’s why I gave it one day ’s notice , because I did n’t want people to think I was trying to pull this transparent ploy to sell more t- shirts .
But then when people got back saying they wanted more notice I was like , alright , sure .
I mean you want to do something cool , but you do n’t want to do something self - serving even though it necessarily is .
I do n’t know , I kind of struggle with that .
Right , and that gets back to the values we talked about earlier , about transparency and honesty and how you want to honour your reader ’s trust .
Yeah , you ca n’t abuse that goodwill .
It ’s funny , I think I ’ll pick this one day to do it annually barring any disaster Saturday .
But I worry that readers who are in happy relationships can’t wear their shirts Saturday .
Well they can make new friends , right ?
Yeah , I guess I ’m worrying about the misanthropic readers I have ( laughter ) .
Well , they do have the other 364 days .
Yeah , one day is n’t too much to ask .
Thanks for your time Ryan .
No problem .

Just when you thought Arizona could n’t get any more provocative , or push any more of the federal government ’s buttons , it looks like America ’s 48th state may actually become the 15th state to adopt another very controversial law !
This proposed law , on the other hand , may actually make some people on the Left , as well as the Right , happy for a change .
I have my doubts about whether it will make those who put party above principle , or anyone employed by the U.S. Department of Justice happy , however .
While Arizona was getting tons of media attention related to the passage of its high profile immigration enforcement law , ( SB 1070 ) , the grassroots activists that were delivering more than 100 boxes of petitions containing 252,000 signatures to the Arizona Secretary of State ’s office received little .
But this week , Fox 11 Arizona ’s website reported :
“ Secretary of State Ken Bennett ’s office on Tuesday certified that organizers of the initiative campaign had turned in enough signatures to get the measure on the ballot . ”
What measure is he referring to ?
The Medical Marijuana Initiative , of course !
The initiative , which Arizona voters will soon have a chance to vote into law this November , would do seven things according to the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project ’s website :
Allow terminally and seriously ill patients who find relief from marijuana to use it with their doctors ' approval .
Protect these seriously ill patients from arrest and prosecution for the simple act of taking their doctor - recommended medicine .
Permit qualifying patients or their caregivers to legally purchase their medicine from tightly regulated clinics , as they would any other medicine — so they need not purchase it from the criminal market .
Permit qualifying patients or their caregivers to cultivate their own marijuana for medical use if a regulated medical marijuana clinic is not located within 25 miles of the qualifying patient .
Create registry identification cards , so that law enforcement officials could easily tell who was a registered patient , and establish penalties for false statements and fraudulent ID cards .
Allow patients and their caregivers who are arrested to discuss their medical use in court .
Keep commonsense restrictions on the medical use of marijuana , including prohibitions on public use of marijuana and driving under the influence of marijuana .
The AMMPP , which is a grassroots organization , has been devoted to passing a medical marijuana initiative in Arizona in November 2010 .
As they explain on their homepage :
“ Currently , seriously ill people who use marijuana on the advice of their doctor to treat illnesses such as cancer , AIDS , and multiple sclerosis are subject to arrest and imprisonment , simply for trying to stimulate their appetite or alleviate their pain . ”
Objections
People who often dismiss state laws allowing the use of medical marijuana always seem to argue that “ federal law trumps state law ” and that federal “ laws ” still prohibit the possession , use , cultivation or distribution of the plant , even for medical purposes .
It ’s true that federal “ laws ” make no exceptions for those who are sick and suffering , and the Feds have claimed universal jurisdiction , even over plants that are grown and consumed by patients in their own home .
But I wish more of these critics ( and all Americans for that matter ) , would take the time to ask the following question :
“ Which of the enumerated powers delegated to the federal government under the Constitution gives them the authority to prohibit the cultivation or use of marijuana at all , for any reason ? ”
It ’s a fair question , and I have yet to hear a satisfactory answer to it .
Michael Boldin , founder of the Los Angelesbased Tenth Amendment Center puts it this way :
“ An honest reading of the Constitution with an original understanding of the Founders and Ratifiers makes it quite clear that the federal government has no constitutional authority to override state laws on marijuana .
All three branches of the federal government , however , have interpreted ( and re-interpreted ) the commerce clause of the Constitution to authorize them to engage in this activity , even though there 's supposedly no ‘ legal ’ commerce in the plant .
At best , these arguments are dubious ; at worst an intentional attack on the Constitution and your liberty . ”
I know it ’s difficult for educated , reasonably intelligent people to understand how cultivating , harvesting and consuming a plant , all on one ’s own property , is actually in fact , a form of “ interstate commerce . "
However , that is only because it defies common sense , which is something the unelected , black robed demi-gods who preside over our federal court system do with ease almost daily .
We mere mundanes , on the other hand , lack their special wisdom , which allows them to interpret the words of the Constitution in a more innovative and sophisticated way .
Our duty is to stand in awe , bow our heads , wave incense before their judgement seats , and to suppress any impulse we might have to think critically about their interpretations .
Do n’t be fooled .
As far as medical marijuana is concerned , all marijuana that is produced within a state ’s boundaries and stays there , falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of that state !
Congressional Commerce Clause Abuse
It ’s funny that the same “ Commerce Clause , " which has been perverted by the federal government to prohibit the medical use of marijuana , was also the same clause that was twisted to justify passing the legislation that gave us Obamacare .
Fortunately , Arizona voters will have the opportunity to effectively nullify both Obamacare and the federal prohibition of medical marijuana this November .
Whether you approve of people using it for any reason , medical or otherwise , the fact of the matter is that unless and until the US Constitution is properly amended ( the way it had to be in order to enact alcohol prohibition ) , the federal government has no authority to interfere with seriously ill Arizonans who decide to use marijuana with their state government ’s permission .
The last time I checked , I discovered that although the 10th Amendment has been largely ignored by the Feds , it has not been officially repealed .
Just like all health care decisions , a person ’s choice to use or not use medical marijuana is a sensitive and highly personal decision .
It ’s a decision that should , at the very most , be decided by we the people , in our own state , not by politicians or unelected bureaucrats and judges in far off Washington , DC !
Like every other state - level measure designed to nullify unconstitutional acts of federal usurpation , the Arizona Medical Marijuana Initiative has the potential to be an unstoppable choice if the people of Arizona simply resolve to exercise their constitutional rights , with or without Washington , DC ’s permission .
The County Sheriff , America ’s Last Hope
But wo n’t the DEA come in and arrest people who are dispensing medical marijuana and / or even the sick and dying people who use it ?
Well , the answer to that question largely depends on whether or not your state officials , especially your elected county sheriff , allows them to get away with doing that .
More and more sheriffs and candidates who are running for the office of sheriff , are boldly coming out and frankly saying that they will not tolerate federal agents who would dare to harass and arrest the innocent people they have sworn to protect .
Bill Hunt , for example , is a candidate for sheriff of Orange County , CA .
He is part of a growing movement of incumbents and candidates seeking the elected office of sheriff who have seen the light .
This great awakening of sheriffs across the country has mostly been the result of the educational efforts of former undercover narcotics officer and two - term Graham County , AZ sheriff , Richard Mack .
Here ’s an excerpt from a recent interview with Bill Hunt :
Question : u201CIf you are elected sheriff and the DEA came into Orange County ( OC ) and asked OC Sheriff ’s Department to help shut down medical marijuana dispensaries , would you oblige them with support ?
u201D
Bill Hunt : u201CNo .
I would prevent them , it 's unconstitutional !
I 'm not an advocate for legalizing marijuana but on the other hand the sheriff is elected to enforce state laws .
So , if I 'm elected sheriff to this county enforcing state law and I 'm using federal law to circumvent state law , then I 'm not really being true to my office and my oath of office .
The sheriff can prevent the feds from coming in and doing that .
u201D
I can assure you , Bill Hunt is not alone .
There are sheriffs already in office , and many more running for office , who agree with him 100 % .
But even if you do n’t live in a county with a sheriff who takes his oath to support and defend the Constitution seriously ( give him a copy of Sheriff Mack ’s book and start educating him about his oath , or replace him with someone who is committed to keeping it ) , here is what the Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP ) has to say about the matter that is very optimistic :
“ Even within the confines of federal law , states can enact reforms that have the practical effect of removing the fear of patients being arrested and prosecuted under state law  as well as the symbolic effect of pushing the federal government to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana .
Federal laws still apply to patients .
While the federal government does not have the resources to arrest , try , and incarcerate a significant number of small - scale medical marijuana users and growers , the federal government has raided some large - scale medical marijuana distributors in California .
However , because 99 out of 100 marijuana arrests are made at the state or local level , state medical marijuana laws give patients 99 % protection . ”
The Will Of The People And The Power Of The States
Take a step back and look at the big picture for a moment .
What the MPP says about enforcement of the federal laws criminalizing medical marijuana also applies to other unconstitutional federal laws that states might decide to nullify .
Some examples are : Obamacare , Cap and Trade , federal regulations on firearms manufactured and kept within state boundaries , the federal plan to ban incandescent light bulbs , or federal regulations that might prohibit the sale and consumption of raw milk .
All of these have to actually be enforced by someone .
If the people of a state choose to ignore the federal government ’s unconstitutional acts of usurpation , which it mistakenly refers to as “ laws , " and their state government stops assisting the Feds in their enforcement efforts , the reality is that the federal government does not have the resources or manpower to investigate , arrest , try , and incarcerate a significant number of those people who choose to ignore illegitimate federal edicts and instead exercise their constitutional rights .
The truth is that when enough people within a given state begin to form a consensus that certain federal laws forced upon them are unconstitutional and therefore illegitimate , and a majority of their government officials at the state and local level agree with and support them , then the idea that Thomas Jefferson expressed so clearly in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , will be actualized :
" … whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force … ”
Let ’s make it so .

Rep. Barney Frank ( D. , Mass . ) and Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn . ) said they believed a final deal on the new package regulating the financial sector would be completed soon , but talks hit snags Thursday .
Aides said they believed a deal would still get done but added that the process was slower than expected .
The most divisive issue was a provision backed by Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D. , Ark. ) that could force banks to spin off their derivatives businesses .
Many New York Democrats and several dozen business - friendly Democrats have said the provision , known as " 716 , " needs to be removed .
" It would be impossible for me to vote for a bill that contains that provision , " said Rep. Michael McMahon ( D. , N.Y. ) .
The House version of the bill passed in December by roughly 20 votes , meaning a small number of defections could imperil the bill .
Congress is currently trying to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the overhaul bill , and still hopes to complete that process in the next few days .

IT ’S a gorgeous Friday evening .
There ’s a breeze off the Hudson River , and the single best place to be  every sailor knows  is out on the water .
But you , who would n’t know port from starboard or rudder from tiller , can only gaze longingly at those bobbing , darting boats on the horizon .
You do n’t know anyone with a boat and you do n’t know how to sail .
Get to Nyack , on the Hudson 25 miles north of Manhattan , and stand on the dock of the Nyack Boat Club before a scheduled race .
“ There ’s always people looking for crew  you would definitely find a ride , ” even without any experience , said Tom Lawton , who sails a 17 - foot Thistle , one of the nation ’s top 10 fastest such vessels .
The club ’s regular races are Wednesdays from 5:30 until dusk , and Sundays at noon .
Despite its blue - blood reputation , sailing is for everyone .
Owning and storing a boat may cost thousands of dollars a year , but aside from membership fees at some clubs ( not Nyack ) , crewing costs nothing when a skipper invites you aboard .
What you do need are the will to learn and a boat in need of a crew .
And “ it ’s definitely not only a young person ’s game , ” said Mr. Lawton , who is 33 and has been racing sailboats for 12 years .
“ The average keelboat racer is in his 60s , and we have an active racer at our club who ’s in his 90s . ”
I highly recommend Stephen Dawley .
I had complete confidence in Mr. Dawley from day one .
I was impressed by his professionalism and courtroom demeanor .

As the Beijing city government tore down historic districts to build a bright and shiny Olympic capital for 2008 , Ni Yulan became famous for helping her neighbors to defend their homes or claim compensation .
She paid a heavy price for standing up to developers and local officials ; her life became a cautionary tale of the risks a Chinese citizen takes if she stands up for her rights .
The authorities jailed her , beat her badly , and stripped her of her lawyer ’s license .
And now , ironically , the disabled former lawyer finds herself without a home .
But not alone .
Since her release from prison 10 weeks ago , hundreds of supporters and sympathizers have rallied round Ms. Ni and her husband Dong Jiqin , offering them money , food , and clothes .
“ Without their help we could not have survived , ” says Mr. Dong .
“ Nothing we have is really ours , ” adds Ni . “ Everything has been donated by other people . ”
“ Everything ” comprises a couple of bags of clothes , a cellphone , and some books , stacked in the cheap hotel room where police dropped them off three weeks ago , apparently to keep them out of the public eye .
Before that , the couple had been camped in a public park where they had attracted the attention of a documentary filmmaker and hundreds of people who saw his film on the Web .
It is not clear if anyone is paying for the hotel room .
Ni and her husband do not dare go out together for fear they might return to find their few belongings on the street .
But Ni says she is “ OK here , it 's not too bad , ” while she ponders her uncertain future .
‘ Obstructing public business ’
Ni first got into trouble as the Beijing government began the city ’s Olympic makeover .
She was detained by the police in 2002 for filming the forced demolition of a client ’s home , and was beaten so badly on the back and legs she has not been able to walk without crutches since .
A few months after her release , she petitioned the Beijing city government , seeking redress for her injuries .
Instead she was arrested , charged with “ obstructing public business , ” and sentenced to one year in jail .
The conviction meant that she was disbarred from ever working as a lawyer again .
But when she was released , she returned to her work as a housing rights activist .
Four months before the Olympic Games opened in August 2008 , a demolition crew showed up at Ni’s house and knocked down a surrounding wall .
She protested , and was again arrested on a charge of “ obstructing public business . ”
In prison and without a home
This time she got two years .
She was behind bars when her home was demolished entirely in November 2008 .
“ Nobody from the district government or from the developers came to talk to us about demolition , not even once , ” says Dong .
“ Nobody offered us any compensation . ”
Nor could Dong rescue any belongings from his home before the bulldozers moved in , he complains .
“ The police dragged me away . ”
He began sleeping in the streets .
His wife meanwhile , in the Beijing women ’s jail , refused to admit her guilt .
“ So they took away my crutches and forced me to crawl on the ground , ” Ni says .
“ I was not allowed to hold onto anything to support myself as I moved around . ”
Only the intercession of foreign diplomats with prison authorities , says Ni , won her the right to use her crutches again after a year .
Released in April ,
Ni found herself with no home , no income save her husband ’s teacher ’s pension , no job , and no immediate likelihood of finding one , given her political notoriety .
So she and her husband set up a tent in a central Beijing park .
“ I ’m not surprised ” by the number of people who rallied round the couple , says Ni . “ They are people whose own homes were demolished .
And the help was also a protest against the officials who tortured me in jail . ”
Activists gathering strength
Ni draws hope from the unusual show of public solidarity .
“ People nowadays have a much stronger sense of law , ” she says .
She also draws succor from Article 41 of the Chinese Constitution , not that it has done her much good .
All citizens , the article reads , have “ the right to criticize … any state organ or functionary .
No one may suppress such complaints … or retaliate against the citizens making them . ”
Ni counsels everyone who comes to her for help to commit the promise to memory .
“ More and more people are speaking up for fairness and justice , ” Ni believes .
“ One day they will stop allowing others to decide their fate . ”

The entire volunteer firefighter department of a B.C. Okanagan town has been handed a bitter punishment after admitting to stealing a number of beer kegs from a burning building earlier this spring .
Oliver Mayor Pat Hampson told ctvbc.ca each of the more than 30 members has agreed to a two - week suspension .
The penalties follow a May 23 fire that destroyed the Mesa hotel , from which firefighters removed at least six kegs of beer during the blaze .
At least two kegs were consumed in the local fire hall after the fire was extinguished .
Initially only two members were suspended , but an RCMP investigation revealed more people knew about the theft .
" They came forward and said they wanted to take full responsibility and stand together as a group , " Hampson said .
" Once we knew that more people were in the loop we knew we were going to have to approach things differently . "
Oliver city council originally recommended three - month suspensions for the members , but that decision has since been rescinded .
The suspensions will be served in two - week rotations so the community can ensure there will be enough firefighters .
Hampson , himself a retired fire chief , said the incident has affected the morale of the tight - knit group .
" They recognize what happened was stupid , " he said .
" They were just really pumped from the fire .
It 's unfortunate that this has happened . "
The members sent a cheque to recoup the cost of the beer but Hampson says to his knowledge it has not been cashed .
The group was also forced to write a letter of apology to the hotel 's owners .
City council has implemented a ban on firefighters drinking any liquor without a permit in town buildings in response to the controversy .
Hampson says the city hopes it can put the incident in the past and move forward .
" They 're a really good crew , " he said .
" There will always be some people who will question what happened but they 're really well respected in the community .
I want us to move forward now . "

Why is nobody talking about the Afghanistan adventure as a cause of our plunging recession ?
Or at least citing the 30 - year - old endless war as a major contributory factor in wasting our money to " nation - build " in the Hindu Kush while our own country falls to pieces on food stamps , foreclosures and child poverty – one in five kids – that would put the world 's poorest nations to shame ?
Iraq was George Bush 's war .
But , as Republican party chairman Michael Steele correctly says , " Afghanistan is Obama 's war of choice " , and a losing proposition .
Historically , Bush and Dick Cheney merely toyed with Afghanistan while visiting shock and awe on Iraq .
But President Obama is really , really serious about it .
He told us so on his campaign trail , but most of us refused to believe him .
We told ourselves : oh , he 's a closet pacifist , or he 'll somehow find a way out of the impasse , thus sealing a devil 's pact with our own consciences .
Obama 's " way out " is to dig deeper in so that he 'll be able to get out , it 's said .
Where have we heard that before ?
Exit strategy , my foot .
Obama is a willing prisoner of his generals , the latest four - star foot - in - mouther being General George Casey , army chief of staff , who a few days ago confessed to CBS News that the US could face another " decade or so " of persistent conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan .
( He then fudged it , but the cat was out of the bag . )
Our Afghanistan war , which began in 1980 under the Democrats ( by weaponising Afghan resistance to the Soviets ) , and is now truly a bipartisan war , is as bankrupt as our economy .
No connection ?
None that I can hear from Republicans or Democrats and the " liberal base " .
The war without purpose or common sense is simply a given , like the weather .
Other than a few lonely " wingnuts " like Florida congressman Alan Grayson ( who introduced a bill titled " The War Is Making You Poor " ) , the antiwar Texas libertarian Ron Paul and Illinois 's Tim Johnson , hardly anybody in public life dares to make a connection between teachers ' pink slips , personal bankruptcies ( 6,000 a day now ) , our rotting infrastructure , lengthening queues at unemployment offices , child poverty … and the war .
You wo n't hear a peep from mainstream liberals such as Keith Olberman or Rachel Maddow .
Nor , when Pentagon - funded war industry jobs are on the line , from any of the congressional liberals in my Southern California delegation such as Henry Waxman and Maxine Waters , who , after routine grumbling , just voted for yet another $ 30bn for the lost war that shores up our local weapons and aerospace industries .
Nobody knows whether , if the Iraq - Afghan wars came to a miraculous stop and we shipped the troops home tomorrow , leaving the homegrown Pashtun and Hazara factions to fight it out among themselves , the money would automatically return to our failing economy .
But it 's a question worth asking out loud .
In 2008 Obama Democrats junked the war as an election issue in favour of the economy , and they won by avoiding as a political third rail any connection between the trillions spent fighting colonial wars in the Middle East and the billions we refuse to spend on our own people .
As a people we Americans are hooked on a permanent war economy that only here and there , in drips and drabs , creates immediate jobs while undermining any long - term possibility of recovery .

WASHINGTON  Fresh off a string of victories in the courts and Congress , the National Rifle Association is flexing political muscle outside its normal domain , with both Democrats and Republicans courting its favor and avoiding its wrath on issues that sometimes seem to have little to do with guns .
The N.R.A. , long a powerful lobby on gun rights issues , has in recent months also weighed in on such varied issues as health care , campaign finance , credit card regulations and Supreme Court nominees .
In the health care debate this year , for instance , the N.R.A. ’s lobbyists worked with the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , to include a little - noticed provision banning insurance companies from charging higher premiums for people with guns in their homes .
The N.R.A. worked out a deal last month exempting itself from a proposal requiring groups active in political spending to disclose their financial donors .
Its push this spring for greater gun rights in the District of Columbia served to effectively kill a measure  once seemingly assured of passage  to give the district a voting seat in Congress .
The first time we landed in a futuro - Asian city was during the original Deus Ex , while we were in pursuit of a hacker called Tracer Tong .
It was n't all work though .
During the search we took some time out and went to a Triad - run club called Lucky Money .
Here we bought an Australian NPC countless drinks in an attempt to seduce her , then gave up and hammered the space bar so we could jump up and down on the dance floor in front of a big mirror .
Well , that 's what I did anyway .
What with it being Deus
Ex you probably went about it in an entirely different way - perhaps involving extreme violence , air ducts , or a code you found on a datapad in the toilets .
In its prequel , Deus Ex : Human Revolution , you 'll land on the bottom layer of a double - decker futuro - Asian city : an island called Heng Sha that lies just off the coast of Shanghai .
It 's a Victoria Sponge of an urban conglomeration , the silicon valley of human augmentation , and you 're here to track down another hacker .
The only information you have to go on is that there 's a man called Tong who runs a downtown ( and below town ) club called The Hive who has some information , as well as ringing a bell or two .
While you 're there you might even be able to dabble in some extreme violence and air ducts , and there 's certainly a datapad with a code on in the toilets .
The presence of Australian NPCs and mirrors is yet to be confirmed .
The more things change , the more they seem to stay gloriously the same .

And that - somewhat early on in what will be a glowing preview of Deus Ex : Human Revolution , by the way - is the message I want to convey .
This is , recognisably and joyfully , a true Deus Ex game - we can stop worrying and start tentative negotiation with the hype train .
When you see the game in motion you find yourself breathing sigh of relief after sigh of relief at the tiniest of things - from the way the screen looks after you 've hacked a computer and are fiddling with security feeds , to the way a strength augmentation will let you pick up boxes that are in your path .
Sure , a 20 - minute preview presentation of the nerfed and agoraphobic Deus Ex : Invisible War may well have featured box movement and correctly represented CCTV too - but with DX3 you can't escape the feeling that Eidos Montreal knows what made the original such a classic , and the follow - up a disappointment in comparison .
Weaponry appears satisfying and chunky - but non-lethal boomsticks will be available for pacifists .
It helps , of course , that the game is utterly beautiful and its world painstakingly created .
As you descend the metal steps into one of Shanghai 's main streets you see that it's an area where the Eidos Montreal team is letting itself go full - on Blade Runner .
The narrow , neon - streaked avenue is bathed in mist and smoke while a huge number of characters get on with life beneath the moving video - adverts that stretch off into the sky - from winking Asian ladies selling fizzy drinks to a solemnly glowing butter - like spreads .
Below , pedestrians make their way through the streets , heavily armed cops make their patrol , prostitutes ply their wares on street corners and shifty guys leaning on walls look on over the scene .
It 's a sight that genuinely takes your breath away .
As does ( having either beaten up the doorman , beaten him in verbal banter , snuck round the back , gone through the sewers or - rather boringly - paid your entry fee ) the inside of The Hive club - where a good 50 NPCs dance , gyrate , order drinks and pose in stunningly realised environs .
Turns out that we have come a long way from jumping up and down in front of the Lucky Money mirror after all .

The proton seems to be 0.00000000000003 millimeters smaller than researchers previously thought , according to work published in the July 8 issue of Nature .
The difference is so infinitesimal that it might defy belief that anyone , even physicists , would care .
But the new measurements could mean that there is a gap in existing theories of quantum mechanics .
" It 's a very serious discrepancy , " says Ingo Sick , a physicist at the University of Basel in Switzerland , who has tried to reconcile the finding with four decades of previous measurements .
" There is really something seriously wrong someplace . "
Protons are among the most common particles out there .
Together with their neutral counterparts , neutrons , they form the nuclei of every atom in the Universe .
But despite its everday appearance , the proton remains something of a mystery to nuclear physicists , says Randolf Pohl , a researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany , and an author on the Nature paper .
" We do n't understand a lot of its internal structure , " he says .
From afar , the proton looks like a small point of positive charge , but on much closer inspection , the particle is more complex .
Each proton is made of smaller fundamental particles called quarks , and that means its charge is roughly spread throughout a spherical area .
Physicists can measure the size of the proton by watching as an electron interacts with a proton .
A single electron orbiting a proton can occupy only certain , discrete energy levels , which are described by the laws of quantum mechanics .
Some of these energy levels depend in part on the size of the proton , and since the 1960s physicists have made hundreds of measurements of the proton 's size with staggering accuracy .
The most recent estimates , made by Sick using previous data , put the radius of the proton at around 0.8768 femtometers ( 1 femtometer = 10 - 15 meters ) .
Small wonder
Pohl and his team have a come up with a smaller number by using a cousin of the electron , known as the muon .
Muons are about 200 times heavier than electrons , making them more sensitive to the proton 's size .
To measure the proton radius using the muon , Pohl and his colleagues fired muons from a particle accelerator at a cloud of hydrogen .
Hydrogen nuclei each consist of a single proton , orbited by an electron .
Sometimes a muon replaces an electron and orbits around a proton .
Using lasers , the team measured relevant muonic energy levels with extremely high accuracy and found that the proton was around 4 percent smaller than previously thought .
That might not sound like much , but the difference is so far from previous measurements that the researchers actually missed it the first two times they ran the experiment in 2003 and 2007 .
" We thought that our laser system was not good enough , " Pohl says .
In 2009 , they looked beyond the narrow range in which they expected to see the proton radius and saw an unmistakable signal .
" What gives ?
I do n't know , " says Sick .
He says he believes the new result , but that there is no obvious way to make it compatible with years of earlier measurements .
" Something is missing , this is very clear , " agrees Carl Carlson , a theoretical physicist at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg , Va .
The most intriguing possibility is that previously undetected particles are changing the interaction of the muon and the proton .
Such particles could be the " superpartners " of existing particles , as predicted by a theory known as supersymmetry , which seeks to unite all of the fundamental forces of physics , except gravity .
But , Carlson says , " the first thing is to go through the existing calculations with a fine tooth comb . "
It could be that an error was made , or that approximations made in existing quantum calculation simply are n't good enough .
" Right now , I 'd put my money on some other correction , " he says .
" It 's also where my research time will be going over the next month . "

Just outside Phoenix , Arizona , sits a field of dishes reflecting the hot desert sun .
Pulling up to the humming devices , installed by Stirling Energy Systems ( SES ) and Tessera Solar , the cars passing by on an adjacent road are dwarfed by their size .
This is the Maricopa Solar project , a 1.5 - megawatt ( MW ) array of SunCatcher Systems ( also known as the Stirling Dish Engine ) .
In January NTR plc , which owns both SES and Tessera Solar , opened the plant after breaking ground just four months earlier .
Maricopa Solar is the first commercial project for the SunCatcher concentrating solar power ( CSP ) technology , which was designed and manufactured by SES .
The SES SunCatcher is a 25 - kilowatt solar power system that uses a 38 - foot high , mirrored parabolic dish combined with an automatic tracking system to collect and focus the sun ’s energy onto a Stirling engine to convert the solar thermal energy into grid quality electricity .
Maricopa Solar is comprised of 60 SunCatcher dishes and will bring energy to Salt River Project ( SRP ) customers in Greater Phoenix , Arizona .
The SunCatchers unveiled at Maricopa Solar were manufactured and assembled in North America , mostly in Michigan by automotive suppliers .
Parts for the SunCatcher dishes are also on track to be made by Linamar Corp. in Canada , which has said that it is expanding its local workforce by 1,200 people in large part to manufacture parts for SES .
The project is the result of a long development process for Stirling and Tessera .
SES has been working for more than two decades to perfect the SunCatcher ’s technology to make it utility - friendly .
The company experienced many technical delays along the way , raising a lot of skepticism from people in the industry who feared that the technology was being over hyped .
Invented in 1816 by Robert Stirling , Stirling engines use air , helium or hydrogen , which is sealed inside the engine .
The Stirling cycle needs an external heat source , which could be either solar or biomass .
The heat moves the gas from a hot side to a cold side , expanding , contracting and pushing pistons .
There are no exhaust valves and no combustion takes place inside the engine ’s cylinders .
High volume manufacturing of the SunCatcher is expected to begin later this summer and Tessera Solar ’s vice president of development , Felicia Bellows said that the company expects to break ground on utility - scale projects late this year in California and Texas .
She said that despite long backlogs for transmission permitting , especially in California , where a new project could be in the queue for three years before getting permits , Tessera ’s projects are on track .
“ Everything is based on permitting right now , if everything moves as planned , Imperial Valley solar is the project that is most likely to come online first , followed by or even possibly preceded by the Western Ranch facility in Texas , ” she said .
SES has been talking about developing large projects for years , with little to show for it .
The company said it would have 300 MW developed by this year .
It only has 1.5 MW .
But with backing from a larger energy company , SES and Tessera officials are still talking about building large projects .
According to the company , the first project in the Imperial Valley will be a whopping 750 - MW , with the first 300 - MW contracted under a power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric near El Centro , California .
The second , Calico , is an 850 - MW project with Southern California Edison near Barstow , California ; and Western Ranch is a 27 - MW project with CPS Energy in West Texas .
Given the company ’s earlier claims , it remains to be seen whether they can pull it off .

“ If politics could force its way into my life in such a vicious and chilling manner , I felt , then I had better find out a bit more about it , ” he writes .
He became , in Mr. Fenton ’s words , “ the second most famous person in Oxford ” ( the first was a student playwright named Mike Rosen ) thanks to his fearsome debating skills and his willingness to attend every left - wing demonstration within 500 miles .
Once Mr. Hitchens leaves Oxford , “ Hitch - 22 ” is off to the races , detailing his early years as a literary journalist in London , his budding friendships with Mr. Amis and Mr. Fenton and Clive James ( among many others ) , and his Zelig - like ability to be in international capitals when trouble was brewing .
“ One of the juiciest pleasures of life is to be able to salute and embrace , as elected leaders and honored representatives , people whom you first met when they were on the run or in exile ” or prison , he writes .
In the early 1980s  not long after he called Margaret Thatcher “ sexy ” in print  Mr. Hitchens moved to America .
His drift away from the left began in 1989 , after the fatwa against Mr. Rushdie .
Mr. Hitchens felt that many on the left acted cowardly , blaming Mr. Rushdie for the response to his fourth novel , “ The Satanic Verses , ” and rationalizing the reaction of Islamic extremists .
This drift continued after 9/11 .
“ When you have seen the Pentagon still smoldering across the river , from the roof of your own apartment building , you are liable to undergo an abrupt shift of perspective that qualifies any nostalgia for Norman Mailer ’s ‘ Armies of the Night ’ or Allen Ginsberg ’s quixotic attempt to levitate the building , ” he writes .
He supported the invasion of Iraq , in large part , because of his sense of the wickedness of Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Before long in this book he is traveling with Paul D. Wolfowitz , a neoconservative in the Bush administration and one of that war ’s architects , and referring to “ my new friend Michael Chertoff , ” then President Bush ’s secretary of homeland security .
“ An autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful , ” George Orwell , one of Mr. Hitchens ’s literary touchstones , wrote .
“ A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying , since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats . ”
Mr. Hitchens passes this test , if only by a nose .
“ Hitch - 22 ” has its share of words like “ embarrassing ” and “ shame ” and “ misgiving . ”
He is bitter about the way the Iraq war was actually conducted .
And he ruefully admits he has been a less than stellar father to his own children .
Tens of thousands of Italians took to the streets Friday to protest public spending cuts that are part of a tide of government austerity washing over Europe .
Demonstrators demanded that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi modify his plan to freeze public - sector salaries and slash local government funding , a tough retrenchment that he says is necessary to bring down Italy ’s budget deficit and bolster confidence in the battered euro .
The protest came a day after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators turned out in France to denounce a move to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 .
Germany , Portugal , Spain and Greece are all grappling with rising discontent over tough new public spending regimes .
Berlusconi ’s austerity plan for Italy , which includes a 10 % budget cut across government departments , is expected to save $ 30 billion .
Presented last month , the plan took some observers by surprise because Berlusconi had insisted for weeks beforehand that Italy did not face the same kinds of deficit and debt problems as Greece .

Union activists say they recognize the need to reduce Italy ’s budget deficit but that the axe falls hardest on those who can bear it the least .
Angry workers walked off the job for hours Friday , shutting down public transport in some areas .
“ We say no to this budget .
It is wrong , unjust , it stunts growth , it does not kick - start production , it does n’t touch the rich , and it punishes workers , ” union leader Fulvio Mammoni told thousands of protesters in Naples .
The outpouring of anger in cities such as Rome and Milan came as leaders of the Group of 20 nations gathered for a summit in Canada , partly to debate the wisdom of tightened government spending at a time when many of the world ’s biggest economies are still struggling to stay out of recession .
President Obama has asked the G - 20 countries not to risk killing the fragile global recovery through too much austerity too soon .
But many of Obama ’s European counterparts have politely disagreed with his analysis , contending that balancing their books must come first , particularly with international investors breathing down their necks .

While this has been especially true among the nations that use the euro , because of the recent loss of investor confidence in the currency , even countries outside the Eurozone have opted to go down the path of government cutbacks .
This week , Britain ’s new Conservative - led ruling coalition unveiled the harshest budget the country has seen since the early 1980s .

Short - haired bumblebees were due to be flown from New Zealand and re-introduced to Britain to tackle pollination crisis
An " international rescue mission " to tackle Britain 's pollination crisis has suffered a setback after a shipment of bees due to be imported into the country died just days before their release .
Natural England , the government 's countryside agency , chose the short - haired bumblebees from New Zealand because they were originally from the UK , but have since become extinct in their homeland .
But less than two weeks before the selected bees were due to be flown over and released on Friday , scientists say they have died in hibernation .
The setback is an example of the problem conservationists are increasingly warning of : that once a species has been destroyed in its local habitat , it is very hard to restore it - a strategy they fear many rely on when they are pushing through developments and other threats to biodiversity .
However , Natural England said the deaths would only delay the re-introduction project , which is now planned for next summer , and they were confident it would eventually succeed .
" An expedition to New Zealand will take place this November to collect queen [ bees ] to rear , and the next generation of queens will be returned to the UK the same time next year for release , " said a statement from the agency .
" Over the next six months , work will concentrate on creating more habitat for bumblebees , perfecting the rearing technique in New Zealand and raising the profile of the importance of bumblebees with local communities .
This is a long - term project and we hope for many future releases . "
The short - haired bumblebees were transported to New Zealand in the first refrigerated lamb ships in the late 19th century , to pollinate crops of red clover to help new emigrant farmers .
They have clung on in small numbers , but are unprotected and under threat .
The plan to bring them back to the UK , where they were declared extinct in 2000 , was in response to a steep decline in bumblebees and other pollinating insects in recent years , a problem blamed on the loss of most wildflowers in Britain 's intensively farmed landscapes - some of which were also transported to New Zealand and have survived in the South Island 's England - like climate .
To prepare for the bees ' return , Natural England worked with farmers in Kent to make more than 550 hectares of land suitable for the bees , as well as nesting birds , mammals and invertebrates .
" This international rescue mission has two aims – to restore habitat in England , thereby giving existing bees a boost ; and to bring the short - haired bumblebee home where it can be protected , " said Poul Christensen , Natural England 's chairman , when the project was announced last year [ 2009 ] .
" Bumblebees are suffering unprecedented international declines and drastic action is required to aid their recovery .
Bumblebees play a key role in maintaining food supplies - we rely on their ability to pollinate crops and we have to do all we can to provide suitable habitat and to sustain the diversity of bee species . "
One of the foundational premises of the new dating series “ Donald J. Trump Presents the Ultimate Merger ” ( TV One , 9 p.m. Thursdays ) is that the 12 bachelors who gather in Las Vegas to compete on the show for the hand of one woman do n’t know who that woman is .
That happens on other dating shows , of course , but in this case there ’s an additional reason for the silence :
The prize is Omarosa .
Perhaps it would have been tough to find a dozen men willing to vie for her affections , but probably not :
In addition to being striking , Omarosa Manigault - Stallworth is the original reality show villain , a figure of such lasting cultural influence that even now , six years after she was fired halfway through the inaugural season of “ The Apprentice , ” she remains an object of curiosity and fascination .
Or as Michael , the suitor with the loosest lips , puts it during his first meeting with her : “ I ’ll be honest with you — you ’re way more pleasant than I expected you to be . ”
In fairness , the veil of secrecy likely was n’t total .
Omarosa has history with two of the men on the show : Charles , a foreign currency trader with a wardrobe full of spectacular shirts , and the R&B singer Al B. Sure ! , who , Omarosa notes , “ did n’t seal the deal ” the first time around .
Many of the rest of the men appear both star struck and a little cowed , though not so much that it disrupts their essential slickness .
It ’s a varied bunch : a former NFL linebacker , a lawyer , an aspiring self - help author , a Christian rapper , a pair of R&B singers and a fashion designer ( the lone white contestant ) .
All told , “ The Ultimate Merger ” is perhaps the first dating show centered on the black professional class .
Which makes its race - related gaffes all the more troubling .
Near the beginning of the premiere , the director of hotel operations at the Trump International ( where the men are staying ) , who is white , informs them of their responsibilities to their new home : “ Ultimately , you need to understand how beautiful this place is .
We are not going to allow anybody to ruin that . ”
He then introduces the security chief : “ He ’s going to ensure personally that all of you act like gentlemen . ”
Given that all of the men are handsome , poised , immaculately dressed and charming — certainly more so than the hotel employees — this feels ludicrous , with a subtle undertone of racism .
Even on the various VH1 life - makeover competitions , filled with far more obviously troubled contestants than these , there ’s never been a lecture about responsible house - caretaking .
From a white employee representing Donald Trump , hotelier and this show ’s executive producer , aimed at an overwhelmingly black cast , on an African American - targeted network , it grates .
Perhaps the tone comes from the top .
In the show ’s introductory conversation between Trump and Omarosa , he asks her , “ Is there anybody that can tame you ? ” as if she were a wild animal in need of a trainer .
Needless to say , racial politics also play a role in the courting .
Sterling , the white fashion designer , is asked if he ’d consider a certain kind of plastic surgery : “ Would you grow for O ? ” Darrell , a nebbish movie producer , admits to the group , “ Most of my friends , they call me ‘ Blizzard ’ ” — that would be for his penchant for dating white women .
“ Why do you think sisters do n’t pursue you ? ” Omarosa asks dismissively , and hilariously .
Turns out it ’s easy to root for Omarosa :
She ’s genuinely engaging , villainous only in her directness .
She has a finely honed understanding of how to play to the cameras , giving good body angle and good quote in equal measure .
Omarosa is n’t the only “ Apprentice ” Season 1 alum who ’s extending their reality - TV shelf - life by emphasizing their personal side .
Katrina Campins , who appears on the premiere episode of “ The Ultimate Merger , ” went from “ The Apprentice ” to the short - lived Bravo series “ Miami Social , ” and that season ’s “ Apprentice ” winner , Bill Rancic , stars in the underappreciated docu-series “ Giuliana & Bill , ” on the Style Network .
Dating shows can be flimsy , but Omarosa brooks no ambiguity , in herself or others , and the conversations on the premiere episode are refreshingly frank .
She chides one bachelor for having a 1 - year - old child , which to her means a mother still in the picture .
She calls Charles “ a player with a passport , ” and appears genuinely moved to see Al B. Sure !
And she may have met her match in Michael , a nasal - voiced man-child event planner who tries to bond with Omarosa by talking about his blog .
Omarosa , a born self - marketer , bristles at the intrusion onto her turf .
“ He was promoting him as a brand as opposed to taking the opportunity to get to know me , ” she gripes .
Michael retreats , removing himself from the date .
If not quite enthralled , he ’s at least intrigued : “ Some of my best relationships in life , ever , started off with drama . ”

Drawing people 's attention to the enormous challenges we face is one thing ; revelling in the collapse of society is quite another .
Dark Mountain could learn from Douglas Adams , says Solitaire Townsend ...
' The End of the Universe is very popular ' , said Zaphod …
' People like to dress up for it …gives it a sense of occasion . '
In Douglas Adams '
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe diners enjoyed watching the obliteration of life , the universe and everything , whilst enjoying a nice steak .
When I first discovered The Dark Mountain Project I could n't help secretly hoping a bunch of uber - cool hipsters were making an ironic analogy between our current climate challenge , and Adams ' satire .
Of course , it turns out there was n't a drop of irony involved .
This project / art installation / book / festival , ' starts with our sense that civilisation as we have known it is coming to an end ; brought down by a rapidly changing climate , a cancerous economic system and the ongoing mass destruction of the non-human world ' .
Basically , the end of the world is nigh and there is sod all you can do about it .
Extrapolate forward from their Principles of Uncivilisation and you 'll find that a bunch of us are going to be washed away but a few survivors will live in harmony with nature .
This is pretty gloomy stuff , even for two ex-journalists ( a breed who seem often rained upon ) .
But Paul Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine have decided that life as we know it is over , the collapse is coming and it's time to essentially turn off and restart human ( particularly western capitalist ) systems .
An orgy of Armageddon
My mounting frustration with Dark Mountain is n't their brutal honesty about the problems , but a growing suspicion that , like the diners at the Restaurant , they are enjoying the show .
Their festival pamphlet reads like an orgy of Armageddon .
A climate change session asks ' how will we choose to live out the last years of the Holocene and mark its passing ? '
Read on and commemoration begins to sound suspiciously like celebration .
From biodiversity wipeout to financial crisis with a dollop of climate meltdown , all with a song , poem or workshop celebrating it .
We have brought about a ' Capitalist Holocaust ' and all the health , nutrition , education , women 's rights and choice in our societies do n't get a look in .
Are n't they just being brutally honest ?
Have n't all thoughtful people had their ' what 's the point , we 're all screwed anyway ' moment ?
Unfortunately the Dark Mountain message is playing right into a nascent and incredibly dangerous public narrative .
The term ' pro climate change ' is now showing 36,100 results in Google .
Pro-climate change scientists are ' tricking ' the data , pro-climate change liberals are manipulating the media , and pro-climate change spin doctors are in government .
If we 're not careful environmentalists and climate change will end up ' on the same side ' .
We are becoming climate change 's cheerleaders , we 're so desperate for people to realise the magnitude of the looming threat that we begin to sound like fans .
This narrative eats away at public trust , and can exile us to the problem side of the debate , rather than the solution .
But by implying we might actually want collapse , we strip ourselves entirely of the right to help prevent it .
I 'm sure the Dark Mountain founders did n't intend their ' brutal honesty ' to play into this narrative .
But self - flagellation always has a suspicious air of gratification about it .
An outcome of inaction
When a previously unimaginable threat looms there are always those prophesising the end of the world .
And also always a few recommending hard work and a vision of a better future .
Dark Mountain is n't a prophesy : it 's the outcome of inaction .
I can't help wondering how Dark Mountain 's philosophy would be taken in idealistic and progress - orientated countries like Brazil , China and India ?
They are facing the threat soonest and hardest , but President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives is hopefully representative of their response when he compares being a political prisoner with the climate fight : ' I could have lost my life if I 'd given it up .
By simply believing in life you can get out of situations .
I believe in human ingenuity .
We are not doomed .
We can succeed and we must work along those lines . '
Yes , we 've got the fight of our lives ahead of us .
On that I utterly and entirely agree .
But must we not fight utterly and entirely against that destructive change ?
Get down off that gloomy mountain and get to work .
' But what about the End of the Universe ?
We 'll miss the big moment . '
' I 've seen it , ' said Zaphod , 'it 's rubbish , come on , let 's get zappy . '

This afternoon , the government introduced the Copyright Modernization Act ( or Bill C - 32 ) , the long - awaited copyright reform bill [ the bill is not yet online , but I attended the media lockup in Montreal ] .
It is nearly two years since C - 61 was introduced and nearly a year since the national copyright consultation , yet discouragingly some things have not changed .
As I reported several weeks ago , Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore won the internal fight over Industry Minister Tony Clement for a repeat of C - 61 's digital lock provisions and against a flexible fair dealing approach and today 's bill reflects those policy victories .
However , over the past month , Clement made steady in - roads in trying to restore some balance in the bill and achieved some wins .
The bill contains some important extensions of fair dealing , including new exceptions for parody , satire , and ( most notably ) education .
It also contains more sensible time shifting and format shifting provisions that still feature restrictions ( they do not apply where there is a digital lock ) but are more technology neutral than the C - 61 model .
There is also a " YouTube exception " that grants Canadians the right to create remixed user generated content for non-commercial purposes under certain circumstances .
While still not as good as a flexible fair dealing provision , the compromise is a pretty good one .
Throw in notice - and - notice for Internet providers , backup copying , and some important changes to the statutory damages regime for non-commercial infringement and there are some provisions worth fighting to keep .
Yet all the attempts at balance come with a giant caveat that has huge implications for millions of Canadians .
The foundational principle of the new bill remains that anytime a digital lock is used – whether on books , movies , music , or electronic devices – the lock trumps virtually all other rights .
In other words , in the battle between two sets of property rights – those of the intellectual property rights holder and those of the consumer who has purchased the tangible or intangible property – the IP rights holder always wins .
This represents market intervention for a particular business model by a government supposedly committed to the free market and it means that the existing fair dealing rights ( including research , private study , news reporting , criticism , and review ) and the proposed new rights ( parody , satire , education , time shifting , format shifting , backup copies ) all cease to function effectively so long as the rights holder places a digital lock on their content or device .
Moreover , the digital lock approach is not limited to fair dealing – library provisions again include a requirement for digital copies to self - destruct within five days and distance learning teaching provisions require the destruction of materials 30 days after the course concludes .
The digital lock provisions are by far the biggest flaw in the bill , rules that some will argue renders it beyond repair .
I disagree .
The flaw must be fixed , but there is much to support within the proposal .
There will undoubtedly be attacks on the fair dealing reforms and pressure to repeal them , along with the U.S. and the copyright lobby demanding that their digital lock provisions be left untouched .
If Canadians stay quiet , both are distinct possibilities .
If they speak out , perhaps the bill can be fixed .
I 'll post an update of my 30 things you can do shortly .
In the meantime , I 'm relaunching Speak Out on Copyright to focus on this bill and encouraging Canadians to join the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook group ( to get active ) and the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook Page ( to stay updated ) .
What 's in the Copyright Modernization Act ?
This is a complicated bill that will require detailed study ( and envisions a mandatory review of Copyright Act every five years ) , but it boils down to three groups of provisions : sector - specific rules , compromise provisions , and the no compromise digital lock provisions .
1. Sector - specific Rules
Bill C - 32 contains many provisions that are designed to address a single constituency or stakeholder concern .
I 'll post more on many of these in the coming days , but immediate sector - specific changes worth highlighting include :
new performers rights as demanded by ACTRA ( and as needed for WIPO Internet treaty implementation )
new photographers rights as long demanded by photographer groups
new exception that addresses potential concerns from companies like Research in Motion for temporary copies for technological processes
new BitTorrent provision which establishes infringement for providing services via the Internet that a person knows or should have known is designed primarily to enable acts of copyright infringement
new ephemeral exception as lobbied for by Canadian broadcasters
new library provisions to allow for digital distribution ( but subject to digital locks and destroying the copies after five days )
new distance learning teaching exceptions that encompass podcasts ( but subject to digital locks and destroying lessons within 30 days of conclusion of the course )
a return of the Internet exception for education
new " You Tube " remix exception for user generated content that permits non-commercial use of works under certain circumstances
new technology - neutral format and time shifting provisions legalizing common consumer activities such as recording television shows and shifting CDs to iPods ( but still subject to digital locks )
new backup copy provision ( subject to digital locks )
expansion of the exception for the visually impaired
The sum total of these exceptions make for a more complicated Copyright Act , but also provide something for just about every stakeholder group .
2. Compromise Provisions
Copyright reform invariably involves compromise and several tough issues were clearly resolved with an attempt to balance interests through compromise provisions .
Three areas in particular are worthy of discussion : fair dealing , intermediary liability , and statutory damages .
Fair Dealing .
As reported earlier , the government rejected a made - in - Canada flexible fair dealing provision as Moore emerged as the anti-exception Minister .
Despite that initial starting point , there are many exceptions that address creators ( parody and satire ) , education ( education exception , education Internet exception ) , consumers ( time shifting , format shifting , backup copies ) , and user generated content ( USG exception ) .
While this leaves innovative businesses without the benefit of flexible fair dealing and Canada still short of the U.S. fair use provision , it is a pretty good compromise .
Intermediary Liability .
For the third consecutive bill , the government has opted for a notice - and - notice system for Internet providers .
The system is costly for Internet providers , but has proven successful in discouraging infringement .
It is also far more balanced than the U.S. - backed notice - and - takedown approach or the incredibly disproportionate three - strikes model that would result in terminating subscriber access .
Statutory Damages .
Many groups called for changes to the current statutory damages system that treats large - scale counterfeiting in the same manner as non-commercial cases .
The new rules reduce statutory damages for non-commercial cases to as low as $ 100 along with a maximum of $ 5000 .
That is not insignificant , but it is well below the current $ 20,000 maximum .
In other words , there are still tough potential damages but the law finally distinguishes between commercial and non-commercial infringement .
Note that the bill also provides the prospect of targeting sites that facilitate infringement with aggressive new penalties .
3. No Compromise Provisions
The one area where there is no compromise are the digital lock provisions .
The prioritization of digital locks is the choice of the U.S. DMCA and is now the choice of the Canadian DCMA .
In fact , the Canadian digital lock provisions are arguably worse than those found in the U.S. , with fewer exceptions and greater difficulty to amend the rules .
The Canadian DCMA provisions are virtually identical to the U.S. – a handful of hard - to - use exceptions , a ban on the distribution and marketing of devices ( ie. software ) that can be used to circumvent , and a presumption that any circumvention is an infringement .
The only significant difference between this bill and C - 61 on digital locks is the inclusion of an exception for unlocking cell phones .
It is important to emphasize that this need not be the Canadian choice .
Canada could comply with the WIPO Internet treaties ( which serve as the impetus for these provisions ) , provide legal protection for digital locks , and still preserve the copyright balance .
Doing so would simply require a provision confirming that circumvention of a digital lock is not prohibited when undertaken for lawful purposes .
Similar language can be found in other countries ' digital lock legislation and – as the top issue raised during last summer 's copyright consultation – should have made it into this bill .
Clement has indicated that the government is open to amendments and the opposition parties should place reform of the digital lock provisions at the very top of the list .
I will be posting much more in the days and weeks ahead on the bill , but the initial reaction depends on whether you are a glass half full or glass half empty person .
For the glass half - full , the compromise positions on fair dealing , the new exceptions , and statutory damages are not bad – not perfect – but better than C - 61 .
For the glass half - empty , the digital lock provisions are almost identical to C - 61 and stand as among the most anti-consumer copyright provisions in Canadian history .
Not only are they worse than the U.S. DMCA , but they undermine much of the positive change found in the rest of the bill .
In the days and weeks ahead , Canadians must speak out to ensure that the compromise positions found in C - 32 remain intact and that the digital lock provisions move from the no-compromise category to the compromise one .
The nuclear industry is being offered what campaigners claim is a taxpayer subsidy on the disposal costs of waste from new reactors following a secret lobbying campaign , the Guardian has learned .
The revelation will put further scrutiny on the new government 's promise that there will be no subsidy for nuclear power .
Liberal Democrat Chris
Huhne , the new energy and climate change secretary of state , admitted to the Guardian this week that the government already faces a £ 4bn funding black hole over existing radioactive waste .
The previous government had planned to charge the industry a high , fixed , disposal levy tied to the amount of nuclear waste it produced .
It had also originally told the industry that responsibility for the waste should be transferred to the state only once the waste had been disposed of , at least 110 years from the start of a reactor 's operations .
Both proposals were deeply unpopular with the industry .
In March , the Labour government published revised proposals that made significant concessions on both issues .
Consultation on the plans will conclude this month .
A spokesman for the energy department said the consultation was continuing but declined to comment on whether the new government would take a different approach to the previous administration .
Documents released under a freedom of information request reveal the extent of behind - the - scenes lobbying last year in Whitehall by EDF Energy , the French firm that wants to build the first new reactors in the UK for decades .
The lobbying focused on the two key proposals which were revised in March .
In one meeting with officials from the energy department in July last year , EDF Energy 's presentation concluded that the original proposals were " non-acceptable " [ sic ] .
In another meeting in October , the presentation warned : " At current levels , [ the proposed ] fixed price model will significantly impact the economics of NNB [ nuclear new build ] in the UK and could make an investment unattractive . "
In a letter in July to the department , the company even warned that the cost calculations could " be open to challenge in future on the grounds of prudency " .
A spokesman from Greenpeace said : " These documents blow EDF 's claim that they wo n't need any subsidies for new nuclear clean out of the water .
They know full well that the economics of nuclear do n't stack up and that new reactors will only ever happen if the British taxpayer is forced yet again to carry the atomic can . "
In an effort to protect the taxpayer from having to pick up the tab , last year the government proposed charging a very high fixed unit price for waste disposal .
But EDF argued it was much too high .
The revised proposal would allow operators to set aside a much lower amount for the first 10 years of a reactor 's operation .
The original plan had also been for the government to assume title – or responsibility – for the waste once it had been disposed of in a new underground storage facility , which has yet to be built .
This transfer – and the transfer of funds by operators to the government to cover the costs – would take place after 110 years of the reactor beginning operation , at the earliest .
But EDF said this would involve too long - term an investment risk , as the returns from their waste disposal fund would have to cover the costs when it matured over a century later .
The consultation instead proposed the transfer taking place once decommissioning has been completed , after around 60 years .
An energy department spokesman said : " The allegation that outcomes of the consultation have been pre-agreed with industry have no foundation .
The coalition has committed that there will be no public subsidy for new nuclear . "
Last month one of three injunctions obtained by Hollywood lawyers required that Swedish ISP Black Internet must stop providing access to the world 's most famous BitTorrent site .
The provider has just complied with the court order and in turn became the first in Sweden to cut their customers off from the site .
Whether this opens the floodgates for other ISP blocks remains to be seen .
Black Internet ’s relationship with The Pirate Bay has been far from smooth .
Last year , the Swedish ISP bravely put its head above the parapet when it became a bandwidth supplier to the site , a move which has had several knock - on effects .
In August 2009 , Stockholm ’s district court ordered Black Internet to disconnect The Pirate Bay from the Internet or face fines of 500,000 kronor ( $ 64,527 ) .
The ISP quickly complied with the ruling and the site temporarily went dark , but quickly reappeared with a new host .
The very next day following its decision to disconnect The Pirate Bay , Black Internet ’s infrastructure was sabotaged with cost implications of “ millions of kronor ” .
Although it was never proven , many believed that the attack and the blacking out of the world ’s most famous BitTorrent site were connected .
After initially saying it would n’t appeal the district court ’s decision , Black Internet changed its mind .
“ This is the first time in Sweden that an operator has been ordered to stop delivering Internet to someone .
We want to know if it ’s correct to do so , ” said company boss CEO Victor Möller .
The appeal was granted .
Last month the Svea Court of Appeals made its decision and for Black Internet the outcome was poor .
The Court ordered Black Internet to “ stop providing Internet access to the TPB web site consisting of a web site including search engine and databasefunctions on which torrent files may be stored and a tracker . ”
Even though the ISP is no longer servicing The Pirate Bay , the scope of this injunction appears to be broader than first thought .
Not only must it never host the site , it must also stop the rest of its regular customers from accessing The Pirate Bay , making it the first ISP in Sweden ordered to block the site .
“ We have chosen to block traffic into and out of the IP addresses that are using the Pirate Bay , ” said Black Internet ’s Victor Möller .
“ We made a decision on our assessment that this was the only way to live up to the Court of Appeal ’s decision . ”
Although being precise is difficult , Möller estimates that the block affects many thousands of businesses and individuals , many of which are keen to reestablish links with the site .
“ They are looking for more tips and advice on getting past this block , ” notes Möller .
“ There seems to be a great need to reach the Pirate Bay . ”
TorrentFreak is awaiting comments from both Black Internet and Hollywood lawyer Monique Wadsted and will update this article with that information as soon as it arrives .
Update : Court of appeals judge Ulrika Gustavsson Stenbäck has been speaking with Swedish media and has stated that Black Internet ’s interpretation of the injunction has gone too far .
“ The decision meant no general duty to supervise over what people do online , or a general duty to stop someone from getting into the Pirate Bay .
It is clear in our decision .
Our decision relates only to Black Internet not providing internet access [ hosting ] to The Pirate Bay . ”
It seems at this stage that Black Internet is blocking The Pirate Bay but does n’t have to .
Washington wants to rein in the spread of reprocessing and enrichment as it grapples with North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programs .
It retains some suspicions about South Korea , which briefly pursued nuclear weapons in the 1970s and experimented with reprocessing later .
Allowing South Korea to reprocess or enrich the fuel , the United States fears , would set a precedent for other nations and give North Korea a pretext not to abandon its nuclear weapons program .
“ The Americans say no to recycling , but do n’t offer an alternative , ” said Lee Un-chul , a nuclear scientist at Seoul National University .
“ They think we might change our minds and build nuclear weapons , depending on the situation with North Korea .
In short , they do n’t trust us .
This is frustrating .
We have to fight . ”
That tug of war begins later this year when the two allies start renegotiating their nuclear treaty , which expires in 2014 .
South Korea is the site of the next nuclear security summit meeting , in 2012 .
Analysts here say that any new deal that would permit Washington to continue blocking South Korea from recycling its fuel  even though it has agreed to let India , which is not even a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , do so  would hurt the national pride of the South Koreans , who have been loyal allies .
According to local news reports , the South Korean government also wants to acquire a uranium enrichment capacity to make the traditional fuel for reactors  another activity banned by the 1974 accord because enriched uranium can also be used for weapons .
Virtually everyone around the world heard about the historic ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States proclaiming the right to gay marriage .
Members of the LGBT community celebrated across the country , both in person and via social media .
However , if you are not a member of this community , you may not know much about Gay Pride .
The lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and questioning persons community , shortened to LGBT , has been persecuted around the globe throughout history .
Of course , there have been times of more acceptance in certain societies as well as complete oppression during points throughout history in the world .
For instance , in the country of Russia , being homosexual was illegal until 1993 and it is still cause for death in some parts of the world .
The freedoms afforded to Americans by the Constitution have given many people more rights than they would have in other countries .
Of course , many of these have been fought for by minority groups since the beginning of the country .
One of the oppressed groups that has been struggling for rights is the LGBT community .
Gay pride is really about taking pride in oneself and refusing to be oppressed .
All people should celebrate who they are instead of feeling as though they need to hide away their true inner self .
A rainbow colored flag is displayed by many in the community as well as their supporters .
In the late 1960 ’s , a gay bar in New York was raided , which led to riots in the city .
In reaction , some in the city began the first pride march , which is a tradition that continues today .
Cities across the country have pride marches where participants can openly celebrate their sexual freedom .
These marches and other displays of gay pride not only give participants the opportunity to gladly boast of their preferences , it has increased societal acceptance for those who have different beliefs or preferences .
Although the Supreme Court ruling was very helpful to those who identify as homosexual , or even bisexual , many in the LGBT community feel as though the ruling did not go far enough to include anything regarding the transgender community , which is at greatest risk for being targeted for hate crimes .
As time continues to pass and the gay pride movement becomes stronger , it is likely that other laws will be passed to afford these members of society greater protection from oppressors .
The Securities and Exchange Commission reached a $ 550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs Group that will resolve its lawsuit against the firm alleging it misled investors in a subprime mortgage product , the agency announced Thursday .
The SEC sued Goldman in April , charging it with fraud in marketing of a complex financial product called Abacus 2007 - AC1 that was based on mortgage - backed securities .
In agreeing to the SEC ’s largest - ever penalty paid by a Wall Street firm , Goldman acknowledged that its marketing materials for the product contained incomplete information , the SEC said .
Goldman denied any wrongdoing in the SEC lawsuit but has been under pressure from shareholders to reach a settlement on the fraud lawsuit and other SEC probes .
The firm faced a Monday deadline to file a response to the lawsuit , which accuses the firm of selling the collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) without disclosing to other participants in the deal that hedge - fund firm Paulson & Co. helped select some of the underlying mortgage securities and was betting on the financial instrument ’s decline .
Settlement papers filed in a New York court contained the following statement from Goldman : “ It was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to state that the reference portfolio was ‘ selected by ’ ACA Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the portfolio selection process and that Paulson ’s economic interests were adverse to CDO investors .
Goldman regrets that the marketing materials did not contain that disclosure . ”
“ This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex , and no investor too sophisticated , to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing , ” said Robert Khuzami , director of the SEC ’s Division of Enforcement .
Shares of Goldman Sachs ended 4.4 percent higher at $ 145.22 on Thursday , and it continued to climb in after - hours trade , recently at $ 151.57 .
Germany 's World Cup Team 2010
German football agent Michael Becker , agent to top footballer Michael Ballack , is making sports headlines across Germany after an interview was published in which he attributed the elegant style of the World Cup team to the fact that " a bunch " of its players are gay .
The Guardian reports :
In an essay entitled New German Men , Aleksander Osang recounts an interview he had with Becker prior to the World Cup in which the agent allegedly told him which of the players in the team were gay .
He later said that a former national player was ready to reveal the " bunch of gays " in the German team , according to Osang .
Asked about the sexuality of one of the newer players , Becker , who is a lawyer by profession , referred to him as being " half gay " .
Osang went on to say that Becker put the new adroit , lighter and elegant style of play that has become a trademark of trainer Joachim Löw 's players down to their homosexuality , in contrast to the typically more aggressive and offensive German style of past years , but suggested they played too delicately to assure themselves a place in the final .
According to Der Spiegel , when Becker made his remarks about the " bunch of gays " he expected the ears of fellow journalists present to " prick up " .
" But they only nodded placidly , " said Osang .
" All sports journalists seemed to already know the alleged homosexual conspiracies enveloping Löw 's team .
The rumours accompanied our team to South Africa and evidently belong to the team . "
Germany came third in the World Cup , going further than expected , after an excellent run that included wins over England and Argentina .
Becker responded to the controversy : " Becker has neither denied nor confirmed that he made the comments , but has since said he was ' misunderstood ' and that the interview was not ' authorised ' , a common journalistic practice in Germany whereby the interviewee has the right to change his remarks after the interview .
Osang said he stood by his article , saying that Becker had told him ' unbelievable stories that I took down in my notebook and Becker did n't seem to have anything against me doing so ' . "
Michael Ballack did not play in the World Cup due to an injury .
Image caption Christopher Metsos is depicted as the alleged spy ring 's money man
One of 11 suspects accused by the US of spying for Russia has gone missing after being freed on bail on Cyprus .
The man , a Canadian , named by police as Christopher Metsos , was due to sign in at a police station in the coastal town of Larnaca but did not show up .
He was held at Larnaca airport on Tuesday as he tried to board a plane to Budapest , a day after the US said it had held 10 other suspects .
Mr Metsos was awaiting a hearing for extradition to the US .
He had been staying alone at a hotel in Larnaca for nearly two weeks and was said by local media to have been carrying a US passport .
' Sleepers '
Aged 54 or 55 , he is depicted by US prosecutors as the alleged spy ring 's shadowy money man , visiting the US as early as 2004 to deliver bags of cash to its members .
I 'm truly surprised the court issued no detention order against an individual alleged to be a spy Ionas Nicolaou , Cypriot MP Ambivalent US - Russia ties Russian Press on spy row Suburban lives of suspects
An arrest warrant is being issued for Mr Metsos , whose bail conditions were that he surrender his travel documents and visit the police station in central Larnaca each day .
He failed to sign in on Wednesday evening as ordered by the court , police say .
Accused of money laundering , he was released on bail of 26,500 euros ( £ 21,700 ; $ 32,500 ) to await an extradition hearing scheduled for 29 July .
" Police went to check his hotel and he could not be located , " police spokesman Michalis Katsounotos told news agency AFP .
Michalis Papathanasiou , a lawyer who represented Mr Metsos in court , told news agency Reuters that he had no contact with Metsos on Wednesday .
The Cypriot authorities ' decision to release him on bail is now under fire .
" I 'm truly surprised the court issued no detention order against an individual who is alleged to be a spy , " Ionas Nicolaou , an opposition MP and chairman of the Cypriot parliament 's legal affairs committee , told AP news agency .
' Tip of iceberg '
The 10 suspects held in the US are accused of conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government , a crime less serious than espionage but which carries up to five years in prison .

US prosecutors say they posed as ordinary citizens , some living together as couples for years .
In security circles such agents are known as " illegals " or " sleepers " .
They were trained by the SVR Russian intelligence agency to infiltrate policymaking circles and collect information , according to papers filed in New York .
Investigators say some of the accused had been using false identities since the early 1990s , using codes and engaging in advanced computer operations , including posting apparently innocent pictures on the internet which contained hidden text .
Russia has said the US charges - which came just days after a US visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev - are baseless and a throwback to the Cold War .
Sources in the US say the FBI had to swoop because one of the suspects , reported to be 28 - year - old Anna Chapman , had been about to leave for Moscow .
Ms Chapman has been painted as the femme fatale of the alleged spy ring , with several glamorous photos posted on her page on Facebook .
She was reportedly lured to a Manhattan coffee shop by an undercover FBI agent after which , in an intercepted phone call , she was told her cover might have been blown and she should leave the US .
Assistant US Attorney Michael Farbiarz said the arrests were " the tip of the iceberg " of the workings of Russia 's SVR .
Five of the suspects , including Ms Chapman , briefly appeared in a Manhattan federal court on Monday , where a judge ordered them to remain in prison until a preliminary hearing set for 27 July .
Picture this .
You ’re driving down the highway with your nine - year - old son .
You ’re in the middle lane .
On your right , one behind the other , are two buses .
The bus in front is painted white .
The bus behind is painted yellow .
The bus in front has its windows painted over .
The bus behind does not .
Your son asks you a question .
“ What are those two buses , Daddy ? ”
You tell him that they are two very different kinds of buses .
“ How are they different ? ” he asks .
You explain that on the first bus are prisoners who are being taken to jail .
On the second bus are students who are being taken to school .
“ But how is that different ? ” your son asks .
That ’s what I ’m asking , too .
You tell your son that the men on the first bus are required to get on that bus .
Then your son asks you if the students on the yellow bus have a choice in the matter .
You think about it .
Neither group has any choice in the matter .
Somebody tells the members of both groups that they must get on that bus and stay on that bus until the bus comes to its destination .
Your son says he does n’t understand .
So , you try to make it clear to him .
You tell hm that the people on the white bus have committed crimes .
They are bad people .
They are being taken to jail .
The people on the yellow bus are good people .
They are being taken to school .
Your son asks : “ Why do they make the good people go on the bus ? ”
That ’s what I ’m asking , too .
Remember , you ’re talking to a nine - year - old .
Nine - year - olds are not very sophisticated .
They need clear answers .
So , you had better be prepared to provide clear answers .
You tell your son that the good people on the yellow bus are being taken to school for their own good .
Your son asks if the people on the white bus are being taken to jail , but not for their own good .
No , you tell him .
They are being taken to jail for their own good , too .
Your son asks , “ Then what ’s the difference ? ”
The difference is , you explain to your son , that the people on the white bus are very bad and society intends to make them better .
Your son asks :
“ Is society taking the people on the yellow bus to school in order to make them worse ? ”
No , you tell him .
Society is taking them to school in order to make them better people , too .
“ Then what ’s the difference ? ”
The difference is , you explain to your son , the people on the white bus are dangerous people .
In order to make society safer , society puts them in jail .
The people on the yellow bus are not dangerous .
“ Then why are they forced to go to a place where they do n’t want to go ? ” your son asks .
“ Because it ’s good for them , ” you answer .
“ But is n’t that why the people on the white bus are being taken to jail ? ” he asks .
You are getting frustrated .
You tell your son that they ’re required to get on the bus because when they are young they do n’t know that it is a good thing for them to go to school .
They do n’t want to go to school .
But they ’re supposed to go to school .
Your son replies that this sounds just like the people in the white bus .
But they ’re supposed to go to jail , you tell him .
It ’s for their own good .
They ’re going to be better people if they go to jail .
Is n’t that right ?
Is n’t the whole idea of sending people to jail to rehabilitate them ?
Are n’t they supposed to become better people in jail ?
I mean , if they are n’t going to become better people , why not just sell them into slavery and use the money to pay restitution to their victims ?
Why build jails ?
Why paint buses white ?
You tell your son that the bad people have to go to jail in order to keep them off the streets .
The problem is , this is one of the reasons why society requires students to go to school .
People want to keep the kids off the streets .
They want to make certain that somebody in authority is in a position to tell the children what to do .
They do n’t trust the children to make their own decisions .
They also do n’t trust the criminals to make their own decisions .
This is more complicated than you thought .
But you keep trying .
You explain to your son that bad people must be kept from doing more bad things .
Your son asks : “ What are the bad things that kids do ? ”
The light comes on .
You tell your son that the children are dangerous to themselves , but the prisoners are dangerous to everybody else .
The children may hurt themselves , but the prisoners may hurt other people .
But your son wants to know why it is that the children must be taken to a school in order to keep them from hurting themselves , when they can stay home and not hurt themselves .
You tell your son that it ’s because people are not able to stay home with their children .
Your son wants to know why not .
You explain that both parents have to work to make enough money to live a good life .
This means that somebody has to take care of their children .
Your son wants to know why parents do n’t hire somebody to come into their home and take care of the children .
Why do n’t they hire a teacher to take care of them ?
You explain that it is cheaper to hire one teacher to look after lots of students .
Your son wants to know why it ’s cheaper to send children to school when it costs money to build schools , buy buses , hire drivers , and pay for gasoline .
This is a smart kid .
You explain that the people who have children force people who do not have children to pay for the schools .
Your son asks if this is the same thing is stealing .
“ Is n’t that what the people on the white bus did ? ”
No , you explain , it ’s not stealing .
Your son asks , “ How is it different ? ”
Now you have a problem .
You have to explain the difference between taking money from someone to benefit yourself as a private citizen , which is what a criminal does , and taking money from someone to benefit yourself as a voter .
This is not so easy to explain .
You explain to your son that when you vote to take money away from someone so that you can educate your child , this is different from sticking a gun into somebody ’s stomach and telling him that he has to turn over his money to you .
Your son that asks if it would be all right to stick a gun in somebody ’s stomach if you intended to use the money to educate your child .
No , you explain , it ’s not the same .
When you tell someone that he has to educate your child in a school run by the government it ’s legal .
When you tell somebody that he has to educate your child in a private school , where parents pay directly to hire teachers , it ’s illegal .
Your son then asks you if it ’s all right to take money from other people just so long as you hand over to the government the money to do the things that you want the government to do .
You explain that this is correct .
“ But what if other people do n’t think that the government ought to be doing these things ? ”
You explain that people do n’t have the right to tell the government not to do these things unless they can get more than half of the voters to tell the government to stop doing them .
Your son sees the logic of this .
He asks you : “ Are the people in the white bus being taken to jail because there were not enough of them to win the election ? ”
You know this ca n’t be right , but it ’s hard to say why it ’s wrong .
Here is where you are so far .
Society makes the prisoners go to jail .
It sees these prisoners as dangerous .
It wants to teach them to obey .
Society makes children go to school .
It sees these children as dangerous to themselves .
It wants to teach them to obey .
If it can teach both groups how to obey , society expects the world to improve .
Society therefore uses tax money to pay for the operation of jails and schools .
This includes paying for buses .
But there is a difference .
Prison buses are white .
School buses are yellow .
There must be more to it than this .
So , you keep trying .
Schools are run by the government to teach children how to make a living .
Jails are run by the government to teach people how to stop stealing .
Here is a major difference .
“ Do they teach prisoners how to make a good living ? ” your son asks .
No , you tell him .
The prison teaches them to obey .
He asks : “ Then why will they stop stealing when they get out of prison , if they do n’t know how to make a good living . ”
Because , you explain , they will be afraid to do bad things any more .
Your son asks if people in prison learn how to do bad things in prison .
You admit that they do .
“ So , ” he asks , “ we send people to prison and school so that they will learn how to make a good living ?
Only the difference is , the government pays for a place where bad people teach other bad people how to steal without getting caught , but in school , the government pays good people to teach children how to be good citizens and vote .
So , the bad people learn how to steal from the good people without voting , and the good people learn how to steal from each other by voting .
Is that how it works ? ”
That ’s how it works .
Both systems use buses to take the students to school .
But the colors are different .
In prison , prisoners sell illegal drugs .
Students do the same in school .
In prison , the food is terrible .
It ’s not very good in school — possibly prepared by the same food service company .
In prison , there are constant inspections .
Guards keep taking roll to make sure everyone is present and accounted for .
Teachers do the same in school .
In prison , you are n’t allowed to leave without permission .
The same is true in school .
In prison , bullies run the show .
In school , they do , too .
But there is a difference .
Prison buses are white .
School buses are yellow .
This is too extreme .
The systems are different .
Criminals are convicted in a court of law before they are sent to jail .
Students , in contrast , are innocent .
Some prisoners can get parole .
The average term in prison for murder is under ten years .
Students are put into the school system for twelve years .
There is no parole .
Be thankful you are not in one of those buses .
Either color .
CHICAGO -- Jesse Jackson criticized Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert on Sunday , saying Gilbert sees LeBron James as a " runaway slave " and that the owner 's comments after the free - agent forward decided to join the Miami Heat put the player in danger .
Shortly after James announced his decision last week , Gilbert fired off an incendiary letter to Cleveland 's fans , ripping the 25 - year - old and promising to deliver a title before James wins one .
He called James ' decision " cowardly " and later told The Associated Press he believes James quit during a handful of Cavaliers playoff games .
" He has gotten a free pass , " Gilbert told the AP in a phone interview late Thursday night .
" People have covered up for [ James ] for way too long .
Tonight we saw who he really is . "
Jackson said Gilbert 's comments were " mean , arrogant and presumptuous . "
" He speaks as an owner of LeBron and not the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers , " the reverend said in a release from his Chicago - based civil rights group , the Rainbow PUSH Coalition .
" His feelings of betrayal personify a slave master mentality .
He sees LeBron as a runaway slave .
This is an owner employee relationship -- between business partners -- and LeBron honored his contract . "
Gilbert responded to Jackson 's comments on Monday .
" I strongly disagree with Rev. Jesse Jackson 's recent comments and we are not going to engage in any related discussion on it .
Going forward , we 're very excited about the Cavaliers and the positive future of our region , " Gilbert said in a statement released by the Cavaliers .
Messages were left Sunday night seeking comment from James .
Jackson also called Gilbert 's comments an attack on all NBA players and said the owner should face a " challenge " from the league and the players ' association .
NBA spokesman Tim Frank declined comment .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
On Cnet ’s behind the scene look at the Windows Phone 7 team , we get some insight as to where things actually stand with the new mobile OS and the realistic expectations come the holidays .
Terry Myerson , vice president at Microsoft , is leading the team and explains :
“ We ’re going to reset , but it is going to take us five years to build a product we all want to have , ”
This of course is enough to frustrate the already wavering Windows Phone 7 hopefuls .
He is basically saying you ’ll be getting a beta release until 2015 !
Of course we are going to see a release this holiday season , but the polished final product they are hoping to achieve is 5 years away !
He goes on to say :
“ There were people that looked in the mirror a year ago and said , well , if we are n’t going to win next year , I am out of here , ” he said .
“ There were people that looked in the mirror and said what a great fun project to spend the next three to five years of my life on and kind of buckled down for it …
Those are the people you want because that ’s how long it is really going to take .
The company has that level of commitment . ”
Let ’s be real here .
Microsoft cannot afford to flop this thing .
It is either going to make or break this company in the mobile OS world , and they are facing very fierce competition from Android with the upcoming release of 2.2 codenamed “ Froyo ” which improves speed , allows native tethering and more to an already booming user base .
The iPhone 4 had record 600,000 + pre-orders and Apple is frantically looking to supply people with a higher than expected demand , as well as reports that they are planning on releasing CDMA iPhones in Q4 of 2010 .
On this Myerson states :
“ I think when we look back on the release five years from now this was a foundational release not the release that broke through , ”
“ We ’ve got some tough competition . ”
That would be an understatement .
Regarding hardware integration , he states :
“ The OEM partnership model we have is more complicated …
We aspire to have the same level of end - user finish as Apple , but getting that level of user finish requires a level of partnership …
Between Qualcomm and Broadcom and Samsung and LG and HTC , AT&T and T - Mobile it ’s just very partnership complex , it just is …
I do n’t know any other way to describe it …
We ’ve made it work many times in the past and as you know , there ’s times in the past where it has n’t worked out so well …
We ’re aspiring to do it well , which unfortunately does take more time . ”
Time is something Microsoft does n’t have much of though , people are getting anxious .
Take a look at our forums and you ’ll see people becoming exasperated and jumping ship over to Android and iPhones .
With the inability to cut and paste , no backward compatibility to your Windows Mobile 6.x apps , no ability to install apps from your SD , no ability to change the Metro UI other than what ’s on the tiles , MS is taking a huge risk and a giant leap with this thing and putting all their chips in the middle of the table .
Myerson is hopeful , however .
“ We ’ve got a good product , ” he said . ” I actually do believe that .
I think we are going to actually have a lot of happy customers . ”
That remains to be seen .
Does this change your mind about Windows Phone 7 ?
Does it frustrate you even more ?
thanks to darren.wlsn1 for the cdma iPhone tip and for the WP7 taking 5 years tip !

Rightwing ' Tea Partier , ' talk show host , calls for the waste of federal tax dollars ...
Sue Wilson Byon 7/2/2010 , 2:35 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Sue Wilson
Just days after resigning as Chairman of the Tea Party Express , Mark Williams , former talk show host at Sacramento 's KFBK radio , began encouraging people to file claims for the BP fund which is being set up to provide financial assistance to those damaged by the Gulf oil spill .
He 's not just encouraging residents of the Gulf or those who do business with Gulf Coast fisheries to file claims ; he is encouraging everyone in the country to file a claim against BP , and brags about having done so himself .
Williams asserts on his blog , MarkTalk.com , that in so filing , people are not stealing .
He writes , " You are only recouping some of your own money that the Obama regime is stealing from you to redistribute , " and he cites fund administrator Ken Feinberg as telling people " we should '... all file a claim … ' because specific criteria for valid claims has not yet been set . "
He further writes , " Let 's show the Marxists who occupy our government and their flying monkey supporters what life under socialism is really like when the productive stop producing and join the gravy train . "
The BP fund , according to a conversation I had with Feinberg 's office this week , " is paid entirely by BP . "
Even the administration of the fund is paid by the private corporation which caused the spill .
" There are no merits to claim that U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill . "
Nonetheless , Williams describes the fund as run by " Marxists " , constituting " life under socialism " , and as nothing short of a " gravy train " .
Yet , oddly enough , it 's the " conservative " Mark Williams , whose agenda could lead to the waste of untold numbers of tax - payer dollars ...
To be clear : A multinational corporation drilling for public resources off our shore in international water causes a disastrous oil spill which imperils not only wildlife , but the opportunity for Gulf residents to earn a living through private business .
The President of the U.S. puts political pressure on said oil company to pay not just for clean up , but for compensation for loss of business opportunity .
Yet , there is one federal government agency which will likely use taxpayer dollars as part of the administration of the BP Fund .
Again , according to Feinberg 's office , " As with the 9/11 fund , " which Feinberg also administered , " Mr. Feinberg will be working with the US Department of Justice Fraud Division to ensure there is no fraud in the fund . "
So in other words , it is Mark Williams who , by knowingly promoting ineligible people to apply for BP money , is costing taxpayers untold dollars to ferret out fraud .
So much for " conservative " fiscal responsibility .
And oh , yes , so much for a " conservative " talk show host getting facts straight .
Funny , too , that Williams ' blog uses the tag line - very similar to one long - used by The BRAD BLOG --- " It 's Not Right vs Left , It 's Right vs Wrong . "
Readers will have to make their own judgment about that .
It 's interesting to note that Sacramento , the state capital of " liberal " California , somehow manages to launch national Right Wing voices .
Williams , Rush Limbaugh , Joseph Farah of rightwing media outlet WorldNetDaily , and the Tea Party Express itself , all hail from Sacramento .
Must be something in the water , and not just in the Gulf .
It 's certainly not anything in the air , as Sacramento offers no progressive radio stations on the public 's local airwaves .

Lindsay Lohan has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after a Beverly Hills judge ruled that she had violated her probation by missing a string of alcohol education classes imposed for a 2007 drink - driving arrest .
Beverly Hills Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel ordered the Mean Girls movie star to report for jail on July 20 .
She also ordered Lohan to attend a 90 - day residential substance abuse program once she had completed her sentence .
Lohan , 24 , sobbed bitterly on hearing the sentence .
Earlier she had tearfully begged the judge for forgiveness , saying she was taking her alcohol education classes seriously .
" I am not taking this as a joke .
This is my life .
It is my career .
It is something I have worked for all my life , " Lohan said .
" I did the best I could to balance jobs and showing up .
" I was working ... I was working with children .
I was n't taking it as a joke ... I wanted to come back and make you happy . "
The court heard that Lohan had missed seven alcohol education classes over a period of 27 weeks and had not attended once a week , as instructed by the judge .
" I could n't have been more clear - and it was n't done , " said Judge Revel before sentencing .
The hearing stemmed from a 2007 drink - driving and cocaine arrest .
Lohan spent 84 minutes in jail that year as part of her sentence and was given three years probation .
Lohan found fame as an 11 - year - old in The Parent Trap and was considered one of Hollywood 's most talented young actresses .
But in recent years , her hard - partying ways have proved steady fodder for celebrity gossip sites .
Her career - at its height during 2003 and 2004 when movies Freaky Friday and Mean Girls were released - has gone rapidly downhill .

But the reality is that many , if not most , products in our industrial society contain some petroleum - based chemicals .
In fact , up to a quarter of the oil consumed in some regions of the United States — such as on the Gulf Coast — goes into petrochemical production , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
A number of startups , however , are working to develop green chemicals that take the petro out of petrochemicals and eliminate the environmental and safety hazards from manufacturing industrial chemicals .
A couple of years ago I wrote about one of those companies , a San Diego startup called Genomatica , that had developed a green version of a chemical compound called 1,4 ‐ butanediol , or BDO .
Your skateboard wheels , sneakers , golf balls , and a host of other products are all made with the chemical , whose manufacture alone is a $ 3 billion business .
At the time , Genomatica , which was spun out of the University of California , San Diego , in 2000 , had only produced batches of BDO in the lab .
The startup ’s scientists had bioengineered a microorganism that eats water and sugar and spits out BDO .
Goodbye hydrocarbons , hello carbohydrates .
The microorganisms are designed and tested “ in- silico ” — in other words , on computers , which also simulate chemical production .
Last year , the company , which is backed by top Silicon Valley venture capital firms Mohr Davidow Ventures and Draper Fisher Jurvetson , announced that it had also bioengineered a benign version of an industrial solvent called methyl ethyl ketone , or MEK .
Better yet , Genomatica planned to produce MEK in shuttered ethanol plants .
On Tuesday , Genomatica executives said they had successfully moved from the lab to small - scale production , producing 3,000 liters of BDO in a pilot plant .
“ By successfully implementing the manufacturing process at this scale , we have shown that our first product is ready for commercialization and that our platform delivers , ” Mark Burk , Genomatica ’s chief technology officer said in a statement .
The company claims its technology can cut chemical development costs and time by 50 percent to 75 percent .
Ramping up to industrial - scale production is another matter , of course .
But if Genomatica and other green chemical startups succeed , expect to see a lot more green products on the shelves in the coming years .
Today we have a delight for all sports conscious fans listing the awesome variety of architecturally outstanding structures .
In fact , sporting excellence has currently become one of the main priorities while increasing thought is now given to highly engineered structures that have so much more to offer than simply performance .
Designers create not just purely functional buildings , they concentrate on architecturally outstanding , innovative , and more complex projects that will provide spectacular views themselves .
So , go ahead and check these amazingly dramatic , curving forms of sporting venues driven by incredible geometry .

As a task for exam I had to make something in Clojure .
My idea was to do something similar to Revolución , just much simpler .
Clojure is a modern variant of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine .
It ’s designed for concurrent programming , has Lisp - like syntax , it ’s built for Java Platform and it ’s a functional language so it ’s completely different style from Java , C# , C++ and similar languages .
For me it was n’t easy to switch to this style and logic , but once you are there it ’s pretty much easy and fun :)
Documentation could be more detailed .
But there are few blogs / forums where you can find examples ( now there is one more ; ) ) .
The Idea
(… or how it works )
cljMovieIndexer runs from console .
You specify the directory where your movies are , and it scans the directory and extracts movie names from sub - directory names .
It will ignore unnecessary words like resolution , scene names , dots , release types etc .
Using the extracted movie names cljMovieIndexer downloads movie info ( stuff like release year , plot , actors , cover image ) from TMDb and creates a movie description file ( web archive format ) which is saved in each movie directory .
The look of the description page can be changed by editing the template file ( actually a css file ) .
Also it ’s written with multithreading in mind , so it will use as many cores your CPU has when downloading movie info and creating description files .
The Code
And now some examples and interesting parts …
TMDb client
TMDb is a great open movie database and it has a pretty nice API to search for movies and get movie info and images .
Requests are made using simple HTTP GET , and the results are in XML form .
First of all , we need to be able to search TMDb for movies :
( defn search " Search TMDB for movies with specified name . " [ movie - name ] ( when - not ( nil? movie - name ) ( logger / info ( str " Searching for ' " movie - name " ' " ) ) ( process - tmdb- search - response ( httpa / stream ( httpa/http-agent ( str @tmdb-api-url " Movie.search/en/xml / " @tmdb-key " / " ( URLEncoder / encode movie - name " UTF - 8 " ) ) : connect - timeout 10000 : read - timeout 10000 ) ) ) ) )
For making HTTP requests there is an agent - based asynchronous HTTP client , so we create a request URL , start a request and pass it to stream method which return an InputStream of the HTTP response body .
Then process - tmdb - search - response is used to read the stream .
( defn process - tmdb - search - response " Extracts movie id from search response . " [ response ] ( let [ movie - xml ( zzip / xml- zip ( xxml / parse response ) ) ] ( zipf/xml1 -> movie - xml : movies : movie : id zipf / text ) ) )
response stream is passed to parse method which parses the XML and returns a tree of elements .
movie - xml is set to be zipper for xml elements .
To extract data from xml there is a zip - filter system for filtering trees , and xml1 -> method which gets the first item that meets the specified query predicates .
So now we have TMDb id of the first movie from the search result .
Using the movie id we can get movie information like plot , cast , genre , images etc .
( defn info " Get movie info from TMDB for movie with specified id . " [ movie - id ] ( when - not ( nil ? movie - id ) ( logger / info ( str " Get details for " movie - id ) ) ( process - tmdb-info - response ( httpa / stream ( httpa/http-agent ( str @tmdb-api-url " Movie.getInfo/en/xml / " @tmdb-key " / " movie - id ) : connect - timeout 10000 : read - timeout 10000 ) ) ) ) )
Like before , response is passed to another method , process - tmdb - info - response , for processing …
( defstruct movie : name : released : imdb : tagline : plot :rating : trailer : genres :images :actors : directors ) ( defn process - tmdb - info - response " Create movie struct with data extracted from XML response . " [ response ] ( let [ movie - xml ( zzip / xml- zip ( xxml / parse response ) ) ] ( reduce ( fn [ current - movie mapping ] ( assoc current - movie ( key mapping ) ( cond (= ( key mapping ) : directors ) ( extract - directors movie - xml ) (= ( key mapping ) : actors ) ( extract - actors movie - xml ) (= ( key mapping ) : images ) ( extract - covers movie - xml ) (= ( key mapping ) : genres ) ( extract - genres movie - xml ) : default ( extract - value movie - xml ( val mapping ) ) ) ) ) ( struct movie ) {: name : name , : released : released , : imdb :imdb_id , : rating : rating , : trailer : trailer , : tagline : tagline , : plot :overview , : genres nil , : images nil , : actors nil , : directors nil} ) ) )
This is a little more complicated :) , but I ’ll try to explain .
First we parse xml and then extract some of the info ( I did n’t need all that is available ) and store it in movie struct .
reduce method …
… returns the result of applying function to value and the first item in collection , then applying function to that result and the 2nd item , etc .
In this particular case , supplied function receives two params – movie struct instance and pair of keys ( one is a key in movie struct and another matches element in xml ) .
In “ first step ” , empty movie struct instance is passed to function with first pair from the map ( : name : name ) , and the function will extract the value of the name element in the xml and set it as a value for the name key in the movie struct .
Then ( “ second step ” ) resulting movie struct is passed again with the next pair ( : released : released ) , value is extracted and set , and so on .
At the end process - tmdb - info - response method returns instance of movie struct with all movie info that is found .
HTML & MHT
There is a great library for working with HTML in Clojure called Hiccup .
I used it to create HTML page with movie info from movie struct .
It ’s very simple to create html , so as a result of this :
( html [ : html [ : body [ : p " Some text " ] ] ] )
… you ’ll get :
< html >< body ><p> Some text</p></body></html>
When we have the page html string , then we need to embed the images and CSS , and create a web archive .
That can be done using the classes from javax .
mail package since you can use standard Java libraries , classes etc. from Clojure .
You can see how at cljMovieIndexer project page @ googlecode .
There is also an example of how to create a PDF document .
Make executable application
This was a little tricky to work out , but here it is , step by step :
Download Leiningen ( a build tool for Clojure ) and run lein self - install Write a - main method : ( defn - main [ & args ] ( ... ))
Make a project.clj file in project root directory where you write project dependencies and path to clj file with main method Run lein uberjar to create a single standalone jar file
You can find complete source code and executable cljMovieIndexer application on the project page : https://github.com/joshefin/cljmovieindexer.
Note
As I said at the beginning , I made this just for practice , learning new stuff and good grade on the exam :) , so it certainly is not 100 % stable and bugs - free , but I hope it ’ll be useful to someone who is learning Clojure or is looking for examples .
By David Ignatius - April 7 , 2010
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is " seriously considering " proposing an American peace plan to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , according to two top administration officials .
" Everyone knows the basic outlines of a peace deal , " said one of the senior officials , citing the agreement that was nearly reached at Camp David in 2000 and in subsequent negotiations .
He said that an American plan , if launched , would build upon past progress on such issues as borders , the " right of return " for Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem .
The second senior official said that " 90 percent of the map would look the same " as what has been agreed in previous bargaining .
The American peace plan would be linked with the issue of confronting Iran , which is Israel 's top priority , explained the second senior official .
He described the issues as two halves of a single strategic problem : " We want to get the debate away from settlements and East Jerusalem and take it to a 30,000 - feet level that can involve Jordan , Syria and other countries in the region , " as well as the Israelis and Palestinians .
" Incrementalism has n't worked , " continued the second official , explaining that the U.S. cannot simply allow the Palestinian problem to keep festering -- providing fodder for Iran and other extremists .
" As a global power with global responsibilities , we have to do something . "
He said the plan would " take on the absolute requirements of Israeli security and the requirements of Palestinian sovereignty in a way that makes sense . "
The White House is considering detailed interagency talks to frame the strategy and form a political consensus for it .
The second official likened the process to the review that produced Obama 's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He said the administration could formally launch the Middle East initiative by this fall .
White House interest in proposing a peace plan has been growing in recent months , but it accelerated after the blow - up that followed the March 9 Israeli announcement , during Vice President Joe Biden 's visit , that Israel would build 1,600 new housing units in east Jerusalem .
U.S. officials began searching for bolder ways to address Israeli and Palestinian concerns , rather than continuing the same stale debates .
Obama 's attention was focused by a March 24 meeting at the White House with six former national security advisers .
The group has been meeting privately every few months at the request of Gen. Jim Jones , who currently holds the job .
In the session two weeks ago , the group had been talking about global issues for perhaps an hour when Obama walked in and asked what was on people 's minds .
Brent Scowcroft , who served as national security adviser for Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush , spoke up first , according to a senior administration official .
He urged Obama to launch a peace initiative based on past areas of agreement ; he was followed by Zbigniew Brzezinski , the national security adviser for Jimmy Carter , who described some of the strategic parameters of such a plan .
Support for a new approach was also said to have been expressed by Sandy Berger and Colin Powell , who served as national security advisers for Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan , respectively .
The consensus view was apparently shared by the other two attendees , Frank Carlucci and Robert C. McFarlane from the Reagan years .
Obama 's embrace of a peace plan would reverse the administration 's initial strategy , which was to try to coax concessions from the Israelis and Palestinians , with the U.S. offering " bridging proposals " later .
This step - by - step process was favored by George Mitchell , the president 's special representative for the Middle East , who believed a similar approach had laid the groundwork for his breakthrough in Northern Ireland peace talks .
The fact that Obama is weighing the peace plan marks his growing confidence in Jones , who has been considering this approach for the past year .
But the real strategist in chief is Obama himself .
If he decides to launch a peace plan , it would mark a return to the ambitious themes the president sounded in his June 2009 speech in Cairo .
A political battle royal is likely to begin soon , with Israeli officials and their supporters in the U.S. protesting what they fear would be an American attempt to impose a settlement and arguing to focus instead on Iran .
The White House rejoinder is expressed this way by one of the senior officials : " It 's not either Iran or the Middle East peace process .
You have to do both . "
For traditionalists in 19th - century Japan , a new sushi place was a sign the neighborhood was going to hell .
In 1852 one writer grumped about the proliferation of sushi stalls in booming industrial Tokyo .
The McDonald 's of their day , the stalls offered hungry factory workers a quick , cheap meal of fish and sweetened , vinegared rice .
If the fish was n't top of the line , well , a splash of soy sauce and a dab of spicy wasabi perked up a serving of fish gizzards nicely , with some antimicrobial benefits to boot .
Today that writer 's spiritual descendants dwell on food chat boards like Chowhound , where calling a new Japanese place " inauthentic " or deriding it as " strip mall " or " food court " quality is the kiss of death .
When we think of high - end , " authentic " sushi today , we envision rich , fatty slices of smooth tuna and creamy salmon arranged on a pristine plate — the height of elegant Japanese cuisine .
But sushi was n't always elegant , and salmon and tuna are relatively recent additions to the menu .
In that sense , sushi's appearance in food courts worldwide is more a return to the dish 's common roots than a betrayal of authenticity .
Sushi has always been in flux , with new ingredients and techniques added as convenience demanded .
Globalization has sped up that process exponentially , bringing novelty to an old food and bringing traditional food to new places .
The story of sushi is the story of globalization writ small — very small , on tiny slivers of raw fish .
As Sasha Issenberg tells it in The Sushi Economy : Globalization and the Making of a Modern Delicacy ( Gotham ) , sushi began in the fourth century B.C. as a preservation method for whitefish .
Packing the fish in layers of rice helped it keep longer and lent both the fish and the rice intriguing new flavors .
By the early 19th century , techniques had changed .
The rice was flavored with vinegar and the fish with soy , and sushi could be created in seconds , without the long wait for fermentation .
The taste for richer fish such as tuna arrived with American troops after World War II , who introduced enthusiastic red meat eating to a previously ascetic people .
The most prized sushi today is fatty tuna from the belly of the fish , or toro .
But before Americans started ordering nigiri—raw fish laid on balls of rice — most traditional sushi chefs looked down on tuna with the same disdain a French chef has for fat - free mayonnaise .
Likewise , the American concept of tuna — the white , flaky stuff in cans — had no place for the rich , red flesh of the 600 - pound creatures being caught in the cold water of the Atlantic .
The huge tuna that now spark intense bidding wars at Japan 's Tsukiji seafood market were used primarily to make cat food .
Everything changed in the early 1970s .
Akira Okazaki was trying to solve a classic business dilemma for his company , Japan Airlines .
His planes were flying to America loaded down with electronics but coming home empty .
What could he use to fill them ?
The tuna craze was already under way as postwar tastes evolved and bank accounts grew , and a few exploratory trips revealed an oversupply of tuna in America 's waters .
After many trials and tribulations — it is n't easy to rush enormous , delicate , expensive fish halfway across the world — the first important auction of Canadian bluefin tuna was held at Tsukiji market on August 14 , 1972 .
This day was henceforth known as " the day of the flying fish . "
Two summers later , more than 90 percent of outgoing cargo on Japan Airlines flights from Canada was Tokyo - bound bluefin .
Japan Airlines had " invented the modern tuna economy , " writes Issenberg .
" Sushi started as a form of preservation , " he says , " but it [ become ] precisely the opposite : a way of using the infrastructure of modernity to chaperone a delicate dish around the world . "
By the time Richard Nixon was resigning , tuna swimming through the Atlantic on Monday could find themselves part of a businessman 's lunch in Tokyo on Thursday .
At the height of Japan 's economic bubble , bluefin was fetching $ 36 a pound at auction .
Trevor Corson sees serendipity in the global economy in The Zen of Fish ( HarperCollins ) : " The Japanese have a nickname for bluefin — shibi .
It means ' four days . '
In the age before refrigeration , when someone caught a bluefin , he buried it in the ground for four days before eating it . "
Now that time is spent traveling , but the result is the same : a great lunch .
Fish were n't the only things moving rapidly around the world in the name of nigiri .
Sushi chefs were also becoming more mobile , eager to escape the oppressive , decade - long apprenticeship a sushi education in Japan required .
Corson 's book follows the education of novice American sushi chefs at the California Sushi Academy in Hermosa Beach .
In additional to traditional nigiri , the students learn to make things like the very Americanized inside - out crunchy shrimp roll , from a chef who sighs that " anything oily or greasy — that 's all Western influence . "
But from time to time , a Japanese tourist comes in and orders one .
As sushi migrated , its ingredients changed yet again .
It 's no accident that avocado joined the cuisine in the 1960s , when Los Angeles chefs started using it to mimic the taste of soft fatty tuna for their homesick Japanese customers .
Tuna was by then a staple of the cuisine , much in demand among the burgeoning crowd of educated diners .
Today avocado rolls are considered " starter sushi " for timid Americans , but they 're popular in Tokyo too .
The greatest success story of the California style is a poster boy for globalization .
Nobu Matsuhisa — Japanese by way of Lima , Buenos Aires , and Anchorage — brought " new style " sushi to America 's food elite in his eponymous restaurant chain , and his clever use of local ingredients has reverberated around the world and back to sushi's birthplace .
In some cases , the global sushi economy has preserved uniquely Japanese traditions better than an unchanged , pristine provincial cuisine ever could :
Men whose great - grandfathers made samurai swords now make the perfect long knives used to carve precious tuna at Tokyo's Tsukiji market , where subtle , intricate auctions are run on less computing power than the average Japanese teenager 's cell phone .
Without a global shipping system and global demand , the markets would disappear .
Chowhounders who fret about lost authenticity or lament the commercialization of cuisine should think again .
There is no such thing as authentic sushi , and there never has been .
There was no moment when sushi was purely traditional .
And tuna and avocado rolls taste a heck of lot better than a cask of semi-rotten whitefish packed with rice .

Dr. Harleen Quinzel , also known as Harley Quinn , only has one sentence in the DC Universe encyclopedia – she ’s the Joker ’s girlfriend .
While true , Harley Quinn is much more , spawning her own comic book series and being a villain in her own right .
On September 11 , 1992 , Joker ’s Favor aired , and audiences all caught their first glimpse of everyone ’s favorite henchwench , Harley Quinn .
She was to only be a one shot character , but somehow was brought back just a few months later in Almost Got ‘im .
Soon , the Joker was n’t seen without at least a passing reference to his girlfriend .
Harley had also been seen without the Joker by her side .
January 18 , 1993 saw the first Harley / Ivy team up with Harley and Ivy , and in 1994 Harley started to see the limelight on her own .
She teamed up with Batman and Robin in Harlequinade , and later that year had a Joker - free episode in Harley ’s Holiday .
In 1993 , Harley ’s fan following found her being introduced into the world of comic books , with Batman Adventures # 12 , Girls Night Out .
February 1994 saw Harley ’s origin story , Mad Love , released .
In this tale , we learn how it is that a former Arkham psychologist could fall in love with one of the most dangerous villains of Gotham City , but this comic revealed more than just that .
Harley , in her own right , is just as dangerous as any other of Batman ’s Rogue Gallery , if not more so .
Her Achilles ’ heel is that she loves too much .
Harley Quinn continued to appear in comics and the cartoon series , and was even in a few episodes of the Superman cartoon series .
She was even introduced into the mainstream in the comic series in 1999 .
The year 2000 was a big year for Harley , as she was introduced into her own comic series , Harley Quinn .
In this series , Harley has had enough of the Joker and she dumps him , officially .
Harley is a free agent , and goes through the adventures of her comic series on her own .
The comic series was dark , dramatic , and above all else , funny , and even had crossovers into the Superman universe .
It introduced Bizarro Harley , the only Bizarro to date that makes sense – a commentary on how nonsensical Harley herself is .
Bizarro Harley was also cold , calculating , and mean , things that Harley is not , no matter how dangerous she is .
The series lasted for 38 issues .
Harley made numerous other comic appearances in 2000 .
Gotham Girls , a flash animated webseries , also debuted in 2000 .
Harley Quinn was one of the main characters of the series , as was Batgirl , Catwoman , and Poison Ivy .
A few years later , Harley Quinn was also a main player in the TV series Birds of Prey .
Over the years , Harley has appeared in every DCU cannon show , including Static Shock , Justice League , and Batman Beyond , has had her origin retold in at least 3 comics and in an episode of The Batman , and has even been in the video game Arkham Asylum .
Except for The Batman , she is always voiced by Arleen Sorkin .
Harley Quinn also continues to appear in the comics .
The only medium Harley Quinn has yet to be portrayed in is movies , and many fans vocalize a want for the former Arkham psychiatrist to appear on the big screen .
Needless to say , it is completely unfair to say that Harley Quinn is just “ the Joker ’s girlfriend ” .
After all , she did come the closer to defeating Batman than her Puddin ’ ever did .

This is the preliminary version of the Ghost typing addition to visual Haskell , the idea is that whenever an explicit type signature is not given , the IDE will display the type inferred by GHC .
You can then click on the signature to insert it , or use the smart action associated with the name of the function .
Up next is the feature that when you have given a signature that does n’t type check , the IDE will remove that signature and retry , if it succeeds the IDE will display a suggested signature .
Below is a GIF of how the first part works .
Oh and collapsible regions has been finished as well
if the function has a type signature it will collapse at the end of that declaration , if not it ’ll collapse at the end of the function name .
There is a restriction to this however since GHC allows you to declare your signatures anywhere in the file .
In order for the signature to be considered part of the function by collapsible regions it has to be end on the line before the binding .
Which means it can span multiple lines , the end just has to be before the binding , that way it also supports haddock documented type signatures .

It 's hard to decide ..

Either way , I love this take on the story .
And I suppose that the next time I read it to my son I 'll be seriously tempted to " read " your version .

I hope I do n't get arrested .
I surely wo n't this evening but a few days hence that might change , if the authorities take undue interest in my household here in the US , the Land of the Free .
There 's sickness here , and has been all week – an annoying cold virus bouncing twixt me and my roommate .
Standard over - the - counter decongestants have n't worked , so today I bought the real deal : cold medicine with pseudoephedrine .
A few years ago that was easy : take a packet off a drugstore shelf , hand the cashier a few dollars and you 're done .
But now pseudoephedrine is tightly controlled since vast quantities of it can be used to make methamphetamine , one of the latest formerly legal but now illegal mind - altering substances .
To unclog my nasal passages today I had my driver 's licence scanned into a law enforcement database – God forbid anyone without government - issued ID catch cold – and sign electronic documents agreeing to spend years in prison and pay fines multiple times my net worth should any of the 18 pills I bought be used for nefarious purposes as defined by any elected or appointed officials .
Should my roommate and I finish this batch – a four - and - a - half day supply for two people – he 'll have to buy the next one lest I be arrested .
Two boxes of allergy medication is enough to send you to jail in the free republic of the USA .
Last year , Sally Harpold from Indiana bought a box of cold meds for her husband , then another box for her daughter less than a week later .
Four months after that , cops raided her home and brought her out in handcuffs because she'd bought more than three grams of pseudoephedrine in seven days .
Authoritarian apologists would tell me to stop complaining , since scanning my personal information into government and corporate databases whenever I buy cold medicine is still cheaper and more convenient than having to reserve , attend and pay for a doctor visit and prescription .
And at least the government did n't ban pseudoephedrine outright , the way it banned marijuana , opium , MDMA and multiple other drugs throughout the 20th century and this one .
But the government could change its mind any minute , and decree possession of pseudoephedrine an imprisonable offence .
All in the name of public health and safety , valid concerns all - too - often invoked to dictate private behaviour .
Consider the controversy over the new pharmaceutical drug flibanserin , nicknamed " Women 's Viagra " since its purpose is to increase women 's sex drives .
This is generating the standard goodness - graciousing by professional worrywarts according to the mathematical formula : " Drugs bad , sex bad , drugs to the power of sex exponentially bad . "
Yet the whole debate might be moot because the Food and Drug Administration has not yet decided whether or not it will allow flibanserin to be sold in the US .
" The FDA wo n't allow it . "
We hear that a lot here in the land of brave rugged individuals and the world 's only country to ban those candy " Kinder Surprise " eggs , lest we all choke on the little toys within ) .
Yet the FDA , when founded , was not supposed to tell American citizens what they could legally consume , but to enforce honesty and integrity in food and drug claims and manufacture .
Look at any 19th - century medicinal catalogue and you 'll see why that was necessary .
In addition to the occasional new wonder drug like aspirin , which really did work as advertised , you 'd find mostly snake - oil claims : " Mrs Jennifer 's Non-Addictive Opium Cordial makes you look 20 years younger and immune to cancer . "
It 's one thing to outlaw fraudulent claims , or ban the use of known poisons in items meant for internal consumption , but the authorities went too far : rather than merely enforce standards in claims and ingredient lists , they decide on behalf of Americans what we can and cannot have .
And my roommate and I might yet get arrested , if he buys pseudoephedrine four days from now and someone , somewhere , someday decides our address has consumed more than its legal share .
I 'm not out to hurt a soul .
I just want to breathe with my mouth shut and stop oozing from facial orifices , and I had to register myself with corporate and law enforcement databases to do it .
I 'm not just sick from a cold ; I 'm sick of the ever - growing number of hoops innocent citizens must jump through to ease enforcement of the ever - growing draconian laws .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I have to blow trumpet noises into enormous handfuls of tissue paper .
BRIAN PADDICK : How can the public feel safe when the police are so scared ?
Is the obsession with paramilitary equipment the right direction for the police ?
The contrast was strange and disconcerting .
Dressed like extras from Robocop , we saw a group of heavily - armed police officers taking aim at the hedgerows last week amid scenes of Northumbrian tranquility .
A herd of cows looked on .
Of course there were good reasons for the helmets , the goggles and the guns .
Those particular officers were responsible for hunting down the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat , accused of two shootings , a murder and threatening to kill police and the public .
Aside from the body armour and the radios , there were automatic rifles , pistols for closequarter combat and Tasers .
It is true that the search for Moat was unusually dangerous and that the officers taking part needed every protection .
The goggles were to protect the eyes from acid or other dangerous liquids as they entered farms and deserted outbuildings where Moat may have been hiding .
Yet the huge weight of equipment on view will strike most ( especially city dwellers ) as far from unusual .
We are all too familiar with bulky body armour , guns and a range of modish extras that have turned the old - fashioned bobby into something resembling a High Street stormtrooper .
Thanks to pressure from the Police Federation ( the police ' trade union ' ) and the manufacturers of specialist equipment , the ordinary policeman or woman has been transformed beyond recognition - with damaging results for public confidence and even for their ability to do the job itself .
The balance between officer safety and the approachability of the British bobby is wrong .
When I joined the Metropolitan Police in 1976 , the emphasis was on presenting as human a face as possible .
My only weapon was a one - foot length of varnished softwood , carefully concealed in a pocket sewn into the right trouser leg of my serge uniform trousers .
( Female officers had a smaller version they carried in their police issue handbags . )
We even had to hide the leather strap , placed around the wrist .
To display it was seen as provocative .
When my colleagues came under attack at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival , their traditional cork helmets offered little protection against the missiles thrown by rioters .
Dustbin lids were inadequate shields .
But when we were issued with reinforced helmets they looked exactly the same as the traditional ones and when , in the early Eighties , riot shields were deployed , the decision was reluctantly taken .
In the course of the past 20 years , though , this understanding about the way officers present themselves , the conviction that the right appearance helps secure the trust and respect of the public , has been gradually lost .
I was never physically attacked on the beat , despite patrolling alone in some of the roughest parts of London .
Until the time I retired four years ago , I would tell new police recruits that the most effective defensive weapons police officers had were their brains and their tongues , to defuse most situations .
Of course there was much more respect for the police in those days , but the police have been the authors of their own difficulty - not least in the way they present themselves in public .
The introduction of unnecessary body armour is a good example .
I was a chief inspector at Brixton in 1993 when two young constables were shot confronting a violent drug dealer who had escaped from prison .
In response , senior officers decided they would allow police officers to routinely wear body armour .
This was despite the officers being shot in the legs , which are not covered by body armour , and despite gunmen rarely targeting police officers .
The sight of policemen in bulky armoured vests creates a psychological barrier between them and the public and raises people 's fear of crime .
We assume the streets are dangerous if officers appear to feel the need , as a matter of routine , for protective clothing .
American batons , which have replaced the traditional police truncheon , are another case in point .
When they were first introduced in 1993 they tripped up the shorter officers when they tried to give chase .
Officers now prefer the extendable metal baton .
But even these are prominently and provocatively displayed .
Handcuffs , which we used to carry in our pockets , are now carried overtly along with a canister of CS spray .
In fact , there is now so much weaponry that officers have to wear wide Batman - style utility belts to carry it all .
These regrettable changes are little to do with the world outside the police station .
The murder rate in Britain has barely changed for decades ( between 550 and 650 a year ) as has the level of serious violence directed at police .
I believe that the look reflects the macho , male - dominated nature of the organisation .
Some officers have always looked to resolve situations by force as a first , rather than a last , resort .
Weak leadership from senior officers has also contributed to the change , colluding with the ' canteen cowboys ' and lobbying for ever more expensive accoutrements .
Is this because they have been unwilling or unable to stand up to successive governments ?
Certainly they have failed to engage with the more difficult questions of law and order in a changing society .
It is often said that Britain is policed by consent , where officers are seen as citizens in uniform operating with the support of the public .
These are not empty words .
Around the world , where most people are policed by force , our approach is viewed with admiration .
Yet the militarisation of the beat bobby is eroding that unique relationship - to the extent that police community support officers are now officially seen as ' the bridge between the police and the public ' .
It is fortunate that the damage is not beyond repair .
Where body armour is required , the heavy style currently in use should be replaced with ultra - thin types that can be easily concealed .
The extendable batons should be hidden from view .
CS spray and Tasers should be held ready for use in patrol cars .
And we should start talking about the human face of our policemen and women once again .
This would do much to restore some public trust and confidence and help to preserve our unique , British approach to upholding law and order .
Dein Online - Shop für Sporternährung : Essen und Trinken für den Erfolg
Sport und Ernährung gehören einfach zusammen .
Denn ohne die richtige Sporternährung sind Höchstleistungen erst gar nicht möglich .
Egal ob Profi-Athlet oder Fitnesssportler , das Essen und Trinken hat entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Form , die Fitness , das Wohlbefinden sowie die Erholung .
Und genau deshalb starten und enden das Training und der Wettkampf für Sportler immer in der Küche .
Ob vor , während oder nach dem Sport : Ernährung macht fit !
Um beim Sport gute Leistungen erzielen zu können , ist es von Vorteil , dass vor intensiven und langandauernden Belastungen die Kohlenhydratspeicher in Muskeln und Leber ausreichend gefüllt sind .
Für Sportler fast noch wichtiger als für Nicht - Sportler ist ein ausgeglichener Flüssigkeitshaushalt .
Daher beginnt die Sporternährungsstrategie in puncto Trinken auch schon vor dem Sport .
Der Sportler sollte hier schon „ liquide “ sein und ausreichend Flüssigkeit getrunken haben .
Während mehrstündiger und schweißtreibender Aktivitäten sollte der Sportler drei Dinge in regelmäßigen Abständen zu sich nehmen , um weiterhin leistungsfähig zu sein : Flüssigkeit , Energie – in Form von Kohlenhydraten – und Mineralstoffe ( Natrium ) .
Sportler greifen hier gerne zu speziellen Sportnahrungs - Produkten wie isotonischen Getränken , kohlenhydrathaltigen Riegeln und Gels .
Denn um leistungsfähig zu bleiben , ist es wichtig , dass die benötigte Energie schnell vom Körper genutzt werden kann .
sowie dass das durch den Schweiß ausgeschiedene Wasser inklusive Natrium schnell wieder ersetzt werden kann .
Die Erholung und Trainingsanpassungen maximieren - auch das gehört zur Sporternährung .
Wer nach dem Sport schnell wieder fit und leistungsfähig sein will , sollte im Anschluss an intensive Aktivitäten die verloren gegangene Flüssigkeit kompensieren und die Kohlenhydratspeicher auffüllen .
Da der Stoffwechsel nach der Belastung auf Hochtouren läuft , werden beispielsweise Kohlenhydrate besonders schnell in die Glykogenspeicher eingelagert .
Außerdem brauchen die Muskeln Eiweiß für Muskelaufbau - und Reparaturprozesse .
Also auch nach dem Sport – Ernährung nicht vergessen !
Eine clevere Strategie der Sporternährung führt nicht nur dazu , dass der Sportler physische und mentale Höchstleistungen erbringen kann , sondern sich auch schneller wieder erholt und auch das Risiko für Erkrankungen minimiert .
Spitzenleistungen sind meist nur dann möglich , wenn ein Athlet optimal isst und trinkt .
Gut verträglich , leicht zu verzehren : Top - Produkte für die Sporternährung
Doch was macht nun spezielle Sportnahrung aus ?
Sie ist wie die Powerbar - Produkte so entwickelt , dass sie rund um die Belastung gut verträglich , ohne oder nur mit minimalem Aufwand zubereitet werden kann und selbstverständlich einfach zu konsumieren ist .
Dadurch fällt es dem Sportler viel leichter , die optimale Nährstoffkombination in der richtigen Menge und zur richtigen Zeit in hoher Qualität aufzunehmen .
An Ector County , Texas grand jury indicted Guerdwich Montimere , a 22 - year - old man accused of posing as a high school student and basketball star in West Texas , on five felony counts on Monday .
The grand jury returned two indictments against Montimere .
The first contained two counts of sexual assault of a child .
Montimere was arrested on May 14 after a 16 - year - old girl in Odessa told police and school district officials she had sex with him at a home in August when she thought he was 15 - year - old Jerry Joseph .
The second indictment contained two counts of tampering with governmental records and one count of fraudulent use of identifying information .
Indicted for those same offenses was former teammate Jabari Caldwell as a party .
Montimere was originally arrested May 11 on a misdemeanor charge of failure to identify himself to a police officer , and school officials said he admitted that he was n't Joseph .
May 13 , Montimere was released on $ 7,500 bond about five hours after his arrest on a felony charge of tampering with government documents .
Officials said Montimere enrolled at a junior high school and later at Permian High School last year with a fake birth certificate from Haiti .
The Odessa American reported in May that Montimere was enrolled at Permian by Caldwell , who was a teammate of Montimere 's at Dillard High School in Ft. Lauderdale , Fla .
According to the newspaper , Caldwell signed an affidavit that " Jerry Joseph " was his half - brother .
Suspicions were raised after coaches at an amateur basketball tournament said they recognized Joseph as Montimere , a 2007 graduate of Dillard and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Haiti .
Caldwell , who had been playing at the University of Texas - Permian Basin , told the Odessa American that he helped Montimere enroll at Permian as a favor .
Montimere , whose Haitian birth certificate says he was born on Jan. 1 , 1994 , was homeless in Fort Myers , Fla. , after fleeing a hurricane in Haiti in 2008 , the newspaper reported .
" He asked me if it was possible for me to help him enroll in school , " Caldwell told the Odessa American in May .
" I met him in Odessa .
He came out here on a Greyhound . "
Permian High School made the state basketball playoffs with Montimere helping lead the way as a sophomore star .
Questions arose after the season , and Montimere was initially cleared by immigration authorities and allowed to return to the school .
Montimer was named the District 2 - 5A Newcomer of the Year .
That honor was stripped in recent weeks , and the Panthers forfeited their 16 wins .
The investigation continued , and a fingerprint from a passport found in his room matched one taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after the allegations surfaced , according to an affidavit .
School officials said Montimere confessed after he was confronted with the new evidence .
Mickey Gaines , speaking for Montimer 's court - appointed attorney , declined to comment .
Sexual assault of a child is a second - degree felony which carries punishment of two years to 20 years in the institutional division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice .
Tampering with government records is also a second - degree felony .
Fraudulent use of identifying information is a state jail felony and can carry a sentence of six months to two years in a state jail .
The grand jury found no wrong doing on the part of Ector County independent school district , Permian High School , the athletic department , or any persons identified with the above listed agencies .
State District Judge Denn Whalen set an arraignment date of June 16 .
Montimer remained in the Ector County Detention Center on a $ 75,000 bond Tuesday .
An arrest warrant will be issued for Caldwell , Bland said .

On Tuesday , South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters that he would vote against the climate bill he helped author .
Now he ’s going one step further .
Graham , one of the few Republicans who claimed to care about climate change , now says global warming is no big deal .
Graham appeared on Wednesday at a press conference with Dick Lugar ( R - Ind. ) , who was rolling out his own energy bill , a measure that relies heavily on expanding nuclear power and raising fuel economy standards without putting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions .
Yesterday , Graham said he did n’t think any energy bill could get 60 votes this year because oil drilling has become too controversial .
Today he decided , at the last minute , to back Lugar ’s bill .
Reporters asked Graham several times about why he was supporting Lugar ’s bill , when just a few months ago he had argued that the Senate should n’t pass a “ half - assed ” bill that lacked hard restrictions on carbon emissions .
Graham replied that he now does n’t think pricing carbon is that important .
“ The science about global warming has changed , ” he noted , offhandedly .
“ I think they ’ve oversold this stuff , quite frankly .
I think they ’ve been alarmist and the science is in question , ” Graham told reporters .
“ The whole movement has taken a giant step backward . ”
I followed up with him .
“ Can you clarify that statement that the science on global warming has changed ? ” I asked .
“ The public acceptance about global warming has changed , ” he said .
“ Well , what do you think ? ” I replied .
I ’ll print his response in full , because it ’s a humdinger :
It makes sense to me that the planet is heating up because you can measure heat .
It ’s not a stretch to say that what goes into the air is contributing to global warming , but I do n’t want to be in the camp that says I know people in Northern Virginia will never see snow .
At the end of the day , I think carbon pollution is worthy of being controlled , whether you believe in global warming or not .
I do believe that all the CO2 gases , greenhouse gases from cars , trucks , and utility plants is not making us a healthier place , is not making our society better , and it ’s coming at the expense of our national security and our economic prosperity .
So put me in the camp that it ’s worthy to clean up the air and make money doing so .
This idea that carbon ’s good for you .
I want that debate .
There ’s a wing of our party who thinks carbon pollution is okay .
I ’m not in that wing .
I asked him , if carbon emissions are n’t warming the planet , why are they bad ?
Here ’s his reply :
I just think it ’s bad … the reason I do n’t hang out in traffic jams and get out and suck up the wind is I think this crap is bad for you .
We ’ve had an increase in asthma cases .
If you ’ve ever been to Thailand stuck behind 400 motorcycles , it ’s a lousy place to be .
It does n’t take a rocket scientist in my view to understand that the stuff floating in the Gulf , if you burn it does n’t make it better for you .
If you would n’t go swimming in this stuff , why would you burn it and want to breath it ?
Graham ended his commentary on the subject on this note : “ I do believe the environmental benefit of a low carbon economy is worth the Republican party ’s time and attention .
Does climate change have to be your religion ?
No , it is not my religion , it is my concern . ”
This is quite different from what Graham has been saying for the past eight months .
Last October , he co-authored an op - ed with John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) arguing that that “ climate change is real and threatens our economy and national security . ”
Now he ’s fumbling to figure out how to make it seem like he still cares — but not too much .
The pandemic has pushed some hospitals — particularly those serving large numbers of low - income patients — closer to the financial brink .
Reporter Stephanie Goldberg joins to discuss this month ’s # CrainsForum , which looks at how the coronavirus is reshaping the future of health care .
