There are various drawbacks to an expat 's life in Japan , starting with the big task of learning the redundancy - packed language and dealing with the cultural parochialism of the population – a parochialism in the intellectual sense only , for in the material sense the Japanese have mastered the best the West has to offer .
A good example of these detriments transpired in 2004 , when Shintaro Ishihara , the governor of Tokyo , opined about the French language .
Mr. Ishihara stated that French is disqualified from being an international language because it is " a language in which nobody can count . "
Indeed , French numbers from x70 through x99 are weird constructs on a 20 base ( e.g. 91 is expressed as “ four times twenty plus eleven ” ) , but that ’s as far as it goes .
What 's more significant is that this was a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black : for , with respect to counting , Japanese may well be the most dysfunctional language in the world .
There are different Japanese vocabularies for counting long , thin objects , or flat , thin objects , or small round objects , or ships , or books , or sheep or cars .
The proliferation of this is practically boundless ; mercifully , outside of specialists , most Japanese give up after mastering perhaps five hundred words just to count from one to twenty .
Moreover , the largest numerical unit for which there is a word in Japanese is ten thousand .
A foreigner in a business meeting who mentions an item like the 67,835,303 euros that his company earned last year , must inevitably witness Japanese executives stopping to count on their fingers in order to divide 67,835,303 by 10,000 so that they be able to grasp and express the figure in their language .
This is significant too : the man who made this amazingly parochial remark is one of the most feted people in Japan : superstar politician , famous novelist , polemicist , yachtsman , and Keio University graduate .
And his remark holds one of the keys to our subject matter today .
Inconveniences and differences notwithstanding , there is one overwhelming blessing that makes me glad to be in Japan .
It 's the daily experience of living in a country that , unlike Western Europe , and increasingly the United States , does not actively pursue it 's own extinction .
I am a European .
Ich kann nicht anders .
Europe had left my parents long before they left it almost 50 years ago , so now I am a Euro - American and I take this distinction seriously .
Still , I do n't feel the religious impulse except in a church that 's at least 300 years old ; and it's only European music that penetrates to my soul , and only European languages in which I can express what I hold dearest , and only European artifacts that satisfy my love of beauty and craftsmanship .
Well , not quite – Japanese artifacts do that too .
But Europe is my Beatrice : a pure vision of the past with little resemblance to what she is now .
The real , contemporary Beatrice does presume to tread the path , like Dante Alighieri 's muse , from Purgatory to Heaven , but the Compass of Reality shows that the path in fact leads in the opposite direction : back to Virgil 's guided tour of Hell .
This is a Beatrice with a bipolar personality disorder , self - inflicted cicatrices , labial and nasal rings and tattooed breasts , sporting combat boots and a black leather suit with a Palestinian terrorist 's kaffiyeh wrapped around her studded dog collar , with a book of onanistic gibberish by an Althusser or Bataille or Foucault in one hand , and a Quranic whip for self - flagellation in the other .
What Europe has become is on ample display in the daily news .
In the April week in which this has been written , France had put Brigitte Bardot on trial for the sixth time for " inciting racial hatred , " but really just because La Bardot desires that France remain French , as did Jeanne d'Arc and , before her , Charles Martel .
And in Spain , a very pregnant , 37 - year - old woman , wearing a sloppy chemise over her protrusion , reviewed a line of Spanish troops standing at attention .
It was not a scene from Luis Buñuel 's new film , The Discreet Charm of the Socialist International , but Spain 's new Minister of Defense , Carmen Chacon , on official duty .
To put a lactating symbol of feminine vulnerability in charge of the defense of a country with a long and proud martial history is to announce to the world :
See , we castrated ourselves ; we beg that you be gentle with us ; please wear a condom .
Would that the Groupe Islamique Combattant Marocain or Al - Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb lay down its arms in benevolent reciprocity .
As it were , the sight of a pregnant woman in charge of the defense of Al - Andalus gives these testosterone–pumped descendants of the Moors some exciting ideas of a very different nature .
And in New York , the erstwhile symbol of what in Europe 's formative past was both its best and its worst , the Roman Catholic Pope , proved that the papacy is no longer concerned with pesky value judgments .
You can swathe the German postmodern socialist theologian in gold and brocade , but you can't swathe his weltanschauung .
And so Benedict XVI , after having inveighed for greater American receptivity to its final inundation by the Third World , lectured the General Assembly of the United Nations that the world is " in crisis " because decisions rest in the hands of " a few powerful nations . "
One wonders whether His Holiness wishes for more power to such nonpowerful nations as those paragons of human rights that were on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights , mercifully dissolved in March 2006 : Burkina Faso , Congo Brazzaville , Egypt , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Gabon , Guinea , Kenya , Mauritania , Nigeria , Sudan , Togo , Zimbabwe , Indonesia , Nepal , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Cuba , Guatemala , Paraguay , and others .
To top if off , the former Professor Ratzinger asserted that the promotion of human rights –- presumably by such devoted advocates as Sudan and Saudi Arabia – " remains the most effective strategy for eliminating inequalities between countries and social groups , and increasing security . "
As though the proper and viable concern of the Roman Catholic Church ought to be the elimination of inequalities between countries and social groups .
The Pope 's words sound as though taken from a speech by Lenin to some Bolshevik congress .
However , it is not something that may be pinned on single individuals or institutions .
Let us not forget the Archbishop of Canterbury , who wishes sharia upon his country ; and the legions of EU 's secular humanists in Strasbourg and Brussels , busy like the bees in dismantling and replacing Europe 's cultural identity , its racial and ethnic ties that bind , its nations ' sovereignty , its peoples ' freedoms and patrimony won with copious blood shed over many centuries .
This is a systemic and critical infection of Europe 's autoimmune system ; Western civilization 's , actually .
98 % of Western Europe 's politicians and state functionaries , and its churches , universities , and mass media , and the great majority of their American and Canadian counterparts , are instruments of the same culturally Marxist and economically Socialist movement aimed at demolishing the nations of the West in the lunatic and deeply immoral hope that it will wipe out war , inequality and " discrimination " in the world at large .
It would be redundant to write much more about the symptoms of this tragic illness , what with this being The Brussels Journal , the chronicle of Europe 's decomposition .
But perhaps a comparative approach may yield some fresh insights .
We live at a hinge of history , witnessing the large - scale self - disembowelment , a sepukku , of a whole civilization .
And we can profit from this observation in two ways :
First , it 's not only Europe that has stuck a dagger in its belly and insists on drawing it across , all the way .
It 's the Anglosphere , the entire white peoples ' civilization , too .
As each continent is suiciding by somewhat different means , at a different pace , the totality of the phenomenon eludes capture in a single essay .
We will therefore concentrate on Europe , but without the myopic schadenfreude that characterizes most American commentators on these matters .
Second , seppuku used to be the exclusive specialty of the Japanese .
But Japan , which has reasons to harbor national psychoses and suicidal tendencies similar to those that haunt the West , has managed to avoid going down that path .
It 's worth speculating why .
Japan 's history is crevassed with the same follies , cruelties , injustices and genocides as Europe 's is , if proportionately smaller because Japan is so much smaller .
The decadence , incompetence and oppression by Europe 's aristocracy have generated the counterforces of statism , leftism and sterile , cowardly mediocrity on display in Europe now .
But Japan 's nobility had led the country into perpetual civil war lasting over 500 years , to be supplanted in the year 1600 by 268 years of a peace - yielding Tokugawa Shogunate 's oppression far worse than what Europe 's old elites ever inflicted on their lessers .
All this notwithstanding , one does not see the same class envy in Japan , the same anti-elitism and toxic " progressivism " that has wreaked so much havoc on Western Europe and on the United States and Canada .
Japan is as socialist as France or Germany , but without the venom , coveting and selfish indulgence that characterizes this political persuasion in Europe .
European countries ' nationalism has led Europe to the disastrous Great War , which makes the EU 's project to abolish old ethnic divisions understandable .
But Japan 's nationalism in the 20th century , deranged to the point of rabid chauvinism and Emperor worship , eventually led it to total ruin in World War 2 – and still the nation survives , its spirit regenerated ; its body thriving .
Europe has a major blot on its history , its erstwhile religion and its collective conscience because of its relentless , 1600 – year - long persecution of its Jewish minority , ending , if not entirely , in the genocide of half of Europe 's Jewry in World War 2 .
And it has another large blot in its centuries of colonial rampages and exploitations of the indigenous peoples of other continents .
But the Japanese people have , over 1200 years , practically wiped out and displaced the indigenous population of Northern Japan , the Ainu .
And their atrocities against the Sino - Korean peoples have not started in Manchuria and Nanking in the 1930s , but in the 16th century .
Visitors to Kyoto may still ascend the steps of the Mimizuka : a mound heaped over the ears and noses of 38,000 Koreans killed in a Japanese invasion between 1592 and 1598 .
The number of the Korean victims was much higher ; the remains in Kyoto are just what fit in the barrels of brine on Shogun Hideyoshi's ships returning from the Korean campaign .
And what Hideyoshi did to Japan 's Christians could have been staged at the Circus Maximus .
Furthermore , what Japan did to its
Allied prisoners of war , just 65 years ago , will enter the annals of humanity 's shame and dishonor for all time .
Yet , her will to live and its people 's cultural pride are still strong , even when subdued by remorse , or propped by denial .
Europe has largely lost its Christian religion – its main spiritual and cultural force .
And it 's not Europe 's but the religion 's fault – its tyrannical ways , corruption , dogmatism ; its suppression of sex and merriment , its cruelty and persecution of nonbelievers .
And so , the religion , to make amends , has made a turnabout and is now promoting the very destructive forces that it used to inhibit : homosexuality and Islam , tolerance of the intolerable , unqualified redistribution of power and income , universalism instead of particularism .
There were other ways to make amends , instead of this quantum pendulum node / 2599 going from one extreme to the other .
There was the option of finding and staying in a point of equilibrium , anchored by the sublime , nourishing and beautiful that are equally woven into the Church 's history and influence .
Japan 's religion is desiccated too .
Japanese Buddhism has mutated into a a panoply of 2000 weird personality cults fleecing their mantra - chanting flocks .
Even the legitimate and ancient branches are little more than burial businesses selling cemetery plots and sticks with magic Chinese characters that are supposed to do for the deceased what papal indulgences once purported to do for the living .
Zen has retained its depth and its spiritual force , but it has many more adherents in Europe and America than it has in Japan .
And Christianity in Japan is not the powerful current it is in Korea but rather a fashion item : a pretext to wear a designer cross pendant and to have a wedding with Felix Mendelssohn 's music and Fred Astaire 's wardrobe .
Nonetheless , the conduct of the people is moral , humane values abound , civility and mutual consideration are pervasive .
Europe is being strangled by a clique of unelected bureaucrats ; regulations - writing mandarins filled with hubris about the inerrancy of their wisdom and its salutary effects on the little people .
A constitution of 160,000 words , such as was signed by the 27 EU member states in 2004 is not , cannot be , an instrument of liberation but only an instrument of oppression .
The American constitution has 4400 words .
Japan too is governed by an unelected cabal : very old men of influence manipulating party politics and known , aptly , as the " black curtain . "
And Japan 's self - perpetuating bureaucracy is second to none .
The system has been honed to such perfection that high government employees who retire ascend to " heaven , " known as amakudari .
Heaven consists of quasi - governmental , for - profit corporations created to provide make - believe , high - paying jobs for retired bureaucrats , such as enforcing the myriad regulations and their attendant levies that said retirees wrote into the code book when they were still on government pay .
But embezzling money and wrapping a country in red tape for selfish reasons are one thing .
Wholesale treason , making of Europe Eurabia , planting the seeds of perpetual strife and future civil wars , robbing the native peoples of their homelands and birthrights , siccing new , totalitarian laws on them to stifle their dissent , persecuting relentlessly those who object to the ethnocide – all these are another matter altogether .
And Japan knows nothing of such horrors .
Both Europe and Japan have deprived their peoples of the fundamental right from which all other rights flow : the right of armed self - defense .
Allegedly , this has been done in the people 's own interest .
But the rates of violent crime have gone up dramatically since the enactment of such forcible disarmament of Europe 's citizenry .
In England and Wales , for instance , homicide rates have gone up by 50 % after the government enacted a ban on firearms in the mid-1990s .
In continental Europe , armed robberies and shooting homicides continue despite the long - standing disarmament of the population , or perhaps because of it .
In Japan , in contrast , the same strict banning of firearms has not increased crime , and homicide and robbery are , in statistical terms , practically nonexistent .
Japan has inherent centrifugal forces as much as any Western European country used to have even before its importation of Muslims .
The Tokyoite feels about the Osakan what the Berliner feels about the Bavarian , and he expresses it in a different dialect too .
The Okinawan 's regard of the main islands is every bit as ambivalent as the Sicilian 's is with respect to the boot of the mother country .
Japanese history is as packed with bloody interregional warfare as Germany 's or Italy 's are .
Why then have the modern - day Western European peoples allowed , and then capitulated before , their own colonization by alien , unabsorbable and , in part , violently criminal newcomers , but the Japanese have not ?
Among the Japanese , the attitudinal difference about immigration is between those who want to set the cap at ½ % , and those who want the cap at 2 % of the population .
That is the spectrum of opinions among bureaucrats , politicians and other elites too .
And to suffer the suppression and demolition of the national identity and heritage , such as Western Europeans acquiesce to , or the displacement of the nation 's language , such as Americans eagerly implement , is , in Japan , unthinkable .
Japan is much the better for it .
Japan 's women no longer want to breed .
The country 's childbirth rates are at the same critically low levels as Western Europe 's : about 1.3 children per woman , versus the 2.2 required for population replacement .
Europe 's governing elite decided a long time ago that to resolve the demographic crisis it was necessary to import Third - World Muslims .
But demography is destiny , not only in the fractions of population growth but also in who those fractions consist of .
With a Third - World Muslim population estimated at 25 to 55 million ( and intentional lying or obfuscation by the Establishment in this matter , e.g. here ) , and with such population 's breeding ratios being 4 – 8 children per woman , versus the indigenes ' 1.3 , it does not take much prescience to foretell that Europe 's culture , its civic underpinnings , even its physical landscape will inevitably come to resemble those of the Maghreb , Arabia and HinduKush .
And yet , Europe 's brainy minders have failed to make this simple extrapolation , and they persecute anyone who does make it .
Japan , on the other hand , has been preparing for a future with a smaller and older population .
Instead of importing Asian nurses , Japan has developed robots that care for hospital patients , or it exports its old and infirm to the countries where the nurses are .
Instead of importing window and wall washers , it has developed nano - polymers that repel dust and dirt .
Instead of importing street sweepers , it has mobilized retired volunteers to maintain the cleanliness of their own neighborhoods .
Instead of opening its doors to primitives who happen to be refugees , Japan donates huge sums of money to refugee organizations .
Japan does not wish to dilute itself , for any reason .
To capture the reasons for such differences takes enough words for a separate treatment .
It will appear here in the near future .
But before we sign off , some words on the respective deities : Astarte and Amaterasu .
Amaterasu is the sun goddess in the Japanese mythology , the direct ancestor of Japan 's Emperor and the figurative mother of the Japanese people .
The reference to the sun is literal and metaphorical , for the goddess is believed to radiate light and life force itself , and also emotional warmth , hope and compassion for the people who worship her .
Without her , everything withers and dies .
Amaterasu is said to have invented the cultivation of rice and wheat , the use of silkworms , and weaving with a loom .
Her symbol is the sacred mirror .
The mirror is kept in the inner sanctum of Japan 's most important shrine , the Grand Shrine of Ise .
Built of Japanese cypress , the shrine is torn down and rebuilt identically every 20 years , at great expense , reflecting the Shinto belief of the death and renewal of nature .
It has been so torn down and rebuilt , in 20 - year cycles , 61 times now .
Astarte was the great and universally worshipped Semitic goddess , known to the Mesopotamians as Ishtar and referred to in the Hebrew Bible as Ashtoret .
She was the principal goddess of the Phoenicians and was widely worshipped by the tribes of Israel as well , in addition to their cult of Yahveh .
Astarte represented fertility , sexuality , motherhood and war .
Her symbols were the lion , the horse , the sphinx , the dove , the planet Venus and the moon .
She was beheld as the Mother of the Universe and the giver of all life on Earth .
Pictorial representations often show her naked or with cow horns , symbolizing fertility – but to the Hebrew prophets she was a female demon of lust , luring the People of the Covenant away from their monotheistic path and into temples of sacred prostitution and firstborn child sacrifices .
Astarte has traversed the Mediterranean basin to appear as Aphrodite and Demeter to the Greeks , Uni-Astre to the Etruscans , Venus to the Romans .
She reached all the way to the British Isles .
But she has reached the wide continent between the Bosphorus and the cliffs of Dover in another form : as the naked daughter of a Phoenician king riding a white , divine bull into the sea and on to Crete .
Her name was Europa .
It is in the dissimilar fates of Europa - Astarte on her eponymous continent , and Amaterasu 's in her own home islands , that the genesis of some of the differences between Europe and Japan , as discussed above , may be found .

Some guys at Stanford invited me to speak at their EE Computer Systems Colloquium last week .
Pretty cool , eh ?
It was quite an honor .
I wound up giving a talk on dynamic languages : the tools , the performance , the history , the religion , everything .
It was a lot of fun , and it went over surprisingly well , all things considered .
They 've uploaded the video of my talk , but since it 's a full hour , I figured I 'd transcribe it for those of you who want to just skim it .
This is the first time I 've transcribed a talk .
It 's tricky to decide how faithful to be to my spoken wording and phrasing .
I 've opted to try to make it very faithful , with only minor smoothing .
Unfortunately I wound up using continuation - passing style for many of my arguments : I 'd occasionally get started on some train of thought , get sidetracked , and return to it two or three times in the talk before I finally completed it .
However , I 've left my rambling as - is , modulo a few editor 's notes , additions and corrections in [ brackets ] .
I did n't transcribe Andy 's introduction , as it seems immodest to do so .
It was funny , though .
Technical corrections are welcome .
I 'm sure I misspoke , oversimplified , over - generalized and even got a few things flat - out wrong .
I think the overall message will survive any technical errors on my part .
Thank you everybody !
So the sound guys told me that because of a sound glitch in the recording , my normally deep and manly voice , that you can all hear , is going to come through the recording as this sort of whiny , high - pitched geek , but I assure you that 's not what I actually sound like .
So I 'm going to be talking about dynamic languages .
I assume that you 're all dynamic language interest ... that you 've got an interest , because there 's a dude down the hall talking about Scala , which is you know , this very strongly typed JVM language ( a bunch of you get up and walk over there – exactly . )
So you know , presumably all the people who are like really fanatical about strong typing , who would potentially maybe get a little offended about some of the sort of colorful comments I might inadvertently make during this talk — which , by the way , are my own opinions and not Google 's — well , we 'll assume they 're all over there .
All right .
I assume you all looked through the slides already , so I do n't need to spend a whole lot of time with them .
I 'll go into major rant - mode here at the end .
My goal is ... for you guys to come away with , sort of a couple of new pictures in your mind , thinking about how languages have evolved over the last 20 years , where they 're going , what we can do to fix them , that kind of thing .
Does anyone here know how to use a Mac ?
It 's showing me this weird , uh ... thing ...
OK .
All right .
Here goes .
So !Popular opinion of dynamic languages : slooooow !
They 're always talking about how Python is really slow , right ?
Python is , what , like 10 x to 100x slower ?
And they have bad tools .
And also there 's this sort of , kind of difficult - to - refute one , that says at millions of lines of code , they 're maintenance nightmares , right ?
Because they do n't have static types .
That one , uh , unfortunately we 're not going to be able to talk much about , because not many people have millions - of - lines code bases for us to look at — because dynamic languages wind up with small code bases .
But I 'll talk a little bit about it .
So first of all , one of my compatriots here , who 's an actual smart person , like probably everybody in this room , you 're all waaay smarter than me — I got invited here for the booger jokes , all right ?
– he 's a languages guy , and he said : " You know , you can't talk about dynamic languages without precisely defining what you mean .
" So I 'm going to precisely define it .
Dynamic languages are , by definition ...
Perl Tcl ... all right ?
[ ( laughter ) ]
It 's the working set of languages that people dismiss today as " dynamic languages . "
I 'll also include Smalltalk Prolog , some of our stars , you know , from the 70s and 80s that , uh , well they 'll come up here today too .
I 'm deliberately not going down the path of " well , some static languages have dynamic features , and some dynamic languages have static types " , because first of all it's this neverending pit of , you know , argument , and second of all , as you 're going to see , it 's completely irrelevant to my talk .
The two ... sort of qualities that people associate with " dynamic " : one would be sort of ... runtime features , starting with eval , and the other would be the lack of type tags , the lack of required type tags , or even just escapes in your type system .
These things work together to produce the tools problems and the performance problems , ok ?
And I 'll talk about them , and how they 're going to be fixed .
All right !
I just talked about that [ slide ] .
So !
Uh ... yeah , that 's right , I 'm at Stanford !
Forgot about that .
So I 've been interviewing for about 20 years , at a whole bunch of companies , and yeah , Stan– every school has this sort of profile , right ?
You know , the candidates come out with these ideals that their profs have instilled in them .
And Stanford has a really interesting one , by and large : that their undergrads and their grad students come out , and they believe that C and C++ are the fabric with which God wove the Universe .
OK ?
And they truly [ think ] : what is it with all these other languages ?
Whereas like MIT and Berkeley , they come out , and they 're like " languages , languages , languages ! " and you 're like , uh , dude , you actually have to use C and C++ , and they 're like " oh . "
So it 's funny , the kinds of profiles that come out .
But this one [ first slide bullet point ] , I mean , it 's kind of a funny thing to say , because the guy 's a Ph.D. , and he 's just discovered Turing 's thesis .
Of course all you need is C or C ++.
All you need is a Turing machine , right ?
You know ?
What we 're talking about here is fundamentally a very personal , a very political , sort of a , it 's almost a fashion statement about who you are , what kind of language you pick .
So , you know ... unfortunately we could talk , I mean I 've got 2 hours of ranting in me about this topic , but I 'm gonna have to , like , kinda like narrow it down to ... we 're gonna talk about dynamic languages because people are out there today using them .
They 're getting stuff done , and it works .
All right ?
And they really do have performance and tools issues .
But they 're getting resolved in really interesting ways .
And I 'm hoping that those of you who are either going out into the industry to start making big things happen , OR , you 're researchers , who are going to be publishing the next decade 's worth of papers on programming language design , will take some interesting directional lessons out of this talk .
We 'll see .
All right .
So why are dynamic languages slow ?
Uh , we all know they 're slow because ... they 're dynamic !
Because , ah , the dynamic features defeat the compiler .
Compilers are this really well understood , you know , really really thoroughly researched ... everybody knows THIS [ brandish the Dragon Book ] , right ?
Compilers !
The Dragon Book !
From your school !
OK ?
It 's a great book .
Although interestingly , heh , it 's funny : if you implement everything in this book , what you wind up with is a really naïve compiler .
It 's really advanced a long way since ... [ the book was written ] and they know that .
Dynamic languages are slow because all the tricks that compilers can do to try to guess how to generate efficient machine code get completely thrown out the window .
Here 's one example .
C is really fast , because among other things , the compiler can inline function calls .
It 's gonna use some heuristics , so it does n't get too much code bloat , but if it sees a function call , it can inline it : it patches it right in , ok , because it knows the address at link time .
C++ — you 've got your virtual method dispatch , which is what C++ you know , sort of evangelists , that 's the first thing they go after , like in an interview , " tell me how a virtual method table works ! "
Right ?
Out of all the features in C++ , they care a lot about that one , because it 's the one they have to pay for at run time , and it drives them nuts !
It drives them nuts because the compiler does n't know , at run time , the receiver 's type .
If you callcould be some class that C++ knows about , or it could be some class that got loaded in afterwards .
And so it winds up — this polymorphism winds up meaning the compiler can compile both the caller and the callee , but it can't compile them together .
So you get all the overhead of a function call .
Plus , you know , the method lookup .
Which is more than just the instructions involved .
You 're also blowing your instruction cache , and you 're messing with all these , potentially , code optimizations that could be happening if it were one basic - block fall - through .
All right .
Please – feel free to stop me or ask questions if I say something that 's unclear .
I know , just looking around the room , that most of you probably know this stuff better than I do .
So !
The last [ bullet point ] is really interesting .
Because nobody has tried , for this latest crop of languages , to optimize them .
They 're scripting languages , right ?
They were actually designed to either script some host environment like a browser , or to script Unix .
I mean the goal was to perform these sort of I /O - bound computations ; there was no point in making them fast .
Except when people started trying to build larger and larger systems with them : that 's when speed really started becoming an issue .
OK .
So obviously there 's a bunch of ways you can speed up a dynamic language .
The number one thing you can do , is you can write a better program .
The algorithm , you know , is gonna trump any of the stuff you 're doing at the VM – you can optimize the hell out of Bubble Sort , but ... Native threads would be really nice .
Perl , Python , Ruby , JavaScript , Lua ... none of them has a usable concurrency option right now .
None of them .
I mean , they kinda have them , but they 're like , Buyer Beware !
Do n't ever use this on a machine with more than one processor .
Or more than one thread .
And then you 're OK .
It 's just , you know ... So actually , this is funny , because , all right , show of hands here .
We 've all heard this for fifteen years now – is it true ?
Is Java as fast as C ++?
Who says yes ?
All right ... we 've got a small number of hands ... so I assume the rest of you are like , do n't know , or it does n't matter , or " No . " [ Audience member : " We read your slides . " ]
You read my slides .
OK .
I do n't know ...
I can't remember what I put in my slides .
But it 's interesting because C++ is obviously faster for , you know , the short - running [ programs ] , but Java cheated very recently .
With multicore !
This is actually becoming a huge thorn in the side of all the C++ programmers , including my colleagues at Google , who 've written vast amounts of C++ code that does n't take advantage of multicore .
And so the extent to which the cores , you know , the processors become parallel , C++ is gonna fall behind .
Now obviously threads do n't scale that well either , right ?
So the Java people have got a leg up for a while , because you can use ten threads or a hundred threads , but you 're not going to use a million threads !
It 's not going to be Erlang on you all of the sudden .
So obviously a better concurrency option – and that 's a huge rat 's nest that I 'm not going to go into right now – but it 's gonna be the right way to go .
But for now , Java programs are getting amazing throughput because they can parallelize and they can take advantage of it .
They cheated !
Right ?
But threads aside , the JVM has gotten really really fast , and at Google it 's now widely admitted on the Java side that Java 's just as fast as C++. [ ( laughter ) ]
So !
It 's interesting , because every once in a while , a C++ programmer , you know , they flip : they go over to the Dark Side .
I 've seen it happen to some of the most brilliant C++ hackers , I mean they 're computer scientists , but they 're also C++ to the core .
And all of a sudden they 're stuck with some , you know , lame JavaScript they had to do as an adjunct to this beautiful backend system they wrote .
And they futz around with it for a while , and then all of a sudden this sort of light bulb goes off , and they 're like " Hey , what 's up with this ?
This is way more productive , you know , and it does n't seem to be as slow as I 'd sort of envisioned it to be .
" And then they maybe do some build scripting in Python , and then all of a sudden they come over to my desk and they ask : " Hey !
Can any of these be fast ? "
Ha , ha , ha !
I mean , these are the same people that , you know , a year ago I 'd talk to them and I 'd say " why not use ... anything but C++?
Why not use D ?
Why not use Objective - C ?
Why not use anything but C++?
Right ?
Because we all know that C++ has some very serious problems , that organizations , you know , put hundreds of staff years into fixing .
Portability across compiler upgrades , across platforms , I mean the list goes on and on and on .
C++ is like an evolutionary sort of dead - end .
But , you know , it 's fast , right ?
And so you ask them , why not use , like , D? Or Objective - C .
And they say , " well , what if there 's a garbage collection pause ?
" Oooh !
[ I mock shudder ]
You know , garbage collection – first of all , generational garbage collectors do n't have pauses anymore , but second of all , they 're kind of missing the point that they 're still running on an operating system that has to do things like process scheduling and memory management .
There are pauses .
It 's not as if you 're running DOS !
I hope .
OK ?
And so , you know , their whole argument is based on these fallacious , you know , sort of almost pseudo - religious ... and often it 's the case that they 're actually based on things that used to be true , but they 're not really true anymore , and we 're gonna get to some of the interesting ones here .
But mostly what we 're going to be talking about today is the compilers themselves .
Because they 're getting really , really smart .
All right , so first of all I 've gotta give a nod to these languages ... which nobody uses .
OK ?
Common Lisp has a bunch of really high - quality compilers .
And when they say they achieve , you know , " C - like speed " , you 've gotta understand , you know , I mean , there 's more to it than just " does this benchmark match this benchmark ?
" Everybody knows it's an ROI [ calculation ] .
It 's a tradeoff where you 're saying : is it sufficiently fast now that the extra hardware cost for it being 10 or 20 percent slower ( or even 2 x slower ) , you know , is outweighed by the productivity gains we get from having dynamic features and expressive languages .
That 's of course the rational approach that everyone takes , right ?
No !
Lisp has all those parentheses .
Of course nobody 's gonna look at it .
I mean , it 's ridiculous how people think about these things .
But with that said , these were actually very good languages .
And let me tell you something that 's NOT in the slides , for all those of you who read them in advance , OK ?
This is my probably completely wrong ... it 's certainly over - generalized , but it 's a partly true take on what happened to languages and language research and language implementations over the last , say 30 years .
There was a period where they were kind of neck and neck , dynamic and static , you know , there were Fortran and Lisp , you know , and then there was a period where dynamic languages really flourished .
They really took off .
I mean , I 'm talking about the research papers , you can look : there 's paper after paper , proofs ... And implementations !
StrongTalk was really interesting .
They added a static type system , an optional static type system on top of Smalltalk that sped it up like 20x , or maybe it was 12 x .
But , you know , this is a prototype compiler that never even made it into production .
You 've gotta understand that when a researcher does a prototype , right , that comes within , you know , fifty percent of the speed gains you can achieve from a production compiler ... because they have n't done a tenth , a hundredth of the optimizations that you could do if you were in the industry cranking interns through the problem , right ?
I mean HotSpot 's VM , it 's got like ten years of Sun 's implementation into not one , but two compilers in HotSpot , which is a problem they 're trying to address .
So we 're talking about , you know , a 12 x gain really translates to something a lot larger than that when you put it into practice .
In case I forget to mention it , all these compiler optimizations I 'm talking about , I do mean all of them , are composable .
Which is really important .
It 's not like you have to choose this way or you have to choose that way .
They 're composable , which means they actually reinforce each other .
So God only knows how fast these things can get .
This is the only interesting ... this is actually the only , I would say , probably original , sort of compelling thought for this talk today .
I really – I started to believe this about a week ago .
All right ?
Because it 's an urban legend [ that they change every decade ] .
You know how there 's Moore 's Law , and there are all these conjectures in our industry that involve , you know , how things work .
And one of them is that languages get replaced every ten years .
Because that 's what was happening up until like 1995 .
But the barriers to adoption are really high .
One that I did n't put on the slide here , I mean obviously there 's the marketing , you know , and there 's the open - source code base , and there are legacy code bases .
There 's also , there are also a lot more programmers , I mean many more , orders of magnitude more , around the world today than there were in 1995 .
Remember , the dot - com boom made everybody go : " Oooh , I wanna be in Computer Science , right ?
Or I just wanna learn Python and go hack . "
OK ?
Either way .
( The Python hackers probably made a lot more money . )
But what we wound up with was a bunch of entry - level programmers all around the world who know one language , whichever one it is , and they do n't want to switch .
Switching languages : the second one is your hardest .
Because the first one was hard , and you think the second one 's going to be that bad , and that you wasted the entire investment you put into learning the first one .
So , by and large , programmers – you know , the rank - and - file – they pretty much pick a language and they stay with it for their entire career .
And that is why we 've got this situation where now , this ...
See , there 's plenty of great languages out there today .
OK ?
I mean obviously you can start with Squeak , sort of the latest Smalltalk fork , and it 's beautiful .
Or you can talk about various Lisp implementations out there that are smokin ' fast , or they 're smokin ' good .
Or in one or two cases , both .
But also there 's , like , the Boo language , the io language , there 's the Scala language , you know , I mean there 's Nice , and Pizza , have you guys heard about these ones ?
I mean there 's a bunch of good languages out there , right ?
Some of them are really good dynamically typed languages .
Some of them are , you know , strongly [ statically ] typed .
And some are hybrids , which I personally really like .
And nobody 's using any of them !
Now , I mean , Scala might have a chance .
There 's a guy giving a talk right down the hall about it , the inventor of – one of the inventors of Scala .
And I think it 's a great language and I wish him all the success in the world .
Because it would be nice to have , you know , it would be nice to have that as an alternative to Java .
But when you 're out in the industry , you can't .
You get lynched for trying to use a language that the other engineers do n't know .
Trust me .
I 've tried it .
I do n't know how many of you guys here have actually been out in the industry , but I was talking about this with my intern .
I was , and I think you [ ( point to audience member ) ] said this in the beginning : this is 80 % politics and 20 % technology , right ?
You know .
And [ my intern ] is , like , " well I understand the argument " and I 'm like " No , no , no !
You 've never been in a company where there 's an engineer with a Computer Science degree and ten years of experience , an architect , who 's in your face screaming at you , with spittle flying on you , because you suggested using , you know ...
D . Or Haskell .
Or Lisp , or Erlang , or take your pick .
" In fact , I 'll tell you a funny story .
So this ... at Google , when I first got there , I was all idealistic .
I 'm like , wow , well Google hires all these great computer scientists , and so they must all be completely language - agnostic , and ha , ha , little do I know ...
So I 'm up there , and I 'm like , we 've got this product , this totally research -y prototype type thing , we do n't know .
We want to put some quick - turnaround kind of work into it .
But Google is really good at building infrastructure for scaling .
And I mean scaling to , you know , how many gazillion transactions per second or queries per second , you know , whatever .
They scale like nobody 's business , but their " Hello , World " takes three days to get through .
At least it did when I first got to Google .
They were not built for rapid prototyping , OK ?
So that means when you try to do what Eric Schmidt talks about and try to generate luck , by having a whole bunch of initiatives , some of which will get lucky , right ?
Everybody 's stuck trying to scale it from the ground up .
And that was unacceptable to me , so I tried to ...
I made the famously , horribly , career - shatteringly bad mistake of trying to use Ruby at Google , for this project .
And I became , very quickly , I mean almost overnight , the Most Hated Person At Google .
And , uh , and I 'd have arguments with people about it , and they'd be like Nooooooo , WHAT IF ...
And ultimately , you know , ultimately they actually convinced me that they were right , in the sense that there actually were a few things .
There were some taxes that I was imposing on the systems people , where they were gonna have to have some maintenance issues that they would n't have [ otherwise had ] .
Those reasons I thought were good ones .
But when I was going through this debate , I actually talked to our VP Alan Eustace , who came up to a visit to Kirkland .
And I was like , " Alan ! " ( after his talk ) " Let 's say , hypothetically , we 've got this team who are really smart people ...
" And I point to my friend Barry [ pretending it 's him ] , and I 'm like : " Let 's say they want to do something in a programming language that 's not one of the supported Google languages .
You know , like what if they wanted to use , you know , Haskell ?
" What I really wanted to do at the time was use Lisp , actually , but I did n't say it .
And [ Alan ] goes , " Well ! "
He says , " Well ... how would you feel if there was a team out there who said they were gonna use ... LISP ! " [ ( laughter ) ]
He 'd pulled his ace out of his [ sleeve ] , and brandished it at me , and I went : " that 's what I wanted to use . "
And he goes , " Oh . " [ ( turning away quickly ) ]
And that was the end of the conversation .
[ ( laughter ) ]
But you know , ultimately , and it comes up all the time , I mean we 've got a bunch of famous Lisp people , and ( obviously ) famous Python people , and you know , famous language people inside of Google , and of course they 'd like to do some experimentation .
But , you know , Google 's all about getting stuff done .
So that brings us full circle back to the point of this topic , which is : the languages we have today , sorted by popularity at this instant , are probably going to stay about that popular for the next ten years .
Sad , is n't it ?
Very , very sad .
But that 's the way it is .
So how do we fix them ?
How – how am I doing for time ?
Probably done , huh ?
Fifteen minutes ?
[ ( audience member : no , more than that ) ]
OK , good .
So !
I 'm gonna talk a little bit about tools , because one interesting thing I noticed when I was putting this thing together , right , was that the ways you solve tools problems for dynamic languages are very similar to the way you solve perf problems .
OK ?
And I 'm not going to try to keep you guessing or anything .
I 'll tell you what the sort of ... kernel of the idea is here .
It 's that ... the notion of " static " versus " dynamic " , where you kind of have to do all these optimizations and all these computations statically , on a language , is very old - fashioned .
OK ?
And increasingly it 's becoming obvious to everybody , you know , even the C++ crowd , that you get a lot better information at run-time .
* Much * better information .
In particular , let me come back to my inlining example .
Java inlines polymorphic methods !
Now the simplest way to do it was actually invented here at Stanford by Googler Urs Hoelzle , who's , you know , like VP and Fellow there , and it 's called , it 's now called Polymorphic Inline Caching .
He called it , uh , type - feedback compilation , I believe is what he called it .
Great paper .
And it scared everybody , apparently .
The rumors on the mailing lists were that people were terrified of it , I mean it seems too hard .
And if you look at it now , you 're like , dang , that was a good idea .
All it is , I mean , I told you the compiler does n't know the receiver type , right ?
But the thing is , in computing , I mean , heuristics work pretty well .
The whole 80/20 rule and the Power Law apply pretty much unilaterally across the board .
So you can make assumptions like : the first time through a loop , if a particular variable is a specific instance of a type , then it 's probably going to be [ the same type ] on the remaining iterations of the loop .
OK ?
So what he [ Urs ] does , is he has these counters at hot spots in the code , in the VM .
And they come in and they check the types of the arguments [ or operands ] .
And they say , all right , it looks like a bunch of them appear to be class B , where we thought it might be class A.So what we 're gonna do is generate this fall - through code that says , all right , if it 's a B – so they have to put the guard instruction in there ; it has to be correct : it has to handle the case where they 're wrong , OK ?
But they can make the guard instruction very , very fast , effectively one instruction , depending on how you do it .
You can compare the address of the intended method , or you can maybe do a type - tag comparison .
There are different ways to do it , but it 's fast , and more importantly , if it 's right , which it is 80 - 90 % of the time , it falls through [ i.e. , inlines the method for that type - Ed. ] , which means you maintain your processor pipeline and all that stuff .
So it means they have predicted the type of the receiver .
They 've successfully inlined that .
I mean , you can do a whole bunch of branching , and they actually found out through some experimentation that you only need to do 2 to 4 of these , right , before the gain completely tails off .
So you do n't have to generate too much of this .
And they 've expanded on this idea now , for the last ten years .
Getting back to my point about what 's happening [ over the past 30 years ] , there was an AI winter .
You all remember the AI winter , right ?
Where , like , investors were pumping millions of dollars into Smalltalk and Lisp companies who were promising they 'd cure world hunger , cure cancer , and everything ?
And unfortunately they were using determinism !
They 're using heuristics , OK , but you know ... before I came to Google , you know , I was really fascinated by something Peter Norvig was saying .
He was saying that they do n't do natural language processing deterministically any more .
You know , like maybe , conceivably , speculating here , Microsoft Word 's grammar checker does it , where you 'd have a Chomsky grammar , right ?
And you 're actually going in and you 're doing something like a compiler does , trying to derive the sentence structure .
And you know , whatever your output is , whether it 's translation or grammar checking or whatever ... None of that worked !
It all became way too computationally expensive , plus the languages kept changing , and the idioms and all that .
Instead , [ Peter was saying ] they do it all probablistically .
Now historically , every time you came along , and you just obsoleted a decade of research by saying , " Well , we 're just gonna kind of wing it , probabilistically " — and you know , Peter Norvig was saying they get these big data sets of documents that have been translated , in a whole bunch of different languages , and they run a bunch of machine learning over it , and they can actually match your sentence in there to one with a high probability of it being this translation .
And it 's usually right !
It certainly works a lot better than deterministic methods , and it 's computationally a lot cheaper .
OK , so whenever you do that , it makes people MAD .
Their first instinct is to say " nuh - UUUUUUH !!!! "
Right ?
I 'm serious !
I 'm serious .
It happened when John von Neumann [ and others ] introduced Monte Carlo methods .
Everyone was like " arrgggggh " , but eventually they come around to it .
They go " yeah , I guess you 're right ; I 'll go back and hit the math books again .
"
It 's happening in programming languages today .
I mean , as we speak .
I mean , there 's a paper I 'm gonna tell you about , from October , and it 's basically coming along and ... it 's not really machine learning , but you 're gonna see it 's the same kind of [ data - driven ] thing , right ?
It 's this " winging it " approach that 's actually much cheaper to compute .
And it has much better results , because the runtime has all the information .
So let me just finish the tools really quick .
And I 'm not talking to you guys ; I 'm talking to the people in the screen [ i.e. watching the recording ] – all these conversations I 've had with people who say : " No type tags means no information ! "
I mean , effectively that 's what they 're saying .
I mean ... What 's ?
It 's a function .
How did I know that ?
[ ( laughter ) ]
What 's ?
What 's ?
You know , it 's a composite type .
It 's an Object .
It has two fields that are strings .
Call it a record , call it a tuple , call it whatever you want : we know what it is .
The syntax of a language , unless it 's Scheme , gives you a lot of clues about the semantics , right ?
That 's actually the one place , maybe , where lots of syntax actually wins out [ over Scheme ] .
I just thought of that .
Huh .OK , so ... then you get into dynamic languages .
This [ code ] is all JavaScript .
This is actually something I 'm working on right now .
I 'm trying to build this JavaScript code graph , and you actually have to know all these tricks .
And of course it 's undecidable , right , I mean this is , you know , somebody could be defining a function at the console , and I 'm not gonna be able to find that .
So at some point you 've gotta kind of draw the line .
What you do is , you look at your corpus , your code base , and see what are the common idioms that people are using .
In JavaScript , you 've got a couple of big standard libraries that everybody seems to be including these days , and they all have their slightly different ways of doing function definitions .
Some of them use Object literals ; some of them use the horriblestatement , you know , that JavaScript people hate .
But your compiler can figure all these out .
And I was actually going through this Dragon Book , because they can even handle aliasing , right ?
Your IDE for JavaScript , if I say " " , and you know ... Did I handle this here [ in the slides ] ?
Yeah , right here !
And I say , is an object , is , and I have an alias now .
The algorithm for doing this is right here in the Dragon Book .
It 's data - flow analysis .
Now they use it for compiler optimization to do , you know , live variable analysis , register allocation , dead - code elimination , you know , the list kind of goes on .
It 's a very useful technique .
You build this big code graph of basic blocks ... So it 's actually one of the few static - analysis that 's actually carrying over in this new dynamic world where we have all this extra information .
But you can actually use it in JavaScript to figure out function declarations that did n't actually get declared until way later in the code .
Another big point that people miss is that the Java IDEs , you know , that are supposedly always right ?
They 're wrong .
If you miss one time , you 're wrong .
Right ?
In Java Reflection , obviously , the IDE has no information about what 's going on in that string , by definition .
It 's a string : it 's quoted ; it 's opaque .
And so they always wave their hands and say " Ohhhhh , you ca n't do Rename Method !
" Even though Rename Method came from the Smalltalk environment , of course , right ?
And you say , " It came from the Smalltalk environment , so yes , you can do Rename Method in dynamic languages .
" And they say " NO !
Because it 'll miss sometimes !
" To which , I say to you people in the screen , you'd be astonished at how often the Java IDEs miss .
They miss every single instance of a method name that shows up in an XML configuration file , in a reflection layer , in a database persistence layer where you 're matching column names to fields in your classes .
Every time you 've deployed some code to some people out in the field ... Rename Method only works in a small set of cases .
These Refactoring tools that , really , they 're acting are like the Holy Grail , you can do ALL of that in dynamic languages .
That 's the proof , right ?
[ I.e. , static langs miss as often as dynamic – Ed . ]
It 's not even a very interesting topic , except that I just run across it all the time .
Because you ask people , " hey , you say that you 're ten times as productive in Python as in your other language ... why are n't you using Python ?
" Slow ?
Admittedly , well , we 'll get to that .
And tools .
Admittedly .
But I think what 's happened here is Java has kind of shown the new crop of programmers what Smalltalk showed us back in the 80s , which is that IDEs can work and they can be beautiful .
And more importantly – and this is n't in the slides either , for those of you who cheated – they have to be tied to the runtime .
They complain , you know , the Java people are like " Well you have to have all the code loaded into the IDE .
That 's not scalable , it 's not flexible , they can't simulate the program just to be able to get it correct .
" And yet : any sufficiently large Java or C++ system has health checks , monitoring , it opens sockets with listeners so you can ping it programmatically ; you can get , you know , debuggers , you can get remote debuggers attached to it ; it 's got logging , it 's got profiling ... it 's got this long list of things that you need because the static type system failed .
OK ...
Why did we have the static type system in the first place ?
Let me tell you guys a story that , even if you know all this stuff , is still going to shock you .
I credit Bob Jervis for sharing this with me ( the guy who wrote Turbo C. )
So javac , the Java compiler : what does it do ?
Well , it generates bytecode , does some optimizations presumably , and maybe tells you some errors .
And then you ship it off to the JVM .
And what happens to that bytecode ?
First thing that happens is they build a tree out of it , because the bytecode verifier has to go in and make sure you 're not doing anything [ illegal ] .
And of course you can't do it from a stream of bytes : it has to build a usable representation .
So it effectively rebuilds the source code that you went to all that effort to put into bytecode .
But that 's not the end of it , because maybe javac did some optimizations , using the old Dragon Book .
Maybe it did some constant propagation , maybe it did some loop unrolling , whatever .
The next thing that happens in the JVM is the JIT undoes all the optimizations !
Why ?
So it can do better ones because it has runtime information .
So it undoes all the work that javac did , except maybe tell you that you had a parse error .
And the weird thing is , Java keeps piling ...
I 'm getting into rant - mode here , I can tell .
We 're never going to make it to the end of these slides .
Java keeps piling syntax on , you know , but it 's not making the language more expressive .
What they 're doing is they 're adding red tape and bureacracy for stuff you could do back in Java 1.0 .
In Java 1.0 , when you pulled a String out of a Hashtable you had to cast it as a String , which was really stupid because you said You know , it 's like ... if you had to pick a syntax [ for casting ] , you should at least pick one that specifies what you think it 's supposed to be , not what it 's becoming – obviously becoming – on the left side , right ?
And everybody was like , " I do n't like casting !
I do n't like casting ! "
So what did they do ?
What they could have done is they could have said , " All right , you do n't have to cast anymore .
We know what kind of variable you 're trying to put it in .
We 'll cast it , and [ maybe ] you 'll get a .
" Instead , they introduced generics , right , which is this huge , massive , category - theoretic type system that they brought in , where you have to under [ stand ] – to actually use it you have to know the difference between covariant and contravariant return [ and argument ] types , and you have to understand why every single mathematical ...
[ I tail off in strangled frustration ... ]
And then what happens on mailing lists is users say : " So I 'm trying to do X . "
And they say : " WELL , for the following category - theoretic reasons ... there 's no way to do it . "
And they go : " Oh ! Oh .
Then I 'm gonna go use JavaScript , then . "
Right ?
I mean , it 's like , what the hell did this type system do for Java ?
It introduced inertia and complexity to everybody who 's writing tools , to everybody who 's writing compilers , to everybody who 's writing runtimes , and to everybody who 's writing code .
And it did n't make the language more expressive .
So what 's happening ?
Java 7 is happening .
And I encourage you all to go look at that train wreck , because oh my God .
Oh , God .
I did n't sleep last night .
I 'm all wired right now because I looked at Java 7 last night .
And it was a mistake .
[ ( laughter ) ]
Ohhh ...OK .
So !
Moving right back along to our simple dynamic languages , the lesson is : it 's not actually harder to build these tools [ for dynamic languages ] .
It 's different .
And nobody 's done the work yet , although people are starting to .
And actually IntelliJ is a company with this IDEA [ IDE ] , and they ... my friends show off the JavaScript tool , you know , and it 's like , man !
They should do one for Python , and they should do one for every single dynamic language out there , because they kick butt at it .
I 'm sure they did all this stuff and more than I 'm talking about here .
All right .
Now we can talk about perf .
This is the Crown Jewels of the talk .
Yeah .
So ... unfortunately I have to make the disclaimer that everybody thinks about performance wrong , except for you guys ' cuz you all know , right ?
But seriously , I mean , you know , you understand , I started out of school ...
* sigh *OK : I went to the University of Washington and [ then ]
I got hired by this company called Geoworks , doing assembly - language programming , and I did it for five years .
To us , the Geoworkers , we wrote a whole operating system , the libraries , drivers , apps , you know : a desktop operating system in assembly .
8086 assembly !
It was n't even good assembly !
We had four registers !
[ Plus the ] si [ register ] if you counted , you know , if you counted 386 , right ?
It was horrible .
I mean , actually we kind of liked it .
It was Object - Oriented Assembly .
It 's amazing what you can talk yourself into liking , which is the real irony of all this .
And to us , C++ was the ultimate in Roman decadence .
I mean , it was equivalent to going and vomiting so you could eat more .
They had IF !
We had jump CX zero !
Right ?
They had " Objects " .
Well we did too , but I mean they had syntax for it , right ?
I mean it was all just such weeniness .
And we knew that we could outperform any compiler out there because at the time , we could !
So what happened ?
Well , they went bankrupt .
Why ?
Now I 'm probably disagreeing – I know for a fact that I 'm disagreeing with every Geoworker out there .
I 'm the only one that holds this belief .
But it 's because we wrote fifteen million lines of 8086 assembly language .
We had really good tools , world class tools : trust me , you need 'em .
But at some point , man ... The problem is , picture an ant walking across your garage floor , trying to make a straight line of it .
It ai n't gonna make a straight line .
And you know this because you have perspective .
You can see the ant walking around , going hee hee hee , look at him locally optimize for that rock , and now he 's going off this way , right ?
This is what we were , when we were writing this giant assembly - language system .
Because what happened was , Microsoft eventually released a platform for mobile devices that was much faster than ours .
OK ?
And I started going in with my debugger , going , what ?
What is up with this ?
This rendering is just really slow , it 's like sluggish , you know .
And I went in and found out that some title bar was getting rendered 140 times every time you refreshed the screen .
It was n't just the title bar .
Everything was getting called multiple times .
Because we could n't see how the system worked anymore !
Small systems are not only easier to optimize , they 're possible to optimize .
And I mean globally optimize .
So when we talk about performance , it 's all crap .
The most important thing is that you have a small system .
And then the performance will just fall out of it naturally .
That said , all else being equal , let 's just pretend that Java can make small systems .
Heh , that 's a real stretch , I know .
Let 's talk about actual optimization .
And by the way , here are some real examples , sort of like the Geoworks one , where a slower language wound up with a faster system .
It 's not just me .
I 've seen it all over the place .
Do you know why this one happened ?
Why was the Ruby on Rails faster than Struts ?
This started one of the internet 's largest flamewars since Richard Stallman dissed Tcl back in the 80s , you know .
You guys remember that ?
[ ( laughter ) ]
I mean , the Java people went nuts , I mean really really nuts , I mean like angry Orcs , they were just like AAAaaaaauuuugh , they did NOT want to hear it .
OK ?
It was because they were serializing everything to and from XML because Java can't do declarations .
That 's why .
That 's the reason .
I mean , stupid reasons , but performance comes from some strange places .
That said , OK , disclaimers out of the way ... Yeah yeah , people are using them .
Um , yeah .
So JavaScript .
JavaScript has been really interesting to me lately , because JavaScript actually does care about performance .
They 're the first of the modern dynamic languages where performance has become an issue not just for the industry at large , but also increasingly for academia .
Why JavaScript ?
Well , it was Ajax .
See , what happened was ...
Lemme tell ya how it was supposed to be .
JavaScript was going away .
It does n't matter whether you were Sun or Microsoft or anybody , right ?
JavaScript was going away , and it was gonna get replaced with ... heh .
Whatever your favorite language was .
I mean , it was n't actually the same for everybody .
It might have been C# , it might have been Java , it might have been some new language , but it was going to be a modern language .
A fast language .
It was gonna be a scalable language , in the sense of large - scale engineering .
Building desktop apps .
That 's the way it was gonna be .
The way it 's really gonna be , is JavaScript is gonna become one of the smokin ' - est fast languages out there .
And I mean smokin ' fast .
Now it 's not the only one that 's making this claim .
There 's actually a lot of other ... you guys know about PyPy ?
Python in Python ?
Those crack fiends say they can get C - like performance .
Come on ...
COME ON !
They ... I mean , seriously !
That 's what they say .
Here 's the deal , right ?
They 're saying it because they 're throwing all the old assumptions out .
They can get this performance by using these techniques here , fundamentally .
But if nobody believes them , then even when they achieve this performance it's not gonna matter because still nobody 's gonna believe them , so all of this stuff we 're talking about is a little bit moot .
Nevertheless , I 'm going to tell you about some of the stuff that I know about that 's going on in JavaScript .
So type inference .
You can do type inference .
Except that it 's lame , because it does n't handle weird dynamic features like upconverting integers to Doubles when they overflow .
Which JavaScript does , interestingly enough , which is I guess better behavior than ...
I mean , it still overflows eventually , right ?
We overflowed aat Google once .
Nobody thought that was possible , but it actually happened .
I 'll tell you about that later if you want to know .
So ... oh yeah , I already talked about Polymorphic Inline Caches .
Great !
I already talked about a lot of this stuff .
This one 's really cool .
This is a trick that somebody came up with , that you can actually – there 's a paper on it , where you can actually figure out the actual types of any data object in any dynamic language : figure it out the first time through by using this double virtual method lookup .
They 've boxed these things .
And then you just expect it to be the same the rest of the time through [ the loop ] , and so all this stuff about having a type - tag saying this is an– which might not actually be technically correct , if you 're going to overflow into a Double , right ?
Or maybe you 're using an int but what you 're really using is a byte 's worth of it , you know .
The runtime can actually figure things out around bounds that are undecidable at compile time .
So that 's a cool one .
This is the really cool one .
This is the really , really cool one .
Trace trees .
This is a paper that came out in October .
This is the one , actually ...
I 'll be honest with you , I actually have two optimizations that could n't go into this talk that are even cooler than this because they have n't published yet .
And I did n't want to let the cat out of the bag before they published .
So this is actually just the tip of the iceberg .
But trace trees , it 's a really simple idea .
What you do is your runtime , your VM , you know , it 's interpreting instructions and can count them .
Well , it can also record them !
So any time it hits , basically , a branch backwards , which usually means it 's going to the beginning of a loop , which usually means it 's going to be a hot spot , especially if you 're putting a counter there ...
Obviously [ in ] the inner loops , the hot spots will get the highest counts , and they get triggered at a certain level .
It turns on a recorder .
That 's all it does .
It starts recording instructions .
It does n't care about loop boundaries .
It does n't care about methods .
It does n't care about modules .
It just cares about " What are you executing ?
" And it records these tree – well actually , traces , until they get back to that point .
And it uses some heuristics to throw stuff away if it goes too long or whatever .
But it records right through methods .
And instead of setting up the activation , it just inlines it as it goes .
Inline , inline , inline , right ?
So they 're big traces , but they 're known to be hot spots .
And even here in the Dragon Book , Aho , Sethi and Ullman , they say , you know , one of the most important things a compiler can do is try to identify what the hot spots are going to be so it can make them efficient .
Because who cares if you 're optimizing the function that gets executed once at startup , right ?
So these traces wind up being trees , because what can happen is , they branch any time an operand is a different type .
That 's how they handle the overflow to Double : there 'll be a branch .
They wind up with these trees .
They 've still got a few little technical issues like , for example , growing exponentially on the Game of Life .
There 's a blog about it , um ...
I 'm sorry , I 've completely forgotten his name [ Andreas Gal ] , but I will blog this .
And the guy that 's doing these trace trees , he got feedback saying that they 've got exponential growth .
So they came up with this novel way of folding the trace trees , right , so there are code paths that are almost identical and they can share , right ?
It 's all the same kind of stuff they were doing with these [ Dragon Book ] data structures back when they were building static compilers .
We are at the very beginning of this research !
What has happened is , we 've gone from Dynamic [ to ]
AI Winter ... dynamic research stopped , and anybody who was doing it was sort of anathema in the whole academic [ community ] ... worldwide across all the universities .
There were a couple of holdouts .
[ Dan Friedman and ]
Matthias Felleisen , right , the Little Schemer guys , right ?
Holding out hope .
And everybody else went and chased static .
And they 've been doing it like crazy .
And they 've , in my opinion , reached the theoretical bounds of what they can deliver , and it has FAILED .
These static type systems , they 're WRONG .
Wrong in the sense that when you try to do something , and they say :
No , category theory does n't allow that , because it 's not elegant ...
Hey man : who 's wrong ?
The person who 's trying to write the program , or the type system ?
And some of the type errors you see in these Hindley - Milner type [ systems ] , or any type system , like " expected ( int * int * int ) " , you know , a tuple , and " but got ( int * int * int ) " , you know [ ( clapping my hands to my head ) ] it 's pretty bad , right ?
I mean , they 've , I think they 've failed .
Which is why they 're not getting adopted .
Now of course that 's really controversial .
There are probably a bunch of type - systems researchers here who are really mad , but ... What 's happening is : as of this Ajax revolution , the industry shifted to trying to optimize JavaScript .
And that has triggered what is going to be a landslide of research in optimizing dynamic languages .
So these tricks I 'm telling you about , they 're just the beginning of it .
And if we come out of this talk with one thing , it 's that it 's cool to optimize dynamic languages again !
" Cool " in the sense of getting venture funding , right ?
You know , and research grants ... " Cool " in the sense of making meaningful differences to all those people writing Super Mario clones in JavaScript .
You know .
It 's cool .
And so I encourage you , if you 're a language - savvy kind of person , to jump in and try to help .
Me , I 'm probably going to be doing grunt implementations , since I 'm not that smart .
And I do n't even need to talk about this [ last optimization — Escape Analysis ] , since you already knew it .
All right !
So that 's it .
That 's my talk .
CPUs ... you get all the good information about how a program is running at run time .
And this has huge implications for the tools and for the performance .
It 's going to change the way we work .
It 's eventually – God , I hope sooner rather than later – going to obsolete C++ finally .
It 's going to be a lot of work , right ?
And then , when we finish , nobody 's going to use it .
[ ( laughter ) ]
Because , you know .
Because that 's just how people are .
That 's my talk !
Thanks .
[ ( applause ) ] Questions ?
No questions ?
I think we 're out of time , right ?
[ ( audience : no , we have half an hour ) ]
Hey man , I 'm doing it right now .
[ ( laughter ) ]
I am !
In a sense , right ?
I mean , like , Perl was a marketing success , right ?
But it did n't have Sun or Microsoft or somebody hyping it .
It had , you know , the guy in the cube next to you saying " Hey , check out this Perl .
I know you 're using Awk , but Perl 's , like , weirder !
"
The marketing can happen in any way that gets this message across , this meme out to everybody , in the Richard Dawkins sense .
That 's marketing .
And it starts from just telling people : hey , it 's out there .
Ah !
I knew somebody was going to ask that .
So unfortunately , the JITs that are doing all these cool code optimizations could potentially be running into these weird impedance mismatches with microprocessors that are doing their own sets of optimizations .
I know nothing about this except that it's ... probably gonna happen .
And , uh , God I hope they talk to each other .
[ Editor 's note : after the talk , I heard that trace trees started life in hardware , at HP . ]
Yes .
I do know ... that there 's a compiler now that compiles [ machine code ] into microcode , a JIT , you know , I was reading about it .
Yeah ... * sigh * .
Well , I think for the forseeable future , I mean honestly having talked to several of the VM implementers , they 're not making any claims that JavaScript 's going to be as fast as C any time soon .
Not for the forseeable future .
It 's going to be very fast , right , but it 's not going to be quite ... they 're not going to make the crazy promises that Sun did .
Which means that these dynamic speedups are primarily going to be useful in long - running distributed processes , for which a little glitch now and then is n't going to matter in the grand scheme of the computation .
Or , they 're going to be , you know , the harder one is in clients , where you 've got a browser app , and you 're hoping that the glitch you 're talking about is n't on the order of hundreds of milliseconds .
Generational garbage collectors is the best answer I 've got for that , because it reduces the pauses , and frankly , the garbage collectors for all the [ new ] dynamic languages today are crap .
They 're mark - and - sweep , or they 're reference counted .
They 've got to fix that .
Right out of the starting gate , that 's gonna nullify 80 percent of that argument .
For the rest , I do n't know .
It 's up to you guys .
That 's right .
As you point out , it 's domain - specific .
If your bottleneck is your database , all bets are off .
For this talk , yes . [ ( laughter ) ]
Yeah , absolutely !
Yep !
They can , actually .
That 's what they 'll say .
And I 'll say : " All right .
I 'll give you a thousand dollars when you 're done . "
OK ?
Because C++ have actually shot themselves in their own foot .
By adding so many performance hacks into the language , and also actual features into the language for performance , like pointer manipulation , the language itself is large enough that it 's very difficult .
It 's much more difficult to envision doing a JIT that can handle pointers properly , for example , right ?
You can do it !
It 's just a lot more work than it is for these simple languages .
[ In retrospect , I 'm not so sure about this claim .
Trace trees may not care about pointers , so maybe it would n't be that hard ?
Of course , they'd have to move to a JIT first , requiring an initial slowdown , so it 'd probably never happen .
- Ed . ]
So they 're winding up ... they 're winding up in a situation where they 're gonna have to weigh it carefully , and say , " OK : when all is said and done , is my language actually gonna be faster than these other languages that have gone through this process already ? "
Because now we 're on a more level playing field .
Especially as it's getting increasingly difficult to predict exactly what the hardware architecture is going to be , and those mismatches tend to have a huge impact on what the JIT actually can do .
I mean , hardware 's getting really out there now , and the compiler writers are still trying to figure out what to do about it .
I mean , even the stuff they 're doing in the JITs today might not apply tomorrow .
So I realize it's a weak answer , but I 'm saying , you know , it 's a hard proposition for me to imagine them doing .
They 'll try !
Maybe they 'll succeed .
Can they hear these questions in the audio ?
Because this is a really good point .
So this is , I mean , I do n't know the answer to this .
This is a hard question , OK ?
Java has kind of gotten there without even having eval .
They 've tiered themselves into sort of second - order people who know how to manipulate the type - theory stuff , you know , right ?
People go off to them with batch requests : " Please write me a type expression that meets my needs " .
And it comes back .
So we 're already in sort of the same situation we were in with hygienic Scheme macros , you know , or with any sort of macro system , or any eval system .
Which is that really only a few people can be trusted to do it well , and everybody else kind of has to ... right ?
So I do n't know , maybe it 's just a cultural ... maybe it 's already solved , and we just have to live with the fact that some programming languages are going to have dark corners that only a few people know .
It 's unfortunate .
It 's ugly .
[ My PhD languages intern , Roshan James , replies to the questioner : Your usage of the phrase ' second - order ' , where does that come from ?
A comment as to what you 're telling us , which is that some sort of phased evaluation , specific to Scheme at least , we 're saying ... some would say the complexity of writing Scheme macros is roughly on the order of writing a complex higher - order procedure .
It 's not much harder .
A well thought out macro system is not a hard thing to use . ]... says the Ph.D. languages intern !
He 's representing the majority viewpoint , of course .
[ ( laughter ) ]
I 'll tell you what : I 'll let you two guys duke it out after the talk , because I want to make sure we get through anybody else 's questions .
Ummmm ... No. [ ( laughter ) ]
I mean , come on .
Garbage collection ... you guys know that , like , it 's faster in Java to allocate an object than it is in C ++?
They 've got it down to , like , three instructions on some devices , is that right ?
And the way the generational garbage collector works is that 90 % of the objects get reused .
Plus there 's fine - grained interleaving with the way the memory model of the operating system works , to make sure they 're dealing with issues with , whaddaya call it , holes in the heap , where you can't allocate , I mean there 's a whole bunch of stuff going on .
[ This was me doing my best moron impersonation .
Sigh .
- Ed . ]
So , like , it works .
So why throw the extra burden on the programmer ?
Even [ in ]
C++ , by the way , Stroustroup wants to add garbage collection Right .
The philosophical answer to you guys is : compilers will eventually get smart enough to deal with these problems better than a programmer can .
This has happened time and again .
[ For instance ] compilers generate better assembly code [ than programmers do ] .
All the " tricks " that you learned to optimize your Java code , like marking everything final , so that the compiler can inline it – the VM does that for you now !
And it puts [ in ] somehooks to see if you load a class that makes it non-final , and then [ if the assumption is invalidated later ] it undoes the optimization and pulls the inlining out .
That 's how smart the VM is right now .
OK ?
You only need a few compiler writers to go out there and obsolete all the tricks that you learned .
All the memory - pooling tricks ...
Hell , you guys rememberandin Java ?
They introducedrecently , which is an unsynchronized version , so they did n't have to have a lock ?
Guess what ?
Java 6 optimizes those locks away .
Any time you can see that the lock is n't needed , they can see it .
[ Editor 's Note : See " Biased locking " in the linked perf whitepaper .
It 's an astoundingly cool example of the predictive - heuristic class of techniques I 've talked about today .
]
So now all these tricks , all this common wisdom that programmers share with each other , saying " I heard that this hashtable is 1.75 times faster than blah , so therefore you should ... " , all the micro-optimizations they 're doing – are going to become obsolete !
Because compilers are smart enough to deal with that .
I did n't mention APL !?
Oh my .
Well , I 'm sorry .
[ ( laughter ) ]
Yeah , so ... so you could 've said Lisp .
You could 've said Smalltalk .
" We did it before ! "
And that was kind of , that was one of the important points of the talk , right ?
It has been done before .
But I 'm gonna stand by my – especially with APL – I 'm going to stand by my assertion that the language popularity ranking is going to stay pretty consistent .
I do n't see APL moving 50 slots up on the [ list ] .
I 'm sorry , actually .
Well not for that case .
[ ( laughter ) ]
But I 'm sorry that in general , the languages that got optimized really well , and were really elegant , arguably more so than the languages today , you know , in a lot of ways , but they 're not being used .
I tried !
I mean , I tried .
But I could n't get anybody to use them .
I got lynched , time and again .
Oh , God !
You guys want to be here for another 2 hours ?
[ ( laughter ) ]
I read the scariest article that I 've read in the last 2 years : an interview with , I guess his name was Cliff Click , which I think is a cool name .
He 's like the HotSpot - server VM dude , and somebody , Kirk Pepperdine was interviewing him on The Server Side .
I just found this randomly .
And they started getting down into the threading , you know , the Java memory model and how it does n't work well with the actual memory models , the hardware , and he started going through , again and again , problems that every Java programmer – like , nobody knows when the hell to use , and so all of their reads are unsynchronized and they 're getting stale copies ...
And he went through – went through problems to which he does not know the answer .
I mean , to where I came away going Oh My God , threads are irreparably busted .
I do n't know what to do about it .
I really do n't know .
I do know that I did write a half a million lines of Java code for this game , this multi- threaded game I wrote .
And a lot of weird stuff would happen .
You 'd gets in situations where , you know , you thought you had gone through and done a more or less rigorous proof that it should n't have happened , right ?
And so you throw in an " if null " , right ?
And I 've got " if null "s all over .
I 've got error recovery threaded through this half - million line code base .
It 's contributing to the half million lines , I tell ya .
But it 's a very robust system .
You can actually engineer these things , as long as you engineer them with the certain knowledge that you 're using threads wrong , and they 're going to bite you .
And even if you 're using them right , the implementation probably got it wrong somewhere .
It 's really scary , man .
I do n't ... I can't talk about it anymore .
I 'll start crying .
Well , I think the biggest thing about IDEs is ... first of all , dynamic languages will catch up , in terms of sort of having feature parity .
The other thing is that IDEs are increasingly going to tie themselves to the running program .
Right ?
Because they 're already kind of doing it , but it 's kind of half - assed , and it 's because they still have this notion of static vs. dynamic , compile - time vs. run-time , and these are ... really , it 's a continuum .
It really is .
You know , I mean , because you can invoke the compiler at run time .
No .
No , it 's not OK .
At Google you can use C++ , Java , Python , JavaScript ...
I actually found a legal loophole and used server - side JavaScript for a project .
Or some of our proprietary internal languages .
That 's for production stuff .
That 's for stuff that armies of people are going to have to maintain .
It has to be high - availability , etc .
I actually wrote a long blog about this that I 'll point you to that actually ...
Like , I actually came around to their way of seeing it .
I did .
Painful as it was .
But they 're right .
[ me paraphrasing ]
Are we going to have something Lisp Machines did n't ?
Well ... no. [ ( loud laughter ) ]
I say that in all seriousness , actually , even though it sounds funny .
I , you know , I live in Emacs .
And Emacs is the world 's last Lisp Machine .
All the rest of them are at garage sales .
But Emacs is a Lisp Machine .
It may not be the best Lisp , but it is one .
And you know , T.V Raman , you know , research scientist at Google , who , he does n't have the use of his sight ... he 's a completely fully productive programmer , more so than I am , because Emacs is his window to the world .
It 's his remote control .
EmacsSpeak is his thesis .
It 's amazing to watch him work .
Emacs , as a Lisp Machine , is capable of doing anything that these other things can .
The problem is , nobody wants to learn Lisp .
And it does n't have closures , although you can fake them with macros .
I 'm actually having lunch with an [ ex -]
Emacs maintainer tomorrow .
We 're going to talk about how to introduce concurrency , a better rendering engine , and maybe some Emacs Lisp language improvements .
You know , even Emacs has to evolve .
But the general answer to your question is No. Lisp Machines pretty much had it nailed , as far as I 'm concerned .
[ ( shrugging ) ]
Object - oriented programming , maybe ?
Scripting ?
I dunno .
Yes !
" Thank you . "
Yes .
Although it 's very interesting that it took a long time before it actually told you something useful .
I remember my first experience with a C++ compiler was , it would tell me " blublblbuh ! ! " , except it would n't stop there .
It would vomit for screen after screen because it was Cfront , right ?
And the weird thing is , I realized early in my career that I would actually rather have a runtime error than a compile error .
[ ( some laughs ) ]
Because at that time ... now this is way contrary to popular opinion .
Everybody wants early error detection .
Oh God , not a runtime error , right ?
But the debugger gives you this ability to start poking and prodding , especially in a more dynamic language , where you can start simulating things , you can back it up ...
You 've got your time - machine debuggers like the OCaml one , that can actually save the states and back up .
You 've got amazing tools at your disposal .
You 've got your print , your console printer , you 've got your logging , right ?
[ Ummm ... and eval .
Oops .
- Ed . ]
You 've got all these assertions available .
Whereas if the compiler gives you an error that says " expected expression angle - bracket " , you do n't have a " compiler - debugger " that you can shell into , where you 're trying to , like – you could fire up a debugger on the compiler , but I do n't recommend it .
So , you know , in some sense , your runtime errors are actually kind of nicer .
When I started with Perl , which was pretty cryptic , you know , and I totally see where you 're coming from , because every once in a while the compiler catches an error .
But the argument that I 'm making is NOT that compilers do n't occasionally help you catch errors .
The argument that I 'm making is that you 're gonna catch the errors one way or the other .
Especially if you 've got unit tests , or QA or whatever .
And the problem is that the type systems , in programming in the large , wind up getting in your way ... way too often .
Because the larger the system gets , the more desperate the need becomes for these dynamic features , to try to factor out patterns that were n't evident when the code base was smaller .
And the type system just winds up getting in your way again and again .
Yeah , sure , it catches a few trivial errors , but what happens is , when you go from Java to JavaScript or Python , you switch into a different mode of programming , where you look a lot more carefully at your code .
And I would argue that a compiler can actually get you into a mode where you just submit this batch job to your compiler , and it comes back and says " Oh , no , you forgot a semicolon " , and you 're like , " Yeah , yeah , yeah . "
And you 're not even really thinking about it anymore .
Which , unfortunately , means you 're not thinking very carefully about the algorithms either .
I would argue that you actually craft better code as a dynamic language programmer in part because you 're forced to .
But it winds up being a good thing .
But again , I – this is all very minority opinion ; it 's certainly not majority opinion at Google .
All right ?
So this is just my own personal bias .
You know , that 's an interesting question .
Why do compiler errors have to be errors ?
Why could n't you have a compiler that just goes and gives you some advice ?
Actually , this is what IDEs are excelling at today .
Right ?
At warnings .
It 's like , " ah , I see what you 're doing here , and you do n't really need to .
You probably should n't .
" It 's weird , because Eclipse 's compiler is probably a lot better than javac .
Javac does n't need to be good for the reasons I described earlier , right ?
It all gets torn down by the JIT .
But Eclipse 's compiler needs to give you that exact help .
The programmer help , the day - to - day help , I missed a semicolon , I missed this , right ?
And Eclipse and IntelliJ , these editors , their compilers are very very good at error recovery , which in a static batch compiler usually just needs to be : BLAP , got an error !
OK ?
So to an extent I think we are getting tools that come along and act like the little paper - clip in Microsoft Office .
You know .
Maybe not quite like that .
That 's the part you have to do at runtime , right ?
Well , I mean , when you get into concurrency you 're just screwed , but if you 're talking about situations where it 's very difficult to ...
I mean , it 's computationally impossible to figure out whether all paths through a code graph are taken .
I mean , it 's NP - complete , you can't do this , right ?
But the VM can tell you which code paths got taken , and if it does n't [ get taken ] , you can change your unit test to force those code paths to go through , at which point you 've now exercised all of your code .
Right ?
That 's kind of the way , you know , they do it these days .
And I would say it 's a pain in the butt , but I mean ... it 's a pain in the butt because ... a static type - systems researcher will tell you that unit tests are a poor man 's type system .
The compiler ought to be able to predict these errors and tell you the errors , way in advance of you ever running the program .
And for the type systems they 've constructed , this is actually true , by and large , modulo assertion errors and all these weird new runtime errors they actually have to , heh , inject into your system , because of type - system problems .
But by and large , I think what happens is unless the type system actually delivers on its promise , of always being right and always allowing you to model any lambda - calculus computation your little heart desires , OK ?
Unless it can do that , it 's gonna get in your way at some point .
Now again , this is all personal choice , personal preference .
I think , you know , static compilers and error checkers , they have a lot of value and they 're going to be around for a long time .
But dynamic languages could get a lot better about it .
I 'm not trying to refute your point .
I 'm just saying that ... there are tradeoffs , when you go to a dynamic language .
I have come around ...
I 've gone from dynamic to static and back to dynamic again , so I 've done the whole gamut .
And I 've decided that for very large systems , I prefer the dynamic ones , in spite of trade - offs like the one you bring up .
I think some of it has been pretty ... there 's a great paper from Adobe about it , right ?
Evolutionary programming ?
Talks about how you prototype your system up , and then you want to lock it down for production , so you find the spots where there are API boundaries that people are going to be using .
You start putting in contracts , in the way of type signatures and type assertions .
Why not build that functionality into the language ?
Then you do n't have to build a prototype and re-implement it in C ++.
That 's the thinking , anyway .
It seems like a great idea to me , but it has n't caught on too much yet .
We 'll see .
[ Editor 's note :
The main hybrid examples I 'm aware of are StrongTalk , Common Lisp , Groovy and EcmaScript Edition 4 .
Any others ? ]
All right , well , now we 're definitely over time , and I 'm sure some of you guys want to go .
So thank you very much !
At this point I got mobbed by a bunch of grad students , profs , and various interested people with other questions .
They dumped an absolutely astounding amount of information on me , too – papers to chase down , articles to follow up on , people to meet , books to read .
There was lots of enthusiasm .
Glad they liked it !
The immediate goal is for the parallel release to help start a potential new movie franchise .
As television advertising becomes less effective because of declining TV viewership , movie studios need to reach a mass audience somehow , and having what amounts to ads sitting on store shelves is seen as a crucial antidote .
The effort is also a way for Warner to get more DVD bang for not many more bucks .
The “ Watchmen ” film , Mr. Synder said , will probably generate at least three DVDs : “ Tales of the Black Freighter , ” followed about four months later by release of “ Watchmen ” itself , and then an “ ultimate ” edition in which the two are edited together into one megamovie .

“ The überfans of this property are going to go crazy for that , ” Mr. Snyder said .
Warner has another reason to make nice with retailers .
The studio , under added scrutiny from Wall Street now that its corporate parent plans to spin off Time Warner Cable , has annoyed chains by leading a movement in Hollywood to simultaneously release titles on DVD and on video - on - demand services .
Retailers worry that DVD sales will suffer from the lack of exclusivity , but Warner  which enjoys 60 percent profit margins for video on demand , compared to half that for physical DVD sales  says there is no cannibalization .
Warner said this month that it would distribute many new releases simultaneously to DVD and on - demand services .
Warner downplayed any friction from the growth of video on demand .
“ Our retail partners have n’t seen a dramatic impact one way or another on their business , so they ’re allowing us to work on it , ” said Mr. Sanders .
Retailers seem to be taking a wait - and - see approach to Warner ’s olive branch .
Wal - Mart , the nation ’s biggest DVD retailer , with as much as 40 percent of sales , declined to comment .
Target , which has historically accounted for about 15 percent of DVD sales , said , “ We ’re always looking for opportunities to generate excitement in our entertainment business . ”
During his 1969 concert at San Quentin prison , Johnny Cash proposed a paradigm shift in the field of developmental psychology .
He used “ A Boy Named Sue ” to present two hypotheses :
1 . A child with an awful name might grow up to be a relatively normal adult .
2 . The parent who inflicted the name does not deserve to be executed .
I immediately welcomed the Boy Named Sue paradigm , although I realized that I might be biased by my middle name ( Marion ) .
Cash and his ambiguously named male collaborator , the lyricist Shel Silverstein , could offer only anecdotal evidence against decades of research suggesting that children with weird names were destined for places like San Quentin .
Studies showed that children with odd names got worse grades and were less popular than other classmates in elementary school .
In college they were more likely to flunk out or become “ psychoneurotic . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A proposed global ban on cluster bombs could jeopardize U.S. participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations around the world , a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday .
Representatives of over 100 nations are meeting in the Irish capital Dublin to hammer out an agreement against use of cluster munitions , although the United States , China and Russia are not participating .
Critics say such munitions are unreliable and indiscriminate .
But Stephen Mull , acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for political - military affairs , said the weapons have a “ certain military utility . ”
He told reporters the proposed ban being discussed could “ criminalize ” joint military operations between countries that signed the ban and those that did not .
“ For example , if the convention passes in its current form , any U.S. military ship would be technically not able to get involved in a peacekeeping operation like disaster relief , or humanitarian assistance , as we are doing right now in the aftermath of the earthquake in China and the typhoon in Burma , not to mention everything we did in southeast Asia after the tsunami in December of 2004 , ” Mull said .
“ And that ’s because most U.S. military units have in their inventory these kinds of weapons , ” he said .
Cluster munitions open in mid-air and scatter as many as several hundred “ bomblets ” over wide areas .
They often fail to explode , creating virtual mine fields that can kill or injure anyone who comes across them -- often curious children .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon told the delegates in Dublin earlier this week that the use , development , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster bombs should be prohibited .
The talks in Dublin are part of the Oslo process , launched by Norway several years ago to prepare a treaty on an international ban of cluster weapons .
The meeting has been undermined by the absence of the United States , China and Russia , which oppose a global ban .
Mull said the United States thought it would be impossible to ban cluster bombs .
A more effective solution would be a technical fix , dealing with the timing of the fuse mechanism so that the weapons ’ viability is limited , he said .
OTHER SOLUTIONS ?
Washington would pursue such a solution via another international forum , called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ( CCW ) , which gathers all the major producers and consumers of cluster weapons , Mull said .
The next meeting is in Geneva in July .
The United States has not used the weapons since the first year of the Iraq war in 2003 , Mull said .
He said Washington was not currently exporting cluster bombs because a law Congress passed last year said cluster munitions with less than a 99 percent reliability rate could not be sold abroad .
The bombs can be dropped from aircraft or fired in missiles or artillery shells and have been used in conflicts including Iraq , Afghanistan , Vietnam , the Balkans and in Israel ’s 2006 war with Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon .
Mull said the United States might need to use them to help its allies .
He said the bombs would be very effective in terms of stopping an advancing army , such an invasion of South Korea or an invasion of Lebanon by Syria .
A United Nations commission said Israel did not limit assaults to military targets in the 2006 war , but an Israeli army probe said Israel did not break international law .
Mull said U.S. officials had consultations with the Israelis and “ we understand that they are introducing reforms so those sorts of mistakes do n’t happen again . ”

A giant inflatable pig which floated away during a Roger Waters concert at the weekend has been recovered in tatters in California .
The pig , which measured the width of two buses , was found by two families on their driveways in La Quinta .
They will split the $ 10,000 ( £ 5,090 ) reward offered by the Coachella music festival , from where the pig was lost .
The inflatable pig bore the image of a ticked ballot box for US presidential hopeful Barack Obama on its underbelly .
Prototype pig
The animal 's flanks carried the slogans " fear builds walls " and " do n't be led to the slaughter " , with a cartoon of Uncle Sam holding two meat cleavers .
Former Pink Floyd star Waters said " that 's my pig " as it drifted away during Sunday 's gig .
The inflatable appeared at the Coachella festival in California

Coachella spokeswoman Marcee Rondan said : " It was n't really supposed to happen that way . "
The pig was tethered to the ground with ropes and floated away as Waters was playing Pink Floyd song Pigs on the Wing .
Pink Floyd had used inflatable pigs during their concerts in the past , and the lost animal was the same prototype as all the others , according to Ms Rondan .
The two families who found what was left of the inflatable have also decided to share four life tickets to the Coachella festival that were offered as part of the reward .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
You might expect Jim Rogers to be gloating a little bit .
After all , the famed investor has been predicting a recession in the U.S. economy for months and shorting the shares of now - tanking Wall Street investment banks for even longer .
And with fears of a recession sparking both a worldwide market sell - off and emergency action from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , Rogers again looks prescient - just as he has over the past few years as the China - driven commodities boom he predicted almost a decade ago began kicked into high gear .
But when I reached him by phone in Singapore the other day there was little hint of celebration in his voice .
Instead , he took a serious tone .
" I 'm extremely worried , " he says .
" I have been for a while , but I just see things getting much worse this time around than I expected . "
To Rogers , a longtime Fed critic , Bernanke 's decision to ride to the market 's rescue with a 75 - basis - point cut in the Fed 's benchmark rate only a week before its scheduled meeting ( at which time they cut it another 50 basis points ) is the latest sign that the central bank is n't willing to provide the fiscal discipline that he thinks the economy desperately needs .
" Conceivably we could have just had recession , hard times , sliding dollar , inflation , etc. , but I 'm afraid it 's going to be much worse , " he says .
" Bernanke is printing huge amounts of money .
He 's out of control and the Fed is out of control .
We are probably going to have one of the worst recessions we 've had since the Second World War .
It 's not a good scene . "
Rogers looks at the Fed 's willingness to add liquidity to an already inflationary environment and sees the history of the 1970s repeating itself .
Does that mean stagflation ?
" It is a real danger and , in fact , a probability . "
Where the opportunities are
The 1970s , of course , was when Rogers first made his reputation - and a lot of money - as George Soros 's original partner in the Quantum Fund .
And despite his gloomy outlook for the U.S. , he still sees opportunities in today 's world .
In fact , he sees the recent correction as a potential gift for investors who know where to head in global markets : China .
Rogers has been fascinated with China ever since he rode his motorcycle across the country two decades ago , and he 's been a full - fledged China bull for several years .
In December he published his latest book , an investor - friendly tome titled " A Bull in China : How to Invest Profitably in the World 's Greatest Market . "
And that same month he sold his beloved Manhattan townhouse for $ 15.75 million to a daughter of oil tycoon H. L. Hunt and moved his family full - time to Singapore - the better to be closer to the action in Beijing and Shanghai .
( He bought the New York mansion 30 years ago for just over $ 100,000 ; not a bad return on his investment . )
But in a November interview I conducted with Rogers , he admitted that he was rooting for a serious correction in China to cool off an overheating market and bring back prices to a reasonable level .
With the bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong both some 20 % off their recent highs as of late January , Rogers says he 's starting to consider new investments .
" I 'm delighted to see what 's happening in Shanghai and Hong Kong , " he says .
" As I 've said , if things had n't cooled off , the Chinese market was in danger of turning into a bubble .
I find this most encouraging .
The government 's been doing its best to try and cool things off .
Mainly they 've been trying to deal with real estate but it 's having an effect on stocks , too .
I would suspect the correction is n't quite over in China .
But I 'm gearing up .
I did n't put in any orders for tomorrow but I 'm starting to prepare my list of things to buy in China .
Whether I buy this week or this month or this quarter , who knows .
But I 'm starting to think about buying new shares in China for the first time in a while .
And I 'm not thinking about buying in America . "
Ultimately , Rogers does n't think that the troubles in the United States will be much of a drag on the prospects for the People 's Republic .
" Anybody who sells to Sears ( SHLD , Fortune 500 ) or Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) is going to be affected , without question , " he says .
" Some parts of the Chinese economy are going to be untouched , however .
They wo n't even know America 's in recession .
They wo n't care if America falls off the face of the earth . "
“ We are probably going to have one of the worst recessions we 've had since the Second World War .
It 's not a good scene . ”
Jim Rogers
What 's on his China buying list ?
Rogers says it will depend in large part on which stocks come down to the right level , but he 's keeping his eye on certain high - growth sectors including tourism , agriculture , power generation and airlines .
The pullback in commodity prices on recession fears has n't dampened his enthusiasm for resources investments , either .
More like a cyclical correction in the middle of a long - term bull market .
" Certainly some commodities are going to be affected , " says Rogers .
" But it 's not as if the markets have n't figured this out .
Remember the old expression : ' Dr. Copper is the best economist in the world . '
Well , Dr. Nickel and Dr. Zinc figured out a few months ago what I thought I had figured out , that we were going to have a recession .
Nickel is already down 50 % .
Other commodities may fall more .
But I do n't see the economics of agriculture being much affected at all .
Maybe there will be a few less cotton shirts bought .
Maybe there will be a few less tires bought .
But the supply is under more duress than the demand . "
Once again Rogers draws on the 1970s in his analysis .
" Think about the story of gold in the ' 70s , " he says .
" Gold went up 600 % , and then it started correcting .
It went down nearly every month for two years , nearly 50 % from the high point .
And everybody said , ' Well , that 's the end of the gold market .
It was just a fluke .
It 's over . '
It scared everybody out .
And then gold turned around and went up 850 % from that level .
This is what happens in markets .
But the fundamentals of the secular bull market in commodities are not over any more now than they were for gold in the ' 70s . "
Where he expects the pain to be most intense is on Wall Street .
He says he has n't covered his short positions on the investment banks or Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and wo n't for a while .
" Those things are going to go way , way , way down , " says Rogers .
" The investment banks are down now because of the problems in the credit market .
Wait until the effects of the bear market come along .
If you just go back and look at other bear markets , investment bank stocks have gone down enormously .
We have n't gotten to that stage yet .
It 's going to bring their balance sheets under duress .
This is going to get much worse .
But that 's where there have been excesses for the past decade or so .
And whenever you have a bear market come along the great excesses of the previous period are the ones that get cleaned out the most . "

The decision is likely to cause a massive stir in the food and beverage industry , where a discreet battle has been raging over the status of the controversial sweetener .
High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is derived from corn , and used primarily to sweeten beverages .
The trade group Corn Refiners Association and numerous industry members have long maintained that HFCS is a natural sweetener .
However , the sugar industry is more critical , as HFCS comes into direct competition with sugar as a sweetener .
Industry group Sugar Association , as well as consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest , categorically maintain that HFCS cannot be considered natural because its chemical bonds are broken and rearranged in the manufacturing process .
The debate raged on for one simple reason : FDA does not define the term ' natural ' , and it has therefore been left open to different interpretations .
However , in response to an inquiry from FoodNavigator - USA.com , the regulatory agency examined the composition of HFCS , which it said is produced using synthetic fixing agents .
" Consequently , we would object to the use of the term ' natural ' on a product containing HFCS , " ​ the agency 's Geraldine June said in an e-mail to FoodNavigator - USA.com .
June is Supervisor of the Product Evaluation and Labeling team at FDA 's Office of Nutrition , Labeling and Dietary Supplements .
FDA on ' natural '​ FDA has received two petitions to define the term ' natural ' - one from the Sugar Association , and one from bakery firm Sara Lee .
Although the agency had not provided a formal response to these petitions , it told this publication that it has no plans to define the term in the near future , due to limited resources .
" We 're not sure how high of an issue it is for consumers , " ​ it said .
Nevertheless , FDA does have a longstanding policy regarding the use of the term .
This states that a ' natural ' product is one that has not had any artificial or synthetic substances added to the product that would not normally be expected to be in the food - including artificial flavors or color additives , regardless of source .
FDA also does not currently restrict the use of the term ' natural ' except on products that contain added color , synthetic substances and flavors as provided for in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) , section 101.22 .
FDA on HFCS ​
Although FDA provides no definition or detailed guidelines for the use of the term ' natural ' , it said it has a system in place for manufacturers with doubts to approach it and ask for guidance on the use of particular ingredients .
Under this system , FoodNavigator - USA.com submitted an inquiry about HFCS .
FDA responded that HFCS is prepared from a high dextrose equivalent corn starch hydrolysate by partial enzymatic conversion of glucose ( dextrose ) to fructose using an insoluble glucose isomerase enzyme preparation .
The glucose isomerase enzyme preparation is fixed ( rendered insoluble ) using safe and suitable immobilization / fixing agents , it said .
" The use of synthetic fixing agents in the enzyme preparation , which is then used to produce HFCS , would not be consistent with our ( … ) policy regarding the use of the term ' natural ' , " ​ said Geraldine June .
" Moreover , the corn starch hydrolysate , which is the substrate used in the production of HFCS , may be obtained through the use of safe and suitable acids or enzymes .
Depending on the type of acid(s ) used to obtain the corn starch hydrolysate , this substrate itself may not fit within the description of ' natural ' and , therefore , HCFS produced from such corn starch hydrolysate would not qualify for a ' natural ' labeling term , " ​ she concluded .
HFCS and industry ​
Although FDA 's conclusion may not be welcome by some industry members , who would have liked to have promoted their HFCS - containing products as ' natural ' , it will at least prevent any future misinterpretations .
Last year for example , both Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft faced lawsuits after making ' natural ' label claims on beverages that contained high fructose corn syrup .
Both companies changed the labeling of their products before any legal action was taken .
The market for ' natural '
​The quest for natural foods and beverages has burgeoned on the back of an overall consumer move towards healthier nutrition .
According to Mintel 's Global New Products Database , ' All Natural ' was the third most frequent claim made on food products launched in the US in 2007 , appearing on 2,617 products .
It ranked fourth most popular claim for beverages , used on 542 items .
In Europe , 878 ' All Natural ' food products and 509 beverage products were launched last year .
Additionally , the Natural Marketing Institute reported in 2004 that 63 percent of US consumers have a preference for natural foods and beverages .
In 2006 , a Harris Interactive survey found that 83 percent of people wanted a government definition of the term .

It was possible to use tables in the past , but only as an embedded Calc object .
Beginning with 3.0 , tables are embedded natively into your presentation and can be edited directly with Impress .
APRIL 16 -- In the hip - hop world , a performer 's street cred can often be gauged by the number of entries on their rap sheet , the time they have spent behind bars , or the gritty details of their illicit escapades .
By any of those metrics , the chart - topping R&B singer Akon appears to have compiled an exemplary outlaw resume , one brimming with scrapes from a hard knock life .
As recounted in scores of interviews since his first album , the platinum - selling " Trouble , " debuted in 2004 , Akon was incarcerated for a total of four - and - a - half years , including a long stretch for his role as the " ringleader of a notorious car theft operation . "
Akon 's gang specialized in boosting Porsches , Lamborghinis , and Mercedeses , he owned four chop shops catering to " celebrities and drug dealers , " and he frequently escaped from cops in high - speed pursuits .
His criminal empire collapsed , though , after underlings -- who " felt like they deserved more than they were getting " -- cut deals and ratted him out to law enforcement .
As a result of that betrayal , Akon spent the next three years in a Georgia prison .
While inside , the 150 - pound inmate " fought almost every day for two years , " in the process becoming a " champion " who prevailed over both big and small inmates because , " I knew where to hit you to knock you out , so I did n't fear you . "
When not brutally schooling fellow convicts , Akon was writing songs , including " Locked Up , " his autobiographical account of prison desolation , from dwindling commissary accounts to friends and family that no longer visited or accepted collect calls .
The song , he recalled , " was like an anthem in there " and corrections officers would often ask him to sing its chorus ( " I 'm locked up / They wo n't let me out " ) .
After his release in 2002 , Akon recorded " Locked Up , " adding to the song what would become his audio trademark : the clanging sound of a cell door closing .
The single later became a hit , but did little to erase the memories of his time on lockdown , which " felt like 300 years , not three . "
Compared to most of hip - hop 's leading figures past and present -- 50 Cent , Snoop Dogg , Eminem , Diddy , Tupac Shakur , Jay - Z , Notorious B.I.G.-- Akon , 35 , seems to have logged more time behind bars and , consequently , gained a better understanding of the average convict 's plight ( both in and out of custody ) than any of his musical peers .
The New York Times has referred to him as the " prison - obsessed R&B singer " who " wants it known that crooners can evoke prison life just as effectively as rappers . "
In fact , the singer not only named his company Konvict Music , but he settled on " Konvicted " for the title of his second album , which sold nearly three million copies last year .
As it turns out , however , " Kontrived " might have been a more accurate choice .
Akon 's ad nauseum claims about his criminal career and resulting prison time have been , to an overwhelming extent , exaggerated , embellished , or wholly fabricated , an investigation by The Smoking Gun has revealed .
Police , court , and corrections records reveal that the entertainer has created a fictionalized backstory that serves as the narrative anchor for his recorded tales of isolation , violence , woe , and regret .
Akon has overdubbed his biography with the kind of grit and menace that he apparently believes music consumers desire from their hip - hop stars .
While the performer 's rap sheet does include a half - dozen arrests , Akon has only been convicted of one felony , for gun possession .
That 1998 New Jersey case ended with a guilty plea , for which the singer was sentenced to three years probation .
Another 1998 bust , this one in suburban Atlanta , has been seized upon by Akon and transformed into the big case that purportedly sent him to prison ( thanks to his snitching cohorts ) for three fight - filled years .
In reality , Akon was arrested for possession of a single stolen BMW and held in the DeKalb County jail for several months before prosecutors dropped all charges against him .
So there was no conviction .
There was no prison term between 1999 and 2002 .
And he was never " facing 75 years , " as the singer claimed in one videotaped interview .
Akon 's invented tales appear to be part of a cynical marketing plan , but one that has met with remarkable success .
Few press interviews conclude without Akon being asked about his criminal exploits and his prison days .
He obliges with canned and well - rehearsed claims , false as they may be , and compares his supposed nationwide operation to those depicted in the movies " Gone in 60 Seconds " and " New Jersey Drive . "
And in interview after interview over the years , he always makes sure to point out the " notorious " nature of his theft ring ( as if the adjective 's inclusion makes him sound even more felonious ) .
Akon repeats the phrase " notorious car theft operation " so frequently it seems like he is reading it from a sheet of talking points .
[ A compilation of video clips in which Akon touts his purported criminal past may be viewed above . ]
Akon 's manager , Robert Carnes , declined to discuss any aspect of the criminal history of the R&B singer , who is currently touring in Africa .
Carnes directed a reporter to Sharonda Smalls , Akon 's publicist at Universal Motown Records .
After being apprised of the nature of TSG 's story , Smalls said she would seek replies to our questions , but had not called back at press time .
Darrick " Devyne " Stephens , Akon 's longtime collaborator and business partner , did not return several messages left at his Atlanta office .
Akon 's deceptions have gone unchallenged and unexamined by the music press , which has been happy to promote him as one of the beleaguered recording industry 's few bright lights .
He was named " Top Artist of 2007 " by Billboard and dubbed " The Last Hit - Maker " in an April 2007 Vibe cover story .
His two albums combined have sold about 10 million copies worldwide , while ring tone sales have exceeded 6.5 million downloads .
He has also collaborated on songs with a wide array of musical superstars , including Gwen Stefani , Eminem , Michael Jackson , and Whitney Houston .
With the single exception of a Washington Post reporter who wrote last March that some of the " bullet points in Akon 's biography " sounded " like the stuff of creation myth , " entertainment journalists have played right into the manipulation .
In a February 2007 story in Creative Loafing , Atlanta 's weekly newspaper , readers were assured that " Akon does n't need to embellish , since he 's already lived an unusual and turbulent life . "
And an August 2007 Interview magazine story was headlined , " Akon : In a hip - hop world where everyone 's always straining for street cred , here 's one guy who has it . "
For his part , the performer appears so confident that nobody will challenge his fables that he has recently embellished them even further .
In an interview for a February 2008 episode of VH1's " Rags to Riches , " the R&B performer claimed that he actually was a carjacker who " used to literally snatch cars from people .
And they would be traumatized for months . "
He claimed to be ashamed of this behavior ( which he never previously mentioned ) and remarked that he could not believe he once " had the heart to do that stuff . "
A VH1 graphic duly noted that this wanton activity " landed him three years in prison for carjacking . "
This m.o. , of course , might seem familiar to readers of these pages .
An artist inflates his criminal history to create an image of himself as a public menace who tangles with law enforcement and pays for his transgressions with a stiff prison sentence .
He cleaves to these bogus biographical details in public appearances and media interviews and carefully weaves them into the art he peddles to the public .
Because without the embellishments and fabrications , without the havoc and heartache , what separates him from every other wannabe clawing for commercial success ?
Why chance having your work judged solely on its merits when a little artistic license can make you so much more distinctive and marketable ?
Akon , as it turns out , is James Frey with catchy hooks and an American Music Award .

TSG began examining Akon 's criminal record after he was arraigned last December on criminal charges stemming from an incident during a June 2007 concert at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill , N.Y..
During that show , Akon , whose given name is Aliaune Thiam , lifted a 15 - year - old boy over his head and tossed the child into the crowd .
As seen on a popular YouTube video , Akon dispatched a security guard to bring the young fan , Anthony Smith , on stage after a pretzel had been thrown at him from the audience ( fellow concertgoers apparently fingered the teenager as the culprit ) .
" He made a big mistake today , boy , " Akon announced before flinging Smith several rows into the crowd .
With the incident on tape , the singer was charged with harassment and endangering the welfare of a child .
Following a December 3 court appearance , Akon was released without bail after a computer check turned up no outstanding warrants or , for that matter , any prior criminal history .
This seemed peculiar considering the singer 's frequent mentions of his prison time and assorted arrests .
A second check was performed , with investigators submitting Akon 's fingerprints to the FBI for a more thorough search for warrants and priors .
This time , bureau records turned up six arrests for Akon , who previously used several aliases and birthdates when being processed by law enforcement agencies in New Jersey and Georgia .
In light of the discovery of the previous arrest history , prosecutors asked a town judge to set Akon 's bail at a nominal $ 5000 , a request the jurist denied .
Though he has claimed to have been frequently arrested while growing up in a middle class household in New Jersey , Akon 's rap sheet ( and court records ) reflect no such cases .
He told Vibe last year that he sold marijuana and test questions from his high school locker and that a friend named Tito got him his first gun , a .22 .
Which , Akon claimed , he rented out for $ 100 a day .
As he explained to VH1 in 2005 , he was a big deal back then : " I got accepted by the gangster crowd because they saw that I was n't afraid of nobody and I would fight anybody ... Before I knew it , I became the most popular kid in Jersey City as a good bad guy . "
Though he lived in the suburbs , Akon told Vibe he " hung out in the ghetto .
The suburbs were just boring .
We could n't make any noise . "
Born in Missouri , Akon reportedly spent some of his youth is Senegal , where his father , Mor Thiam , was a well - known percussionist .
Akon apparently moved with his family to Georgia in the mid-90s , though he would often return to New Jersey , where he hung out with members and associates of the Fugees .
At the time , the singer was signed to Elektra Records and was , according to copyright records , writing songs with Fugee Wyclef Jean and Stephens , a choreographer and " image consultant " who would later play a central role in Akon 's platinum success .
It was after his deal with Elektra cratered that Akon ran into his first serious criminal trouble .
In September 1998 , he was named in a felony indictment charging him and codefendant Terrence Taylor with handgun possession and receiving stolen property ( specifically , a 1998 BMW ) .
Burlington County Superior Court records indicate that Akon -- who was originally charged under the name Abou Thiam - - was released from the county lockup in Mount Holly after posting $ 3500 bond .
While free on the New Jersey case , he was arrested in mid-November 1998 in Stone Mountain , Georgia .
According to a police report , a DeKalb County auto crime investigator happened to be on a stakeout when Akon had the misfortune to drive past him .
It probably did n't help that , as the police report notes , Detective R.L. Brewer " observed a white BMW vehicle being driven by a B / M subject . "
During a prior court case , Akon listed a home address in Stone Mountain that was slightly more than a mile away from where Brewer spotted him .
In a TSG interview , Brewer recalled that he was positioned outside a shopping center and that his stakeout had nothing to do with Akon ; the singer was just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
The performer happened to be driving a car whose license plates triggered a " stolen vehicle response " when the auto 's tags were typed into a police computer .
Brewer followed Akon until two uniformed backup officers arrived and pulled over the BMW 740 near Highway 78 , according to a police report .
He was taken into custody " without incident . "
A passenger , Willie Ashley , was detained on unrelated traffic charges .
[ Years later , as he recounted his purported " ringleader " arrest in an interview for a DVD , Akon said that he was " going up 78 headed toward DeKalb " when he was surrounded by police cars .
With their weapons drawn , officers began simultaneously barking at him to get out of his car .
One cop , the singer recalled , remarked that , " You was caught in a car once before and they said it was a hot pursuit or something .
But your name popped up in the computer . "
So , the singer added , " He locked me up . "
The arrest left the imaginary kingpin perplexed and wondering if he had been framed by someone who " planted something , " since he knew how " clean " his work was . ]
[ In a November 2006 Rolling Stone interview , Akon took a similar fact - free flight of fancy , claiming that he was " driving a BMW 325 , on my way to the chop shop " when he was apprehended .
" That 's the slowest car in the whole fleet ... I 'd been in high - speed pursuits before and always got away , but this time I did n't because the car was too slow .
I did n't even want that car , it was a favor to someone else .
And I wound up getting locked up for three years . " ]
While searching the BMW , Brewer discovered title and registration documents purporting to show that Akon was the rightful owner of the $ 70,000 vehicle .
But the detective believed the paperwork was fraudulent and called in FBI Agent Peter McFarlane for a consultation .
McFarlane , who has worked auto crime cases in Atlanta since 1972 , examined the documents and concluded that the title papers were bogus .
Brewer obtained warrants charging Akon with possession of stolen property , forgery , and possession of an auto with an altered vehicle identification number .
The singer was booked into the DeKalb County Jail , where bond was set at $ 20,000 ( an amount Akon could not raise ) .
Nearly a decade after the arrest , McFarlane , who retired from the FBI in late - 2002 after 31 years , could still recall some details of the case , due to one memorable fact regarding the BMW 's theft in August 1998 .
Three months before Akon was arrested driving the car , the vehicle had been stolen from in front of the Columbus , Georgia office of Robert Schiffman , a wealthy financier .
Schiffman also was a collector of valuable guitars , one of which happened to be in the trunk of the sedan when it was taken .
The car thieves , though , were unaware that the instrument , a 1931 Herman Hauser that once belonged to the classical guitar virtuoso Andres Segovia , was worth more than the BMW itself .
The guitar , then valued at $ 100,000 , was one of only two instruments that Hauser built for Segovia ( the other guitar , made in 1937 , is part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art 's collection ) .
Along with everything else in the car that could trace back to the BMW 's owner , the guitar was discarded by the thieves .
The instrument , still in its $ 1200 case , was eventually discovered in a roadside bush by a BellSouth lineman .
Five years later , the Hauser guitar finally found its way back to Schiffman , who is now seeking to sell the guitar for upwards of $ 250,000 .
McFarlane , 62 , who has worked auto crime cases for Georgia 's Department of Revenue since his FBI retirement , laughed out loud when told of Akon 's claims about running a " notorious " auto theft ring , owning chop shops , and being brought down by turncoat underlings .
" Ah , this is bullshit .
This guy is so phony .
He 's an arrogant SOB , " said McFarlane .
Asked about Akon , Brewer said , " I do n't think he had any role besides [ wanting ] to drive a high - dollar vehicle .
And I say this because we did n't link him to any other cars . "
Nobody was arrested for the actual theft of the BMW , and it is unclear how Akon obtained the auto .
Though both McFarlane and Brewer recalled how a member of Jagged Edge , an Atlanta - based R&B group , opted to purchase stolen cars at a deep discount .
Either way , the felony case against Akon was dropped in its entirety in late - April 1999 .
He spent five months in jail before prosecutors decided not to make a grand jury presentment .
The singer was immediately sprung from the DeKalb jail , departing at 1:27 on a Wednesday morning , according to county records .
Somehow , in the intervening years , those few months in custody morphed into three years in prison , the majority of Akon 's purported total of four - and - a - half years behind bars .
In June 1999 , Akon pleaded guilty in New Jersey to a weapons possession count .
In return , Burlington County prosecutors agreed to drop a second felony charge stemming from the singer 's possession of an allegedly hot car .
He was later fined $ 1000 and sentenced to three months probation , the supervision of which was immediately transferred to Georgia , where Akon resided .
In opting for a probationary -- and not custodial -- sentence , Judge Donald P. Gaydos noted that Akon had " no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law - abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense . "
Gaydos also concluded that Akon would likely " respond affirmatively to probationary treatment . "
This was an accurate prediction on the judge 's part , as Georgia officials requested , in late - 2001 , that the performer 's supervision be terminated early since he had been a model probationer .
That request was granted by a New Jersey judge on September 20 , 2001 .
Of course , this was during the exact period of time ( 1999 - 2002 ) that Akon claims he was imprisoned in Georgia for his supposed " Gone in 60 Seconds " handiwork .
It was during that fabricated prison stretch , of course , that he supposedly wrote much of " Trouble , " his first album .
In that CD 's liner notes , the acknowledgements end with this purposely vague salute : " Last but not least , thanks to the jailhouse in which I was confined -- which made me a better , stronger and wiser man . "
The album 's autobiographical centerpiece , " Locked Up , " is Akon 's lament about being warehoused and forgotten in prison , where " They wo n't let me out / They wo n't let me out . "
He never actually served those three years , so these observations lose a bit of their authoritativeness .
Additionally , a check of United States Copyright Office records reveals that when Akon 's publishing company registered the song they listed its " Date of Creation " as 2003 .
So " Locked Up " was not even created during the three - year period in which Akon was not even in prison .
And as if there needs to be further evidence to rebut the singer 's claims about being imprisoned from 1999 - 2002 , Akon 's own son Tyler could serve as Exhibit A .
According to a paternity action filed late last year in Fulton County , Georgia , the boy was born on July 26 , 2001 , which roughly puts his date of conception in late - October 2000 ( again squarely in the middle of a prison term that Akon never served ) .
As part of the amicable paternity action , the singer was ordered to pay the boy 's mother , a former Alpha Delta Pi sorority girl at Eastern Kentucky University , $ 2795 in monthly child support .
Curiously , Superior Court filings in the paternity case -- in which both sides appear to have been represented by the same attorney -- list Akon 's monthly gross income as a relatively paltry $ 15,900 , or $ 190,800 annually ( child support payments are based , in part , on this figure ) .
In reality , Akon likely makes 20 or 30 times that amount monthly via record sales and touring income .
His Atlanta - area real estate portfolio alone is worth about $ 5 million .
In January , he paid $ 1.65 million for an 8697 - square - foot McMansion on 4.96 acres adjacent to the Atlanta National Golf Club .
In February 2007 , Akon and " Devyne " Stephens paid $ 2.65 million for a 13.29 acre Fulton County estate .
Photos of the two sprawling properties can be seen below .
Though it had been less than a year since the property was purchased ( and despite the housing market being in distress , especially in the Atlanta area ) , Akon assured VH1 during a recent tour of the estate that his home was " already appraised for $ 25 million . "
Fittingly , the R&B star has dubbed his home " Dream Land . "
He also told VH1 of his desire to house lions and tigers on the grounds and how he " flew in an African crocodile " that will live in a glass - enclosed chamber that can be peered into through a transparent panel on the home 's ground floor .
Oh , and near the indoor waterfall he is going to install a retractable stripper pole .
Which will come as no surprise to anyone who has listened to his albums .
While his lilting , nasal voice and hooks are distinctive and contagious , Akon 's lyrics are pedestrian and filled with standard - issue hip - hop boasts and references to strippers , bitches , girls " dropping it to the floor , " and sex acts performed atop furniture .
Women are said to be " looking bootylicious and jingling , " and a worked - up Akon notes that he might even ask a gal if he could " bust all over your anatomy . "
In " Smack That , " Akon 's Top Ten collaboration with Eminem , the R&B star sings of a possible romantic encounter :
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend ya over / Look back and watch me smack that
All on the floor / Smack that
Give me some more / Smack that
Til you get sore / Smack that
Leonard Cohen he is not .
* * *
Akon is not the first performer to fudge some biographical details .
But few artists have gone so far out of their way to aggressively promote these fabrications and embellishments ( or you could just call them lies ) .
In hip - hop circles , being considered " real " is a requirement for success .
Akon , on the other hand , could n't be more fake .
He 's the music industry 's phantom menace , a guy who , four years ago , cast himself as a crime kingpin and has happily played that fictitious role ever since .
Really , why tinker with success ?
In fact , if the title is any indication , the singer 's hotly anticipated third album , " Acquitted , " promises more of the same when it is released later this year .
According to an MTV report , Akon has even already recorded his fourth album , which he 's calling " Double Jeopardy . "
What 's next ?
" No True Bill ? " " Pretrial Detention ? "
During a Vibe interview last year , Akon eagerly repeated his phony stories of criminal entanglements , but balked when reporter Laura Checkoway asked about his age , which he has long sought to cloak .
By all indications , he was born April 16 , 1973 , so birthday wishes are in order ( though his first Copyright Office registration carried a 1972 year of birth ) .
The singer explained to Checkoway that , " The only thing I hide is my age , " adding , " Before I lie to you , I 'd rather say nothing . "
It was a rare moment of self - restraint from the serial fabulist , who offered one other bit of self - examination : " I always had a way of getting over on people , whether manipulating or conning them . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Karl Rove , who had been one of President George W. Bush ’s top aides , was subpoenaed on Thursday for a second time to testify in a congressional probe of the administration ’s firing of federal prosecutors .
Karl Rove is pictured at the end of a roundtable meeting on financial literacy chaired by U.S. President George W. Bush ( not pictured ) in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington April 25 , 2007 .
Rove , who had been one of President George W. Bush 's top aides , was subpoenaed on Thursday to testify before a congressional panel investigating the administration 's firing of nine federal prosecutors .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
The former deputy White House chief of staff quickly indicated through his attorney he would again refuse , citing executive privilege that protects conversations between a president and his staff .
House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers issued the subpoena for Rove to testify on July 10 after months of failed efforts to get him to voluntarily answer questions under oath about the 2006 firing of nine of 93 U.S. attorneys .
Critics charge the dismissals were politically motivated .
Rove and the White House have denied any wrongdoing .
In December , the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to hold Rove and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten in contempt for failing to comply with its subpoenas in the same probe .
“ While the ( House ) committee has the authority to issue a subpoena , it is hard to see what this will accomplish , apart from a ... replay of the same issues that are already the subject of litigation , ” Rove ’s attorney , Robert Luskin , wrote Conyers , a Michigan Democrat .
A court fight over the subpoenas may not be settled until after Bush ’s term ends in January .
Democrats have charged the firings may have been in retaliation for prosecutors being too soft on Democratic lawmakers or too tough on Republican ones .
The controversy ignited a firestorm that led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Rove stepped down as deputy White House chief of staff last year .
He had also served as Bush ’s political strategist and is now a political commentator .
Conyers said : “ It is unfortunate that Mr. Rove has failed to cooperate with our requests .
Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate . ”
‘ POLITICAL THEATER ’
White House spokesman Tony Fratto noted the House committee had rejected Rove ’s offers to answer questions privately or in writing .
“ They want their political theater , ” Fratto said .
The House and Senate Judiciary committees have been investigating the ouster of the prosecutors for more than a year .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting its own probe into what Conyers describes as political prosecutions of Democratic lawmakers , including former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
A federal court this year released Siegelman from prison , pending appeal .
He had begun serving a more than seven - year sentence in 2007 after being convicted of corruption .
Critics charge Siegelman and other Democrats were victims of a smear campaign by Rove .
He has denied it .

The government says a referendum is not needed on the treaty
The House of Commons turned down the Conservative proposal by 311 votes to 248 - a margin of 63 .
The result means Parliament itself will decide whether to ratify the treaty , signed by EU leaders last December .
Thirteen Lib Dem
MPs rebelled against the party 's orders to abstain on the referendum vote , with three frontbench spokesmen resigning their posts .
MPs rejected the Conservative amendment to the EU ( Amendment ) Bill , but 29 Labour MPs supported it .
Three Tories defied their party leadership .
Manifestos
All EU parliaments must ratify the treaty before it can come into force .
The only country which has committed to a referendum is Ireland .
We hope that in this case the Lords will hold the government to their manifesto commitment
William Hague , Conservatives
Clegg revamp after rebellion
The three main UK political parties promised a public vote on the EU Constitution in their 2005 general election manifestos .
But the constitution was rejected by the French and Dutch electorates later that year .
The Lisbon Treaty was drawn up to replace it .
The government and the Lib Dems say the treaty does not have constitutional implications , so a referendum on it is not needed .
The government says most changes are minor and procedural and it has secured " opt-outs " where necessary .
Month - long debate
But the Conservatives , some Labour and Lib Dem MPs and the UK Independence Party among others , say that it is effectively the constitution under a different name - so there should be a referendum .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " This treaty will now go to the House of Lords .
" It is convention that the House of Lords does not stand in the way of manifesto commitments .
We hope that in this case the Lords will hold the government to their manifesto commitment .
" The Liberal Democrats ' position will once again be pivotal .
We will see if they follow their three - line whip in the Commons to abstain . "
The Lib Dem leadership , which instead wants a referendum on whether the UK should stay within the EU , ordered its MPs to abstain in the Tory - led debate .
But 13 refused to do so , instead voting for a referendum on the treaty .
Scottish affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael , countryside spokesman Tim Farron and justice spokesman David Heath resigned from the Lib Dem frontbench team .
MPs have been debating the different elements of the treaty over the past month .

FACES OF CONSTRUCTIVISM :
Trivial constructivism
Radical constructivism
Social constructivism
Cultural constructivism
Critical constructivism
Constructionism
Introduction
During the past three months , I ’ve been learning about constructivism by reading scholarly texts , discussing them with my class and my friends , journal keeping and personal reflection .
Through this interesting time , I feel my understanding has grown considerably and have already proved useful .
I ’ve constructed this text in an attempt to demonstrate my current understandings of constructivism , as well as the process by which my knowledge developed .
I had some trouble with the self - referential nature of the material .
Since the subject is the “ meaning of meaning ” at various levels , it ’s easy to become confused and fall into a “ black hole ” where text seems meaningless .
How can I know from reading texts what authors think , and what works ?
How can I realise my own understanding ?
How can I communicate my understandings to you ?
Despite this , I feel the struggle to construct this text to try and represent my learning as a result of interacting with a wide diversity of other texts has been a rewarding one .
It has helped me develop constructivism in my mind as a referent to apply to my own day - to - day practices and research in communication , teaching and learning .
I hope that reading this will also help you , the reader , reflect critically on your own life , and perhaps increase your own satisfaction with your educational activities .
A word about the writing styles I ’ve chosen to use in this essay .
For the most part , I ’ve written in the first - person , since this essay is an expression of my thoughts ( Ellis , 1996 ) .
However , I often use a third - person style , which is not intended to impart a sense of objectivity , but to make it easier to read passages describing the ideas of others .
Background
I signed up for a Masters course to broaden myself in my desire to develop the use of technologies for learning , gained from many years of constant learning with technology and later , teaching it to others .
My youth was spent as an isolated child in small desert towns in central Australia .
Much of my school education was undertaken in distance mode via School of the Air , using shortwave radio .
I had half an hour of contact with a teacher per day , with several hours self - directed study using worksheets and projects .
Moving to the city in my teens , I attended a normal high school , followed by seven years of University education .
At University , I studied Engineering , Physics and finally Computer Science , and then gained some intensive experience programming visualisation systems for the mining industry .
In the five years since then , I have worked within Curtin University of Technology on Internet technologies : analysing systems , solving problems , educating other users in the technology , helping people to solve their own problems .
For the first two years I worked on the help - desk – a demanding job involving an average of ten or twenty wide - ranging consultations a day .
Later , I focussed more on the Internet , including the design and operations of Curtin ’s main web sites .
During much of this time , the same issues kept arising in the way people came to deal with the technology .
I tried to distill these issues into an Internet Overview seminar , which I used and developed over a four - year period with a wide variety of adult learners .
By monitoring reactions to my experiments in teaching , I kept the parts that seemed to work , and changed the areas that did n’t , letting the course evolve each time .
I felt that I knew enough about the technologies , and had an intuitive sense of communicating my enthusiasm and knowledge to others , yet wondered how I could improve the quality of my teaching at a more rapid pace than simply relying on direct feedback .
I was also becoming very interested in developing better interfaces to computers to solve many of the problems before they arose , but sensed that I needed a more theoretical foundation than the occasional forays I had already made into cognitive psychology , design , complexity theory and computer science .
After some exploration of options around my University , I decided modern science education theory might offer what I was needing .
After explaining some of this to Dr Peter Taylor , he suggested enrolling in his course on Constructivism , as part of a Masters in Science Education .
At the time , I had only a very vague notion of what it was – I actually thought it was something like behaviourism !
– but Peter assured me I ’d find it interesting .
He was right !
First Impression
I threw my suitcase on the bed and looked around my Bangkok hotel room .
The single room was worn and clean , with a good view of endless dusty buildings .
After a few minutes listening to the ancient ceiling fan and honking traffic , I changed my shirt and headed outside to explore .
The first thing I did after enrolling was to go and hunt down a few web pages about constructivism .
After reading them , I tried to describe in my own words what constructivism was :
Constructivism is building on knowledge known by the student .
Education is student - centred , students have to construct knowledge themselves .
Explanations can use metacognition to explain via metaphor .
Semiotics , or meanings of words , are important to keep in mind .
Constructivism is a theory , a tool , a lens for examining educational practices .
( from my journal , July 1998 )
Looking back at this now it seems very thin indeed , but it was from this point that I launched into studying constructivism .
Faces of constructivism
I wandered almost randomly along the cracked pavements , keeping one eye on the hotel and the other on the throngs of people all around me .
In this section I ’ll describe the major “ faces of constructivism ” separately , because it is more helpful for me to write about them in that way , and hopefully for you to read about them , although perhaps both will be in a non-linear fashion .
Each of these types of constructivism should not be seen as a set of methods , or as a fixed manifesto - like set of beliefs .
They are “ points of view ” , perspectives loosely defined by a collection of writings of particular individuals in each case .
My research is not comprehensive , and nor could it be , but these sections represent popular labels in constructivist literature used as shorthand to indicate these different groups of ideas .
Indeed , you can also say that “ constructivist literature ” is defined by their use of these labels , since the ideas are related to many other philosophical labels .
The points of contact between these concepts are many , as are the connections they can make within your own life .
As I work through these sections , I am endeavouring to point out major relationships as I ’ve seen them in developing my own understanding of constructivism as a referent – a perspective I can apply to a wide variety of situations to help me make choices about my actions and to help reflect on what I ’ve done .
Most importantly , behind all of this are values that are rarely discussed openly in constructivism literature .
Why do we even want to create models of learning ?
Why do we feel we need to improve the quality of education ?
In constructivism I see a hidden value ascribed to the notions of diversity and adaptability , which in turn promote the root value : survival of our species .
Learners who can adapt quickly by learning in a complex world are more likely to adapt to changing conditions and survive as an individual .
As an insurance against our future , more capable individuals are also more likely to discover answers to the questions we have n’t even thought of asking yet .
A diverse population is also more likely to ensure survival in the event of unpredicted disasters , since different people may be affected differently .
Trivial constructivism
So much life !
So many people scurrying about their daily business !
I ’ve never seen so many sick , scabby dogs .
Is that motorbike - thing a taxi ?
Is that old lady actually cooking in that tiny cart ?
The simplest idea in constructivism , and the root of all the other shades of constructivism described later in this text , is what von Glasersfeld ( eg 1990 ) calls trivial constructivism , also known as personal constructivism .
The principle has been credited to Jean Piaget , a pioneer of constructivist thought , and can be summed up by the following statement :
Knowledge is actively constructed by the learner , not passively received from the environment .
This reacts against other epistemologies promoting simplistic models of communication as simple transmission of meanings from one person to another .
The prior knowledge of the learner is essential to be able to “ actively ” construct new knowledge .
To me , this seemed obvious , and it seemed to be compatible with most opinions I ’d ever read about teaching or science .
Learning is work – effective learning requires concentration .
There are some things you have to learn before others .
The education system has always been built on a progression of ideas from simple to complex .
So , so far , nothing really new .
Hence , probably , von Glasersfeld ’s characterisation as “ trivial ” .
Questions arise , however .
What is “ the environment ” ?
What is “ knowledge ” ?
What is the relation of knowledge to “ the environment ” ?
What environments are better for learning ?
Trivial constructivism alone says nothing about these issues , and these are the shortcomings that the other faces of constructivism attempt to address .
Radical constructivism
I approached the old lady , smiled and looked at the foods keeping warm on her tiny gas burner .
The chicken pieces looked tasty but no , probably not safe .
I decided on a couple of what looked like tiny deep - fried meatballs .
Somehow , with a combination of very bad Thai and waving hands I managed to pay for them .
She laughed and said something to another woman huddled on the ground beside her , as I retreated to the safe anonymity of the crowded footpath .
To my surprise the balls were very sweet and multilayered , not at all what I was expecting .
Was that coconut ?
Radical constructivism adds a second principle to trivial constructivism ( von Glasersfeld , 1990 ) , which can be expressed as :
Coming to know is a process of dynamic adaptation towards viable interpretations of experience .
The knower does not necessarily construct knowledge of a “ real ” world .
What is there to stop an individual from developing any “ reality ” they like ?
Taken to extremes , would n’t we all be living in our own dream worlds , unable to communicate with other people or do anything for ourselves ?
Well , to some extent , we do all create our own realities .
Radical constructivism does not deny an objective reality , but simply states that we have no way of knowing what that reality might be .
Mental constructs , constructed from past experience , help to impose order on one ’s flow of continuing experience .
However , when they fail to work , because of external or internal constraints , thus causing a problem , the constructs change to try and accommodate the new experience .
Within the constraints that limit our construction there is room for an infinity of alternatives .
“ Truth ” in traditional epistemologies is replaced by “ viability ” , bounded by social and physical constraints .
The large diversity of flourishing public opinions in today ’s society on nearly every conceivable topic is evidence that a range of viable constructs are possible to allow survival and growth in the world .
So how can people with different world views communicate ?
From a radical constructivist perspective , communication need not involve identically shared meanings between participants .
It is sufficient for their meanings to be compatible ( Hardy and Taylor , 1997 ) .
If neither of the parties does anything completely unexpected to the other , then their illusions of identically shared meaning are maintained ( von Glasersfeld , 1990 ) .
The emphasis here is still clearly on the individual learner as a constructor .
Neither trivial nor radical constructivism look closely at the extent to which the human environment affects learning : it is regarded as part of the total environment .
These issues are focussed on in more detail by social , cultural and critical constructivism .
Social constructivism
My feet were getting tired .
I sat on a bench next to a couple of other travellers , and together we watched the motorbikes swarm like bees at the traffic lights .
It turned out the dark guy was Canadian , and the girl Welsh .
“ Do you know where the main palace is ? ” , I asked them , not knowing the name of it .
“ Sorry , no ” , said the guy , “ we were going there ourselves .
We know it ’s near the Democracy Monument . ”
“ The big pointy one ? ” , I said , shaping it with my hands .
“ Yep , near the river . ” , the girl said .
I knew where that was – I ’d passed it leaving my hotel .
“ Let ’s go ! ” , I said .
The social world of a learner includes the people that directly affect that person , including teachers , friends , students , administrators , and participants in all forms of activity .
This takes into account the social nature of both the local processes in collaborative learning and in the discussion of wider social collaboration in a given subject , such as science .
Many of the authors that identify with social constructivism trace their ideas back to Vygotsky ( e.g. , 1978 ) , a pioneering theorist in psychology who focussed on the roles that society played in the development of an individual .
Cobb ( 1994 ) examines whether the “ mind ” is located in the head or in social action , and argues that both perspectives should be used in concert , as they are each as useful as the other .
What is seen from one perspective as reasoning of a collection of individuals mutually adapting to each other ’s actions can be seen in another as the norms and practices of a classroom community ( Cobb , 1998 ) .
This dialectic is examined in more detail in a strong paper by Salomon and Perkins ( 1998 ) , who suggest ways that these “ acquisition ” and “ participation ” metaphors of learning interrelate and interact in synergistic ways .
They model the social entity as a learner ( for example , a football team , a business or a family ) , compare it with the learning of an individual in a social setting , and identify three main types of relations :
Individual learning can be less or more socially - mediated learning .
Individuals can participate in the learning of a collective , sometimes with what is learned distributed throughout the collective more than in the mind of any one individual .
Individuals and social aspects of learning in both of these senses , can interact over time to strengthen one another in a ‘ reciprocal spiral relationship ’ .
Teaching strategies using social constructivism as a referent include teaching in contexts that might be personally meaningful to students , negotiating taken - as - shared meanings with students , class discussion , small - group collaboration , and valuing meaningful activity over correct answers ( Wood et al , 1995 ) .
Cobb ( 1994 ) contrasts the approach of delivering mathematics as “ content ” against the technique of fostering the emergence of mathematical ideas from the collective practices of the classroom community .
Emphasis is growing on the teacher ’s use of multiple epistemologies , to maintain dialectic tension between teacher guidance and student - initiated exploration , as well as between social learning and individual learning .
Constructivism - related strategies such as these are starting to be used more often in science and mathematics classrooms , but perhaps not surprisingly , have been common for a longer time in humanities subjects like social studies and communication .
It ’s interesting to observe the construction process of the wide community of intellectual publishers : liberal quoting of each other ’s ideas , combining , arguing , extending and recombining them in order to construct our social and cultural understanding of thought , understanding and ultimately human nature .
Cultural constructivism
We wandered among the walls of the ancient palace buildings , admiring intricate Buddhist murals and statues next to signs in English telling us not to touch things , not to graffiti , not take photos , not to eat food , not to sit etc .
It was hard to tell if they wanted tourists here or not .
Did they think we wanted to destroy the place ?
Perhaps they did .
Perhaps we already had .
I thought about the amount of signs advertising western products I ’d seen , I thought about those herds of motorcycles eroding the quiet temples with their exhaust .
Beyond the immediate social environment of a learning situation are the wider context of cultural influences , including custom , religion , biology , tools and language .
For example , the format of books can affect learning , by promoting views about the organisation , accessibility and status of the information they contain .
“ [ What we need ] is a new conception of the mind , not as an individual information processor , but as a biological , developing system that exists equally well within an individual brain and in the tools , artefacts , and symbolic systems used to facilitate social and cultural interaction . ” ( Vosniadou , 1996 )
The tools that we use affect the way we think ( by tools , I am including language and other symbolic systems as well as physical tools ) .
Salomon and Perkins , ( 1998 ) identify two effects of tools on the learning mind .
Firstly , they redistribute the cognitive load of a task between people and the tool while being used .
For example , a label can save long explanations , and using a telephone can change the nature of a conversation .
Secondly , the use of a tool can affect the mind beyond actual use , by changing skills , perspectives and ways of representing the world .
For example , computers carry an entire philosophy of knowledge construction , symbol manipulation , design and exploration , which , if used in schools , can subversively promote changes in curricula , assessment , and other changes in teaching and learning .
Higher mental functions are , by definition , culturally mediated .
They involve not a direct action on the world but an indirect one , one that takes a bit of material matter used previously and incorporates it as an aspect of action .
Insofar as that matter itself has been shaped by prior human practice ( eg it is an artefact ) , current action incorporates the mental work that produced the particular form of that matter .
( Cole and Wertsch , 1996 , p252 )
Cobern ( 1993 ) writes of the world of subject matter and the internal mental world of the student as competing conceptual “ ecologies ” , an image which invokes pictures of competing constructs , adaptation and survival - of - the - fittest .
This is a somewhat more complex picture than radical constructivism .
It highlights the need to consider both contexts fully , that of the student and that of the knowledge to be learned .
Critical constructivism
Later , walking back to the hotel , I thought about the conference starting the next day .
My paper about new technologies was starting to feel wrong , but I could n’t quite put my finger on it .
What right did I have coming to Thailand and telling them what they should do to be like us ?
Critical constructivism looks at constructivism within a social and cultural environment , but adds a critical dimension aimed at reforming these environments in order to improve the success of constructivism applied as a referent .
Taylor ( 1996 ) describes critical constructivism as a social epistemology that addresses the socio-cultural context of knowledge construction and serves as a referent for cultural reform .
It confirms the relativism of radical constructivism , and also identifies the learner as being suspended in semiotic systems similar to those earlier identified in social and cultural constructivism .
To these , critical constructivism adds a greater emphasis on the actions for change of a learning teacher .
It is a framework using the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas to help make potentially disempowering cultural myths more visible , and hence more open to question through conversation and critical self - reflection .
An important part of that framework is the promotion of communicative ethics , that is , conditions for establishing dialogue oriented towards achieving mutual understanding ( Taylor , 1998 ) .
The conditions include : a primary concern for maintaining empathetic , caring and trusting relationships ; a commitment to dialogue that aims to achieve reciprocal understanding of goals , interests and standards ; and concern for and critical awareness of the often - invisible rules of the classroom , including social and cultural myths .
This allows rational examination of the often implicit “ claims to rightness ” of the participants , especially those derived from social institutions and history ( Taylor , 1996 ) .
Cultural myths that are prevalent in today ’s education systems include ( Taylor , 1996 ) :
The rationalist myth of cold reason – where knowledge is seen as discovery of an external truth .
This can lead to the picture of the teacher in a central role as transmitter of objective truths to students .
This philosophy does not promote clarifying relevance to the lives of students , but instead promotes a curriculum to be delivered .
The myth of hard control – which renders the teacher ’s classroom role as controller , and “ locks teachers and students into grossly asymmetrical power relationships designed to reproduce , rather than challenge , the established culture ” .
Together these myths produce a culture that portrays classroom teaching and learning as “ a journey through a pre-constructed landscape ” .
Modification of such entrenched environments to reduce these myths and promote approaches based on constructivism is problematic , because of the self - reinforcing nature of administration , and the effects of wider culture .
Taylor ( 1996 ) argues for an optimistic approach , and that teachers need to work collegially towards reconstructing education culture together rather than heroically on their own .
Constructionism
I got back to my room and read my paper again .
No , it was all wrong .
I spent an hour or so working on it , but still could n’t get it right .
By the bed was a postcard I ’d bought at the palace .
I stared at the picture for a while , then turned it over and started writing to Sarah , telling her about my walk there that afternoon .
Suddenly , I knew what I should do at the conference .
I reached for my laptop and started jotting ideas .
Constructionism asserts that constructivism occurs especially well when the learner is engaged in constructing something for others to see :
“ Constructionism shares constructivism ’s connotation of learning as `building knowledge structures ’ irrespective of the circumstances of the learning .
It then adds that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity , whether it ’s a sandcastle on the beach or a theory of the universe …
If one eschews pipeline models of transmitting knowledge in talking among ourselves as well as in theorizing about classrooms , then one must expect that I will not be able to tell you about my idea of constructionism .
Doing so is bound to trivialize it .
Instead , I must confine myself to engage you in experiences ( including verbal ones ) liable to encourage your own personal construction of something in some sense like it .
Only in this way will there be something rich enough in your mind to be worth talking about . ” ( Papert , 1990 )
In studying constructivism through my recent course , it has become apparent that one of the most important processes in developing my knowledge has been by explaining and exploring my ideas in conversation with fellow students .
I have noticed , on reflection , that a great deal of my own development was fostered by participating in ongoing dialogue and creating “ texts ” for others to answer back to , whether in conversation or as a class presentation .
I feel also that the construction of web sites and computer sofware ( Dougiamas , 1999 ) has a similar effect .
Gergen ( 1995 ) explores the use of the metaphor of dialogue to evaluate a number of educational practices .
Particularly , he views knowledge as fragments of dialogue , “ knowledgeable tellings ” at a given time within an ongoing relationship .
This relationship can be between learners , between a learner and a teacher , or between a learner and an environment experienced by the learner .
Gergen describes a lecture as a conversation where , because the lecturer has already set the content , the student enters part - way through the dialogue and finds they have no voice within it .
Steier ( 1996 ) looks into this dialogue process in more detail .
Unlike the communicative ethics of Taylor ( 1998 ) which also suggest ways to set up a discursive environment , Steier highlights the circularity of reflective thinking in social research , and presents a number of ways mirroring occurs between learners ( like two mirrors facing each other ) where each reciprocator affects the other .
Awareness of such issues can help ‘ frame ’ the dialogue used to communicate more effectively .
I ’ve found these constructionist metaphors powerful in thinking about Internet - based tools to support learning , and it will help inform me in research I ’m just starting ( Dougiamas , 1999 ) .
Particularly , the Internet ’s strengths as a resource and for communication support Gergen ’s advocation of problem - centred inter- disciplinary study , and the problems of representation are also crucial in a low - bandwidth environment .
For your own learning , this single essay is a very poor vehicle , no matter how clear I try and make it .
Here I am , late at night , stringing together words about constructivism in my word processor , and there you are , reading these words using your own cognitive framework , developed via your own unique background and frameworks of language and meaning .
I am translating a variety of texts , using them to build an understanding on my own background , then translating my new understandings into building my own text , which you are deconstructing to reconstruct your own understanding .
Like Chinese whispers , all these translations are introducing unknowns .
I do n’t know , and can never know if I am reaching you .
In attempting to teach through this medium , all I can hope to do is to stimulate a curiosity in you to read further on these subjects , to write about them , to talk to people about them , and to apply them wherever possible in your own situations .
Conclusions
Constructivism has been said to be post - epistemological , meaning that it is not another epistemology , or a way of knowing .
It can not replace objectivism .
Rather , constructivism is a way of thinking about knowing , a referent for building models of teaching , learning and curriculum ( Tobin and Tippin , 1993 ) .
In this sense it is a philosophy .
Constructivism also can be used to indicate a theory of communication .
When you send a message by saying something or providing information , and you have no knowledge of the receiver , then you have no idea as to what message was received , and you can not unambiguously interpret the response .
Viewed in this way , teaching becomes the establishment and maintenance of a language and a means of communication between the teacher and students , as well as between students .
Simply presenting material , giving out problems , and accepting answers back is not a refined enough process of communication for efficient learning .
Some of the tenets of constructivism in pedagogical terms :
Students come to class with an established world - view , formed by years of prior experience and learning .
Even as it evolves , a student ’s world - view filters all experiences and affects their interpretation of observations .
For students to change their world - view requires work .
Students learn from each other as well as the teacher .
Students learn better by doing .
Allowing and creating opportunities for all to have a voice promotes the construction of new ideas .
A constructivist perspective views learners as actively engaged in making meaning , and teaching with that approach looks for what students can analyse , investigate , collaborate , share , build and generate based on what they already know , rather than what facts , skills , and processes they can parrot .
To do this effectively , a teacher needs to be a learner and a researcher , to strive for greater awareness of the environments and the participants in a given teaching situation in order to continually adjust their actions to engage students in learning , using constructivism as a referent .
Reflection
I wrote about my experiences in Bangkok .
Looking back at my first impressions from the perspective of now I can see how much my “ eyes ” have changed over this relatively short time of four months .
I remember how difficult it was to make sense of my first few attempts to read constructivism literature .
As I read the texts the words “ slipped ” through my mind , like trying to catch water in a net .
The words made sense , the sentences made sense , I could parrot the phrases , but the meanings were threadbare .
There were few connections to experiences and ideas that could be said to make a rich meaning .
I had “ intellectual knowing ” , but not “ knowing “ .
Now , after much dialogue with texts and people , reflection , and by constructing representations of my understandings , I feel I have improved my knowing of constructivism .
I have a greater sense of the richer ‘ cloud of baggage ’
I have developed around some of the concepts within constructivism , as indeed any concept I develop over a long period .
This cloud has been enriched by multiple approaches to understanding – by listening , by reading , by speaking , by writing , by working in groups , pairs and alone , by applying it to various situations , and by having to write this essay .
I find it easier to speak and write about constructivism using my own words , and to apply the ideas in situations I have not encountered before .
I have a deeper understanding of perspective and context , and try to be more critical of texts in terms of the author ’s background , and social situations in terms of the environment and participants .
I feel I have an understanding of the effectiveness of approaching teaching by attempting to know more about the background of the learners , and attempting to stimulate multiple situations of communication between teacher and learner , between learners , and between learners and experience , in order to promote their own development of knowledge relevant to them and to their physical and social environment .
I can see the value of epistemological pluralism , and a variety of referents held in dialectic tension .
The various faces of constructivism can be useful in their own right in various circumstances .
In some cases , even methods derived from an objectivist framework still have value , as long as they are critically applied and their context is made clear .
From writing my journal and writing this essay , I also have a better feel for the value of a constructionist approach , as well as the value of a reflective account for qualitative assessment of learning .
These aspects in particular I think will help me in developing Internet - based learning .
Despite the very fluid nature of constructivism and it ’s many faces , I now believe that attempting to understand it while simultaneously applying that understanding in a reflective manner promotes the development of influential mental constructs that are useful in the pursuit of more effective communications , teaching and learning .

Thank you for writing about your journey , I am starting on your pathway for a PhD , and enjoyed reading your simplistic explanations and analogies .
Before reading your journey notes , I started to become bogged down in ‘ models ’ of learning and asking similair questions .
A positive factor for my research is that I have the opportunity through action research to monitor the changes from traditional methods of teaching to student - centred learning using a constructivist approach .
Thank you again

Thanks Martin for sharing your thoughts , they have caused me to reflect further about my own beliefs about constructivism .
Perhaps what I found most inspiring was your willingness to try and model constructivism in the way you shared your ideas .
This modeling demonstrates how much you value these ideas , and that for you this is not simply an academic exercise or the means of being associated with the latest pedagogical fad .

One last hit on research of Constructivism on a sleepless night … and I found your insightful and refreshing observations .
I return tomorrow to interact with a gifted group of ‘ At Risk ’ Middle School students with renewed enthusiasm for what we have been attempting and the realization that the interactive experience of constructing and expanding knowledge is and should be a pleasurable experience in and of itself .
I appreciate permission to cite your paper in my application for National Teacher Board Certification .
Thanks for the insight .

I am a student in China .
I decide to write something on constructivism for my graduation paper .
I want to write about the application of constructivism to language teaching .
But it seems that all papers on constructivism are on teaching of science .
I wonder whether we can also apply it to the teaching of social sciences , like language teaching .
I badly need your help .
Thank you !

Great essay .
I have been travelling OZ presenting a Science show and working locally as a specialist science teacher [ primary ] since being packaged out in 1993 .
I also present PD and Family Science nights to schools in the Gippsland Region .

Hey there , it is a pretty interesting essay you wrote tehre .
I am a postgrad student in Germany and my UNi is specialising on Constructivistical Media Theory .
It should be worth to check out some sociological approaches by some German sociologists and also French ones such as : Giesecke , Merten , Chomsky ( pretty interesting , as he works on the edge between sociology and biochemistry ) and Schmidt .
Youll find their work very interesting , you might also want to check out the LUMIS institute in Siegen - Germany .

Sorry , I forgot to add the link : http://www.lumis.uni-siegen.de
UNfortunately it is in German , but they have interesting links , and thsi might answer questions I read in the former mails , asking for Constructivism in teaching languages .
There is loads on that , cause I do n’t see it as being mainly about teaching sciences , but about understanding society , mainly if you can compare this to theories such as the system theory by Luhmann , or Neo-Formalism by Alexander .
Nough said , enjoy Constructivism , it does change your life .

Dear martin , I am a part time lecturer in psychology in ireland .
And , judging from what you ’ve written , a naive constructivist !
I am constantly challenging students to refer to their own experience and to question standard models even though they are only first - years .
I had heard of this idea but did not really know what it actually MEANT .
I ’ve always had an intrest in language and remember reading Vygotosky ’s Language and Thought with great interest in college .
This was a very interesting paper and i would definitely like to use it at some point .

Hellow !
Mr.pro
Now , I am studying the theory of constructivism as a Master .
I feel this theory is interesting and it will have a strong impact on the theory of learning in the future , I do n’t think passtive instruction can solve the question of human ’s learning in the knowledge society .
We can not know the world itself , because it is too complicated .
what we must do will be finding and constructing the “ world ” belonging to ourselves .
from prehistoric time to now , human being have been constructing their knowledge world in this way .
History is created by human being himself , not by the nature .
Rule of the nature reflects human ’s selection .

I was one of three teachers who founded a school in 1996 based on the principles of constructivism and interdisciplinarity , two areas I had researched during my Master ’s program .
In addition , to make things even more interesting , we set it up as a multiage classoom , 7 - 13 .
Although the workload was unbelievable ( there are no real curricula you can buy with all 3 aspects combined ) it was unbelievably fun , and very liberating .
As an educational experiment , it proved that children flourish intellectually when given these three aspects simultaneously in their academic lives .
I have this year turned over my teaching position to another and am focusing on researching and giving workshops on these foundational approaches to teaching .
Your paper is very well written and provides an excellent synopsis of a vital–and too often lacking –pedagogical tool .

I ’m just starting a Master ’s in teaching at the University of Sydney and found your article to be of great value .
I had merely the simplistic version of constructivism in my head and I thank you for directing me to widen my definition .
The approach you adopt of inter -weaving your mental landscape with a more physical one is tremendous and I ’d like to see you improve this by allowing these parallel worlds to reach some sort of conclusion .
We were asked in seminar the other day to think of a meaningful learning experience and mine was reading a philosophy book on my own after I ’d been kicked out of University for a year ( back in 1977 ) .
The book , although widely held to be of poor philosophy , was nevertheless brilliantly written and used the same technique as you adopt .
He uses a motorcycle trip across the U.S.A . where all kinds of opportunities for parallels of both mental and physical high ground present themselves as he heads into the Rockies .
Great stuff – very captivating .
The book is Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig ( 1974 ) .
I may try to develop this technique myself as I find it incredibly evocative .

I dunno , folks …
This is all very interesting , but why yammer on and on about Constructivism or any other obscure ( and happily so ) teaching concept when all one must do to teach is simple teach the pupil to read , write , subtract , divide , or cut up the silly dead frog in that pan full of asphalt on the desk ?
I realize that if you do n’t “ yammer , ” you wo n’t receive your Masters degree .
That might be better for your future pupils , but not for you , of course .
Maybe that ’s the reason so many students fail to learn : their teachers are bored to death with real teaching and become sidetracked by ( allegedly ) esoteric pedagogical abstractions .
Not to be a kill - joy , of course , I think your “ distance learning ” software is remarkable .
I really do .
Much more impressive than any oddball educational theories .
I think Moodle is a lot more important than Constructivism .
Hell ’s bells , man , ya want koans , get into Zen !

The way we learn is there , but the purpose not only be to have a degree .
The idea of the constructivism ( social , simplistic , etc. ) should be taken in the enterprises to increase the productivity and the hapiness of employees .
The use of new technologies ( Talking about e-learning in particular moodle ) could arrive to the last point .
But we need integrate moodle with an eviroment of colaboration of projects at work .

Hi , Martin , Like others , I appreciate your paper and very much appreciate the opportunity you give to write about it and to see others ’ comments .
I have felt ( with my limited exposure to constructivism ) that there are constuctivists who believe that there is ultimately no objective reality .
Would you say this true ?
I have also felt that there are what I would call pragmatic constructivists who , considering themselves as following constructivism , might take some of the ideas included in constructivism ( students learn by doing , for example ) without believing there is no objective reality .

I must say , this is one of the best elaborations of learning and educational theory I ’ve come across for a long , long time .
As someone who teaches and coaches second chance adults , as someone who started late in life to reap the benefits of education and thinking , and as someone who ’s also placed their feet ( had to ) firmly on the ground , even though its been swampy at times , this whole exposition is a remarkable revelation .
I wish I ’d had this a long time ago .
I ’m so impressed I ’ll begin my next course on assertion and personal development using some of these references .
Moodle , in fact , is a world beater .
It dispenses with so much trivia and concentrates purely on what matters – this is becoming rarer in education , often to the detriment of students whose attention span is advert paned .
Globally it is developing a critical base because it puts serious professionals in touch with others – by this I do n’t mean ernest serious , but those who know how to take their opportuities and share their expertise .
I think that ’ll do .
Keep up the brilliant work .

I read your article as my first research on constructivism .
I am a professional musician and a high school orchestra director enrolled in a Master ’s program on Technology in Education .
I found it very interesting and related entirely ( although I find myself at a totally different , infinitely more basic , stage in my familiarity with the subject ) to your comments related to “ how difficult it was to make sense of my first few attempts to read constructivism literature .
As I read the texts the words “ slipped ” through my mind , like trying to catch water in a net . ”
Enjoyed your weaving of your travel experiences to Thailand in the essay .
It gave it a visual perspective that facilitated the understanding of the more esoteric concepts .
Thank you .

Hello , Martin .
I am a student from China .
I am engaged in my master ’s paper on constructivism and CAI in English teaching .
I ’ve attended some classes with the use of CAI , but I do feel the use of it so restricted and I find a split of the theories in designing CAI and using it in the classrooms .
I am wondering if i could say constructivism need to be applied as a basis throughout the whole process of teaching .
Could you give me any suggestions ?
Thank you .

This is good stuff .
I have found this area personally challenging – I ’m on a distance learning degree course – in computing science .
Without it being fully explained to us , this is the approach being used – we were told about “ Each one , teach one ” .
I ’m involved in my local church , where tradional teaching methods send me to sleep .
I have been challenged by this to look at applying these methods to learning in the church environment .
I will let you know how I get on in a culture resistant to change !

Hi .
I ’m coming to the end of a master thesis on “ A Microworld for Language Learning ; A Constructivist Approach to Designing Star City ” and I ran across your paper trying infinite searches to find another one i wanted to see again .
Being a great distance from the University where I ’d done my coursework , I relied less on books and more on the internet …
I just wanted to tell you that I sank into it and read it with deep interest from beginning to end with facination .
It was very gripping !
Usually I can only say that about novels …
The point you make about discussion really felt like a bit of a revelation to me …
THAT is exactly what I was missing in this whole masters program , since it was an interdiciplinary program and no one else ( including my 2 sponsoring professors ! ) was interested in my subject !!
I was really on my own , and did n’t get a grip on this subject until this last process of going onto the internet and “ interacting ” with other working with the subject , joining the IT forum listserv etc .
Thank you !

Martin , Found your paper as 1st site cited on MSweb search for “ social constructivism . ”
The term had been applied by another author referring to Paulo Feire ( 1970 ) .
If I understand your analysis , Feire would have been a critical constructionist .
Or , on the otherhand , it may only be how “ my reality ” intersects with yours , Paulo and the other author ’s experiences .
Hmmm .

“ Constructivism is building on knowledge known by the student .
Education is student - centred , students have to construct knowledge themselves .
Explanations can use metacognition to explain via metaphor .
Semiotics , or meanings of words , are important to keep in mind .
Constructivism is a theory , a tool , a lens for examining educational practices .

Your article has given me one ( of many ) starting point in my research for an article on cultural relativism and science .

Since much of your emphasis seems to be on mathematics , you might be interested in researching the Moore method of mathematics teaching .
This was used by R.L. Moore at the University of Texas at Austin for around 40 years until he retired in 1965 .
I was a graduate student there in physics from 1966 to 1971 and met a number of students who had studied with Moore .
His method essentially led students to construct the subject matter for themselves .
Students were not to read the text in a class , or discuss how to prove theorems outside of the classroom .
He would provide some axioms and definitions , and discuss what constituted a proof , then give some statements that students were expected to prove themselves .
Through the course of a term the students would construct the course material for themselves .
The American Mathematical Society use to have a film about Moore and his teaching , which produced a number of fine mathematicians .

I must say I am impressed .
From where the project was when we first started to where the project is now and the distance that we have actually brought our local teachers and students into the world of technology .
In my time I have done and seen alot of things .
I have trained and worked with some of the brightest minds that are today quite involved with the world of technology .
I have trained others who have gone on to form companies who have been bought - out by Microsoft ; trained techs who travel the globe for major corporations ; trained techs for NASA ; all from Santa Cruz High School in the 80’s ; and with all this I am still impressed with the commitment and involvement of those individuals who are building a better world through Moodle .
I would love to some day meet you all just to say thank you , but I know that will probably never happen .

What a great intro. to constructivism !
I confess – I was more interested in hearing how your talk went than reading your conclusions – if only because as you point out , knowing constructivism and ‘ KNOWING ’ constructivism are two different things , and I am at the beginning of my journey .
Your metaphor helped me see a way I can begin to apply this theory to my present course ( holistic approaches to information technology at OISE , U. of T. ) and my present life ( as a resource teacher for students with learning disabilities ) .

My first semester of PhD Science Education just ended but I still have a seminar to complete .
With the approval of my Professor I choose Constructivism for my topic .
Your article , which I just browsed over will help me a lot since I noticed that you simplified it and gave a very good background of the topic .
I ’ll still decide what title I ’ll give my paper .
Thank you very much !

I find this article very valuable .
As I was reading through the article , I thought about the learning process that goes along with the interactions of my co-students and comprehend how they themselves lear from one another through the sharing of their own interpretations independently from their backgrounds .
I hope i express myself well , my best regards and thanks for sharing this article .

I really liked reading through this article , because i have gained a lot from it in terms of improving my understanding of the idea of ‘ constructivism ’ .
I wish I could always have access to such information about learning theories especially after failing to get to grips with this theory from lectures !

news A Good Pac- Man Is Hard To Find : Spadina Bust
We should have known !
The culprits responsible for the Pac - Man recreation on a streetcar shelter outside Kensington Market have stepped forward , and they ’re neither advertisers nor immoralists : they ’re Teeth ( responsible for this charming bear - woman ) and our very own Posterchild ( who is something of a fan of video games ) .
The two collaborated to put up three nearly identical installations along Spadina : one at Spadina and Harbord ( pictured above , at top ) ; one at Spadina and Queen ( above , bottom ) ; and the one we spotted on Sunday , at Spadina south of Nassau ( above , middle ) .
The three ghosts , three cherries , and three Pac - Men were made out of scrap adhesive vinyl , took a grand total of five hours to build and install , and , says Posterchild , were totally Teeth ’s idea .
Says Posterchild : “ When Teeth told me about it , I said ‘ That ’s brilliant !
Let ’s do it ! ' ”
And they did , and it was good .

Thousands of people are still trapped beneath ruined buildings
A massive search and rescue operation is under way in south - western China after one of the most powerful earthquakes in decades .
Troops have arrived in Wenchuan county at the epicentre , which was largely cut off by the quake - but heavy rain is hampering rescue operations .
Elsewhere in Sichuan province , frantic efforts are being made to reach thousands of people under the rubble .
The death toll is now more than 12,000 , officials say , and looks set to rise .
Eyewitness : ' Constant aftershocks '
Chengdu witness : Fear of home Chaotic yet organised rescue effort Pandas ' safe ' after quake
In one city , Mianyang , near the epicentre , more than 18,000 people are said to be buried under the rubble , state news agency Xinhua reports .
In the nearby town of Mianzhu , at least 4,800 people are trapped , and massive landslides have buried roads to outlying villages , state news agency Xinhua says .
Sichuan Vice - Governor Li Chengyun said the death toll included : 7,395 in Mianyang , 2,648 in Deyang City , 959 in the provincial capital Chengdu , 700 in Guangyuan City , and 161 in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture .
See a map of the earthquake area Premier Wen Jiabao was quick to reach the scene and urged rescuers to clear roads into the worst - hit areas as fast as possible .
" As long as there is even a little hope , we will redouble our efforts 100 times and will never relax our efforts , " he told crying locals through a loudhailer in the badly hit Dujiangyan city , south - east of the epicentre .
The health ministry has made an urgent appeal for people to give blood to help the injured .
But plans to air - drop supplies and deliver troops by parachute have been undermined by bad weather .
Panic rife
The BBC's Michael Bristow describes a scene of organised chaos in Dujiangyan - with dazed survivors in the streets in their pyjamas while police try to direct traffic .
China mounts huge rescue efforts to find survivors
In pictures
He heard the story of one man whose uncle was trapped in the rubble of his apartment building .
He was able to speak to him on his mobile phone , but could not reach him and was desperately searching for help .
Panic is rife , he says , and there is a palpable sense of fear .
Strong aftershocks have hit regularly , and rumours that others are about to strike have sent people scurrying through the streets , dragging bags behind them .
People do not want to return to their homes , he says , and are spending another night in the open , in heavy rain , with no power or water .
The quake - now upgraded to 7.9 magnitude - struck on Monday at 1428 local time ( 0628 GMT ) and was felt as far away as Beijing and the Thai capital , Bangkok .
Boulders and landslides are blocking roads in the worst - hit areas and helicopters have been unable to land because of the bad weather .
Beijing has deployed 50,000 troops to help with relief efforts , but many have not yet arrived .
About 1,300 rescue troops and medics have reached Wenchuan county and immediately started searching for survivors and treating the injured , Xinhua reported .
But there is still no word on casualties from the area - where about 100,000 people live .

More than 100 people are thought to be buried underneath a hospital that collapsed .
Relatives waited at the gate all day on Tuesday , but rescue workers only managed to pull out one body .
In Shifang , where two chemical plants collapsed , releasing a huge toxic cloud , about 600 people were reported dead and up to 2,300 still buried .
More than 300 people were killed in the neighbouring provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi , and in Chongqing municipality , Xinhua said .
' Pandas safe '
There are also fears for the safety of staff and tourists - including a group of 19 British visitors - at a giant panda research centre at Wolong in Wenchuan .
However , after about 36 hours during which the centre could not be contacted , it emerged that at least 80 of the pandas themselves were safe , Xinhua said .

US President George W Bush expressed condolences to victims ' families , while the US , UK , the European Union , Japan , South Korea and Taiwan reportedly offered aid .
China said it would accept international help to cope with the quake - the worst since 1976 when 242,000 people were killed in Tangshan - and offered its thanks .
The government response was praised as " swift and very efficient " by Francis Marcus of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Beijing .
But he added the scale of the disaster was such that " we ca n't expect that the government can do everything and handle every aspect of the needs " .

Monkeys previously orbited Earth in the Bion capsule
They wo n't utter Yuri Gagarin 's famous phrase " Let 's go ! "
But the monkeys of Sochi have already proven their worth as trailblazers in space - and now they are being groomed for a trip to Mars .
The macaques will be the first to experience the radiation that poses a big risk to astronauts - or Russian cosmonauts - on any flight to the Red Planet .
The Sochi Institute of Medical Primatology , at Vesyoloye near the Black Sea , has a proud history of involvement in the Russian - formerly Soviet - space programme .
" People and monkeys have approximately identical sensitivity to small and large radiation doses , " explains the institute 's director , Boris Lapin .
" So it is better to experiment on the macaques , but not on dogs or other animals . "
The institute will select macaques that may eventually fly to Mars before humans do .
After two years of experiments the most suitable 40 monkeys will be sent to the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow , where scientists study aerospace biomedicine .
Experiments on the monkeys will be carried out at the same time as the Mars - 500 project .
That project - due to start early next year - is aimed at simulating the conditions of interplanetary flight .
Volunteers will have to spend 17 months in a mock - up " spaceship " in Moscow .
Monkeys may touch down on boulder - strewn Mars before humans
But a real expedition to Mars is not likely to happen for another 10 years at the very least .
Gruelling mission
In addition to the effects of radiation , space scientists want to see how the monkeys react to prolonged weightless conditions , isolation and a special diet of juices and pureed food .
Mars -500 director Viktor Baranov says 520 days " are enough for the flight to Mars - 250 days to fly there , 250 days to come back and a month for the landing on Mars " .
Today Russia is one of the few countries where experiments on primates are carried out .
" Humanity sacrifices more than 100 million animals a year in the name of health and beauty .
It 's time to think of an alternative to experiments with animals , " says Andrei Zbarsky of the international nature conservation group WWF .
The son of space veteran Krosh may one day fly to Mars " I 'm sure scientists will repeat the story of Laika , the first dog in space .
Today it 's no secret that the dog died from the nervous stress immediately after the rocket launch and its dead body revolved in orbit for two weeks . "
Mr Lapin admits that his institute has received some objections from European colleagues concerned about the animal experiments .
A researcher at the institute , Anaida Shaginyan , says " certainly , I feel sorry for the monkeys , they might die , but the experiments are necessary to preserve the lives of the cosmonauts who will fly to Mars in future " .
Veteran cosmonauts
The institute has a breeding programme for the macaques , so it is not necessary to catch them in the wild .
Twelve macaques have flown in Russian and Soviet spaceships on previous missions .
Krosh flew in space in 1992 and is still in rude health Abrek and Bion were the first into space , in December 1983 .
After a five - day flight they landed in Kazakhstan and after rehabilitation returned to the pack .
Two years later the monkeys Verny and Gordy spent seven days in space .
In 1987 Dryoma and Yerosha spent two weeks in orbit .
After returning from space Dryoma was presented to Cuban leader Fidel Castro .
After that there were three two - week flights : in 1989 , 1992 and 1996 .
Then the project stopped - Russia did not have enough money for the programme .
Now experiments are conducted on Earth under conditions which simulate weightlessness .
Sixteen - year - old space veteran Krosh is a star of the institute .
" Old man Krosh is about 60 years old , if we translate his monkey age to a human life span .
He is very active .
He responds well to food and is aggressive with his female partners , " says Ms Shaginyan .
" After rehabilitation he produced offspring .
And that 's proof that spaceflight did not harm his health , " she added .

The case of the limited " unlimited " EVDO has been settled : Verizon has agreed to pay out $ 1 million to customers that it has terminated for overuse of its high - speed data service .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo made the announcement today , saying that Verizon 's decision came after a nine - month investigation into the company 's services and marketing practices .
The attorney general accused Verizon of producing misleading materials and deceptive marketing when it claimed that its data plans were unlimited .
The issue came to light last year , when some customers found their accounts on the chopping block after downloading too much data over Verizon 's wireless broadband service .
The wireless provider prominently advertised its EVDO service as " unlimited , " but the fine print indicated that it was only unlimited for certain things , such as e-mail and web access .
Video , music , and other media did not fall into that category , and Verizon began enforcing an undisclosed bandwidth cap on users that the company decided downloaded too much .
Verizon eventually cut off some 13,000 customers for excessive use of its " unlimited " service , leaving those customers out in the cold with equipment that they could no longer use .
But the Attorney General said that the service 's limitations were not clearly and conspicuously disclosed , and that they " directly contradicted the promise of ' unlimited ' service . "
Verizon , which has voluntarily cooperated with the investigation since it began in April , has now agreed to reimburse the terminated customers for the costs associated with their now - useless equipment .
Verizon estimates that it will come out to be about $ 1 million , with an additional $ 150,000 in fines paid out to the state of New York .
" This settlement sends a message to companies large and small answering the growing consumer demand for wireless services .
When consumers are promised an ' unlimited ' service , they do not expect the promise to be broken by hidden limitations , " said Cuomo in a statement .
" Consumers must be treated fairly and honestly .
Delivering a product is simply not enough — the promises must be delivered as well . "
The company has also agreed to revise its marketing of the wireless plans , in addition to allowing common uses of the broadband connection ( such as video downloads ) .
As you can see above , Verizon has already updated some of its marketing material .
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Sudanese President Omer al - Bashir announced on Sunday a decision to sever diplomatic ties with Chad , holding Chad responsible for an attack launched by Darfur rebels on the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Saturday .
" Sudan holds Chad responsible for what had happened and reserve the right for responding , " the Sudanese president said in an address to the Sudanese nation .
He praised the position of the Sudanese Armed Forces ( SAF ) , the police , various political parties and the Sudanese people , which , he said , had been " standing firmly over the Darfur issue and against the aggression " .
On Saturday , a group of militants of the rebel Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) infiltrated into Omdurman Area in northwestern Khartoum and clashed with the SAF troops and police forces .
The Sudanese government announced that the army and the police had crushed the attempt of the rebels to infiltrate into the capital and carry out sabotage activities there , killing and capturing a number of the infiltrators .
This was the first time for rebels in Darfur to enter Khartoum and launch attacks there since bloody conflicts erupted in the western Sudanese region neighboring Chad in February 2003 .
The Sudanese government has repeatedly accused N'djamena of supporting and providing assistance to the rebel movements in Darfur , but the Chadian government has denied the accusation .

UAW sellout of American
Axle strike imminent
By Shannon Jones
18 April 2008
Click here to download this article as a leaflet .
The United Auto Workers is rapidly pushing to finalize a concessionary agreement in the now eight - week - long strike by 3,600 workers in Michigan and western New York against auto parts maker American Axle .
According to a report in the industry journal Automotive News , a tentative agreement could be reached by this weekend .
The paper quoted American Axle spokesperson Renee Rogers who said , “ Negotiations are continuing progressing .
The process is moving along . ”
Automotive News wrote : “ The two sides are making progress on three fronts : Wages , health care and legacy costs , and job classifications . ”
American
Axle is insisting on a wage cut from $ 28 an hour to as low as $ 11.50 , the elimination of pensions , steep cuts in health - care benefits and a massive consolidation of job classifications that would lead to substantial job reductions .
As usual , the UAW refused to make any comment on the content of the negotiations .
However , in an op - ed piece published in the Detroit News earlier this month , UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said contract proposals submitted by the union would impose “ real sacrifices on our members . ”
On Wednesday the UAW abruptly cancelled a strike support rally set for April 18 in Detroit , citing “ progress ” in the talks .
The calling off of the rally came as a surprise and slap in the face to American Axle workers , who were attempting to mobilize wide participation .
Fear of a large turnout , not only of American Axle workers but other rank - and - file autoworkers , was undoubtedly a major factor in the decision by Solidarity House to scuttle the event .
Since the walkout began in late February the UAW has done everything it can to isolate and demoralize the strikers .
In any event , Gettelfinger made it clear the UAW bureaucracy never intended the rally as part of a serious effort to mobilize workers behind the strike , declaring in the previously cited op - ed piece , “ We ’d like nothing better than to cancel our rally because the strike was resolved by having a ratified contract . ”
The cancellation of the support rally and continuing total information blackout imposed by the UAW International on the rank and file leave no doubt that the union is preparing an imminent betrayal .
The chief remaining issue to be resolved in the contract talks appears to be the division of the spoils between American Axle and General Motors .
The axle maker was set up in 1994 after GM sold several axle and driveline factories to a group of private investors led by current American Axle CEO Richard Dauch .
A report in the April 17 Detroit Free Press indicates that GM is resisting demands that it contribute toward “ attrition packages ” for American Axle workers .
For its part the giant automaker expects American
Axle to use part of the millions it gains from concessions to subsidize price reductions for the parts it supplies to GM assembly plants .
The UAW is moving to wrap up the strike even as the impact of the American Axle walkout is spreading .
Thirty GM plants have already been partially or totally shut down by the strike .
According to Automotive News , the strike is beginning to have an impact on production of some of GM ’s better selling models .
Production of the Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne has been slowed at the Detroit - Hamtramck assembly plant .
Now it is reported that production of the HHR crossover is slowing at the GM facility in Ramos Arizipe , Mexico due to a parts shortage ; the Saturn Vue could soon be impacted .
Production of Kodiak trucks in Silao , Mexico could also soon be slowed .
GM also announced the cancellation of one shift of production at its Oshawa , Ontario car plant starting next week
On April 17 , 2,600 workers at a GM plant outside of Lansing , Michigan struck over local issues .
The facility builds the Buick Enclave , Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia .
A strike by workers at a local parts supplier had already slowed production at the plant .
The walkout undoubtedly reflects , at least in part , the enormous sympathy that exists among autoworkers for the American Axle strike .
However , from the standpoint of the UAW the walkout is a cynical maneuver .
By calling the strike the UAW is applying a little additional pressure on GM to help facilitate the sellout of American
Axle workers by putting up money for buyouts as it did at auto parts maker Delphi last year .
With the majority of GM units yet to sign local agreements , the UAW could call a wave of crippling strikes .
But it has no intention of doing this .
The union recently withdrew a strike notice at a GM plant in Flint , Michigan that was set to walk out over local issues and put off threats of strikes at plants in Warren and Grand Rapids , Michigan while it continues to drag out talks .
After attempting to starve out workers , leaving them isolated on the picket line for two months surviving on a miserable $ 200 a week strike paycheck , the UAW evidently calculates it is time to try to force through a vote on concessions .
American
Axle workers cannot afford to wait while the UAW prepares to impose a sellout .
They must form independent rank - and - file committees to campaign against any return to work without a contract and rejection of any concessions agreement .
They must take the initiative to spread the strike by appealing directly to workers at the Big Three auto plants , including their brothers and sisters in Canada and Mexico .
They must fight to mobilize support independently of the UAW bureaucracy from throughout the working class , including unemployed and nonunion workers .
Massive support could be won for such a struggle because the fundamental issue in the strike , the right to earn a decent wage , is vital to the future of every worker .
It comes amidst reports of hedge fund managers making billions of dollars off of a home mortgage crisis that threatens millions with losing their homes .
The basic precondition for mounting such a campaign is for workers to put aside any illusions in the UAW .
It has been transformed into a wealthy business enterprise , no less ruthlessly committed to the defense of capitalism and the suppression of the class struggle as American Axle CEO Richard Dauch .
The union apparatus , from Gettelfinger down to the local level , is determined to crush this strike to prevent any precedent being set for a successful struggle .
Workers must be prepared to resist attempts by the UAW bureaucracy to organize a return to work and a hasty ratification vote and efforts by the UAW to mobilize its apparatus to pressure and intimidate opponents of a sellout .
However , militant action is not enough .
A new political strategy is needed .
American
Axles workers are not simply in a battle against one employer , but confront a social and political system that is entirely hostile to the interests of millions of working people like themselves around the world .
Their struggle takes place in the midst of a presidential election campaign in which all the major party candidates pledge to continue spending hundreds of billions on the illegal occupation of Iraq while pledging next to nothing to healthcare , education or aid to homeowners facing foreclosure .
Neither Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton nor John McCain have offered a word of support to the American Axle workers because they are all beholden to the interests of corporate America and its drive to make workers pay for the worsening economic crisis .
The working class must break with the Democrats and Republicans , the two parties of big business , and construct its own political party to wage a struggle against the profit system .
This includes the fight for public ownership of the auto companies and other key industries under the democratic control of the working class in order to carry out the rational organization of production to meet human needs , not profit .

It 's an unfortunate side effect of being young , impatient , and uncultured .
Eventually we grew larger , gained extra limbs , and became adults .
But during that horrifying nightmare of youth , with all its jumbled priorities , interests , and miniature attention spans , we saw things remarkably different .

Duchenne muscular dystrophy may not seem to have much in common with heart attacks .
One is a rare inherited disease that primarily strikes boys .
The other is a common cause of death in both men and women .
To Atul J. Butte , they are surprisingly similar .
Dr. Butte , an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford , is among a growing band of researchers trying to redefine how diseases are classified  by looking not at their symptoms or physiological measurements , but at their genetic underpinnings .
It turns out that a similar set of genes is active in boys with Duchenne and adults who have heart attacks .
The research is already starting to change nosology , as the field of disease classification is known .
Seemingly dissimilar diseases are being lumped together .
What were thought to be single diseases are being split into separate ailments .
Just as they once mapped the human genome , scientists are trying to map the “ diseasome , ” the collection of all diseases and the genes associated with them .
“ We are now in a unique position in the history of medicine to define human disease precisely , uniquely and unequivocally , ” three scientists wrote of the new approach last year in the journal Molecular Systems Biology .
Such research aims to do more than just satisfy some basic intellectual urge to organize and categorize .
It also promises to improve treatments and public health .
Not one , but THREE of my weaknesses .
The time during the past year when I have been the most upset with myself .
When interview ing for a job , it is not uncommon to be asked what you consider to be your main weakness professionally .
This is a very good question .
Certainly your prospective employer would like to know in what areas you feel you need improvement .
However , in a recent interview for a position posted internally at my company , I was compelled to provide my interviewer with :
Now again , ONE weakness is fair , but making your candidate tell you four bad things about themselves seems like dirty pool to me .
I mean , what a way to make someone crawl , right ?
" Well , I guess I was most upset with myself this past year when I accidentally knocked my oldest boy off the roof while we were repairing the shingles and he went to the hospital in a coma .
As I watched them load him into the ambulance , not knowing if he were alive or dead , I was overcome with feelings of shame and self - hatred that linger even today .
I prayed to God to kill me where I stood . "

Maybe because I'm a " San Francisco elite , " when I heard what Barack Obama said at a Marin County fundraiser about the difficulties inherent in reaching out to small town voters , I said , " And ...? "
Obviously , context is everything , and perhaps it was not as artfully phrased as it might have been .
Are voters so fragile that having someone point out that there is antipathy and bitterness in many economically impoverished areas that makes it hard to connect to voters and encourage them to vote for you is somehow an elitist attitude ?
Are we so immature that we need candidates to pat us on our heads and say , " It 's okay , little voter , there , there ... do n't let me bother your pretty little head with reality " ?
Really , which is more condescending ?
But you would n't have known that by CNN 's coverage on Lou Dobbs Tonight .
Guest host Kitty Pilgrim spent the whole hour talking about how this could potentially devastate Obama 's campaign , bringing on concerned analysts and reporters alike to discuss how this shows Obama 's elitist attitude ( my God , he declined a cup of coffee for a glass of orange juice ... and he can't bowl !
That snob ! ) .
And while they acknowledged Obama 's response , they saw fit to focus on Clinton and McCain 's pouncing on this opportunity to go after Obama .
At first , I was incredulous over the whole thing and figured that the media just needed something to talk about .
But then I looked at the calendar .
Friday afternoon data dump .
What came out of the White House this Friday ?
Bush sanctioned torture .
That 's right .
While Kitty Pilgrim clutched her pearls for a full hour at the thought of poor voters in rural Pennsylvania being thought of as being bitter and distrustful of others because of their disaffection , she ( and all the other talking heads and news shows ) IGNORED the fact that our president has admitted that he committed a war crime .
A crime for which other heads of state have found themselves in front of a war crimes tribunal in The Hague , but merited not even a yawn out of our media .
Read what is less important to CNN than Barack Obama 's characterization ( NSFW ) .
Talk about disaffection .
At this point , I am of the belief that we need to put the heads of these media companies on trial as well for their complicity .

It was cloned from Q1 ’07 and most of the data and information was wrong .
In this fourth post ( one , two and three are found here ) on the State of the Computer Book Market , we will look at programming languages and drill in a little on each language area .
Overall the 2007 market for programming languages was down ( 1.67 % ) in 2007 when compared with 2006 .
There were 1,809,695 units sold in 2006 versus 1,779,523 units sold in 2007 which is ( 30,172 ) fewer units in 2007 .
So the modest 1 % growth in the Overall Computer Book Market must have been fueled by non-programming oriented books .
You do n’t need a programming language to learn to use MacOsX , Vista or Office and that is where the growth was in 2007 .
Before we begin to drill in on the languages , we thought it would be best to explain our “ language dimension . ”
We track both topic categories and languages .
In the latter dimension , we capture whether the book being categorized has code examples in a particular language .
So a title like Head First Design Patterns , which contains all examples written in Java , carries the “ java ” tag on the language dimension even though it ’s in the design patterns category .
A Treemap view of Programming Languages
Caveat :
The image below is about 1 % or 2 % off because there were several titles that were unclassified at the end of 2007 when we took this screen capture .
The trends are still the same , but the precision is lacking .
In the treemap view , you ’ll notice a couple of bright green areas — namely ActionScript and PowerShell .
Python , Ruby and C# are green ( not bright green ) , showing nice growth when compared to 2006 .
Ruby was a small box last year and is now the 8th largest language , passing Perl and Python and now knocking on the door for Visual Basic ’s spot .
Ruby has the second largest unit growth after C# , going from 4 % overall market share to 5 % ; it is now 4 k units from displacing VB for # 7 overall .
C# was equally impressive with a 36,811 unit growth , or 18.85 % ; it went from 11 % market share in 2006 to 13 % market share in 2007 .
At the rate it is going , it should surpass Java as the number one language this year as it is only ( 9,526 ) units short and is on a positive 18.85 % growth rate while Java continues its slide at a ( 14.16 % ) clip .
In addition , look at the title efficiency : C# is achieving close to the same number of units with 3/ 5 the number of titles , indicating that each title is selling better .
Now let ’s dive into this treemap and take a closer look at the languages .
This chart shows the five - year trend for the major programming languages .
Red is used to highlight 2007 .
What is very noticeable is the huge decline with Java .
In five years , it is now half of where it was in 2003 .
C# and Javascript are the only two Major languages that showed fairly conistent performance during the past five years .
2007 Market Share
Before we dive in , let ’s look at the high level picture for the grouping of languages .
As you can see in the table below , the MidMinor and Minor languages experienced growth in 2007 while the rest experienced a decline .
The languages driving the growth in the Minor category are Groovy , SAS , Erlang , Matlab , and Processing .
For the sake of grouping and presenting this information in a more readable format , we have classified the categories for the languages in this way :
Category Category Unit Range 2006 Units 2007 Units Growth Major 100,000 - 250,000 1,183,713 1,173,444 ( 10,269 ) Mid-Major 65,000 – 99,999 453,596 441,739 ( 11,857 ) Mid-Minor 10,000 – 64,999 151,633 152,890 1,257 Minor 1000 – 9,999 63,084 77,482 14,398 Immaterial 1 – 999 5,825 4,392 ( 1,433 )
The tables that we are showing below will contain the following header :
* Major * U N I T S T I T L E S M A R K E T S H A R E 1 . Language 2 . 2006

The following table contains data for the Major languages .
As you can see , C# , Javascript and .net Languages ( books containing both C# and VB code ) were the only languages experiencing growth .
At the rate Java is declining , C# should overtake Java this year as the number one most purchased language category for books .
We are a bit surprised that PHP is down .
Maybe Javascript or Ruby / Rails are biting into this market .

Here are the top titles for the Major languages , and incidentally , the titles and order are the same whether you look at Units sold or Dollars generated :
Mid-Major Programming Languages — 65,000 - 99,000 units in 2007
You ’ll notice in the Mid-Major languages that Ruby and Actionscript are the two languages that are showing growth when you compare 2006 and 2007 .
Both ActionScript and Ruby achieved their growth by adding more titles to the list .
Remember that does not mean that more titles were published , but that more made it into our Top 3000 report from Bookscan .

Mid-Minor Programming Languages — 10,000 – 64,999 units in 2007
So the news in this category is that Python has swapped places with Perl as the leader of the category .
Perl had seven fewer titles make it into the Top 3000 while Python saw and additional 8 make the list .
Powershell came out of nowhere and surpassed all the other groupings to make this list .

Minor Programming Languages — 1,000 – 9,999 units in 2007
So the news in this category is that Groovy came out of nowhere and moved quickly up the charts .
SAS , and MATlab had nice growth .
Erlang , Processing and Nxt - G had no units in 2006 and each sold a nice quantity in 2007 .
Remeber from above , this is the language grouping that grew the most in 2007 .
More than 14 k units were produced by this grouping in 2007 versus 2006 .

The noticeable trend with the Immaterial languages is the decline of DirectX and positive growth of F# and Alice .
Here are the top titles for the Immaterial languages .
Lastly , the following languages were Inactive for 2007 .
That means they did not sell enough units to make it into any weekly Top 3000 report .
And here is the list : labview , lingo , ml , mumps , net languages , oopic , opl , pascal , pda languages , pl / 1 , qbasic , rexx , s , smalltalk , spark , squeak , unrealscript , windows script .
So this concludes the Languages view of the State of the Computer Book Market .
We hope you enjoyed it .
Pay attention to this space , as we will be publishing this information twice a year .
Now that we have all the queries , spreadsheets , pivot - tables and systems down , we should be able to update these posts much more easily going forward .
If you have anything you would like explored a bit more thoroughly , please leave a comment here and we will see what we can do .
Will you say one day , " I Should Have Done Something When I Could ? "
Time is running out faster than most people realize .
If you 're reading this essay on rense.com , a similar website or via email , you are probably already aware of this fact .
But this essay is n't intended to preach to the choir .
My intention is to provide something useful to share with your friends and families who need help understanding .
It is intended to help them to understand that what they see and hear is engineered , controlled and filtered courtesy of Uncle Sam .
That spell cast upon them needs to be broken , just as your spell was broken some time ago .
Some twenty years ago , a friend of mine nearing retirement came to our home to help convert it from propane to natural gas .
We worked hard and long together that day , cutting , threading and running larger iron pipe in the basement to finish the conversion .
When he was finished I asked what I owed him .
His kind answer was , " Nothing .
Just pass it on . "
His message was clear and unmistakable .
Today , I pass on to you what I can as well .
All the facts are out there in plain sight .
It seemed to be the right time to connect a few of the dots and assemble some key concepts into one document , to help others see the light of truth .
Consider what grass - roots efforts have accomplished in the past .
Pressure from several grass - roots movements were responsible for ending the endless Vietnam War and causing Richard Nixon to step down as a result of ordering the bugging at Watergate .
And in recent times , it was a grass - roots effort which exposed the " rendering " of prisoners by intelligence services to other countries for torture and so - called " questioning . "
Exposure of the highly illegal and un-American process of rendering began with a journalist taking photos of unmarked planes through a fence , which he observed landing at a closed airbase overseas .
That grass - roots movement took off from there and the rest is history . [ 2 ]
A 100 YEAR WAR YIELDS GREAT BENEFITS
The world anti-terror war will last 100 years , which everyone was told in 2001 in a presidential address .
Does anyone question how a president could know it will last 100 years ?
When America helped allies fight the Germans and America fought the Japanese , no one announced how long those wars would last , at least not publicly .
Could it be that the reason this fake war on terror will last 100 years , is because it 's PLANNED to last 100 years ?
A century long war is a great blessing for defense industry revenue .
Before the attacks of 2001 , defense industries were dying .
World War 2 was a massive , complex conflict which involved all the countries of Europe yet it only lasted about four years .
The war with Iraq has lasted far longer , and still is n't over yet even though it was declared a victory several years ago .
Does anyone ever ask themselves why this conflict rages on , and who gains from it ?
COVERED FACES OF TERRORISTS
Why is it that whenever terrorists are shown in the media their faces are always covered ?
The government and media constantly tell us these men are proud to die for their religion .
If so , then why would these men cover their faces with black ski masks ?
Can anyone even BUY a black ski mask in a DESERT country ?
Why do n't they use a cooler material in the 120 degree heat they can see through ?
Yet these proud men who supposedly will kill themselves for Allah never give their full names .
They make blurry videos in the age of DVDs ( with auto - focus cameras ? ) when standing over some innocent man who supposedly is about to be killed .
Experts examining the videos stated the man in the chair was already dead .
Since these killers are completely anonymous , how could any government from any country retaliate against their families if these men are unknown individuals ?
It makes no sense and defies logic .
Could it actually be that their faces are hidden because the world would find out they are really American or allied intelligence agents , and not Arabs ?
If one looks closely at the build of these men in these videos , they do n't appear to be of Arab origin .
Many have tree - trunk necks and jar heads like those of Navy Seals .
PROOF OF DESTROYING AMERICA BY DESIGN
Could the government stop terrorists from invading America ?
Uncle has constantly insured that America 's borders remain leakier than a rotted Three Stooges row - boat .
Uncle is virtually playing the part of Curly by drilling holes in the bottom to let the water out .
Uncle also made sure that Mexican Border agents had their automatic weapons taken away , and these firearms were replaced by semi-automatics .
Now word has been circulating that now these weapons may be taken away .
Why disarm or under -arm border agents charged to protect America ?
The answer is a simple one :
It greatly reduces their ability to both defend themselves and be able to disable or kill those shooting at them that cross the border illegally .
How can they properly defend the border from those shooting at them from Mexico , which has already happened and taken the lives of border agents ?
Yet Mexican drug smugglers already have used automatic weapons against border agents .
So why was this madness ordered and to what end ?
The president WANTS illegal aliens in America no matter what he says to the contrary .
It 's clearly part of the bigger plan to destroy America from within .
Illegal aliens bring sickness , crime and a large burden on the health care and financial systems .
Emergency rooms within 100 miles of the border have been closed because of the financial drain .
How many hard working , honest American farmers and ranchers along the border have died because emergency help was too far away , thanks to the closed emergency rooms ?
We may never know that answer .
There can be no other reason for encouraging illegal aliens to come into America other than to destroy it .
The sick message is clear that border agents , farmers and ranchers are expendable , but illegal aliens and drug smugglers are not .
INTERNAL SECURITY - AMERICA BY THE NUMBERS America is a land of considerable size which is impossible to completely protect from within .
Here are a few facts from uncle 's CIA fact book : AREA : Total : 9,826,630 sq km Land : 9,161,923 sq km Water : 664,707 sq km AREA COMPARATIVE : About half the size of Russia ; about three - tenths the size of Africa ; about half the size of South America ( or slightly larger than Brazil ) ; slightly larger thanChina ; more than twice the size of the European Union .
LAND BOUNDARIES : Total : 12,034 km Border countries : Canada 8,893 km ( including 2,477 km with Alaska ) , Mexico 3,141 km Note : US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba is leased by the US and is part of Cuba ; the base boundary is 28 km COASTLINE : 19,924 km
We see here it 's bigger than one might think , at more than 9.8 MILLION square kilometers with more than 19,000 kilometers of coastline .
How could anyone even remotely believe the government can protect it ?
Can we imagine trying to spread the entire combined defense force of approximately 750,000 men and women over 9.8 MILLION square kilometers to protect America ?
DO TERRORISTS REALLY EXIST ?
Let 's look at a simple example of the invasion of America by these supposed terrorists using extremely conservative numbers .
Since the self - inflicted wound in 2001 , approximately 2,430 days have passed as of this writing .
If an average of only 50 terrorists came across the Mexican border during each 24 hour period from Sept. 2001 to the date of this writing in May 2008 , there would be approximately 121,500 terrorists in America right now .
( 50 per day x 2,430 days = 121,500 . )
Yet hundreds to several thousand illegal aliens from several countries , including Afghanistan , are already known have crossed the Mexican border into the American desert EACH day according to the government announcements over the years .
But only a tiny percentage of illegal aliens are captured , and an even smaller number of them are actually prosecuted and deported .
The biggest problem with many of these illegal aliens is crime , not terrorism .
Has anyone ever asked WHY nothing else has been blown up or destroyed in America since 2001 if there are as many terrorists running loose as we 've been told ?
So for discussion purposes , let 's assume that there are " terrorists everywhere in America " as we 've been told repeatedly by the president .
Why have n't ANY of them attacked in the past seven years ?
In one of my earlier essays I predicted ongoing attacks would NOT happen and that the passage of time would prove this theory was true .
Did I use a crystal ball ?
Remote viewing ?
Inside information ?
Not at all .
It was obvious shortly after 2001 that what happened on that September day was both permitted and designed to happen .
America simply attacked itself on purpose with the help of a bold , power - mad president .
The Islamic people are the equivalent a fall guy who takes the blame , willingly or not .
My best guess is that the next new attack will be staged in time to negate any November election .
It will be intended to keep the current president in office indefinitely , when America is put under martial law .
But if he declares martial law , he MUST have the military support him .
And that 's highly doubtful at this point .
The real question is ­ how long could he remain in office before being forced out ?
Remember the television broadcast in 2001 showing the president sitting in a classroom , being told about the planes crashing into buildings ?
He just sat there and did n't really care .
Any other president would be surprised and shocked by this , and would have jumped out of his seat and left the room .
But this president did nothing because he expected the attack to happen .
Still do n't believe that he knew about it before hand or that he was a part of it ?
Consider the CIA announcement that the intelligence agency was running drills of crashing planes into buildings on that very morning .
This too is a fact , but it was dismissed by the agency merely as a " coincidence . "
So what are the odds of this event happening in real life on the very same day of a drill for this ?
What can we conclude from simple logic about these invisible terrorists constantly referred to by the president in almost every speech as being everywhere ­ repeatedly for the past SEVEN years ?
They simply do n't exist .
Are you angry yet ?
PICTURES OF WTC ATTACKERS IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS
This is yet another issue which bears close examination .
When America was " attacked " newspaper front pages were plastered the next day with front page pictures of all the men responsible .
The east coast of America is in Eastern Standard Time .
This is the same time zone where the attack took place .
All the attacks took place mid-morning ­ yet in less than 12 hours east coast newspapers ALL had the photographs of the " terrorists " plastered on their front pages .
So what 's wrong with this picture ?
I 'll explain it .
All newspapers have copy deadlines for the next day 's issue around midnight or even sooner .
Metal plates for the presses have to be created , mounted on the presses and all the newspapers printed .
All this takes place nationwide during the early morning hours , with most newspapers distributed to newsstands before dawn for people to purchase or read before going to work .
WHO has the ability to supply photo - ready images to all the newspapers in less than 12 hours to meet press time ?
Only the government could do this .
Since the government already knew who all these men were ­ WHY did n't it stop them first ?
Because they were pre-assigned to be fall guys for that day .
And even worse , many of them have been found around the world still alive ­ even after they all died on the four crashed planes .
ELECTRICITY EVERYWHERE ­ ALL UNPROTECTED
There are more than a million utility and telephone poles scattered across America .
Here are some public statistics from just one famous utility company known as Con - Ed , unedited from the company 's website .
This is the same electric company that supplies power to New York City : UNDERGROUND UTILITY STRUCTURE 94,000 miles of cable 264,000 manholes and service boxes 35,000 underground transformers OVERHEAD UTILITY STRUCTURE 36,500 miles of cable 207,500 utility poles 47,000 overhead transformers
The above infrastructure is required for just ONE utility company to supply one major city .
A very large percentage of utility poles and transmission towers are located in rural areas across America .
High tension power lines across 9,161,923 sq km supply power for major cities .
Yet not one single utility pole has ever been destroyed by a " terrorist , " even though ALL of them are unguarded across thousands of miles of desert , mountains , prairies and forests .
Get the idea yet ?
This is what I meant in the beginning , when I said the facts are all in plain sight .
It 's clear from this simple example that this phantom terrorist enemy being omnipresent simply cannot be real , nor can we realistically protect the electrical infrastructure from anything or anyone .
The government can't stop a tornado or hurricane from leveling utility poles en masse , any more than it can stop someone with a chain saw .
I have recently learned that patients who are on oxygen cannot fly on planes with their portable cylinders , and airlines will no longer supply oxygen to these patients .
Yet chainsaws are not banned or controlled .
At least not yet at the time of this writing .
When the war with Iraq was being promoted because of phantom WMDs ( like a used car salesman selling a car without an engine ) the American people were promised Iraq 's oil , almost like the " spoils of war . "
Have the American people seen any of that oil ?
Or pumped a drop of gasoline or diesel fuel made from it into their vehicles ?
Apparently not , but other foreign oil companies were given control of the oil fields .
Yet people everywhere are paying over $ 4.00 / gallon for gasoline .
These are the rewards reaped for listening to a pathological liar and doing nothing about it .
Yet it seems few have learned anything from this to date .
If you are an American as I am , do you feel cheated and lied to yet ?
If not , are you actually breathing ?
We have barely scratched the surface .
Already the highest ranking generals in the pentagon have resigned , refusing to promote and play the president 's power grab game .
Several generals have threatened to resign together if Iran is attacked .
Why ?
Because these honorable men know lies about Iran when they hear them , and do n't want to go down in history as helping WW3 reach the nuclear level .
Would you ?
A PLANE LOADED FOR A NUCLEAR ATTACK
There was the USAF plane with nuclear weapons mounted under the wings which flew north to south across the entire continental USA from the North Dakota to Louisiana .
It is a serious violation to fly a plane loaded with wing - mounted nuclear weapons over American soil .
Yet this was called an " accident . "
This accident could have turned into a nuclear attack , but still no one in the media talks about it anymore .
The story disappeared off media radar right after the USAF promised to investigate it .
But it was NO accident as we shall see .
The late airman Todd Blue who took his own life for as yet unknown reasons was connected to this event .
He worked at Minot Airbase in North Dakota where the aircraft originated .
This is also the location where the nuclear weapons involved in this " accident " were stored .
Barksdale airbase in Louisiana where the plane landed is a logistical location for equipment materiel headed for the mid-east .
Fortunately , REAL patriots in the USAF prevented that aircraft from continuing on to the mid-east .
It could have become the mid-east equivalent of the Enola Gay ­ the name of the airplane which dropped the first nuclear bomb on Japan .
It requires a presidential order to move and mount nuclear weapons under the wings of any aircraft .
There are numerous safety and ordinance officers that must sign for nuclear devices at every step as they are moved from storage to the wings .
ONLY an order from the president can authorize mounting nuclear weapons under the wings of an aircraft .
All nuclear weapons are kept under guard in a high security area .
Can anyone believe that USAF career officers , men and women , all of whom were psychologically tested for their jobs - decided to risk their careers , retirement pensions and prison time in a futile attempt to start a nuclear attack ?
Utter nonsense .
The pentagon announced that about 200 personnel were involved in this event and that a " thorough investigation would take place . "
Men and women who would do this intentionally without a presidential order , clearly would have known that after the plane had taken off and completed its flight to Barksdale , that additional officers participating in this madness would also have to take the same risks and lose their careers , retirement pensions and prison time .
These men and women cannot be held accountable for following orders .
Are we also to believe the pilot , co-pilot and crew of the plane would take all the same risks with their lives and careers needlessly in a futile effort to start a nuclear war ?
Everyone involved in such an idiotic scheme would face military courts actions .
Are you angry yet at the lie of blaming numerous officers and airmen for what happened , instead of the president who ORDERED these weapons mounted under the wings of a bomber ?
This presidential order designed to start a nuclear attack and subsequent war without the authorization of Congress ( which could never be obtained legally ) is an impeachable offense , and it's almost a certainty that you 'll never hear any more information about this event ever again .
SIGNS OF A PRESIDENT WHO FEARS THE PEOPLE
Make no mistake ­ all dictators ( or those masquerading as presidents ) secretly fear what the people will do to them when they 've finally had enough .
History around the world illustrates this .
When the " decider " comes to any city today , interstate highways are cleared and closed in both directions for as many miles as required to and from the airport to his location for the duration of his visit .
Police are stationed at the top and bottom of every entry and exit ramp to the highway .
This is a fact .
Of course , it does n't matter what inconvenience this causes people going to / from work during rush hour .
Or patients with a heart attack that can die in an ambulance , as they travel a long circuitous route through heavy traffic to the hospital .
When you see this kind of control happen to a highway , you can sense the fear by the government of what the masses might do to him .
In past years when previous presidents came to town , presidents truly loved to see the American people everywhere they went .
And they were loved by the people as well .
Compare president Kennedy and other presidential visits to the ultra - tight security we have today .
Now only carefully pre-approved , metal detector scanned pro-president audience members are allowed within blocks of the president .
These people are also required to have special tickets or passes to just to see him , and only a select few are allowed to shake his hand .
Does this sound like a president who has the people 's love and respect ?
Or does this sound more like a president who is afraid of the people ?
Consider how we proved earlier that the concept of terrorists everywhere cannot possibly be true and of course , the government already knows this .
That only leaves the people themselves for the president to be afraid of .
If the decider wanted ordinary citizens near him , he could order the Secret Service to allow it .
The Secret Service works for him , he does not work for them .
But he does not want people near him .
So why is this ?
Secretly , he 's probably scared as hell when out in public about what might happen to him .
Consider all he 's done to help destroy America with lost lives , lost jobs , lost homes , brutal fuel and heating costs and other damage is it any wonder he 's scared ?
He continues to perform like the crazed employee who burns down the building of the only job in town .
Forget about dogs ­ this president really does bite the hand that feeds him .
This decider has been working hard every day to destroy America , while refusing to give any real aid or relief to the American people over the past seven years .
What good is a paltry " economic stimulus check " when it can't begin to cover the cost of living ?
If you lived on half an acre in a cardboard box , today a $ 1200 economic stimulus check would n't even pay the property taxes .
And according to experts , these checks are really nothing more than a loan for which uncle will want it all back , probably including hidden interest .
Watch and see what happens to your taxes next year .
No wonder the decider is afraid of the people .
WHY EVERYONE CAN AND MUST HELP
These are but a few examples of a power mad dictatorship and only scratch the surface .
I could go on and on , but these examples should be more than enough to get anyone who still loves American and FREEDOM thinking .
How many will be mournfully pining to themselves one day , " I should have done something when I could . "
Especially when they watch friends , children , grandchildren and family suffer even more than they are now .
Did you ever think in your wildest dreams you would be paying more than $ 4.00 a gallon for gasoline in 2008 ?
Experts are saying it could reach up to $ 10.00 a gallon , and stay that way .
China is driving up the demand , causing a permanent price increase for the world to pay for .
Remember the grass - roots movements which forced ending of the Vietnam War , Richard Nixon to resign and the exposure of rendering prisoners for illegal torture .
If you think that you can't do something that will help end this madness then you 're just not thinking .
I 'm not suggesting anything for you to do .
What you do is up to you .
When a self - appointed decider is performing actions that threaten the very existence of America , it wo n't be the efforts of any one person that will force change .
It requires the efforts of thousands or millions of people .
This is what causes great worry to those in power .
Keep in mind that for everyone working in government from building janitors to the president , it 's still a JOB and a source of income .
They do n't want to lose that job , any more than you want to lose your job .
Rats do n't like the light of day no matter what hole they live in .
We have the light of day on our side .
Why become one of the guilty who , in the end because of inaction , must bow their head in shame and say , " I should have done something when I could . "
America has reached a point where there is nothing to lose from action and everything to gain .
When the remaining freedom is gone , so will ALL life as we live it today .
It will never be the same again , no matter how much blood is shed or how many gallons of tears .
There will be no turning back .
If everyone continues to sit idly by , web - pages , writings and essays such as this one will suddenly become forbidden material .
Even reading or having writings like this in your computer will become a crime .
Anything a citizen does in the name of freedom at that point in the future , will cause them to be considered an enemy of the state .
Great patriots of our time like Keith Olberman will disappear overnight from the media .
Who in their right mind wants that to sit idly by and wait for this to happen ?
To do nothing is to support tyranny .
Who would want that on their conscious ?
If you have n't read the Patriot Act yet , you owe it to yourself do so .
It will astound you at the length and breadth of it .
How could such a draconian 1,200 + page document be ready for signing by Congress just a few days after 9 - 11 ?
At 9:30 at night ?
Clearly , the Patriot Act document was already set to be rammed down Congress ' throat during the planning of the WTC event - just like the photographs which were quickly distributed to newspapers showing the world exactly who all the " terrorists " are that did the attack .
You see , time DOES prove all things .
And as we have seen with newspapers , timing reveals many things as well .
Here a small sample from the 2001 Patriot Act table of contents ­ an Act clearly useful against patriots whenever so desired by the government .
Parts of the Act have already been shot down in court when challenged .
Sec. 201 . Authority to intercept wire , oral , and electronic communications relating to terrorism .
Sec. 202 .
Authority to intercept wire , oral , and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses .
Sec. 203 . Authority to share criminal investigative information .
Sec. 204 .
Clarification of intelligence exceptions from limitations on interception and disclosure of wire , oral , and electronic communications .
Sec. 205 . Employment of translators by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Sec. 206 .
Roving surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 .
Sec. 207 . Duration of FISA surveillance of non-United States persons who are agents of a foreign power .
Sec. 208 . Designation of judges .
Sec. 209 .
Seizure of voice - mail messages pursuant to warrants .
Sec. 210 . Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications .
Sec. 211. Clarification of scope .
Sec. 212 . Emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb .
Sec. 213 . Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant .
Sec. 214 .
Pen register and trap and trace authority under FISA .
Sec. 215 . Access to records and other items under the Foreign Intelligence Surveil - lance Act. Sec. 216 .
Modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices Sec. 217 .
Interception of computer trespasser communications .
This is only a portion of the Section 2 table of contents .
There are NINE other sections to it .
Realistically , we may never have the entire
Act repealed .
Politics is often about compromise to get things done .
But we can work toward having the more serious incursions on our freedoms repealed , and those that remain more tightly limited in scope .
Exposure of it to the public is a good start .
You can bet that very few Americans have read it , and have depended on mainstream media to review it for them .
This is yet another big mistake .
Could anyone after reading everything presented here still look forward to bowing their head in shame and say , " I should have done something when I could ? "
Remember ­ all or part of ANY act can be REPEALED , and it will require sufficient pressure exerted by the people .
( See [ 1 ] for the link to the actual text on a government website . )
Even Richard Nixon stepped down as a result of public pressure .
Contrary to what government and media may want you to think , the American public still exerts considerable power on governmental actions .
Congressman and senators often perceive silence from the public as acceptance , or even as a sign the public is condoning their actions .
The biggest subliminal lie promoted by the media is to give you the impression that you are powerless .
This lie is engineered to keep you from trying to do anything at all .
Is this the kind of America you want to pass on to your children , grandchildren , descendants and friends ?
To allow our countrymen to be afraid of terrorists who do n't even exist ­ except at the highest levels of government ?
To bow your head one day , and say " I should have done something when I could . "
What will YOU do about it ?

A one hour documentary about a journalist exposing the rendering process aired on Link TV , on May 18 , 2008 .
Corporations have traditionally considered taxes a painful but necessary cost of doing business .
But this view has changed , says Harvard Business School professor Mihir A. Desai .
With the advent of sophisticated tax shelters , global tax - reduction opportunities , and high - priced finance experts focused on the issue , corporations are turning the tax function into a profit center , says Desai , an expert on international corporate and public finance .
In this e-mail interview , he discusses new ways businesses are looking to shrink their tax obligations , how the commonly accepted dual - book system may ultimately harm shareholders , and the role boards of directors play in making sure their companies stay within the rules .
Ann Cullen :
How has the way corporations view taxation changed ?
Mihir A. Desai :
There is growing evidence that the tax function within corporations has shifted from being a compliance function to being a profit center .
The ratio of corporate taxes to GDP declined through the late 1990s even during an economic expansion .
There has been a growing disconnect between the income reports to capital markets and tax authorities ( a byproduct of the dual - book system where firms characterize profits to tax authorities and capital markets separately ) .
There is also much anecdotal evidence on the profusion of tax shelters and compensation incentives for managing effective tax rates .
Managers appear to have become more attuned to the possibilities of creating profits by minimizing tax obligations .
Q : You mentioned the dual - book system .
Why are firms allowed to report their profits in two different ways to capital markets and tax authorities ?
A : It is a curious system .
Imagine if you were allowed to report income to the IRS in one way and on your mortgage application in another way .
You might , in a moment of weakness , depict your situation in a particularly favorable light to your prospective lender and make yourself look worse off to the IRS .
Indeed , you might end up with two completely different pictures of your economic situation that would serve your best interests .
With the growing globalization of firms and the growth of these discretionary opportunities , the dual - book system is clouding the true picture of how firms are actually performing .
Of course , you do n't have this opportunity , and for good reason .
Your lender can rest assured that the 1040 they review in deciding whether you deserve a mortgage would not overstate your earnings , given your desire to minimize taxes .
Similarly , tax authorities can rely on the use of tax forms for other purposes to limit the degree of income understatement , given your need for capital .
In that sense , the uniformity with which you are forced to characterize your economic situation provides a natural limit on opportunistic behavior that serves the interests of prospective lenders and tax authorities .
This uniformity may even benefit you if it makes both reports more credible and eliminates doubts about your income .
While individuals do not have this opportunity , corporations do .
Historically , accounting treatments deviated to allow for differential accounting of expenses .
In the process , policymakers get a policy tool without distorting the way in which income is reported to capital markets .
For example , depreciation schedules for investment can be different for tax and accounting purposes , creating a tool for fiscal stimulus .
I think this rationale has outlived its usefulness for several reasons .
For starters , these different definitions of such expenses no longer account for much of the difference between book and tax income , and yet this disparity has been growing .
Other factors such as the peculiar accounting treatment of stock option compensation and differential treatment of overseas income , subsidiary income , and pension obligations account for some of this disparity , and a large portion remains unaccounted for but is consistent with tax sheltering .
Moreover , investment lives have shortened considerably , removing much of the power of accelerated schedules .
With the growing globalization of firms and the growth of these discretionary opportunities , the dual - book system is clouding the true picture of how firms are actually performing .
As such , enforcing uniformity could reduce uncertainty over the level of true profits thereby furthering the interests of unsure investors , tax authorities , and firms .
Q : What is driving this change in the way managers view corporate taxes ?
A : I think several factors are at work .
First , financial engineering increasingly allows for cheap recharacterizations of income for tax and book purposes , making tax obligations easily disappear .
Second , the growing global reach of companies and falling costs of global transactions means that profits can be reallocated to lower - tax jurisdictions with a fair amount of ease .
Finally , changing patterns of incentive compensation have sharpened incentives to squeeze profits out of parts of the organization that were heretofore not profit centers .
Q : Is this necessarily a bad thing ?
Is n't this good news for shareholders ?
In other words , do n't lower corporate taxes just mean more profits for shareholders ?
A : You 're absolutely right to think that this could be viewed as a good thing .
Indeed , there are a variety of reasons to think of the corporate tax as distortionary , and reductions of that burden could be welcome .
Moreover , if shareholders are the recipients of all this value , then this would just be a transfer from tax authorities to shareholders .
Unfortunately , the evidence is more mixed on the degree to which shareholders benefit from these activities .
Countering the tempting logic that tax avoidance is good for shareholders is the fact that tax avoidance opportunities require obfuscation and , consequently , open the door to managerial opportunism .
Indeed , several high - profile cases of managerial opportunism including Enron , Tyco , and Dynegy had their genesis in tax - planning activities .
These activities , and the secrecy they demanded , became the cover for activities that were not in shareholders ' best interests .
Oversight of tax planning , much like accounting , can no longer be relegated to specialists within corporations .
There are other more systematic pieces of evidence that suggest that the link between reduced taxes and shareholder benefits is tenuous .
Specifically , my coauthors and I have examined a crackdown in tax enforcement in Russia that was accompanied by an increase in share prices of those companies subject to the crackdown .
In a setting where there 's plenty of scope for managerial diversion , having the state enforce its claim can be a wonderful thing for shareholders .
Similarly , tax avoidance in the United States is only valued fully for firms that are considered well - governed firms .
Some apparently tax - motivated transactions such as corporate inversions are often not greeted with a positive price reaction .
In short , the view that tax avoidance is simply a net transfer of value from the state to shareholders is complicated by the agency problem between shareholders and managers .
Q : How should CEOs and boards of directors respond to this changing environment ?
A : Because of increased activity by tax planners within corporations and the heightened attention to tax shelters by regulators , boards have to become attuned to what tax risks are being borne by shareholders .
Tax planning can be a legitimate , value - enhancing activity and , indeed , can be a competitive necessity .
But tax planning can also cross the line into activity that is costly to shareholders .
Creating the right incentives within organizations and ensuring transparency for these activities is critical .
Oversight of tax planning , much like accounting , can no longer be relegated to specialists within corporations , given the risks that it entails .
Q : If both shareholders and tax authorities are potentially worse off from all this activity , what should be done about this more generally ?
While firms are forced to do some minimal reconciliation of their tax reports and capital market reports , these reconciliations provide very limited detail ( in tax forms ) or are completely opaque to even the most nuanced analysts — take a look at the tax footnotes of any major corporation .
As such , a minimal solution would be the clarification and elaboration of these differences in public documents .
More generally , a wholesale revisiting of the rationale for departing from conformity in the reporting of book and tax income seems long overdue .
Given that financial report accounting has evolved over the years while tax accounting remains quite primitive , conformity on financial reporting definitions would seem to make sense .
This change could prevent a variety of tax shelters , as managers seldom undertake tax shelters when they reduce book profits .
This possibility does raise some concerns that capital market profit reporting will be driven by tax considerations .
This concern has to be weighed against the gains in reduced compliance costs ( firms would no longer have to file hundreds or thousands of returns ) that are currently sizable , reductions in tax sheltering , and reduced opportunities for managerial manipulation created by book - tax differences .
Simple calculations also indicate that book - tax conformity could reduce tax rates considerably , as a 15 percent tax on book - pretax profits ( just for public companies ) would provide the same amount of corporate tax revenues being collected today .
Most radically , these trends provide another reason to revisit the rationale for a corporate tax more generally .
The corporate tax is hard to like , as it facilitates an additional layer of taxation on savings .
If , in addition , the evasion of these taxes is widespread and this evasion is linked to managerial malfeasance , it is even harder to rationalize such a tax .
Surprise !
If you are a regular reader of Cockeyed.com , you know that I 've been completely obsessed with the Eyeclops bionic eye camera toy , and that I 've pretty much taken a close look at everything I can get my hands on .
So , alphabetically , following Velcro and Yarn I now present a very close look at Ziplock plastic bag closures .
Unfortunately , I did n't actually have any Ziploc brand bags on hand , so I used a generic version from Target and a GLAD version , with the catchy " GLAD food storage bags " name .
I 'm also a fan of the crazy - sized Uline plastic bags .
As you may know , Ziploc bags can have either a single zipper , or a double - zipper .
Here is a view of the cross section of a single zipper closure .
With the Eyeclops , we get a closeup of the cross section .
This could be called the female side of the closure .
Ka-bam !
LOCKED !
With a well - aimed snap , the other half pushes in and is caught by the meat hooks on the other side .
Now , the two halves are locked together strongly .
Only a strong pull , ( such as jealousy or drug addiction ) can pull them apart when they are locked together like this .
Here is a slightly different angle , to remind you that this connection happens along a long C - shaped channel which is ( somehow ) fused to the plastic bag .
Same view , connected with the opposite channel .
Here is a look at a cross-section of the " double zipper seal " which is used in most larger food storage bags .
Open .
And sealed .
The " double " seal is more robust , but it does n't actually have more connection hooks .
The " male " side of the single zipper seal is split , creating two independent hooks from one mushroom - cap shaft .
This connection is a little bit too large for the extreme magnification of the eyeclops .
I could n't fit the whole thing onto my screen at once .
Here is a photo of half of the connection .
Under the high - powered magnification of the Eyeclops , I started to notice some new features of these re-sealable bags .
These features are visible to the naked eye , I just had n't noticed them before .
At the top of the bags are two long ridges , which I call the " edge grip " .
This ridge helps fat fingers find and grip the edges of the plastic bag .
The " edge grip " is very important .
It is fused to ( or extruded with ) the plastic film of the bag in the same way as the ziplock mechanism , and it is almost as important as the seal itself .
This probably sounds crazy .
You should decide for yourself .
Buy some lunch meat or cheese in a re-sealable bag .
These " cut-once , re-seal many " bags usually leave out the edge grip strips , creating a bag mouth which is much more difficult to re-open than regular ziplock bags .
In fact , I 'll bet that the invention of the Ziplock bag closure was a side - innovation , discovered while figuring out another problem :
How to make the mouths of plastic bags easier to open .
I also noticed a textured area surrounding the seals , making the plastic easier to grip .
The GLAD Brand food bags use two colors for the different sides of their seal , creating a miniature Men 's Wearhouse logo .
They introduced their bags years ago with a " yellow and blue makes green , its sealed ! " marketing campaign .
Up close , with the view of the Eyeclops , the tiny hooks and peaks are a little ragged .
This might have happened when I cut across the seal with scissors to see the cross section .
Is this seal watertight ?
Mostly .
In this view , water would have to try to flow from left to right , past two hook lock channels .
Here is a view of one of the edge grips .
Man , those tiny things do a big job .
I literally can not think of a smaller handle which is used by human hands .
The clear film for these bags is 1.6 mils thick , which you can see here on edge .
Finally , the sliding zip lock zipper bag .
When I first noticed this type of ziplock bag , I figured it was for people with poor dexterity , like Yeti and half - orcs .
They are definitely the most expensive , sold in boxes of just 15 .
Here is a cross-section view of the seal .
At this level of magnification , it looks like a solid connection .
The connecion is made by dragging this red zipper across the bag opening .
Here is an inside view .
It is a lot like a regular zipper , complete with alignment guides .
This is the view of the bag seal magnified by 200 times .
The connection is an incredibly tight handshake between the two channels .
This looks like a waterproof seal !
For the reasonably healthy who know what they are looking for , ehealthinsurance .com got fairly good reviews .
The site , which has the feel of an Expedia or Orbitz for purchasing health insurance , allows you to compare a variety of policies offered through about 70 insurance providers .
One caveat , pointed out by several readers , is that ehealthinsurance .com does not serve consumers in all states .
Rhode Island , Vermont , Massachusetts , Maine and North Dakota are excluded .
The company also covers only individuals .
So if your company has employees , you will need to explore other options , like starting a group if your state permits that .
Another possibility for consultants and independent workers is the Freelancers Union , which won consistently good reviews in the reader comments .
But the union also has some limitations .
It operates in only 30 states , and you have to work in one of the industries or occupations it serves .
While healthy business owners have to incur high costs and navigate a maze of choices , the truly unhealthy face the biggest challenges .
To learn more about options for those whose health is getting in the way of their self - employment , I spoke with Ms. Jaff , the woman who directed me to healthinsuranceinfo.
net .
Ms. Jaff , a lawyer who has worked on legal issues surrounding health care in both the public and private sector , now runs Advocacy for Patients With Chronic Illness ( advocacyforpatients.org ) , a nonprofit organization in Farmington , Conn. , that advises and advocates on behalf of the chronically ill .
She says she works with about 1,000 patients a year , handling everything from battles to get insurance companies to pay for treatments prescribed by patients ’ doctors to helping people figure out the best coverage .
Ms. Jaff speaks from experience .
She suffers from Crohn ’s disease , a condition so severe that she does not leave her house during flare - ups except to get to a doctor ’s appointment or to the hospital .
She wanted to find something she could do out of her home and as she went through the challenge of finding her own health insurance , she discovered what she calls “ a community of patients in desperate need of help . ”
Ms. Jaff qualified for the Municipal Employees Health Insurance Program , offered by Connecticut to cover small - business owners as part of a plan for state employees .
She knew about the plan , which she recommends to all small - business owners in Connecticut , from her days as a lawyer in the attorney general ’s office .
Even with her extensive experience , Ms. Jaff has not been able to find the holy grail  good coverage at a great price .
When she started on this insurance , her premium was $ 400 a month .
Last year , the monthly payment went up to $ 800 .
“ I do n’t know if people who do n’t have chronic illnesses can really understand this , ” she said .
“ But I have worked full time my entire adult life  generally 15 to 18 hours a day .
I have paid into the system for all those years .
And there is only one thing that could bankrupt me , and it is my health .
I could lose every penny I own from one serious hospitalization without insurance .
So I chose the plan that would give me the most possible coverage because the year I do n’t is going to be the year I get really sick . ”

Why are we asking this now ?
Because the US motor giant Ford has just sold two of the proudest names in the British car industry – Jaguar and Land Rover – to Tata of India .
Some 16,000 jobs are at stake .
Given India 's relatively low cost base and rapidly expanding market for vehicles , there is naturally some concern about the future of the marques .
The worry is that Tata could do what the Chinese car companies Shanghai Automotive and Nanjing did to MG Rover and simply seize control of the intellectual rights to the designs and brands and move production eastwards .
An Indian rather than a Chinese take - away , perhaps .
However , that is a worst - case scenario – the future could be a lot brighter .
Do we still make cars in Britain ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yes , lots .
Production last year was just over 1.5 million , just off its recent high of 1.6 million and below the all - time peak of almost 2 million reached in 1972 , but still way up on the dark days of the late 1970s and early 1980s .
British cars are now better value and sell more abroad .
What will happen to Jaguar / Land Rover ?
In the short - term , very little .
Production will continue and Ford will continue to supply engines and other components to the companies .
In the medium - term , the chances are that production of the more basic Land Rover models will migrate to India .
The principal candidate for relocation would be Land Rover 's Defender – beloved of the British Army .
The potential for this vehicle in emerging markets is huge .
However , that would leave most of the more sophisticated designs , such as the highly profitable Range Rover , in Britain .
In the long - term , a small Jaguar might be built in India , with the more lucrative , more expensive models still made here .
Such a strategy might yield impressive global results .
Is the Jaguar an endangered species ?
Last year , Land Rover built 232,548 cars and made a profit , although not a huge one .
Jaguar is different and much depends on new models the company is developing .
Jaguar simply does not sell enough cars to justify its present production capacity and pretensions – and that is fundamentally why it loses money .
Having made 54,000 cars last year , it is a tiddler by global standards and small even for a premium marque .
It is dwarfed by BMW , Mercedes - Benz and Lexus and is about half the size of also - rans such as Saab or Alfa Romeo – in other words barely viable .
It desperately needs to improve sales .
In the recent past , it suffered from too many " retro " designs which , although elegant and superbly engineered , looked a bit fuddy - duddy .
Until recently , there was also few diesel options – a major handicap in the European market .
That is now being rectified with the release of the more modern - looking XF saloon .
Any replacement for the large XJ limousine and smaller X - Type model , if there is one , will have to be similarly avant garde .
Jaguar and Land Rover will also have to catch up with the Germans and Japanese in advanced engineering – not least in developing greener diesel , hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies .
Jaguar was also plagued , as it has been on and off since the mid-1970s , by quality and reliability issues .
Americans once joked that they bought their Jags in pairs : one to drive while the other was in the garage .
Quality has improved vastly in recent years , but it takes a long time to rebuild reputations .
Land Rover has been just as bad but somehow seems to have escaped the stigma , and is also moving up the customer satisfaction tables .
Are British jobs safe ?
The unions seem cautiously optimistic but many analysts think that Jaguar / Land Rover has one too many car plants .
Its Halewood factory on Merseyside is probably safe because it is more efficient than the Solihull ( Land Rover ) or Castle Bromwich ( Jaguar ) sites .
Jaguar closed its main plant at Browns Lane , Coventry , in 2005 , so its costs are lower than they used to be .
Can Tata do it ?
The family - owned Tata conglomerate is a massive and well capitalised company into everything from information technology consultancy to Tetley Tea .
More relevantly , it owns the Anglo - Dutch steel company Corus and its own automotive division , which recently unveiled the Tata Nano – India 's car for the masses .
If all goes well , Tata will invest in the Jaguar and Land Rover brands and reap rewards which eluded Ford , thereby securing British jobs .
In return , Tata will learn much about the premium and executive car markets it is desperate to enter .
Who owns Britain 's car industry ?
A collection of Japanese , German , American and now Indian based transnationals .
With the demise of MG Rover in 2005 , the last remotely serious volume manufacturer was lost to the nation .
Most of our surviving famous names are in the hands of " foreigners " – Mini and Rolls - Royce are subsidiaries of BMW , Bentley is in the loving care of Volkswagen , Vauxhall is still owned by General Motors of the US and Ford retains engine and van-making operations in Britain .
The biggest growth in the British car industry has come from the Japanese brands .
Margaret Thatcher opened Nissan 's plant in Sunderland more than 20 years ago and it is still one of the most efficient in Europe .
The company is the UK 's biggest car manufacturer .
Toyota and Honda are also significant players and Tata will hope to emulate the successes of all three .
Even the Malaysian company Proton owns a slice of our heritage , in the sporty shape of Lotus , while Nanjing Automotive of China is promising the return of small - scale MG sports car production to Longbridge in Birmingham .
The Russians own LDV Vans – a vestige of the old British Leyland .
Only specialist manufacturers such as Morgan and Bristol can be said to be British in the traditional sense .
Does the UK industry have a future ?

Yes .
Nissan , ( 353,718 cars ) , Toyota ( 277,852 cars ) and Honda ( 237,772 cars ) have proved that Britain can make competitive products in large numbers .
They have taken up the slack from the end of car - making at historic sites such as Longbridge , Ryton , Dagenham and Luton ( although Morris Motors ' old factory at Cowley , Oxford , is happily churning out record numbers of new Minis ) .
GM will build the next generation Astra at the Vauxhall factory at Ellesmere Port , while commercial vehicle production – especially vans , is at a high .
At the other end of the spectrum , Bentley is making 10,000 cars in Crewe this year , while Rolls - Royce will build 1,000 at Goodwood in West Sussex .
Aston Martin , recently sold by Ford to private investors , is another winning marque .
Apart from Italy , no other nation is so successful at producing luxury cars .
Hopefully , Jaguar and Land Rover will continue to make their presence felt as well .
Is the British car manufacturing industry safe for the time being ?
Yes ...
* We still make more than 1.5 million cars each year in Britain , the same level of production seen in the mid-1970s .

Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Marvin Harrison 's agent says reports that Harrison is under investigation in his hometown of Philadelphia in connection with a shooting this week are untrue .
A shooting took place Tuesday near Harrison 's North Philadelphia bar , a source told Anthony Gargano of Philadelphia 's WIP Radio .
Harrison 's agent , Tom Condon , told ESPN's Chris Mortensen on Friday : " I 've spoken with Marvin and I 've spoken with his attorney , and they say the reports are erroneous .
Marvin was not involved in any shooting , and he is not the subject of this investigation . "
Condon declined to answer any other questions .
Harrison was interviewed by police about the shooting , Philadelphia Police Lt. Frank Vanore said .
Harrison has not been arrested or charged .
" He was interviewed , " Vanore said Friday .
" Why he was interviewed , that is all part of the investigation .
No one is a suspect . "
A source told the Philadelphia Daily News that Harrison , during an interview with police , later admitted to being in a fistfight on Tuesday , but the Colts receiver said he was n't involved in the shooting .
According to ESPN 's Sal Paolantonio , the case will be taken over by Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham .
Paolantonio also reports that the case is now on the back burner as police searched for bank robbery suspects who killed a police officer in North Philadelphia this weekend .
After the first day of Colts rookie minicamp on Friday , Indianapolis coach Tony Dungy said he knew little more than had been reported .
" My phone has been ringing , too , but I do n't have any details , " Dungy said .
" I really do n't have any more information than you do . "
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Friday the league was " aware of the report , and we are looking into it . "
But even the most financially stressed of Greenwich homeowners have generally been able to ward off actually losing their homes .
RealtyTrac data shows that owners of seven homes received notices of default last month , and another home is about to be auctioned in this town where the average single family home that sold this year went for $ 3.1 million .
The owners of all of them had received notices of pending litigation but were still hoping to rescue their positions .
In the last 30 days , none of the three Greenwich properties listed for auction were actually sold .
As millions across the nation face the threat of losing their homes , the few Greenwich owners in trouble are tapping into other resources that most people cannot call upon to help prevent the ultimate indignity .
In Greenwich , foreclosure filings were made against 100 homes last year , according to RealtyTrac .
That translates into less than half of 1 percent of Greenwich ’s 24,511 households , compared with a rate higher than 1 percent nationwide .
Already one of the richest cities in the country in 2000 , when the Census Bureau recorded a median household income of $ 99,086  more than double the national average  the town has become far wealthier in recent years , with the exponential growth of many of the hedge funds that have set up business here .
A new generation of wealthy Wall Street executives has moved in as well .
By 2007 , the Connecticut Economic Resources Center reported , the median household income had risen to $ 122,849 , with many homeowners earning far more .
The tearing down of existing homes to make room for new ones has continued despite the mortgage crisis that began last summer .
And while prices and sales volume are dropping , Greenwich is not suffering as badly as nearby towns .
Through April 23 this year , 160 co-ops , condos and single - family homes sold for $ 290,000 to $ 30 million .
That compares with 240 sales , from $ 385,000 to $ 12 million , for the period in 2007 , according to the Greenwich Multiple Listing Service .
Several Valley residents reported seeing strange red lights in the sky on Monday night and the cause of the lights remains a mystery .
Arizona Republic reporter Anne Ryman , who lives in Deer Valley , reported seeing four lights in a square shape that eventually became a triangular shape .
The lights were moving to the east and they disappeared one by one .
She said the lights were visible for about 13 minutes at about 8 p.m..
One north Phoenix resident , who wished to remain anonymous , said he saw four or five red lights lined up in a straight line and spaced apart evenly .
The lights slowly moved east and became dimmer as the witness watched .
He said the last light remained in the sky the longest .
Then three jets came from the west and traveled in the direction of the red lights .
An official from Luke Air Force Base stated that they did not have any aircraft in the sky Monday night and that the lights were not part of any Air Force activities .
The Deer Valley airport officials said that the lights were not from any aircraft at that airport .
Ian Gregor , a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said that air traffic controllers at Sky Harbor Airport also witnessed the lights , but they do not know the cause .
The incident is similar to the " Phoenix Lights " seen on March 13 , 1997 .
Thousands of residents reported seeing a mile - wide , v-shaped formation of lights over the Valley .
In that case the lights appeared about 7:30 p.m. and lasted until 10:30 p.m .
How Can I Forget Lhasa , March 14 ?
The following is a translation of a blog post ( published at ifeng on March 18 , 2008 ) written by a Shenzhen girl working in a eyeglass store in Lhasa .
[ in translation ]
Today is March 18 and our company resumed business .
According to the rotation schedule , I am on the late shift today beginning at 1 pm .
But based upon my awareness of the overall situation outside , I decided to proceed two hours earlier so that I can get off work two hours earlier .
I wanted to make sure that I can catch a bus instead of hurting my wallet with taxi fare .
My plan may be perfect , but reality did not oblige .
I waited for one hour before the bus came .
Since I wanted people to be safe and the criminals be apprehended soon , I had no complaints about the inspections being made by the armed police .
I would never say nasty words against the hardworking and responsible armed police for that lost hour .
On the contrary , the sight of them patrolling the streets of Lhasa makes us ordinary citizens feel safer .
One - and - a- half hours later , I walked into the store .
When my colleagues saw me , they asked about what happened to me .
I am somewhat unusual because I did not stay in the group dormitory .
Instead , I live in a family hotel near the Sera Monastery .
In my district , the mobile telephones were not working .
One can call the fixed - line telephones , but one can not call out .
On the afternoon of March 14 , I had fled back home .
Since my colleagues could not contact me , they were all worried about me .
Fortunately , my rotten luck was not that bad and I arrived home safely .
So now I told them about my experiences on March 14 .
On March 14 , I was on the late shift too .
At past noon , I took the public bus along North Ling Khor Road .
At the intersection 50 meters in front of the Ramoche Monastery , I spotted from the bus a dozen police officers and several dozen civilians .
My immediate reaction was that there was a curfew at the Ramoche Monastery .
I got off at the People 's Hospital stop more than four hundred meters down the street .
I entered our store and I said : " Curfew over at Ramoche Monastery ! "
At the time , my colleagues did not pay too much attention .
They said that there might have been some incident .
I was uneasy .
The clients came and went .
By the time for lunch , it was already 1:45 pm .
The office for my company was situated even closer to the Ramoche Monastery .
From afar , I could see my office colleagues gathered outside the front door watching the disturbance on the street outside the Ramoche Monastery .
A colleague said that a Han female clutching a bag in hand had sprinted down the street and entered our dental clinic .
She sat down on the sofa and started to cry emotionally .
She said that over at the Ramoche Monastery , the Tibetans were assaulting all Han people and the buses have stopped running .
I ate one bite and I spotted two Tibetan young men escorting a third Tibetan young man with a bleeding face past our entrance and entering the 120 facility across the street .
We knew that things have gone worse down there , but we firmly believed that nothing major would happen .
After lunch , a father and a daughter came in to purchase eyeglasses .
The girl is a high school student at Lhasa Middle School , and the father is an official at the Tibet Department of Health .
While they were picking through the eyeglasses , the colleagues from the dental department next door stood in front of the store to discuss the violent incident .
I had to keep the clients company and then periodically sneak out quickly to take a look .
Each time , I saw that the mob was getting closer to us .
Smoke was rising from the direction of Barkhor Street , and it was frightening .
I asked the father and the daughter whether they were scared and they said no .
The daughter said that only a couple of people died , so there was nothing to be afraid of .
The father who is an official said that they wo n't be able to start anything and there was nothing to be afraid of since he had gone through 1989 .
But those words could not alleviate my uneasiness .
By around 3 pm , the girl finally finished her eyesight test and she left immediately in order to go back to school .
Her father stayed behind while the eyeglasses were being prepared .
By this time , my colleagues have pulled down the rolling gate on the side entrance and they even pulled down the rolling gate on the front entrance halfway .
My heart was pounding .
I made out the invoice and I received the money .
The colleagues from the various departments were still standing outside to watch .
About 15 minutes later , the client departed .
We immediately packed up , closed down the store and went to the company office .
By the time I got outside , the disturbance had reached the intersection between North Lin Khor Road and Youth Road .
The smoke was getting thicker .
Coming at us were the crowds from the Wenzhou Commercial Center ( facing North Lin Khor Road near the Ramoche Monastery ) and Youth Road looking for safety .
I weaved my way through the running crowd .
Before I reached the office entrance , I heard someone call out to me .
I stopped and looked .
It was the 17 - year - old Tibetan girl staying at the same family hotel as I do .
She is lovely , capable , gentle , vegetarian and loves to laugh .
As soon as we saw each other , we hugged together .
The young girl said : " Sister , this is very scary !
I am very scared ! "
Although I am a few years older than her , I have never seen any disturbances before -- the dense smoke was rolling in , the sirens of the ambulances were s creeching and people were rushing past me .
Fewer than ten meters away , several dozen Tibetan young men were throwing rocks , shouting and cursing .
People were screaming and shouting everywhere .
It was frightening .
I brought the young girl to our office and let her stay with my colleagues .
Then I went out to the neighboring Tibetan Architectural Design Institute and used my mobile camphone to take photos of the disturbance on Youth Road .
A new American - style fast food restaurant named Dicos had just opened up this year on Youth Road .
Several dozen Tibetan youth regarded that this was their main target .
Of course , they were not going to spare the stores around it either .
They threw rocks and applied force continuously .
Behind them , the police tried to stop them without much effect .
When the police approached , the several dozen persons would run towards the Institute of Architectural Design while screaming .
The spectators in front of the Institute of Architectural Design would run too .
It was very chaotic .
Once the police retreated , the several dozen Tibetan youth returned to continue what they were doing .
I took some photos and then I went back to the office .
The gate of the office was shut and I did not see the young Tibetan girl .
I started to yell out her name .
Half a minute later , the rolling gate opened by half a meter and the young girl slipped out .
My colleagues and the boss lady were peering outside .
They advised me not to return to where I was staying and to stay with them at the office instead .
But under these circumstances , there was no place more reassuring than one 's nest .
So I decide to go back home with the young girl .
By this time , traffic was restricted on North Lin Khor Road from the intersection with the Fukang Hospital .
No vehicles except for 120 ambulances , the District People 's Hospital ambulances and certain government vehicles were allowed to enter the section of North Lin Khor Road and Youth Road .
We were unable to find a public bus or taxi .
Traffic restrictions were also imposed on the section of Niangre Road towards Beijing Middle Road .
But the section from South Niangre Road to the Second Ring Road and the western section of the North Lin Khor Road were smooth running with some military vehicles going into the area of disturbance .
Due to the fear of assault by Tibetans , I put on a surgical mask .
I walked with the young girl to the vicinity of Xuexin Village where we got on a minibus .
There were only Tibetans on the bus , and I remembered what the young girl told me on the way walking over .
She said that near the Ramoche Monastery , the rioting Tibetan young men were attacking any Han person that they came across -- they rushed over and attacked with knives , rocks and sticks while chanting : " Kill him !
Kill him ! "
I was anxious for a dozen minutes or so until several Han persons got on the bus .
Then I relaxed a little .
A few more Tibetan persons got on afterwards .
A Han young man yielded his seat to a Tibetan old man .
At that moment , I felt that Han and Tibetan people do not have to behave like what was happening in front of the Ramoche Monastery .
The minibus did not take us directly to where I live .
We got off at the Sacred City Garden on East Zaji Road and we turned into North Sera Road .
It took 15 to 20 minutes to walk home .
By that time , the stores near Sacred City Garden Road on North Sera Road were all closed even though this was very far from the scene of the disturbances .
There were very few pedestrians around .
At the intersection from Middle Cisongtang Road to the Sera Monastery , armed police officers were present .
The atmosphere felt as if war had broken out .
We entered our neighborhood and the normally friendly Tibetan security guards ( including a cousin of the young girl ) told the young girl sternly in Tibetan : " How can you come back in the company of a Han person ?
Are n't you afraid of getting beaten up ? "
The young girl was scared and did not respond .
We got back to the hotel and it was quiet and calm as if nothing has happened outside .
We went up to the roof and we saw that the heavy smoke had covered half the sky in Lhasa .
The young girl told me that the Tibetans were setting fire to the stores around the Ramoche Monastery , even those that still had people inside .
They were also throwing rocks at the Han people and the police , they used knives to slash people and they beat them with sticks .
The young girl must have been scared .
She had a lost , uncomprehending look with a tint of sadness .
But above all , she could not believe that this was happening .
That night , the landlord went out to pick up someone .
He told me that the street on which our store was located was vandalized , and there were two burned out motorcycles in front of our store .
At the time , I was glad that I had returned earlier or else something bad might have happened .
He told me that Youth Road , the Wenzhou Commercial City , Beijing Middle Road , Beijing East Road , Chomsyikhand and Barkhor Street were all but unrecognizable .
At the time , I kept thinking and thinking , but I could not imagine just how they could be unrecognizable .
My father called me that night .
He said that he watched the Hong Kong news report about the trouble in Lhasa and he wanted me to take care .
Based upon my understanding of my father , the news report probably did not indicate that this was so serious and that was why he did not call me immediately .
I did not know what the situation was like outside , I did not know how my colleagues were and I did not know how my friends were doing .
I stayed inside the hotel for two whole days without stepping outside .
Fortunately , my landlord sometimes went out to check out the situation and let us know what was going on .
The little girl was becoming increasingly worried as more and more news came in .
The brilliant Tibetan smile did not appear at all .
On one occasion , she sought out my embrace and said with teary eyes :
" Sister , I am so scared ! "
I asked her : " What are you scared of ?
Are you scared that since you are with us , you will be assaulted by your own Tibetan people ? "
She shook her head and said in a low voice : " No . "
" So what are you afraid of ?
Are you afraid that the police might arrest you ?
Afraid that we Han people will assault you ? "
" No . "
She lifted he head and replied with sad eyes : " I am afraid for my Tibetan friends .
I do n't know what is happening to them .
I heard that many people have been arrested .
I have a friend who went to vandalize some stores .
He has been arrested .
Sister , what can be done ?
I am so scared ! "
Then her eyes became even redder .
If I had been younger , I would be holding her head and crying together .
We cannot change how things are , we are worried about our friends and we do n't know what is happening .
This is when we feel very vulnerable .
But I ultimately did not cry .
I did my best to talk to her in a fair and balanced manner based upon what I know , so that she can understand that what happened was not the fault of any one person , and whoever did wrong will have to take responsibility for their actions .
March 17 .
I heard that the situation has finally become stable .
The buses were running again .
I could no longer suppress my need to look at the world outside , so I went out .
As soon as I got out of the neighborhood , I saw a dozen military vehicles at the intersection of the Sera Monastery .
There were armed police officers checking people in each direction .
I showed them my ID and they inspected my handbag .
Amidst their thanks for my cooperation , I used my mobile telephone to take a photo of them .
Before I even put my hand down , an armed police officer told me not to move .
He came over to check what I took .
Somewhere in the back on the other side of the street , a senior officer in a military vehicle called out to bring me over there .
I did not know what to do .
There were so many police officers there that there was no way that I can resist .
So I asked the police officer carefully , " You are not going to arrest me ? "
The police officer smiled and comforted me : " No , do n't worry . "
I breathed a sigh of relief and I was more composed .
I stood in front of the senior officer .
He took a look at me first and then he turned on the mobile telephone to see what was inside .
He asked me how many photos I have taken and why I was taking them .
He said that he was going to delete the photos .
He warned me not to take photos with my mobile phone .
What was I going to say in front of him except to agree ?
Ten minutes later , all was okay !
I was a good citizen .
There was no problem and I was released !
I must thank the armed police officer for not locking me up .
I continued to wait at the bus stop for a bus to go to my company .
This time , I waited for more than half an hour .
The bus continued on the route .
The police hospital at East Zaji Road had many armed police officers around as if it were an important military base .
The next intersection also had many armed police officers there .
By this time , the mobile telephone was receiving signals .
We passed the Second Ring Road and I saw many militia police officers .
Then we reached South Sera Road where I occasionally spotted burnt out motorcycles and bicycles .
By this time , I had the feeling that I was entering a disaster area .
We entered North Lin Khor Road .
A green armored vehicle was parked at the entrance of the police station .
There were armed policemen at the intersection to the Ramoche Monastery .
The stores across the Ramoche Monastery were unrecognizable because all that was left were blackened rubble .
The Anqi Pharmacy at the Wenzhou Commercial City was covered up with red - white - blue canvas .
It was supposed to have been vandalized and set on fire .
This is the place where I had worked for more than half a month and I got acquainted with many Tibetan friends .
But it was now a wasteland .
Further down , we reached the intersection with Youth Road .
It was shocking to see the 120 Dermatology Clinic and the eight stores adjoining it all reduced to charred rubble .
Smoke was still rising with the terrible smell of burning rubber .
I cannot imagine that these were the clothing stores that I used to see every day .
Some of these stores had just opened up this year .
I closed my eyes and I did not look .
I got off the bus and I inspected the stores that belonged to my company .
Apart from the smashed office sign and a ripped wall poster , nothing was damaged .
The stores nearby were not so lucky .
One of them had the display window smashed .
Another store was broken into and completely trashed .
Many of the second - floor windows of the stores were also broken .
I stood in front of the Institute of Architectural Design and I took out the mobile telephone to call my family .
I told my grandfather happily , " I am safe . "
But suddenly there was a loud sound of a gun shot at the intersection with Youth Road less than 10 meters away .
I jumped , and my grandfather was also scared by the situation .
He asked if I was coming back .
I am stubborn .
If I am the type to be scared to leave on account of a disturbance , I would not have chosen to come to Lhasa where I did not know anyone .
To put it another way , when I decided to come to Lhasa , I had already thought about the various possibilities .
So I gave my grandfather an answer that was disappointing to him .
I told him not to worry and I hung up the telephone .
From a taxi across the street , my Tibetan friend waved at me and asked me to go and drink tea .
I went through the spot where the gunshot occurred and got into the taxi .
I thought that I would be the same way with my Tibetan friends as before and not changed as a result of March 14 .
But as I sat in the Tibetan sweet tea house , I realized that everything has changed .
The Tibetan service workers ignored the Han people completely and they only chatted with their Tibetan friends .
Even worse , the Tibetans were swapping rumors and lies that completely distorted the facts .
It was absurd that anyone can believe these bare - faced lies and regard them as the truth .
The reason why they believe that these were the facts is very simply that the tellers were Tibetans !
They said ,
If you can't trust a Tibetan , who can you trust ?
In any case , as long as it is a Tibetan , they you must help him no matter what the rights or wrongs of the matter are !
Among their beliefs , there are no rights or wrongs and there is only ethnicity !
There was no way for us to communicate !
My Tibetan friend dined with her Tibetan friends .
After they ordered , my friend raised some doubt about those slurs against the Han people .
Her friend stood up and yelled at her : " Are you Tibetan ?
How can you help out the Han ? "
Then she walked out .
Later , after her other Tibetan friends , I went to drink tea with her .
But before I even took a sip , she uttered a slur about the Han people .
I was so angry that I imitated her friend : I stood up and walked out .
Among my beliefs , the most important thing is about knowing the rights and wrongs , which is completely different from the Tibetan belief that their ethnicity is the most important thing .
I felt that there was no need to debate with them anymore .
Saying anything more would only end in a shouting match .
I chose to leave so that we can cool down .
At the time , I really did not want to say another word to her even though we used to be able to tell each other everything !
I really cannot believe that someone like her who has received higher education and traveled all around the country can still hold such narrow - minded views !
I cannot believe that their perceptions and judgments are circumscribed completely within the words " Tibetan people " while willing to ignore what they have personally seen or heard !
I was saddened , I was pained , I was immensely angry !
I was even more angry than having been inexplicably cursed out with foul language by the Tibetan conductor that I know on the bus this afternoon !
All my confidence in thinking that the Han and Tibetan people can never reach this stage has evaporated .
I walked down the street expressionlessly .
I thought about all those deaths that I heard about .
I remembered the devastation at the places that I usually visited .
I wanted to cry out aloud : " Where is justice ?
Where is fairness ?
Where is the law ? "
What is kind - heartedness ?
What is morality ?
What is warm - heartedness ?
What is intimacy ?
What is justice ?
What is fairness ?
Ha ha , they are all dog 's fart !
Yesterday Tibet TV and Lhasa TV showed how people were doused with gasoline and burned to death , Hui children coming out of school had their ears cut off and set on fire , the shops of Han and Hui people were vandalized and set on fire , the banks were vandalized , the schools were vandalized , the hotels were vandalized , the many places that the Han , Tibetan and Hui people lived were destroyed along with our peaceful and happy lives .
Is this the so - called beautiful and sacred Tibet ?
Is this how the Tibetans treat life ?
These lamas would normally not even want to step on an ant , but they now show their indifferent and cruel faces .
What can we say ?
What can we do ?
I cannot believe that in the face of these ironclad facts that they can still say without blinking their eyes , " The owners burned down their own stores , the injured inflicted wounds on themselves and everything was a frame - up ! "
I wish that this was just a dream .
I did not really see the blackened rubble , I did not hear about the deaths and I did not know anything .
I was just dreaming all that .
When I wake up , everything will be the same as before .
I can still sit down with my Tibetan friends in the sweet tea house to chat and joke .
I can still walk around with my backpack at Barkor Street , Chomsyikhand , Youth Road ...
Sleep then .
When I wake up , none of this will have happened .
But when I came to work today , everything was just like in the dream .
All the inner calm was just a façade ; all the smiles were repressed pains ; all the numbness is just the irretrievably lost memories of the once beautiful Lhasa ; all the indifference is just the sorrow of never being able to look at Lhasa in the same way again ; all the light winds and clouds are the grimness at the thought that the Hans and Tibetans can never go back again .
I really did not want to come out and go to work .
I did not want to face everything after March 14 .
But coming back after the trauma , the delight in seeing colleagues again is still stronger than the other emotions .
So I had to tell them how I made it back to my place .
I had to tell them how I spent the days when I was supposed to stay indoors .
I had to thank my colleagues for their concern when they could not contact me .
I had to hear what happened to them too .
My colleagues did not dare to come home on March 14 , so they hid in the warehouse of the Institute of Architectural Design .
Men and women slept there with the wares without daring to utter a word in case those crazy Tibetan young men hear them and use violence .
One of my colleagues made a harrowing escape from knife - wielding Tibetan young men .
Another colleague went back to the dormitory on a bicycle , and received two strong slaps in the face .
An employee at the Institute of Architectural Design was stabbed by a Tibetan who charged into the place .
Those colleagues not staying at the company dormitory returned to their rented place and banded with the other Han people to form their own defense team .
They armed themselves with kitchen knives , metal pipes , rocks and wooden sticks and guarded their home .
They passed through the days and nights nervously .
The Chomsyikhand wholesale market where we went to buy daily items for the company was burned out and quite unrecognizable .
The Direct Line Eyeglass Company , which was our competitor , was burned to the point where not even the store sign was visible .
At the Yizun Clothing Store on Beijing Middle Road , several service workers were burned to death inside .
The Dicos restaurant at Barkhor Street was burned to the ground .
The Tianhai Night Market , which is the most famous night market in Lhasa , was burned to the ground .
The shops at the western suburb customs office were burned .
A Han man on the motorcycle was killed by rock - wielding rioters .
On the night of March 16 , the Hui people gathered together and attacked the Barkhor Street Tibetan area to take revenge against the Tibetans for burning their shops and mosques as well as cutting off the ears of Hui children .
The price of food in Lhasa was rising ; when Han and Tibetan people go to shop for stuff , the Han pays this much and the Tibetan pays that much , so that the Han are paying less .
How many carloads of people were sent to the hospital today ?
...
There was so much to talk about that we practically ran out of saliva .
By that time , it was 4:30 pm and the boss lady came over to say that there was trouble in the western suburbs and the Xuexin village .
Therefore , we were closing early .
So we closed shop and went home .
We were very , very nervous .
We said goodbye to each other with the sense that we may never see each other again .
Fortunately , I made it back to my place safely once more .
I will have to work tomorrow .
They said that things are fine and there wo n't be any trouble .
I wish .
But many things can no longer be as before , and I cannot say that everything is alright .
All those of us who lived through the March 14 disturbances will bear a psychological scar for the rest of our lives .
I cannot forgive those people !
I cannot forgive those criminals for destroying our homes , for destroying our lives , for destroying the brotherhood of Han and Tibetan , for destroying our trust , for destroying our ability to sit down chat at the sweet tea house and for destroying my tender love for Lhasa .
I think that my sorrow and chagrin right now is like that between the ' greens ' and ' blues ' in Taiwan .
I look around but I cannot find any neutralizing candy or pain - killing medicine .
The Cheetah is included on the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) list of vulnerable species .
AA amyloidosis is regarded as an increasingly important cause of mortality in captive cheetahs populations .
Cheetahs may get a lethal disease by eating the poop of their brethren .
This deadly ailment is similar to mad cow disease and Alzheimer 's — its cause is malformed proteins .
Keeping these felines from consuming their own droppings might help keep these rare cats alive in captivity .
Cheetahs are in danger of extinction .
One of the principal causes of death of these felines in zoos and sanctuaries is a disease known as AA amyloidosis — it has been found in as much as 70 percent of autopsied cheetahs in captivity .
Misfolded
Like Alzheimer 's and mad cow disease , AA amyloidosis results in clumps of proteins that are normally harmless , but have somehow become misfolded into something dangerous .
In Alzheimer 's and mad cow disease , the fibers of malformed protein — known as amyloid — are concentrated in the brain , but in AA amyloidosis , the amyloid clumps are primarily deposited in the spleen , liver and other organs .
" Severe deposition in the heart causes heart failure , " said researcher Keiichi Higuchi , a pathobiologist at Shinshu University in Asahi , Japan .
Little is known about how this disease is spread , but it seems as though its misshapen clumps might actually convert normal proteins into amyloid .
In this sense , it resembles mad cow disease in cattle , where abnormal versions of proteins known as prions can mutate their normal brethren .
Now Higuchi and his colleagues find that cheetahs might contract the disease from excrement .
It turns out their feces contain small , fragile amyloid fibers that proved highly effective at triggering AA amyloidosis in mice .
The researchers do not believe the cheetahs are intentionally consuming excrement .
Rather , " we speculate this may occur during mutual grooming — licking of fur contaminated by fecal matter , " Higuchi said .
Or soil contaminated with their poop could be capable of tainting both food and fur .
" We hope that we could suggest possible measures for rescuing cheetahs from extinction by preventing AA amyloidosis , such as removing feces as soon as possible , " Higuchi said .
The scientists detailed their findings online May 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Other possibilities
This disease might also conceivably spread through saliva or urine .
However , the cheetah " is a fierce and protected animal and it is dangerous and difficult for us to collect urine and saliva samples , " Higuchi said .
Last year , amyloidologist Alan Solomon at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and his colleagues found that foie gras — goose or duck liver — contaminated with amyloid could trigger AA amyloidosis in susceptible mice .
" So a number of amyloid diseases may be very similar to prion diseases , with the abnormal form of protein can serve as a seed , " said Solomon , who did not participate in this study .
" One thing we 're working on is a way to eliminate or prevent this disease process , an antibody that can recognize this amyloid and help destroy it . "
WASHINGTON  Lurita A. Doan has been forced out as head of the General Services Administration , the federal agency that oversees billions of dollars in contracts and manages thousands of government - owned buildings .
In a stormy two - year tenure as the agency ’s administrator , Ms. Doan was accused of improperly mixing government business with politics and of trying to steer government contracts to her friends .
Democrats in Congress said she violated the Hatch Act , which makes it illegal for government employees to take action that could influence an election .
Ms. Doan ’s resignation was requested by the White House on Tuesday and takes effect immediately , the agency said Wednesday .
Ms. Doan said in a statement , “ It has been a great privilege to serve our nation and a great president . ”
The agency said that its deputy administrator , David L. Bibb , a career employee , would take over , at least for the time being .

The goal is to have a house with the best design for the money , not necessarily the cheapest .
But you could easily add or subtract from this design to hit almost any budget .
If you are n’t interested in house plan designs , and most of you are n’t , I hope you are interested in the process of “ open design , ” where hordes of people essentially guide the design .
I started with a basic idea , and your comments have guided it .
Many of you complained about my two - story house plan .
Having recently injured my knee playing tennis ( not badly ) , I have a new level of sympathy for that view .
What follows is a single - level design , with an optional basement , based on your comments .
Click to enlarge .
Based on your comments , I put the laundry room near the center of the action part of the house , so you can watch the kids and prepare meals without traveling to laundry Siberia and back .
I even designed a rolltop window in the laundry room where you can do the ironing while facing out to the big screen TV .
Noise would n’t be that big of a deal if you soundproofed the walls and only opened the rolltop window when others were n’t around .
I retained the closets that open to bedrooms and to the laundry room .
This house makes doing laundry almost fun .
( And realistically , the person who does the laundry usually decides what house you live in . )
I moved the guest / kid bathroom to the end of the house .
No one wanted it anywhere near the kitchen or living area .
I added a front porch because those are relatively inexpensive , energy friendly , and provide lots of outdoor enjoyment .
This is the large and useful kind of porch , not the purely cosmetic type you see on new houses these days .
And it faces the primary sun direction to keep the home cool .
I kept the storage room concept adjacent to the main living area , and added a door from storage to the garage , based on comments .
This is the room that keeps all your party stuff , exercise equipment , holiday decorations , extra chairs and tables , and anything else you need to change the function of the living area on the fly .
If you are n’t sold on the storage room concept yet , and you have kids , imagine that it also contains what I call Toy Jail .
Anything that is n’t picked up by the kids gets thrown in a big box ( the Toy Jail ) in the storage room .
There is one dining area , casual enough for every day , but imagine it designed with a restaurant ambiance , so you would n’t be embarrassed entertaining friends there either .
And after dinner , the big screen comes down from the ceiling for a movie .
A home theater seems like an excess , but prices are dropping fast , and if it is included in the original design of the house , and you plan to use it a lot , it makes sense .
The front entrance is off the family room , with a mud room , and a small foyer that is business only .
Every inch of the home that gets heated or cooled is useful .
The Cat 's bathroom is in the master bathroom .
If you have allergic house guests , just lock the cat in the master bedroom and it has all it needs .
The home office is moved off toward the garage and kitchen side , and is on its own heating / cooling zone .
It 's close to the kitchen for convenience .
The optional basement steps are moved to near the entrance from the garage .
The game room is moved next to the family room , separated by a two - way fireplace .
All bedrooms have windows now .
Bathrooms reduced from five to two .
You could always add them back to bedrooms without changing the overall design too much .
The master bedroom got a retreat / sitting area just to square things off .
So there it is , the ultimate house , designed by you .
How ’s it look now ?
A decade before Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton admitted fudging the truth during the presidential campaign , federal prosecutors quietly assembled hundreds of pages of evidence suggesting she concealed information and misled a federal grand jury about her work for a failing Arkansas savings and loan at the heart of the Whitewater probe , according to once - secret documents that detail the internal debates over whether she should have faced criminal charges .
Ordinarily , such files containing grand jury evidence and prosecutors ’ deliberations are never made public .
But the estate of Sam Dash , a lifelong Democrat who served as the ethics adviser to Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr , donated his documents from the infamous 1990s investigation to the Library of Congress after his 2004 death , unwittingly injecting into the public domain much of the testimony and evidence gathered against Mrs. Clinton from former law partners , White House aides and other witnesses .
The documents , reviewed by The Washington Times , identify numerous instances in which prosecutors questioned Mrs. Clinton ’s honesty , an issue that continues to dog her on the campaign trail after she was forced to acknowledge earlier this year exaggerating a story about coming under sniper fire as first lady during a visit to Bosnia in 1996 .
For instance , the papers say prosecutors thought Mrs. Clinton first concealed her legal representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association — and the money she made doing it — during the 1992 presidential campaign when she and her husband , then - Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton , came under fire in a questionable Arkansas real estate project known as Whitewater .
Beginning in March 1992 and continuing over the next several years , Mrs. Clinton steadfastly denied that she ever “ earned a penny ” in representing her Rose Law Firm clients , including the failing thrift ’s owners , James and Susan McDougal — the Clintons ’ partners in the Whitewater Development Corp. project .
But the newly discovered records , more than 1,100 pages in 30 separate documents , tell a different story .
A June 1998 draft indictment of Mrs. Clinton ’s Rose firm partner Webster L. Hubbell , who followed the Clintons to Washington in 1993 as associate attorney general , said Mrs. Clinton did legal work for Madison “ continuously ” from April 1985 to July 1986 .
It also said she represented the thrift before the Arkansas Securities Department for approval to issue preferred stock , helped Madison obtain a questionable broker - dealer license to sell the stock and was actively involved in a failed Madison project known as Castle Grande .

The draft indictment clearly asserts that Mrs. Clinton , despite her denials , represented Madison and its projects “ in a series of real estate and financial transactions . ”
A separate 183 - page report included in the Dash documents said Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton “ concealed from federal investigators the true nature of their work ” with Madison and its various entities .
Clinton campaign spokesman Jay Carson disputed the allegations .
“ This is a baseless accusation which was looked into over a decade ago in an investigation that took $ 71.5 million and eight years to determine there was no case , ” he said .
But exit polls from Tuesday ’s North Carolina and Indiana primaries found that about half of the voters in each state said they did n’t find Mrs. Clinton “ honest and trustworthy . ”
Mrs. Clinton misspoke in March when she claimed she had come under sniper fire during a trip to Bosnia in 1996 .
She said she and her daughter , Chelsea , ran for cover under hostile fire shortly after her plane landed in Tuzla .
She later admitted to making a “ mistake . ”
The Library of Congress documents have not been released publicly .
A library official said they are still be “ processed . ”
In April 1998 , Whitewater prosecutors , divided over Mrs. Clinton ’s truthfulness , argued over whether to indict her on charges of lying under oath about her legal work for Madison .
Lawyers and others close to the probe said a draft indictment of the first lady became “ a work in progress ” after Mrs. Clinton ’s January 1996 grand jury appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington .
Prosecutors concluded at the time , the sources said , that she had testified falsely in denying doing legal work in the Castle Grande venture .
“ There is concern among some about how successful they might be in bringing a criminal indictment against Mrs. Clinton for obvious reasons , but there is no lack of desire to do so , ” one lawyer familiar with the probe said at the time .
The lawyer said the decision rested on two major points : whether there was sufficient evidence to contradict her sworn testimony and , more importantly , whether prosecutors could win the case in court .
No indictment was sought , but Whitewater prosecutors noted at the time , according to the Dash documents , that sworn statements by Mrs. Clinton were contradictory and misleading and that her involvement with Madison ”s failed real estate project known as Castle Grande project was only fully detailed with the discovery of her Rose firm billing record summaries in the White House living quarters in January 1996 — two years after they had been subpoenaed .
A week before the summaries were found , the Resolution Trust Corp. ( RTC ) said in a Dec. 28 , 1995 , report it had little information on Mrs. Clinton ’s ties to Madison or Castle Grande .
After their discovery , the agency concluded Mrs. Clinton was more involved with the two entities than was previously known .
The summaries said Mrs. Clinton billed Madison for 60 hours of legal work , spoke with Madison officials about the Castle Grande project on 14 occasions , discussed legal matters with Madison ’s owners — the McDougals — 16 times , had 28 meetings with Rose firm lawyers on Madison , and met with state regulators about Madison at least twice .
At the time , Madison was seeking help from Mrs. Clinton ’s Rose Law Firm in Little Rock to fend off state and federal regulators concerned that the thrift was insolvent .
Madison also wanted to jump - start a questionable preferred stock deal to pump much - needed cash into the operation and was desperate to keep the government from shutting it down .
In December 1995 , the Senate Whitewater Committee also made public handwritten notes of a telephone conversation that contradicted assertions made by Mrs. Clinton during the 1992 presidential race that she had little participation in the legal representation of Madison when state and federal regulators were deciding whether to shut it down .
The notes , by New York lawyer Susan Thomases , one of the first lady ’s closest advisers , said Mrs. Clinton had numerous conferences with officials at Madison , that she reviewed documents , that she made calls to discuss a preferred stock plan aimed at keeping the failing thrift afloat , and that “ she did all the billing . ”
The committee released 350 pages of Madison files that said Mrs. Clinton , according to the billing summaries , had made significant claims on the thrift for legal services , and at one point was listed exclusively as the billing attorney .
The summary is all that remains , since the original Rose firm billing records for Madison disappeared .
In May 1995 , as the Whitewater investigation expanded into separate probes by Senate and House committees , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) , the RTC and a federal grand jury , Mrs. Clinton denied in sworn affidavits any knowledge of a Madison real estate project known as Castle Grande , saying she had “ no recollection ” of doing legal work for the 1,050 - acre development .
Madison was closed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $ 70 million .
Castle Grande failed at a taxpayers ’ loss of $ 4 million .
Another major area of concern , authorities said , was an option agreement regulators said “ facilitated ” a questionable $ 300,000 payment to Seth Ward , the Madison official to whom Mrs. Clinton had spoken about Castle Grande .
The agreement was written by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell and guaranteed Mr. Ward a payoff and negated his liability in the project .
While the option was never exercised , it disguised the reason for the payment and created a paper trail to justify the outlay to Mr. Ward , who was Mr. Hubbell ’s father - in - law .
Mrs. Clinton told the RTC in May 1995 she had no memory of providing legal services for Mr. Ward and said in a sworn statement she did not know the Castle Grande name , thinking the project was called IDC even though the Castle Grande name was widely associated with the site .
Not truthful
According to the Dash documents on Whitewater , investigators also challenged Mrs. Clinton ’s public statements on what she knew at the time of Mr. Hubbell ’s March 1994 Justice Department resignation .
Mrs. Clinton told reporters she thought he quit over an “ internal billing dispute ” with his former Rose firm partners that “ likely would be resolved . ”
But the records said that three months before the resignation , Mrs. Clinton had been told by another Rose firm partner , Allen Bird , that Mr. Hubbell ’s “ billing problems were very serious ” and documents released during the Senate Whitewater hearings in 1996 said that two weeks before Mr. Hubbell resigned , Mrs. Clinton was notified formally that her former law partner was involved in a conflict - of - interest investigation and he might have lied in a sworn statement to federal regulators .
The Dash records also state that Mr. Hubbell ’s extensive role in a conflict in the Rose firm ’s representation of Madison and his testimony under oath to the RTC had meticulously been described in a March 1 , 1994 , memo written by White House Associate Counsel W. Neil Eggleston and forwarded to Mrs. Clinton by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes .
The records said Mr. Eggleston ’s seven - page memo described concerns by the RTC and the FDIC on whether the Rose firm had disclosed its prior legal representation of Madison in an FDIC lawsuit against the thrift ’s former auditors and whether Mr. Hubbell had disclosed his relationship with Mr. Ward in Castle Grande .
Mr. Eggleston ’s memo , according to the records , said the RTC had concluded the Rose firm disclosed neither the prior representation nor Mr. Hubbell ’s relationship , noting that an “ ultimate finding ” of nondisclosure would mean that “ Mr. Hubbell was not truthful in his recollection . ”
Mr. Eggleston said a finding against the firm would mean that it was “ permanently barred from any further work for the RTC or the FDIC ( and possibly other banking regulators . ) ”
He also said that while it was “ not clear ” whether the FDIC or the RTC would review the accusations under an actual conflict standard , there was the possibility of sanctions in the case , including “ criminal liability , ” the records said .
The records also said Whitewater investigators were concerned that Mrs. Clinton played a key role in helping Mr. Hubbell obtain consulting contracts after his March 14 , 1994 , Justice Department resignation .
In a report titled “ Hubbell Hush Money Summary , ” Whitewater investigators said that a day before Mr. Hubbell quit , Mrs. Clinton and other top administration officials met privately at the White House to arrange for him to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees at a time his cooperation in the Whitewater probe could have resulted in charges against the then - first lady .
The records said Mrs. Clinton took an active role in White House efforts to “ take care of ” Mr. Hubbell financially , helping to locate campaign supporters who divvied up more than $ 450,000 over the next nine months mostly for consulting work he never did .
In 1997 , Mr. Starr subpoenaed White House records to determine whether the consulting fees were intended to guarantee Mr. Hubbell ’s silence in the Whitewater probe .
Mr. Starr also wanted to know whether the White House had sought or directed the payments .
An Oct. 22 , 1998 , report said Mr. Hubbell ’s fees were arranged through “ high administration officials or advisors , ” including Mrs. Clinton , whom was described as “ the direct impetus for at least one client . ”
Others who helped were identified as White House Chief of Staff Thomas F. “ Mack ” McLarty ; former Democratic National Committee Chairman Truman Arnold ; Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan ; Small Business Administration Chairman Erskine Bowles , a former White House chief of staff ; and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , the Clinton - Gore campaign chairman in 1992 who later served as commerce secretary .
An April 21 , 1998 , report questioned why White House officials would choose to “ support Hubbell and take care of him ” at a time “ [ Mrs. Clinton ] was on notice that Hubbell engaged in a widespread pattern and practice of cheating the [ Rose Law Firm ] . ”
The report said a “ sinister reason ” could be Mr. Hubbell knew about Mrs. Clinton ’s role in doing legal work for Madison and other related companies .
A May 21 , 1997 , memo , noted that most of the company officials who paid him consulting fees said no work product was ever produced .
The report said one employer told investigators the only document Mr. Hubbell produced was “ his bill . ”
Mr. Hubbell pleaded guilty in December 1994 to mail fraud and income - tax evasion in the theft of $ 482,410 from his Rose firm clients and partners and failing to pay $ 143,747 in taxes .
He was sentenced to 21 months in prison , serving 16 before being released .
The Whitewater probe ended on March 21 , 2002 , when Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray , who succeeded Mr. Starr , concluded in a final report there was “ insufficient evidence ” to bring charges against the Clintons .
But the report also said statements by the Clintons to investigators were “ factually inaccurate ” and that White House delays in the production of evidence and the “ unmeritorious litigation ” by its lawyers “ severely impeded the investigation ’s progress . ”

The incomprehensibly self - defeating wastefulness and inefficiency of the legislatosaurus never ceases to depress me , but for once , America 's idiocracy has been outdumbed by a Russian government agency which has proposed one of the most breathtakingly inane policies that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing : mandatory registration of all WiFi devices .
According to Fontanka.ru , a Russian news source , the government agency responsible for regulating mass media , communications , and cultural protection has stated that users will have to register every WiFi- enabled device with the government and receive special permission in order to use the hardware .
The agency says that registration could take as long as ten days for standard devices like PDAs and laptops and that it intends to confiscate devices that are used without registration .
Users who wish to operate a wireless access point or WiFi- enabled home router are expected to go through an even more onerous process that will involve submitting documentation and obtaining a license .
In certain regions , like Moscow and St. Petersburg , users will also have to receive special approval from the Federal Security Service .
The policy , which was explained to Fontanka.ru by the Russian agency 's deputy director Vladimir Karpov , could reverse existing policies like a 2004 government panel decision to provide blanket permission for indoor wireless access point operation and a 2007 policy which allowed use of mobile WiFi devices without registration .
According to The Other Russia , which provides an overview of the Fontanka .ru article in English as well as some additional details , the Russian government agency which is responsible for issuing the new policy was created when the Russian media and telecommunications regulatory bodies were merged last year .
The policy would likely be impossible to enforce and some question whether the government agency even has the authority to enforce it .
WiFi technology is a powerful enabler of mobile connectivity and technological innovation .
If regulatory policies broadly erode the availability of connectivity , the results could be disastrous for Russia 's tech - savvy population .
The policy reflects an abysmal understanding of WiFi 's pervasiveness and utility and seems like arbitrary bureaucratic decision with no inherent purpose .
Perhaps in Russia , unregulated WiFi is one of those accoutrements of capitalist imperialism that must be opposed with vigorous shoe - banging and similarly vigorous legislative action .
Mandatory WiFi regulation could have a chilling effect on Russia 's IT industry
The Fontanka .ru article quotes an industry specialist who points out that the government agency behind the policy is run by a former metallurgic engineer who likely has no clue about many of the technical issues overseen by his organization .
In this respect , Russia has much in common with the US , where lack of relevant experience often seems to be a prerequisite for public office , especially when it comes to regulating the series of tubes that make up the interwebs .
EVEN more than tempting liquors like tequila , tobacco is a pleasure that the Old World wishes it had never taken from the New .
In 1492 , when Christopher Columbus was met by tribesmen with “ fruit , wooden spears and certain dried leaves which gave off a distinct fragrance ” , he threw the last gift away .
But his shipmates brought home the custom of sucking in the smoke , and the taste spread so rapidly that in 1604 King James I of England was prompted to issue a denunciation of the “ manifold abuses of this vile custome ” .
Vile indeed , but habit - forming and therefore lethally dangerous : it cuts short the lives of between a third and half of its practitioners .
According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , perhaps 100 m people died prematurely during the 20th century as a result of tobacco , making it the leading preventable cause of death and one of the top killers overall .
Another 1 billion more may die from it in this century if current trends continue unchecked .
In recent years smoking has been sharply restricted in some unlikely places .
In 2004 Ireland amazed the world by successfully imposing a tobacco ban on all workplaces ; and at the start of this year , France 's café culture suddenly went smoke - free .
The draconian curbs introduced by California in 1998 have been followed , at least in part , by well over half America 's states .
But the number of smokers in China , India and other developing countries is continuing to grow , as addiction spreads faster than information .
Hence the determination of almost everybody involved in global public health to escalate the war on smoking .
Over 150 countries have already ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , which requires countries to take a range of anti-smoking measures .
Last July negotiators agreed on international norms for banning smoking in public places .
Next week they meet in Geneva to discuss a protocol on tobacco smuggling .
In addition to new international rules , the WHO is pushing for aggressive policies at the national and local levels .
On February 7th Margaret Chan , the WHO 's director - general , and Michael Bloomberg , New York 's zealously anti-smoking mayor , were due to unveil the most comprehensive survey of tobacco use ever carried out .
The venue was fitting .
Tom Frieden , the city 's health commissioner , notes that the mayor 's efforts have reduced smoking among the adults in New York by 20 % and among teenagers in public schools by 50 % .
Mr Bloomberg 's private charity , which supports many anti-smoking efforts worldwide , also funded the global survey , known as MPOWER .
The study is “ a call to action to avoid a public - health catastrophe ” , says Douglas Bettcher , head of the Tobacco Free Initiative at the WHO .
The report lists the anti-smoking efforts of countries worldwide , offering benchmarks for aspiring reformers .
What the survey shows , says Dr Bettcher , is that most countries have yet to implement even those policies that are proven to work .
The WHO says countries must do six related things .
The first is to improve the quality of data on tobacco use .
The second is to impose sweeping Irish - style smoking bans ; only 5 % of the global population is now covered by such curbs .
The third is to intensify efforts to induce and assist smokers to drop the habit .
Only nine countries offer the kind of well - funded , accessible programmes of which the WHO approves .
Those ideas concern the existing users of tobacco ; another three are aimed at persuading people not to light up in the first place .
It may be hard to believe , but the WHO insists that most smokers still do not understand the full extent of the health risks .
It wants all countries to mandate large , grotesque pictorial warnings on cigarette packets .
Another policy proven to work ( in the handful of countries , representing 5 % of the world 's population , to have tried it ) is a complete ban on marketing .
The agency is adamant that “ partial bans on tobacco advertising , promotion and sponsorship do not work . ”
The final prescription offered by the WHO is also the most powerful one : higher taxes .
Studies show that raising tobacco taxes by a tenth may cause a 4 % drop in consumption in rich countries and an 8 % drop in poor ones , with tax revenue rising despite lower sales .
The agency wants a 70 % increase in the retail price of tobacco , which it says could prevent up to a quarter of all tobacco - related deaths worldwide .
The claim is that higher taxes not only bring in revenue to fund anti-smoking efforts ; they actually benefit the poor .
How come ?
A forthcoming paper by two scholars ( Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Botond Koszegi of the University of California ) notes that smokers face a familiar choice between short - term pleasure and a long - term desire to quit .
Tobacco taxes are an incentive to make the right choice , and because the poor are price - sensitive , they benefit the most .
Indeed , the authors calculate that in the United States , “ the monetary value of the health damage from a pack of cigarettes is over $ 35 for the average smoker , implying both that optimal taxes should be very large and that cigarette taxes are likely progressive . ”
The practical argument for action is simpler : the tobacco industry is getting the world 's poor hooked before governments can respond .
In recent years , as rich countries have clamped down on smoking , tobacco firms have shifted their focus to poorer places .
A study by Britain 's Bath University found that by using aggressive tactics , such as targeting women , international tobacco firms had helped to double smoking rates in Russia since 1991 .
The tobacco industry is regrouping in order to focus on “ promising ” markets and escape the pesky lawsuits it is likely to face in rich , litigious countries .
For example , Altria , a global tobacco concern based in the United States , plans to spin off Philip Morris International as a stand - alone foreign entity in late March .
China is now home to more than a quarter of the world 's smokers ; it will soon be manufacturing Marlboro cigarettes for Philip Morris , and the firm will be exporting Chinese tobacco to other countries .
At times , the strategy used by public - health campaigners may seem heavy - handed ; they retort that nothing else can work against a rich adversary .
Indeed , Dr Bettcher argues that just as mosquitoes convey malaria , Big Tobacco is the “ vector spreading this epidemic ” .
And eradicating tobacco may prove every bit as hard as fighting insect - borne disease .
These nine drawings were done by an artist under the influence of LSD – part of test conducted by the US government during it ’ s dalliance with psychotomimetic drugs in the late 1950s .
The artist was given a dose of LSD 25 and free access to an activity box full of crayons and pencils .
His subject is the medico that jabbed him .
^ First drawing is done 20 minutes after the first dose ( 50Âµg ) .
An attending doctor observes – Patient chooses to start drawing with charcoal .

The patient seems euphoric .
“ I can see you clearly , so clearly .
This … you … it ’ s all ..
I am having a little trouble controlling the pencil .

“ Outlines seem normal , but very vivid – everything is changing colour .
My hand must follow the bold sweep of the lines .
I feel as if my consciousness situated in the part of my body that ’ s now active – my hand .. my elbow .. my tongue . ”

Patient seems gripped by his pad of paper .
“ I am trying another drawing .
The outlines of the model are normal , but now those of my drawing are not .
The outline of my hand is going weird , too .
It ’s not a very good drawing , is it ?
I give – I ’ll try again … ”

What Causes Traffic Jams ?
You .
The next time a traffic jam materializes in front of you for no apparent reason , think about Japan .
That ’s where scientists have , for the first time , recreated “ shockwave ” traffic jams , in which one driver ’s slowing down creates a ripple effect that moves backwards through traffic , grinding everything to a halt for miles .
They say recreating the phenomenon successfully is the key to finding ways to defeat it .
Their experiment found that human error is a major cause of these most frustrating kinds of traffic jams ( there are , of course , other causes ) .
But if driver error is the source of the problem , do n’t drivers also have the solution ?
Clive Thompson points to one idea , the classic “ slow down and keep a constant speed ” method , which seems to be effective in breaking these shockwaves .
Any other solutions ?
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s capital has recorded its first death from an outbreak of hand , foot and mouth disease as authorities try to contain the spread of a potent virus just three months before the city hosts the Olympic Games .

Beijing Health Bureau spokeswoman Deng Xiaohong said a 13 - month - old boy from the city ’s northern Changping District died on the way to a hospital on Sunday .
Hubei province to the south also confirmed the death of a toddler from hand foot and mouth , taking the nationwide toll to 42 .
The spokeswoman said the child in Beijing had tested positive for enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) , a virus that has caused the majority of the deaths in the latest outbreak , which started weeks ago in the eastern province of Anhui ’s Fuyang city .
Deng also said another child had died of the disease in a Beijing hospital , but that case would be recorded in neighboring Hebei province , where the child contracted the disease .
No further details of that case were disclosed .
Hand , foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness , with a number of causes , but the current outbreak has been linked to the EV71 virus , which can cause a severe form of the disease , characterized by high fever , paralysis and meningitis .
There is no vaccine or antiviral agent available to treat or prevent EV71 .
Enteroviruses spread mostly through contact with infected blisters or faeces .
More than 27,500 cases have been reported in China as of last Friday , Xinhua said earlier , with the number of new cases in Anhui province starting to decline .
Other deaths have been reported in the Guangdong , Hainan and Guangxi regions .
Following the Anhui outbreak , China issued a nationwide alert , closing some kindergartens and sending officials to visit nurseries and primary schools to educate staff on hygiene and prevention .
At least two Beijing kindergartens were suspended last week after children showed symptoms of the disease , but a Health Ministry spokesman said then that the number of cases was not abnormal .
“ We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the Beijing Olympic Games , ” Mao Qunan , the ministry spokesman , said last week .
Before the latest cases , Chinese media also quoted Hans Troedsson , the China representative for the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , as saying he did not expect the disease to be a threat to the Olympics .
He said the WHO was providing technical advice and support to China .

My benchmark for usefulness was " Can a programming language be used to write complex , performance intensive video games ? "
After working through basic tutorials , and coming to grips with the lack of destructive updates , I started thinking about how to write trivial games , like Pac - Man or Defender , in a purely functional manner .
Then I realized that it was n't performance that was the issue , it was much more fundamental .
I had no idea how to structure the most trivial of games without using destructive updates .
Pac - Man is dead simple in any language that fits the same general model as C .
There are a bunch of globals representing the position of Pac - Man , the score , the level , and so on .
Ghost information is stored in a short array of structures .
Then there 's an array representing the maze , where each element is either a piece of the maze or a dot .
If Pac - Man eats a dot , the maze array is updated .
If Pac - Man hits a blue ghost , that ghost 's structure is updated to reflect a new state .
There were dozens and dozens of Pac - Man clones in the early 1980s , including tiny versions that you could type in from a magazine .
In a purely functional language , none of this works .
If Pac - Man eats a dot , the maze can't be directly updated .
If Pac - Man hits a blue ghost , there 's no way to directly change the state of the ghost .
How could this possibly work ?
That was a long time ago , and I 've spent enough time with functional languages to have figured out how to implement non-trivial , interactive applications like video games .
My plan is to cover this information in a short series of entries .
I 'm sticking with 8 - bit retrogames because they 're simple and everyone knows what Pac - Man looks like .
I do n't want to use abstract examples involving hypothetical game designs .
I 'm also sticking with purely functional programming language features , because that 's the challenge .
I know that ML has references and that processes in Erlang can be used to mimic objects , but if you go down that road you might as well be using C .
The one exception to " purely functional " is that I do n't care about trying to make I /O fit a functional model .
In a game , there are three I/O needs : input from the user , a way to render graphics on the screen , and a real - time clock .
Fortunately , these only matter at the very highest level outer loop , one that looks like :
repeat forever { get user input process one frame draw everything on the screen wait until a frame 's worth of time has elapsed }
" Process one frame " is the interesting part .
It takes the current game state and user input as parameters and returns a new game state .
Then that game state can be used for the " draw everything " step .
" Draw everything " can also be purely functional , returning an abstract list of sprites and coordinates , a list that can be passed directly to a lower level , and inherently impure , function that talks to the graphics hardware .
An open question is " Is being purely functional , even excepting I/O , worthwhile ? "
Or is it , as was suggested to me via email earlier this year , the equivalent of writing a novel without using the letter 'e ' ?

If everyone lost just 4 or 5 kilograms , mortality rates would drop dramatically .
At least that ’s one lesson from the economic crisis Cuba suffered in the 1990s .
When the Soviet empire began to unravel in 1989 , Cuba was hit with serious food and fuel shortages .
From 1991 to 1995 , people were getting only about 1800 calories a day and had to walk or cycle wherever they needed to go .
The result was an average drop in body mass index of 1.5 units , and a halving of the obesity rate to just 7 per cent .
In the years that followed , deaths …
Chances are pretty darn slim that this will be President Bush ’s favorite cover model moment : Canadian magazine Maclean ’s whipped up quite a provocative picture for its latest top story , which makes the claim that “ a desperate Washington is reaching out to the late dictator ’s henchmen . ”
Maclean’s :
America ’s other main enemy is al - Qaeda in Iraq , which is to Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaeda what a cheap watch is to a Swiss timepiece — effective , easily reproduced , and disposable .
Al - Qaeda did not exist in Iraq before the invasion , but today it , along with Iran , are the two strongest arguments the U.S. makes for “ staying the course . ”
Al - Qaeda in Iraq is essentially a religious criminal gang that kills anyone who threatens its power or differs from its Salafist views on establishing a perverse form of an Islamic state .
Its death squads and enormously destructive truck bombs have killed thousands of Shias , but Sunnis , too , have suffered al - Qaeda ’s violent nihilism .
Car bombs , assassinations and “ religious punishments , ” including decapitations and cutting off the fingers of smokers , have put Sunni Iraq under a Mordor - like shadow of terror and justified collective punishment from the Shias .
In his testimony to Congress , Gen. Petraeus pointed out the lethal threat of al - Qaeda .
But this should come as no surprise to an American general — because the U.S. Army helped create al - Qaeda in Iraq .
The American role in the promotion of the terrorist organization is not some mad conspiracy theory , but a well - documented attempt by the U.S. government to demonize the insurgency and make it appear to be the central front in the war on terror .
This was as great a mistake as disbanding the Iraqi army , which the U.S. did in May 2003 , or perhaps even greater , since it led to the sectarian downward spiral that has destroyed the country .

As consumers face a cornucopia of bad financial news -- plunging home values , higher food and gas prices , a shrinking job market and the like -- there is one place they may be turning to fill in the gaps : credit cards .
U.S. consumers are already burdened with a mountain of debt : $ 2.54 trillion at the end of February , according to the
Federal Reserve
.
Revolving debt , which typically comes from credit cards , has increased at a faster rate than overall debt since the summer of 2006 -- right about when the housing market began to implode .
The trend seems to suggest consumers are using credit cards to patch up holes in revenue that once could be filled by refinancing or selling a home .
Now that home values have dropped sharply and are predicted to fall further , at least over the short term , consumers are left without the housing crutch they once relied upon .
The other available crutch -- credit cards -- may simply inflict more pain , as balances accrue , interest rates rise and fees are attached .
This is especially true for those with weak FICO scores , who are already in a bad debt situation and face higher interest rates because of the risk involved in lending to them .
" To go to worse in debt from badly in debt right now could be something that is largely irreversible , " says Michael Branham , a financial planner at Edina , Minn . - based Cornerstone Wealth Advisors .
" It does n't make any sense , and yet people are doing it .
They continue to spiral into more and more debt . "
Nonetheless , lenders are happy to oblige , with some caveats , in an effort to make up for miserable first - quarter results .
The banking industry has posted massive losses from mortgages and other housing investments as the market began to collapse .
The downturn was due in large part to risky loans issued to consumers with weak credit profiles , known as " subprime " or " Alt - A " borrowers .
Now that those customers -- as well as some with better financial measures -- are facing delinquencies , defaults and foreclosures , lenders of all stripes have tightened their standards .
" There are many banks that see opportunities in the consumer - lending space because they feel they have the capital and resources to take some market share , " says James Chessen , chief economist at the American Bankers Association , an industry trade group .
But , he adds : " I guarantee any borrower that 's had late payments on their mortgages will not see a lot of offers for any other type of consumer - loan product . "
Credit - card debt , which is unsecured , is riskier for banks to provide and requires more capital reserves than asset - backed loans .
But the return on equity for credit - card lending far exceeds that of mortgages or other loans , because of higher interest rates and other fees .
For instance ,
Capital One's
( COF ) - Get Report
business that handles credit cards had a 50 % ROE last year , compared with 6.5 % for its mortgage business and 10 % for the company overall , according to
TheStreet.com
Senior Banking Analyst Philip van Doorn .
The bank lifted pricing and fees and modified terms of its card agreements last year .
" It 's an uglier business , " says van Doorn , " but there 's oodles of money to be made . "
Several major banks and credit - card companies are looking to drive growth by tapping into new credit - card customers at home and abroad , according to outlooks they provided in recent weeks .
Whether this will ultimately help the banks -- or cash - strapped consumers -- is uncertain and depends on whether the economy can regain its footing .
American Express
( AXP ) - Get Report
said Wednesday that profit from its U.S. card business fell nearly 20 % last quarter as it spent more to attract new business and faced higher delinquency rates and charge - offs .
However , earnings from its much smaller international segment rose 30 % on higher borrowing and spending by cardholders .
CEO Kenneth Chenault said the company is targeting affluent U.S. consumers and new customers abroad .
Bank of America
( BAC ) - Get Report
, the largest U.S. retail bank , said earlier in the week that credit cards represented nearly two - thirds of the bank 's consumer losses during the period .
Delinquencies of 30 days or more rose to 5.61 % , up from 5.45 % in the previous quarter .
They were particularly higher in states worst affected by the housing market -- like California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona -- which make up about a quarter of Bank of America 's card portfolio .
Still , Bank of America remains hopeful as consumers keep spending :
It had 10 % higher outstanding card balances last quarter , on average , than during the same period a year ago .
" Even though the economy has slowed , we continue to add new retail customers and expand our relationships with existing customers , " CEO Ken Lewis said during a recent conference call .
Similarly ,
Citigroup
( C ) - Get Report
posted higher U.S. credit - card write - offs during the first quarter as delinquencies advanced at a faster rate and more customers filed for bankruptcy .
JPMorgan Chase
( JPM ) - Get Report
said its card - services business had a 20 % profit decline in the same period .
That was caused by higher charge - offs , but also increased spending to draw in new customers .
Despite all the bad news -- more debt , more delayed payments , more bankruptcies -- there are some silver linings for the banks .
As the U.S. market soured , Citi opened 2.3 million new card accounts abroad last quarter , particularly in Mexico and India , where the economy and middle class are growing rapidly .
Even in the U.S. , not all the news is foul .
Capital One CFO Gary Perlin noted a " striking finding " that about two - thirds of its credit - card customers who were 90 days or more past due on mortgage payments were still current with credit - card payments .
That figure has remained steady over the past year , he said , because consumers " have a bias to pay the loans that ... provide enduring value . "
By such logic , at least 66 % of consumers value credit - card purchases above their homes .
Certainly that 's true for some who feel a need to have the latest fashion , accessories , technology and cars , regardless of financial circumstances .
But others place higher importance on credit cards because they 're a means to purchase immediate needs , like food and gasoline , when cash is n't available .
For those with adjustable - rate mortgages that reset at higher rates , perhaps making huge mortgage payments on a home whose value is plummeting seems like throwing cash into a black hole .
" People feel like a $ 500 credit - card payment is more affordable than their $ 2,500 mortgage payment , " Branham says .
" Psychologically , it makes sense . "
While the problem for banks is the risk , the problem for consumers is the cyclical nature of credit - card debt .
A load of debt can take decades to pay off , and only lengthens if the cardholder is still making purchases .
High interest rates and fees only compound the problem .
Say a consumer has $ 10,000 of credit - card debt with a 20 % interest rate and the minimum payment is calculated by taking 2.5 % of the average daily balance .
It will take more than 50 years to pay off the balance with just the minimum payments -- if no further debt is added -- and cost nearly $ 20,000 in interest charges , according to
City National Bank's
( CYN )
online calculator .
That does n't include additional spending , fees for late payments , potential interest - rate hikes or other charges the consumer may incur .
The outlook for card issuers may be sunny if they hold to stricter lending standards and expand the business at a sensible rate .
But the outlook for U.S. consumers is less robust , especially if current economic trends continue .
Further job cuts , higher costs of living and a weaker housing market will leave very few U.S. consumers isolated from the downturn .
Using credit - cards as a last resort might seem like temporary relief , but it may also be the straw that breaks the back of the consumer .
LAS VEGAS --
While the economy may be cool , the world of networking is anything but , according to Marie Hattar , VP of Network Systems and Security Solutions for Cisco .
There are a lot of reasons why Hattar is so upbeat including new product initiatives , compliance drivers and overall customer sentiment .
Since Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) is an important bell weather for the technology industry as a whole , what Cisco sees as the current and future state of the networking business has wide implications .
As a simple proof point of the renewed interest in networking Hattar who spoke to InternetNews.com at the Interop trade show , cited the enthusiasm of Interop .
" Despite the split personality of Interop this year we 're excited because we 're seeing so many customers , " Hattar said .
( Interop added a separate software conference to the event ) .
" A few years ago all we 'd see was vendors . "
Hattar 's area of responsibility includes routing and switching as well as security .
Under her auspices lies the big area of Cisco's Self Defending Network portfolio of which Network Access Control ( NAC ) is a constituent .
" We see NAC as something that crosses between network security and endpoint security and we do see it as an area of growth , " Hattar said .
Hattar noted there has been a lot of hype about NAC and it 's taken longer for the technology to prove itself in terms of deployments than some might have expected .
A trough of disillusionment
" What happened with NAC is it went through great hype and then it went through the trough of disillusionment , " Hattar said .
" I think now what you 're seeing are customers getting to the steady state of deploying it into their networks . "
Hattar also was quick to point out that security is much more than the concept of admission control .
Cisco 's broader vision involves its new Trustsec initiative which was announced at the end of 2007 .
" Trustsec secures things across the LAN and brings policy , identity and ties it all together so you have a whole trusted security entity , " Hattar explained .
" That to me is a more interesting topic than just purely ' knock knock who is there ? '
That does n't necessarily protect your overall network . "
While NAC has perhaps been a driver for networking , there is no question that the PCI compliance requirements have also been a boost .
" Many enterprises deploy security products to deal with compliance issue so PCI has been huge as a driver to put security into the network , " Hattar said .
" But just because you 're PCI compliant does n't mean you have a secure network . "
After enduring criticism for weeks , John McCain broke Thursday with two controversial televangelists whose endorsements he once trumpeted in a bid to win support from religious conservatives .
At a late - afternoon rally in Stockton , McCain said he rejected the endorsement of John Hagee after learning of a recording in which the San Antonio pastor portrayed Adolf Hitler as being sent by God to force Jews “ to come back to the land of Israel . ”
McCain said he had not been aware of the comments -- which were made in a sermon in the late 1990s and turned up recently on the Internet -- when Hagee endorsed him in February .
“ I just think that the statement is crazy and unacceptable , ” McCain said .
The pastor ’s words , he added , “ are just too much . ”
Later in the day , McCain told the Associated Press that he also repudiated the support of Rod Parsley , an Ohio preacher who has sharply criticized Islam and called the religion inherently violent .
“ I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America , ” McCain said .

McCain , who is viewed with suspicion by many conservatives in the Republican Party , had actively sought endorsements from evangelicals .
He has had a rocky relationship with evangelical leaders , notably calling Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell “ agents of intolerance ” in the 2000 presidential campaign .
His experience with Hagee ’s endorsement , which drew even more criticism than Parsley ’s , recalled the controversy that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama confronted after incendiary sermons made by his former pastor became public .
After the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made similar comments in an appearance in Washington , Obama strenuously disavowed them and severed ties with his longtime mentor .
As McCain in recent weeks began distancing himself from Hagee , many Obama supporters complained that news outlets were paying more attention to Wright ’s statements .
In Stockton , McCain said he did not think the comparison was fair .
“ I ’ve never been in Pastor Hagee ’s church or Pastor Parsley ’s church .
I did n’t attend their church for 20 years , and I ’m not a member of their church .
I received their endorsement , which did not mean that I endorsed their views . ”

Obama , campaigning in Florida , responded : “ John McCain has to deal with Hagee , who said something that is mind - boggling .
I do n’t attribute those statements to John McCain .
Nobody thinks McCain believes that stuff . ”
McCain was in California on Thursday on a campaign trip .
He participated in a business roundtable with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and vowed he would “ compete and win ” in the Golden State .
At the rally later , he drew laughter when he mocked Obama , saying that “ for a young man with very little experience , he ’s done very well . ”
In the sermon that led to the break with McCain , Hagee was giving a theological interpretation of the developments that led to Jews founding the state of Israel 60 years ago .
Hagee cited Jeremiah 16:15 and referred to God sending “ a hunter . ”
“ A hunter is someone with a gun , and he forces you , ” Hagee said .
“ Hitler was a hunter .
. . .
How did it happen ?
Because God allowed it to happen .
Why did it happen ?
Because God said , ‘ My top priority for the Jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of Israel . ’ ”

On Thursday , Hagee released a statement saying he was “ tired of these baseless attacks ” and was withdrawing his endorsement .
Hagee , who heads a group called Christians United for Israel , said critics were “ grossly misrepresenting my position on issues most near and dear to my heart . ”
Hagee infuriated many Catholics with past remarks referring to the Catholic Church as a “ false cult system ” and the “ great whore . ”
Hagee also suggested Hurricane Katrina was God ’s answer to a “ level of sin ” that God found offensive and linked the devastating storm to a gay parade scheduled about the same time .
McCain dismissed the remarks as “ nonsense ” when he visited New Orleans .
However , he had said he was pleased when Hagee apologized to the Catholic League in a letter last week , and the group said it accepted the apology .

J.J. Goldberg , editorial director of the weekly Jewish newspaper Forward , said McCain might have concluded that the controversial endorsements were starting to cost him more votes than they were bringing in -- and could damage the Republican ’s attempts to make inroads among Jewish voters .
A Gallup Poll Daily survey released May 7 found that , in a head - to - head contest , Obama would edge McCain 61 % to 32 % among Jewish voters .
Still , for a Republican to win nearly 1 in 3 Jewish votes would be a good showing , given the historically strong loyalties Jews have had to the Democratic Party .
McCain , Goldberg said , is likely to fare best among conservative Jews who are worried about Obama ’s approach to foreign policy .
“ The people that he needs , or that he ’s counting on from the Jewish community -- it ’s only a fragment -- are precisely the people who are the most likely to jump out of their skins when they hear ‘ Hitler , ’ ” he said .
Goldberg said McCain might not have felt the need to reject Hagee ’s support after his comments about the Catholic Church came to light , but acted now because Jews could be “ more easily offended ” due to the memory of the Holocaust .

“ It ’s not like Catholics hear a slur and immediately envision mass annihilation , but that ’s exactly what happens in the Jewish community , ” he said .
“ It ’s not based on delusion but based on fairly recent experience . ”
After McCain split with Hagee , religious organizations offered sharply varying reactions .
The Rev. C. Welton Gaddy , president of the Washington - based Interfaith Alliance , said he was happy McCain “ did what he had to do . ”
Gaddy , whose organization advocates keeping electoral politics separate from organized religion , said “ when politicians and religious leaders try to use each other , both of them usually get hurt . ”
But Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League , said he found it “ noble ” that Hagee decided to sever his ties to McCain .
“ He knows he has become a liability to McCain , even after he has made amends to Catholics , ” he said .
Advertisement
Donohue said Hagee visited him a week ago , after the pastor ’s remarks about the Catholic Church caused controversy .
“ I found him to be sincere , apologetic and friendly , ” Donohue said .
“ I also found him to be the strongest Christian defender of Israel I have ever met , and that is why attempts to portray him as anything but a genuine friend to Jews -- one for whom the Holocaust is the horror of horrors -- is despicable . ”

The choice was ' very clear ' for Nutter
PHILADELPHIA —
This city ’s mayor , Michael Nutter , has been in office just a little more than 100 days and he has n’t even had time to hang pictures on the wall of his large , though not grandiose , office yet .
He has been a little busy , what with passing five new gun laws — which the local district attorney says are unconstitutional and she will not enforce — getting the police to “ stop , question and frisk ” anyone suspected of carrying an illegal weapon on the streets , and , oh , yeah , trying to get Hillary Clinton elected president .
Advertisement
Nutter , an African - American , endorsed Clinton last December .
Nutter had unexpectedly won the Democratic primary for mayor the previous May , getting 37 percent of the vote in a five - person field .
Barack Obama had endorsed one of Nutter ’s opponents in that primary , U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah , who had looked like he had a pretty good chance of winning early on , but ended up coming in fourth .
“ Fattah gave off the impression that he was doing people a favor by being willing to leave Washington to run Philadelphia , ” a local political sage told me .
“ It did n’t play well . ”
Nutter , on the other hand , campaigned hard , going into the subway stations early in the mornings and handing out “ Nutter Butter ” cookies , a somewhat odd choice for a man who carefully watches his diet and health , eating no meat , drinking no caffeine and smoking no cigarettes .
In the general election the former city councilman , 50 , won a historic 86 percent of the vote in this heavily Democratic city and his presidential endorsement was sought fervidly by both Clinton and Obama .
“ I talked to both personally .
Both senators called me ; I met with both privately and I talked to both on the phone a couple of times , ” Nutter told me .
“ I was getting to know them and it was a quite unique experience . ”
In the end , however , Nutter said the choice was “ very clear . ”
“ Sen . Clinton clearly was the best candidate for cities like Philadelphia , ” Nutter said .
“ She understands the issues that challenge cities and metropolitan areas all across this country . ”
Nutter mentioned Clinton ’s understanding of issues like crime — Philadelphia had a shocking 406 homicides in 2007 , the highest murder rate of any large city in the nation — public education , jobs and mass transit .
“ When you have a conversation with her , you know she understands and she knows what she ’s talking about , ” Nutter said .
“ She will match up well with John McCain in the fall . ”
Philadelphia was about 45 percent white and 43 percent black in the last census and I asked Nutter how much grief he has gotten from Philadelphia ’s black community for not endorsing Obama .
“ Very little , ” he said .
“ I am not being sarcastic about it , but it actually only comes up in interviews . ”
And the fact that Obama endorsed one of your primary opponents had nothing to do with your decision not to endorse him for president ?
“ I am not saying your question is silly , but the idea is silly that I would base such an important decision on something like that , ” Nutter said .
“ This is America .
You can support whomever you want to support .
And that ’s what I am doing . ”
He went on : “ And the people of Philadelphia understand that even the mayor gets to make his own choice and selection for who gets to be president .
My decision was who would be best for the city as a whole .
I now have a responsibility for all one and a half million people here : black , white , Latino , Asian and all different colors under the rainbow . ”
Not that Nutter is n’t hedging his bet just slightly .
Clinton is leading in the polls in Pennsylvania , but most analysts consider Obama the front - runner for the nomination .
“ We ’re all good Democrats and at some time point in time we are going to have a Democratic nominee , ” Nutter said .
“ If , some how , some way , it ’s going to be Sen .
Obama , then I am going to be supporting our Democratic nominee to make him president of the United States . ”
Until that time , however , Nutter is going all out for Clinton .
“ I only know how to engage in campaigns one way , ” he said .
“ It ’s 100 percent effort , it ’s how I campaigned for myself and when I endorse someone they get the same level of effort . ”
And when it ’s all over ?
“ I ’m thinking that when it ’s over , ” Nutter said , “ I might have to seek some kind of therapy . ”
Him and everybody else .
From government to big business , if you have a dirty secret , Wikileaks is your nightmare .
David Leigh and Jonathan Franklin on the site a US court has tried to muzzle
A secretive Swiss bank landed an apparently novel censorship blow against the internet this week .
Anyone who tried to call up wikileaks.org , a global website devoted to publicising leaked documents , found themselves frustrated .
The site simply was n't there any more .
The Julius Baer bank in Zurich succeeded in hamstringing the shadowy individuals behind the website by the simple trick of moving not against them , but against a US company that hosted their domain name .
Dynadot , the California resellers who collect a few dollars by this internet trade , submitted to a legal injunction ordering the name to be deleted .
Yet however wise this scheme may have appeared at the time to the Swiss bank 's Los Angeles lawyers , Lavely & Singer , it has now backfired in a big way .
The injunction blew up a gale of debate about internet freedom , and sprayed the bank 's secret documents all over the net .
It has also thrust into prominence an obscure group of dreamers and programmers who want to provide what they call an " untraceable and uncensorable " leaking machine , to be used by dissidents worldwide .
Those behind Wikileaks include Tibetan , Chinese and Thai political campaigners , an Australian hacking author , and Ben Laurie , a mathematician living in west London who is on the advisory board .
Wikileaks is not the first site of its kind .
John Young , a New York architect , has been posting leaked intelligence documents on his Cryptome site for some years .
But since its launch in late 2006 , Wikileaks has had an impressive record .
When Northern Rock collapsed last autumn , print media in London were gagged by a judge 's order from re-publishing its leaked sales prospectus .
It was Wikileaks that kept the prospectus before the public , along with the text of some threatening " not for publication " letters from the British lawyers , Schillings .
In the US , Wikileaks also made headlines last November with the publication of secret documents , including the 238 - page manual Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta , a document that even the US military grudgingly admitted was genuine .
The Guantánamo document , including descriptions of everything from transferring prisoners to evading protocols of the Geneva convention , was a comprehensive guide to day - to - day operations at the controversial prison .
Wikileaks landed an even bigger coup last August with a previously secret 110 - page draft report by the international investigators Kroll , which revealed allegations of massive corruption in Kenya .
The family of former Kenyan leader Daniel Arap Moi were reported to have siphoned off more than £ 1bn .
The reason Wikileaks has now enraged the Zurich bank is that pages have been posted detailing the bankers ' most intimate trade secret : the way they hide the funds of their ultra-rich international clients in offshore trusts .
This sort of material is very hot stuff .
In Germany , the federal intelligence service recently paid an informer almost £ 4 m for a disc containing similar details from a Liechtenstein bank .
That led to raids on hundreds of suspected tax evaders , the disgrace of prominent businessmen , and a diplomatic collision with the tiny tax haven .
The person Baer describes as a disgruntled former employee at their own Cayman Islands office has similarly made off with a large quantity of internal records .
A handful of these have made their way on to the Wikileaks site , which advertises that individuals can leak with the confidence they wo n't be discovered , thanks to the site 's cryptographic protection .
The files tell some interesting stories .
One of Margaret
Thatcher 's life peers allegedly salted away more than $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) in a secret trust , for example .
The late Lawrence Kadoorie , a Hong Kong millionaire , was ennobled in 1981 by the former British prime minister .
He had built up the family 's fortunes through China Light and Power , which provides Hong Kong with its electricity , and through a chain of hotels .
According to the files , the Baer bank ran an anonymous company , registered in the British Virgin Islands and called Seneford Investments .
A nominee director was based in a second tax haven , the Cayman Islands .
But the real owner of Seneford Investments , it is claimed , was Kadoorie 's family trust .
In 1998 , the documents listed six bank accounts for the company , in Switzerland and elsewhere .
They held a total of $ 113 m .
There is no suggestion that this was illegal .
Kadoorie 's son , Sir Michael , who still has major interests in the Hong Kong companies , did not respond yesterday to invitations from the Guardian to comment .
The other bank records posted by Wikileaks describe equally elaborate structures husbanding millions of pounds for Spanish financiers , Greek ship - owners , Chinese expatriates and wealthy New Yorkers .
Although the leaker hints that tax frauds and bribery may lie behind some of these other accounts , he does not give enough detail to provide proof .
Wikileaks itself admits that some of the documents might be fabricated , and the whole affair might have only been seen as a curiosity , had the Baer bank not called in their lawyers .
The federal judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco not only ordered removal of the domain name , but banned further circulation of the documents .
As a result , they reappeared on Wikileaks " mirror " sites , hosted in the UK , Belgium and the Christmas Islands .
It even transpired that the deleted main Wikileaks site could be accessed , slightly less conveniently , by using its IP number ( 88.80.13.160 ) instead of the domain name .
Bloggers , online columnists and websites decried the bank 's move as they launched a counterattack and lobbied in favour of Wikileaks ' right to anonymously publish secrets .
Less than a week after the court decision , a Google search for the court case turned up 69,000 hits .
Four hours later , the tally was 78,000 .
A further hearing on February 29 may well overturn the original decision .
The Zurich bank says : " It was the sole objective of Julius Baer to have legally protected documents removed from Wikileaks .
We brought legal action against the website only after our initial efforts proved unsuccessful .
In the course of taking such action , the bank has been made the subject of serious defamatory allegations .
Such allegations are based on forged and stolen documents and are unequivocally denied .
We have always sought to act in the best interests of our clients and shall continue to do so . "
Who are Wikileaks ?
Although the project makes a feature of the anonymity of its volunteers , the minds behind it are not hard to find .
One prominent driving force is Julian Assange , a much - travelled Australian programmer and author who has a flamboyant mane of silver hair .
Before riding his motorcycle across Vietnam , he co-wrote a book about computer hackers .
" He 's a pretty standard modern geek with a thing about dissidents , " says the British encryption expert Ben Laurie , who advised the group on encryption .
" He 's quite techie and he can write code . "
One of Assange 's early schemes was to develop what he called " deniable cryptography " .
The idea was to help dissidents resist giving away secrets under torture .
Texts would be encrypted in layers , so that even if a victim were forced to reveal a password , the torturer would not realise there was a second layer of information , hidden by a second password .
Assange then turned up in London and proposed the Wikileaks scheme for " an open - source , democratic intelligence agency " .
Laurie said : " I thought it was all hot air at first . "
But he became enthusiastic .
He advised on an encryption system , first developed by the US Navy , which uses a chain of three separate servers , and ensures leakers can post documents anonymously .
Laurie is an international consultant on internet security .
Earlier he set up a business that bought two military bunkers , at the abandoned US base at Greenham Common , and at an old RAF radar station in Kent .
His company rents them out to firms and banks who want to protect their servers from attack .
The Kent bunker is deep underground : " The radar operators were supposed to survive 30 days after a nuclear strike . "
Some of his subversiveness may have rubbed off from his father , Peter Laurie , who wrote a cult book in the 1970s called Beneath the City Streets , which traced networks of secret government bunkers and tunnels .
Fresh off a flight from Washington , he answers the door to his rambling house in Acton in bare feet , and willingly explains why he approves of Wikileaks , while pointing out he is not personally responsible for any of their legally controversial deeds : " I have a long - term interest in privacy on the internet .
It provides enormous opportunities for surveillance and this is not a good thing .
Also , this is an interesting technical problem : how do you reveal things about powerful people without getting your arse kicked ?
Whistleblowing is a practice which should be encouraged .
" I'm really quite surprised at Wikileaks ' success .
They 've done a lot of interesting stuff .
It seems people are prepared to take the risk . "
Another member of the advisory board is an American former draft resister , CJ Hinke .
Speaking from his home in Thailand , he said : " Wikileaks is a decentralised phenomenon , and that means there are volunteers in dozens of countries .
These volunteers form a very loose network so that , in fact , government can't home in on anybody and take drastic action against them . "
In Thailand , Wikileaks has focused on efforts to block access to websites critical of the government .
" The minute Wikileaks was announced , we sent them a huge trove of secret documents , " said Hinke , founder of Freedom Against Censorship Thailand .
The documents included detailed lists of blocked sites , including all references to The King Never Smiles , a book published by Yale University Press .
" Ordinary people come across things that governments or companies or individuals would prefer to keep secret .
I think it is possible for almost everybody to expose these kind of events . "
The wikileakers share the same belief in the " wisdom of crowds " that lies behind Wikipedia , the online encyclopaedia .
Their theory is that their leaked documents will be self - verifying , thanks to the scrutiny of thousands of pairs of eyes .
Some may wonder whether it 's quite as easy as that .
Laurie cautions that Wikileaks ' vaunted encryption is not completely unbreakable .
Codebreakers such as the US National Security Agency could probably crack it , he says .
" If my life was on the line , I would not be submitting [ documents ] to Wikileaks . "

Parallel Mode
The libstdc++ parallel mode is an experimental parallel implementation of many algorithms of the C++ Standard Library .
Several of the standard algorithms , for instance std:: sort , are made parallel using OpenMP annotations .
These parallel mode constructs can be invoked by explicit source declaration or by compiling existing sources with a specific compiler flag .
Note
The parallel mode has not been kept up to date with recent C++ standards and so it only conforms to the C++03 requirements .
That means that move - only predicates may not work with parallel mode algorithms , and for C++20 most of the algorithms cannot be used in constexpr functions .
For C++17 and above there are new overloads of the standard algorithms which take an execution policy argument .
You should consider using those instead of the non-standard parallel mode extensions .
Intro
The following library components in the include numeric are included in the parallel mode : std::accumulate
std::adjacent_difference
std::inner_product
std::partial_sum
The following library components in the include algorithm are included in the parallel mode : std::adjacent_find

OAKLAND , California – Linux programmer Hans Reiser put the pedal to the metal on his geek defense at his murder trial here Monday , explaining to jurors that , as nonscientists , they may not understand his social ineptness .
" Scientists communicate by reference to data .
I can not communicate effectively .
That 's not how scientists talk .
We cannot throw out assertions that cannot be supportive without data points , " the 44 - year - old defendant testified on his 10th day on the stand .
" I have a compulsive tendency to say things that I know are true that people do n't want to be true .
I do this by reference to the data , " the developer of the ReiserFS filesystem testified .
All the while , some of the jurors were smiling while others appeared exhausted as the defendant explained again that he is a misunderstood scientist who did not kill his wife who was divorcing him .
Nina Reiser , 31 , was last seen at her estranged husband 's house in the Oakland hills , when she dropped off their young children for the Labor Day weekend Sept. 3 , 2006 .
The authorities claim she never left the house alive .
Scientists , the defendant testified , " we 're all kind of comfortable with each other but when we go out into society , we tend to have some problems , " he said .
Some of his strangeness included him hosing down the inside of his tiny 1988 Honda CRX his mother loaned him after his wife vanished .
" It gets the car clean , and it 's cheaper than renting a shampoo device , " he testified .
Moments before , his mother was on the stand , agreeing that her son was an " inconsiderate slob . "
Beverly Palmer added , " I also told him he made a mess out of my car , and he should clean it up . "
Defense attorney William DuBois asked his 44 - year - old client whether he is " dysfunctional in every social setting ? "
" Except for being a scientist , yes , " Hans Reiser replied .
During his days on the stand , he also testified he tried to hide the car from the police and that he removed the passenger seat so he could sleep inside the two - seater vehicle .
When police discovered the vehicle two weeks after Nina vanished , there were two books about murder inside and a sleeping - bag cover with Nina Reiser 's blood on it .
Reiser added that " I have a compulsive tendency to say things that I know are true that people do n't want to be true . "
" In most of society , that practice works disastrously , " he added .
" If you prove it , they hate you even more . "
Moments later , he added : " I found a little niche in society where I can get away . "
That niche , he said , " is working as a scientist . "
His testimony Monday , as during his duration on the stand , was filled with objections from prosecutor Paul Hora .
Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman largely sustained them .
DuBois asked Hans Reiser why he thought he was under attack by society at large .
" Listen carefully .
Can you hear me ? "
DuBois continued .
" Why do you believe you tend to attract such attacks ? "
" Actually , this is a perfect example .
He does n’t want to hear the data , " Reiser said , noting prosecutor Hora .
" Your honor , this is becoming nonresponsive , " Hora chimed .
" Mr. Reiser , enough .
I 've had it with all of your answers , " the judge said .
The defendant claims his wife abandoned her children after he accused her of bilking his software company , Namesys , while they were discussing their divorce that Sept. 3 , 2006 , day .
Testimony is recessing for lunch .
The defendant is expected to resume the witness stand soon .
THREAT LEVEL is providing gavel - to - gavelcoverage .

A price cut in the summer of last year helped lift PlayStation 3 sales Sony 's PlayStation 3 games console has outsold Microsoft 's Xbox 360 in Europe , according to figures released by Sony .
More than five million PS3s have been sold across the continent , Sony 's David Reeves confirmed .
Speaking at a European PlayStation event in London , he said : " The numbers are a testament to the strength of the PlayStation brand . "
He said PlayStation 3 had been outselling the Xbox 360 since October last year .
" We have sold more PlayStation 3s throughout Europe than Xbox 360 even though they launched 16 months before us . "
Mr Reeves , head of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe , also said 12 million PSP handheld consoles and 48 million PlayStation 2s had been sold in Europe .
Despite Sony's overhauling of Microsoft in Europe , both firms ' sales are a long way behind the Nintendo Wii .
Price tag Sony has managed to overtake Xbox 360 sales despite a much higher price tag .
The cheapest PS3 is available for £ 299 , versus £ 159 for the Xbox 360 .
" We have been consistently outselling our closest competitor [ Xbox 360 ] since October 2007 , even with the latest price point , " said Mr Reeves .
Microsoft cut the price of Xbox 360 in March .
The PS3 is far more mass market than 360 , which has gone for traditional adult males
Nick Parker , games consultant
The figures will cheer Sony after a painful launch period for the machine , which saw delays , stock problems and criticism from gamers that early titles for the machine were below par .
Kaz Hirai , Sony 's global head of PlayStation , said the first year of PS3 had been difficult .
Speaking at the London event , he said : " There were teething problems ... and customers were a little underwhelmed by early games . "
' No surprise '
He said Sony was going to promote the PS3 as a " multi- faceted interactive entertainment system " in the year ahead .
Games consultant Nick Parker said it was " no surprise " that PlayStation had overtaken Xbox in Europe .
" The PlayStation has held out remarkably well over the last 18 months despite the press slating it because of the price .
People got behind the brand .
" The PS3 is far more mass market than 360 , which has gone for traditional adult males - and that does not go down well in continental Europe . "
He said consumers in Europe had " never gotten over the design ethos of the original Xbox . "
Microsoft had set out to broaden the appeal of its titles " but never did come up with the goods " , he went on .
The Xbox 360 was performing well in the UK but has a " problem on the continent " .
He said PlayStation 3 had " every chance " of overtaking the Xbox 360 in its heartland of North America in the next two to three years .

What are these ?
The Iraq war might end like this :
• Iraqi Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds uneasily share power and wealth in a single state .
Sectarian violence , as well as terrorism linked to Al Qaeda , are diminished but not eliminated .
Overseeing all this are perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 US troops , deployed in Iraq for years , maybe decades .
• Iraq is partitioned , accompanied by a return to the widespread sectarian violence of 2006 – times two .
Five years after the invasion of Iraq , those scenarios might be the best and worse cases that the United States now can aim for .
One key to the outcome may be how long the US stays engaged in the expensive , drawn - out conflict .
From the point of view of the US , the Iraq war might be over when a president simply declares an endpoint .
To an Iraqi , it might take much longer than that .
Iraq today might be only at the midpoint , even the beginning , of a cycle of epic geopolitical change , say some analysts in a Monitor survey of experts in the region as well as in the US .
For evidence , look at the Balkans , they say , which is still experiencing the geopolitical aftershocks of its mid-1990s wars .
" It will take the whole term of the next president to get this right , " says Michael O'Hanlon , a Brookings Institution foreign - policy expert who advocates continuing surge - level US military efforts .
The Bush administration 's vision of 2003 – that an Iraq freed of Saddam Hussein would be a peaceful hive of democracy , the Germany of the Middle East , and a source of strategic strength for the US – long ago proved wildly optimistic .
It 's been replaced by the knowledge that Iraq is a frail state , a source of strategic weakness , and a likely drain on US resources for some time to come .
On one basic point , the US invasion of Iraq has been wholly successful :
It toppled Saddam Hussein .
That may not seem as important today as it did at one time , given that the invasion also did not find any of his vaunted weapons of mass destruction , and that the unintended consequences of his removal have proved to be numerous .
But many of Mr. Hussein 's neighbors considered him a source of instability .
At least one US ally in the region remains grateful he is gone .
" Any Iraq will be better than Iraq under Saddam , because the Iraq of Saddam had the ability to threaten Israel , " says Shlomo Brom , a senior fellow at Tel Aviv University 's Institute for National Security Studies and former head of the Israeli Defense Force 's Strategic Planning Division .
Of the misjudgments made by the US prior to its initiation of hostilities , however , one of the most profound was its error in predicting how Iraqi society would react once freed of Hussein 's grip .
Pushed by extremists , it split into ethnic and sectarian groupings .
It turned out that few Iraqis – or , at least , not enough of them – had been waiting for the day they could found a Jeffersonian democracy .
" The main lesson of the invasion of Iraq is that you cannot engineer society , " says Mr. Brom .
Sectarian competition will continue
Today , years of internecine warfare have taken their toll .
Even under the best of circumstances , it appears inevitable that Sunnis , Shiites , and Kurds will compete for political and economic influence for years to come .
Within those sectarian and ethnic groupings various factions will vie for influence as well .
At issue will be the nature of competition : ballots or bombs ?
" People are n't going to be reconciled , there has been too much violence .... the question is can they work out a new set of arrangements , " said Anthony Cordesman , a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , in a February briefing .
At this point in its experience in Iraq , the US is no longer trying to win a great victory , according to a range of analysts from around the world .
It is simply trying to avoid defeat .
Much depends on the attitudes of the various groups toward basic questions of national identity .
But even after all this time , the US may not really know whether the Kurds want their own state , whether Shiites will allow true Sunni participation in central government , and whether the Sunnis – Iraq 's old ruling class – truly have given up dreams of reconquering the country .
" We do n't really have a good fix on what the calculations of all these actors are , " said Martin Indyk of the Brookings Institution in Washington during a January seminar on the future of Iraq .
The most crucial unknown :
Is the current decline in sectarian violence a real trend – or are Sunnis and Shiites simply rearming and biding their time ?
One bit of good news is that the country has not been physically partitioned into three sectarian cantons , as some predicted .
At least , not yet .
The current situation is " semiseparation , " says Mr. O'Hanlon .
He estimates that about half of the possible ethnic cleansing that could occur in mixed neighborhoods , has .
Today Baghdad neighborhoods are separated by miles of security walls and blast barriers .
" If you get an [ Iraqi ] security force that is capable enough , get a couple of rounds of elections , more economic growth , there is a chance to take down those barriers , " says O'Hanlon .
But it is only a chance , and a small one at that , he says .
The worst - case scenario would be a return to the levels of violence of 2006 – times two .
With such a resumption " at some point you would have complete ethnic cleansing , " he says .
Iran ascends while US bogged down
Iran is one nation that seems poised to gain from Iraq 's current situation .
As Iraq 's largest neighbor and a Shiite Muslim state , it has close ties with the current Shiite - dominated Iraqi government .
Hussein and his Sunni-led regime , with whom Iran fought one of the bitterest regional wars of the late 20th century , is gone .
That does not mean Iran now wants Iraq to remain weak and unstable .
To the contrary , Tehran has good reason to work for a stable and democratic Iraq , Iranian analysts say .
" In the next five years , Iraq should be united , with a Shiite government , without American troops , but with good relations with Iran and more secure , " says Amir Mohebian , political editor of the conservative Resalat newspaper in Tehran .
At the moment , the US presence in Iraq is in Iran 's interest , he says , to prevent radical Wahhabi Sunnis from helping Sunni insurgents form a Sunni state .
But that does not mean Tehran needs to make things easy for US forces , he adds .
Many US officials have accused Iran of passing lethal weaponry to an array of anti-US resistance groups .
Iran 's strategic view is one of Tehran ascending , while the US remains bogged down in Iraq and hamstrung regionally by its pro-Israel policies .
" Now the US in Iraq is better for Iran , but [ America ] should not be secure , not be victorious , " says Mr. Mohebian .
Turkey worries about Iraq disunity
Meanwhile , to Iraq 's north , Turkey also sees a united Iraq as being in its own national interest .
If Iraq splits too much along sectarian lines , Turkey 's own restive Kurdish minority might be tempted to join with northern Iraq 's Kurds in a greater Kurdistan .
That would be Ankara 's worst - case scenario .
On the other hand , " the best scenario from the perspective of Turkey would be a territorially integral Iraq , one that is the same in terms of its current borders , " says Faruk Logoglu , a former Turkish ambassador to the US who is president of the Eurasian Strategic Studies Center , a think tank based in Ankara that is considered close to the military .
Iraq is likely to adopt a federal system , with considerable power and authority delegated outside Baghdad .
Turkey is fine with that , as long as Iraq 's Kurds do not aid or shelter PKK Kurdish rebels .
There is already quite a bit of economic interaction between Turkey and northern Iraq , point out Turkish analysts .
" A stable Iraq would open opportunities for Turkey , " says Lale Sariibrahimoglu , defense affairs columnist for Today 's Zaman , a Turkish English - language daily .
" Turkey would benefit as a transit route for Iraq 's oil and natural gas resources . "
Some analysts worry that a weak Iraq will become a regional battleground , with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states rushing to bolster Sunni militias in a proxy war with Shiite Iran .
That 's just one of the ways that Iraq 's current problems might affect the larger region .
" The issue now , tragically , is not what happens in Iraq , but whether the damage is limited to Iraq or spreads to other countries in the region , " says James Steinberg , dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas .
The US , basically , is still going it alone in Iraq , says Professor Steinberg .
It needs to do more to try and involve other countries and the United Nations , as it has in Afghanistan .
Iraqis : Time can heal divisions
Iraqi officials themselves say they simply need time – both to learn their own approach toward democracy and to develop Iraqi forces capable of securing their own country .
" Iraq is like a sheet that has been ripped .
It will take time to reunite the fabric back together , " says Gen .
Naseer al - Abadi , deputy chief of staff for Iraq 's armed forces .
The military surge has helped control violence , says General Abadi .
Now the government needs to provide services and jobs .
That does not mean the war is over , he adds .
The US and the Iraqi government are not even fighting an enemy , in the traditional sense .
" There is no center of gravity that you can hit to win the war , " he says .
And the terrorists of Al Qaeda in Iraq might be a continuing problem , notes the Iraqi deputy chief of staff .
The pool of willing Islamic militants in the Middle East is a deep one .
Infiltration into Iraq is easy .
" Remnants will always be there , " says Abadi .
How long will ' success ' take ?
Taking all these factors into account , success in Iraq at this point might be defined as a unified country that does not offer sanctuary to Islamic militants and is governed by a stable regime that is not under the influence of a hostile foreign power , such as Iran .
That , for example , is the bottom line of Andrew Krepinevich , a veteran Army planner and now president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
Reaching this relatively stable state could take another three to five years – if it can be reached at all .
Even then , the US might need to keep a substantial number of troops in the country – to keep Iraq 's internal factions from going after one another and to protect the nation from its external enemies .
" A reasonable outcome would find something like 30,000 to 40,000 troops in Iraq for 25 to 50 years , " says Dr. Krepinevich in an e-mail .
After all , the US has deployed troops in Germany and Japan for 63 years , and Korea for 57 .
Might Iraq , in the end , require a commensurate commitment ?
• Contributing to this report were Monitor staffer Scott Peterson ( Iran ) and correspondents Sam Dagher ( Iraq ) , Josh Mitnick ( Israel ) , and Yigal Schleifer ( Turkey ) .
The poll found that Americans blame government officials for the crisis more than banks or home buyers and other borrowers .
Forty percent of respondents said regulators were mostly to blame , while 28 percent named lenders and 14 percent named borrowers .
In assessing possible responses to the mortgage crisis , Americans displayed a populist streak , favoring help for individuals but not for financial institutions .
A clear majority said they did not want the government to lend a hand to banks , even if the measures would help limit the depth of a recession .
“ What I learned from economics is that the market is not always going to be a happy place , ” Sandi Heller , who works at the University of Colorado and is also studying for a master ’s degree in business there , said in a follow - up interview .
If the government steps in to help out , said Ms. Heller , 43 , it could encourage banks to take more foolish risks .
“ There are a million and one better ways for the government to spend that money , ” she said .
Respondents were considerably more open to government help for home owners at risk of foreclosure .
Fifty - three percent said they believed the government should help those whose interest rates were rising , while 41 percent said they opposed such a move .
The nationwide telephone survey of 1,368 adults was conducted from March 28 to April 2 .
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
When the presidential campaign began last year , the war in Iraq and terrorism easily topped Americans ’ list of concerns .
Almost 30 percent of people in a December poll said that one of those issues was the country ’s most pressing problem .
About half as many named the economy or jobs .
But the issues have switched places in just a few months ’ time .
In the latest poll , 17 percent named terrorism or the war , while 37 percent named the economy or the job market .
When looking at the current state of their own finances , Americans remain relatively sanguine .
More than 70 percent said their financial situation was fairly good or very good , a number that has dropped only modestly since 2006 .

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) Coverage : Canadians greet Karl Rove with charges of 9/11 being an inside job !
No US media coverage ?
When a former President ’s aid is greeted in a friendly nation by protesters claiming he had a role in the most horrific attack on the United States in modern history , and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation covers it . . . would n’t that be a newsworthy item for US media ?
One would think so if they lived in a democracy with a vibrant fourth estate .
However if they lived in a corporatocracy , they sadly would accept that media was part of a new propaganda art , that enables the rule of corporate government over people 's needs for truth .
" F ascism is the marriage of state and corporate power . "
-- Benito Mussolini , Italian Fascist Dictator
However , most Americans are increasingly becoming savvy to the fact that US media is a glorified propaganda ministry owned by weapons industries and other corporate interests who profit from war , the illness of Americans via endless pharmaceutical ads , and flawed elections in the form of endless media ads for candidates which shine NO light and only generate divisive HEAT .
In the past weeks we ’ve seen a former Italian Prime Minister accuse the US government of complicity in 9/11 , we ’ve seen the Japanese opposition leader grill the Japanese Prime Minister about 9/11 being an inside job on national television for nearly 30 minutes , we ’ve seen a 9/11 truth documentary and panel discussion held at the European Parliament , we ’ve seen country music icon Willie Nelson accuse the Bush Administration of complicity in 9/11 . . . and what have we seen the US media report on these earth - shaking events ?
[ Videos to these US media censored stories on page 2 of this article .
SHARE THEY WIDELY !!]
The same coverage they ’ve given to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ’s report of Karl Rove being accused by Canadians of 9/11 being an inside job – ZERO , ZILCH , NADA .
Folks , the cat is out of the bag .
Corporate media in America , and too much of alternative media is not media . . . it is part of the most grossly obvious cover up machine in modern history .
Perhaps some is out of ignorance , and some out of cowardice , but the result is the same .
No one who takes time to read all of David Ray Griffin ’s books can possibly not have questions about the 9/11 events , unless they simply have no natural drive to know truth .
The holes in the official story are too big , too gross , to avoid .
So , what can we do to break this media blockade ?
We must be innovative and creative .
We have to look for opportunities , and grab them .
Opportunities that corporate media ca n’t stop and sweep under the rug .
On January 22nd , New York Times best selling novelist , Steve Alten ’s explosive new edu-tainment thriller “ The Shell Game ” hit bookstores all over America .
Despite a virtual media blockade , with the help of 9/11 activists spreading the word , writing opeds , posting on blogs , and linking to it from websites , this book rose to # 31 on the NY Times best seller list two weeks ago .
Alten linked his book on amazon.com to David Ray Griffin ’s new book to get it more exposure .
His www.TheShellGame.net website is linked to most major 9/11 truth websites .
He spent most of his advance creating two 90 second book trailers that warn of a coming false flag operation inflicted on Americans by the White House to fool them into war with Iran , making it more and more difficult for this Administration to execute such a strike , as activists spread these trailers widely through the internet .
IF 9/11 truth seeking Americans spread the word on this important book , “ The Shell Game ” widely and relentlessly it can easily go to # 1 , even if mainstream media purposely ignores it .
Once there they will be unable to turn away from it , or its author .
Why do we need that ?
Because this is what Alten has told Americans when on mainstream media interviews :
“. . . they [ the majority of Americans ] shall come to realize what I now realize … that the 9/11 Truth Movement are the real patriots in 21st century America ! "
-- Steve Alten , New York Times Best Selling Novelist ( author of “ The Shell Game ” )
More Americans need to hear this , plus Alten ’s demands for a new 9/11 investigation .
We can expand this message and the number of Americans hearing it , by SPREADING THE WORD on “ The Shell Game . ”
But David Axelrod , chief strategist to Mr. Obama , argues that any Democratic nominee will be subject to the same withering attacks on values and character .
Image Michael S. Dukakis , right , and Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 .
Credit ... Elise Amendola / Associated Press
“ The question , ” Mr. Axelrod said , “ is whether given the abysmal state of our economy , given the war , given all the challenges that people sense we face that have led George Bush to have the lowest rating ever , do you believe that voters are going to be distracted from the fundamental need for change ?
I think the answer to that is no . ”
In fact , as Mr. Axelrod suggests , these are very different times .
Twenty years ago , the nation was in an era of comparative peace and prosperity ; a sense of crisis did not hang over the election .
Today , with the war in Iraq in its sixth year and the economy stumbling , more than 8 in 10 Americans say the country is on the wrong track .
A new generation of voters have entered the electorate , who may not be as susceptible to values issues .
In such a climate , it would presumably be far more difficult than in 1988 to keep the campaign focused on symbolic , values - related issues , or matters of personality .
There are differences , as well , in the political skills of the candidates then and today : Mr. Obama rose to national prominence largely on the basis of his oratorical skills , and has never been accused of lacking vision ; Mr. Dukakis based his campaign on a prosaic promise of managerial competence and “ good jobs at good wages . ”
And yet , some veterans of past Democratic campaigns say , there are similarities , as well .
Even with so many big issues at stake this time around , the race between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton has often been focused on questions of values , background and character  witness the recent fixation on Mr. Obama ’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , or the continued unfounded rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim .
Like Mr. Dukakis in 1988 , Mr. Obama is relatively new to the national scene , and thus vulnerable to being defined by Republican attacks .
And like Mr. Dukakis , Mr. Obama lacks experience with the politics of wedge issues on a national stage .

Since its establishment B’Tselem has published testimonies , comprehensive reports and regular updates on human rights violations in the Occupied Territories .
The impact and power of the written word are greatly amplified when coupled with visual documentation .
Images provide a direct experience that cannot be ignored , compelling the viewer to face reality and see the violent routine of life under occupation .
In 2005 , B’Tselem created a video department with a view to incorporating visual imagery into its work of documenting human rights abuses in the Occupied Territories .
The department ’s early work was producing and publishing short documentary videos .
About two years later , we launched the B’Tselem Camera Project .
B’Tselem provides video cameras and training to Palestinians living in the West Bank , helping them become citizen journalists .
They document life under the occupation and human rights abuses and publicize this material , either through B’Tselem or independently .
By participating in the project , B’Tselem volunteers acquire skills that contribute to their fight for their own human rights as well as those of their communities and allow them to document daily life under the occupation .
Since the Camera Project was launched , video documentation has become a staple of B’Tselem ’s work .
Thanks to footage shot by the project ’s volunteers , serious human rights violations committed by Israel in the Occupied Territories have been widely covered by both local and international media .
This , in turn , has helped bring to public attention – even if briefly – incidents that would not have gotten any coverage whatsoever if it were not for the presence of cameras .
In several cases , footage even played a role in the fight against the whitewashing policy practiced by civilian and military Israeli law enforcement agencies which , as a general rule , avoid taking any measures against security forces personnel or settlers who harm Palestinians .
Thanks to the documentation , Israeli civilian and military law enforcement agencies simply could not deny what had happened and were forced to face the facts .
In 2009 , B’Tselem ’s Camera Project won the One World Media award for its ground - breaking work in citizen journalism .
In 2012 , the project was awarded first prize in the Freeform Documentary category of the Israeli Documentary Filmmakers Forum documentary film competition .
In 2009 , B’Tselem began producing documentary and cinematic projects as well .
In 2010 , we produced Gaza – An Inside Look , a project in which Palestinians describe life in the Gaza Strip a year after Operation Cast Lead .
In 2011 , in partnership with The Guardian , B’Tselem produced Living in East Jerusalem .
The interactive project showcased personal video diaries by two Israelis and four Palestinians about the daily struggles of living in East Jerusalem .
In 2015 , we produced Smile and the World Will Smile Back .
The award - winning short film has been screened in many film festivals and was even nominated for the European Film Awards .
In 2017 , B’Tselem produced video diaries by two of B’Tselem ’s women volunteers who live in the Jordan Valley ( A Weekend Visit Home and A Dream that Will Never Come True ) .
Our short film The Boy from H2 was also released in 2017 .
It premiered at the Berlinale , where it took part in the short film competition , and has since been screened in many other important international film festivals .
In 2012 , we launched the video blog My Own Private Gaza .
Filmed by Khaled al - ‘ Azayzeh , B’Tselem ’s field researcher in the southern Gaza Strip , it offers a glimpse of what it is like to live in Gaza .
Our video department maintains a rich and unique archive containing thousands of hours of raw footage , testimonies and photographic materials from throughout the Occupied Territories .
The archival material is available to the public .
It is used by filmmakers , journalists , academics , students and other individuals interested in learning about life under occupation .

hat are the differences ( physical and spiritual ) between kielbasa and Italian sausage ?
pice ( Paprika vs. Oregano ) and collective guilt about the holocaust .
Unless you 're speaking metaphorically about my dick .
hat is your reaction to the following quote ?
" I'm at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life .
In fact , I 've just had a mirror put over my kitchen table . "
- Rodney Dangerfield , 1980
addyshack was my favorite American comedy until Shakes the Clown .
Mr.. Dangerfield 's comments notwithstanding , my life is at the stage where work has replaced everything else , including sex .
For this reason , I feel like quitting the racket and opening a snotty little cafe with my buddy David Yow where we can cook what we like and serve it to a handful of discriminating guests .
an you think of a way to utilize the top of a pineapple ?
n Associated Press style , " utilize " means " to press into service in a manner not usual or intended . "
Since pineapple tops ' only usual or intended uses are to top off pineapples and Latin showgirls , anything done with one would satisfy your question .
Let 's try poking one up a Spin Doctor 's ass ... Neat .
Now let 's try sticking it in the eye of one of those tiresome " love rockers " on the " K " label or down the throat of some dreadful New Zealander pop whiner ... Ohh , splendid !
Now let 's pulverize it as a source of cellulose fiber for making paper and textiles ...
Not as much fun as wholesale deforestation of old - growth timberlands .
Can we force it on \ the gullible music scenesters as a fashion accessory by saying it represents the rebirth of the feminist aesthetic ?... Yes ! Grrrl Styllle .
lease tell us about a memorable experience you have had in a restraunt .
f by " restraunt " you mean " restaurant , " then I can relay the following two anecdotes .
A : Bob Weston , his squeeze Carter Nicole Launt , their friend Tara and I were eating at one of Chicago 's many Greek bistros .
One specific busboy / water glass filler / greasy little man-of - perplexing ethnicity made it a point of brushing Nicole 's boob or shoulder when he refilled her water glass ( which he did about every 22 seconds ) .
She noticed and we all watched him do it .
Then I noticed that he was turning his body in such a way that his actual pecker was what was rubbing her as he leaned over .
I did n't say anything , so they 're reading about it for the first time .
B : Julia Child visited the kitchen of an overly snobby expensive restaurant where a friend of mine worked .
The chef there was an old acquaintance of hers , and he was a little drunk .
He was showing off to the staff , trying to impress everyone by being chummy with The J .
In the 1970's , after a bout with breast cancer , one of Julia 's boobs had been cut off , and this guy knew which one .
There , in full view of the patrons and staff , he poked a fork at her prosthetic boob and bit at it , making mock gobbling and biting sounds .
f all the bands you have worked with in the studio , which one had the most interesting or unusual eating habits while they recorded ?
Please describe .
he band Ut , three strange women and a hired - gun drummer , drank a ridiculous number of medicinal herbal teas ( including a sage infusion that stank like old socks ) , depending on the mood that each song required and the state of their individual hormones and menstrual cycles .
Mike Greenless , drummer of the band Tar , vomits often .
He does not enjoy it , but his stomach seems to reject any food with either color or flavor .
Polly Harvey ( PJ Harvey ) ate nothing but potatoes , with occasional sauces , during the entire recording of her Rid of Me album .
KK Null of the ferocious Japanese band Zeni Geva had , over the course of a two hour celebratory dinner , the following : whole tiny fish ( raw ) , slimy transparent algae strands , raw horse meat , fish sperm sacs , soup with spherical croutons made from tofu scum ( " Fu " ) and " Natto , " a pile of uncooked rotten moldy soybeans mixed with raw egg .
Many rock musicians are excellent cooks , I 've found , and those that are prefer to eat their own cooking in the studio .
I encourage this behavior as I also enjoy the benefits of fresh food .
The best rock music chefs follow , in descending order of excellence : Laura Fuckin ' Carter ( Jack o Nutz , also Bar b que Killers ) is a head chef at a gourmet restaurant in Athens , Georgia .
Her best dish is Trout Wellington , which she invented and perfected .
It is a whole brook or large rainbow trout baked in a puff pastry and served with light sauces .
David Yow ( The Jesus Lizard , Scratch Acid ) who has been a chef at several restaurants in Austin , Texas and Chicago .
His best dishes are Whiskey Chicken and Large Number of Vegetables Soup , both of which he invented .
Pete Conway ( Flour , Rifle Sport ) can make palatable food out of anything .
He wins the frugality and versatility badge .
I have seen him cook a week 's worth of meals , catering to three different diets ( one vegan , one fish - sensitive and one carnivore ) with nothing but a stone and two twigs in the kitchen .
escribe your last two relationships with women in terms of food .
will assume you mean sexual relationships .
The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her .
As is the case with most vegetarians , she had never eaten properly prepared meat , only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh .
Since I really only enjoy food ripped off the carcasses of dumber , weaker species , she got to see a wide variety of meats prepared in many ghoulish fashions .
Eventually , her curiosity overwhelmed her , she tried some and now eats all manner of dead things .
The relationship immediately prior to that one was very short lived , and pretty much devoid of any interaction other than a range of sexual activities , including several that might fall under the " gourmet " or " glutton " mastheads .
Let 's just say I was probably her most significant source of protein .
f you could ask any animal a question about their eating experiences and get a subjective answer , what would this question be ?
t really bothers me when people misuse the pronouns " they " and " their " .
The non-specific third - person pronouns are " he " and " his " .
If you wish to avoid offending the dogmatic imbeciles who claim such pronouns imply cultural sexism , then change all your sentences to the plural and you may use " they " and " their " to your coddling , timid , bleeding heart 's content .
It amazes me sometime the length people will go in order to take offense at something , jettisoning perfectly understandable plain English for coquettishly popular and faddish political reasons .
The answer to the question you thought you had posed is this :
Of a dung beetle I would ask , " Why bother ? "
Of a tapeworm , " Do you ever wish you could dine in a more formal setting ? "
ose a food related question to any dead person .
We will do our best to come up with an answer .
.L. Mencken loved hearty , simple food .
He often wrote of his fondness for the shellfish and other seafood from the Baltimore and Chesapeake bays .
He fondly recounted many memorable meals of beef and game , and wrote of his appreciation for beer and strong liquor .
He also detested snobbery and pretense .
I would like to hear his thoughts on the nouvelle cuisine , that silly cul - de-sac of bad taste which substituted tiny food on small plates painted with sauces in place of a meal .
I would also like to hear his thoughts on the dreadful trend away from using even moderate amounts of oil or butter in cooking .
In my opinion , this sort of dry , dismal non-cuisine is for people whose fear of their own mortality has trumped their common sense and common senses .
[ H.L. Mencken Responds ]
escribe the most enjoyable meal you have ever had .
wo memories spring to mind .
A : When I was 19 , I worked as a T - shirt screen printer .
One payday , when I could no longer hack the horrible working conditions and minuscule pay , I quit .
It took me a week or two to find another job .
The new job had a delayed pay period ­ that is I got paid for two weeks work after an additional two weeks passed ­ and I realized that I would have no vittles money for a month .
I bought a huge bag of rice and a huge bag of pinto beans , and I lived on them for a month .
Four weeks later , on the evening of my first payday , I spent about an hour in the grocery store , picking out the most fantastic sirloin steak and vegetables , and cooked the best meal anyone in the world had ever eaten .
Then I ritualistically threw the remainder of the rice and beans out the window and composed this song :
" The Anti-Rice and Beans League Theme "
I do n't like rice ( da - da da da )
I do n't like beans ( da - da da da )
I wo n't eat them together .
( I have n't knowingly eaten rice and beans at the same time since . )
B : In 1989 , in Ljubljana , Yugoslavia , I ordered Steak Tartare .
The Chef rolled up a cart to our table , allowed me to select a cut of beautifully aged beef , lifted a pair of cleavers , and with a musician 's fluidity , chopped it into a puree as smooth as butter .
He then did the same with some garlic cloves , black peppercorns and a bouquet of herbs .
He then blended the ingredients with the cleavers , adding a raw egg , a lemon segment and a bit of salt .
He spiced the meat with some paprika and spread a dab on a crouton for my approval .
I do n't think I have ever been fed so graciously or eaten as well .
o you have any dietary advice for young bands trying to establish themselves ?
void any food that comes packaged in a sauce .
Buy groceries and feed yourself , even on the road .
Road food is terrible because the roadside eateries know the feeders will be hundreds of miles away before heartburn or diarrhea set in .
For less than the cost of a Big Mac , fries and a Coke , you can buy a loaf of fresh bread and some good cheese or roast beef , which you will enjoy much more .
ompare the advent of digital recording to an event in the history of food or agriculture .
ayonnaise is as it is now known a bastardization of the Sauce Mayonnaise every saucier learns to make his first season as an apprentice .
Pre - packaged mayonnaise sold in jars is almost nothing but tasteless vegetable oil and water , emulsified by gum and gelatin .
I think this product is analogous in many ways to the CD , and it 's introduction has degraded the standard of eating in much the same way digital recording has degraded the standard of music .
Here is a recipe anyone can use to make a wonderful Sauce Mayonnaise :
Into a stationary blender , crack one egg .
Add an extra egg yolk , one garlic clove , a strong quarter teaspoon of cayenne ( or a teaspoon of white pepper ground very fine ) and either a slight teaspoon of salt or a tablespoon of Tamari soy sauce .
Blend at high speed until the garlic is finely divided and the egg begins to froth .
With the blender still running , trickle in good olive oil until the mayonnaise thickens and will accept no more oil .
( this will vary , but will usually be about a cup . )
Stop the blender and add a tablespoon of good vinegar OR the juice of half a lemon .
Fold the mayonnaise once or twice with a spatula , which will loosen it considerably .
Pulse the blender until the thick consistency returns .
Taste
If the mayonnaise tastes oily , add more acid ( vinegar or lemon juice only .
Never combine the two , as this makes for a weird bilious aftertaste ) .
Chill covered for at least 15 minutes .
I often add a tablespoon of fresh or dried dill or thyme at the beginning of the process .
Do n't add the acid at the beginning , as this can prevent the eggs from emulsifying .
The global exhibition market has been growing .
Some experts predict it ’s going to reach over $ 50 billion in the next few years .
That ’s in addition to other trade shows , conferences , and conventions .
Many in - person events are currently on ice , but people are still planning events .
Some are taking them online , while others are putting their plans in place for 2021 .
If you ’re doing convention planning for the very first time , you may feel a little overwhelmed .
There ’s no need to worry , though .
With these eight genius tips , you ’ll be well on your way to creating a showstopping event .
1. Create a Business Plan for the Conference
Perhaps the most important of all convention planning tips is to start with a plan .
In fact , you should create a business plan for your conference or convention .
A business plan will allow you to outline your vision and your goals for the convention .
You can also set a budget , create a marketing strategy , and more .
Business plans also include an analysis of your risks , as well as opportunities .
This is a chance to look at your competition .
Are there other , better - established events ?
What about other events on your planned date ?
Is there enough interest in the subject or industry ?
2. Select the Right Venue
The next step is going to be picking the right venue for your event .
Location is key , especially if you think you ’ll have people coming in from out of town .
It also has an impact on your budget .
If you ’re hosting a large event , then a convention center may be your best bet .
Many are easily accessed and located close to transportation .
Your attendees will have an easy time getting to them , even if they ’re coming in from out of town .
A smaller venue might be better if this is a first - year event or a small - scale conference .
You might want to look at local hotels or other potential venues to host your event .
You can also take your event online , which may be an excellent option for planners today .
Keep in mind that your choice of venue may also have an impact on what you can do in the space .
AVL companies can help you design something that will work for any space .
3. Communication Is Central to Convention Planning
Communication is key at all levels .
You ’ll need to be prepared for changes every step of the way .
It ’s important to keep in touch with the venue , as well as your production partners .
You ’ll also need to keep attendees and vendors in the loop .
Volunteers , security , and staff must also stay up to date on what ’s happening .
Early communication keeps everyone on the same page .
You should also be clear about policies such as refunds and more .
Clarifying these policies early and communicating them will reduce potential confusion .
4. Reach out to Speakers Early
Once you ’ve found your venue and set your date , it ’s time to find speakers and guests to attend your event .
Give yourself as much lead time as possible .
You may need time to research appropriate speakers , as well as to make contact with them .
Negotiating the terms of the booking can also take some time .
Many speakers have crowded calendars , so reaching out early can help you ensure you ’ll get a spot .
It also shows respect for the speaker ’s time and schedule .
It may also allow you to build connections with people who could become speakers at your event .
This could be helpful for following years or even if you have to fill a slot after a last - minute cancelation .
5. Build Unique Content
While you ’re reaching out to guest speakers for your event , you ’ll also want to pay attention to the content you ’re building .
You want to provide something unique at your conference .
Getting the right guest speakers is a step in the right direction .
Think about unique presentations and the subjects people are interested in .
Could you host a workshop for people who are interested in learning more ?
Also , think about networking events .
Unique opportunities here , such as an informal brunch or pub run , could help make your event a smash hit with attendees .
6. Promote the Event
Now it ’s time to promote your convention or conference .
You built a marketing strategy and budget into your business plan , so be sure to revisit those points .
Promotion can take many forms .
You may want to advertise on LinkedIn or other social media networks .
Websites that cater to your demographic are also good targets for advertising .
Think about industry - specific publications , local newspapers , and more .
There are plenty of ways to promote the event .
You ’ll also want to think about ways to get people talking .
Can you offer a discount or a free gift when people sign up ?
7. Look for Pain Points
Now it ’s time to put yourself in someone else ’s shoes .
Think about your attendees , your vendors , and your sponsors .
What pain points do they have ?
Potential attendees may be having trouble with accommodations or getting from a train station to your location .
How can you solve this for them ?
What about the price point of entry ?
Is there some way to help attendees overcome this challenge ?
Vendors may have questions about security in the convention space .
The use of power or availability of Internet may be another concern .
Be sure to address these points , and you ’ll help everyone have a better time at the convention .
8. Use Technology to Increase Engagement
Finally , think about how you ’ll use technology to engage your attendees .
Many convention planners are using apps to help attendees see schedules and connect with each other .
Your AVL company partner is another resource here .
They can help you make interesting presentations that keep people on the edge of their seats .
Even video conferencing technology can help you create engaging content to keep everyone engaged .
Planning for Success
Convention planning can be time - intensive and full of challenges .
These eight tips will help you start planning your most successful event yet .

It was after writing the title to this article that I realized it ’s not just TV that is n’t fun anymore .
Almost NOTHING is fun anymore !
In the 50s and 60s people were positive .
Wow !
We live in the Twentieth Century !
Hallelujah !
The Space Race is GO !
We ’re going to the moon !
Cars are V8 two - tone convertibles with bigger tailfins every year !
Let ’s grab a burger and Coke and take in a movie at the drive - in !
Listen to the radio !
The music ’s fun !
Les Paul and Mary Ford !
How high the moon !
The Beach Boys !
California Girls !
TV is fun to watch !
Maverick , Ed Sullivan , The Monkees , The Honeymooners , I Love Lucy .
They ’re all fun !
Even the US pavilion at Expo 58 in Brussels is fun !
And we ’ll have fun , fun , fun till the Grinches take our optimism away …
Fast forward to the 21st century .
Now what ?
Cars are n’t fun anymore .
No big red and white convertibles , no tailfins , no fun .
Now cars are either drab - colored pokey little boxes that all look identical , or else they ’re SUVs and Hummers and we are supposed to hate their owners because they ’re destroying the ozone or the planet or something .
Radio is full of talk shows with constantly complaining hosts taking calls from a miserable whining public .
And what does TV offer ?
South Park , CSI , and Dancing with the Stars .
Whatever these shows may provide it ’s not “ fun . "
Neither are the shows that depict people ’s insides being dismantled !
And look at grumpy Hugh Laurie on House , and disparaging Simon Cowell on American Idol .
Funny Lucy ’s out and miserable curmudgeons are in !
And the commercials !
People used to enjoy smoking and actually did it onscreen !
“ I ’d rather fight than switch , " “ It ’s a whole ‘ nother smoke . "
Sure , we knew that smoking was n’t good for you but we did n’t get all in a knot about it !
Nowadays we are fed an endless stream of information about what ’s wrong with us and what we need to buy to make it right .
Available are Advair , Aleve and Ambien ; Celebrex , Cialis , Claritin and Crestor ; Flomax , Lipitor , Valtrex and Viagra , just to mention the few I ’ve noticed .
After pinpointing a perceived problem , these commercials feature earnest actors or voiceovers delivering grave warnings about all the terrible things that could happen if you do use the product .
If you do n’t die from the disease the side effects of the drug could make your life a living hell anyway !
Whatever happens you ’re on the way out !
It ’s useless .
Living is worse than dying .
What ’s the point ?
Even if you survive the diseases and the drugs your life is going to be so unhappy that you might as well give up right now .
The modern message seems to be that we ’re all going to die any day now — not long after the last polar bear dies from drowning or eating a mercury - tainted fish or something !
If it ’s not pollution that kills us it ’ll be global warming or cooling or listening to Al Gore bore us to death .
The last thing we must do is joke about any of it because life is dead serious do n’t you know ?
And then there ’s the economy !
Although the standard of living is the highest that human beings have enjoyed since Atlantis the populace sees nothing but gloom .
If gloom is here can doom be far behind ?
Of course most of this gloom is started by government telling us about all the things that we should be worried about and that only they can fix — with the use of our money of course .
Terrorists , sexual predators , pesticides , light bulbs , cell phones , cigarettes , fast food , cholesterol , SUVs , asbestos , lead paint — is there anything that is n’t a hazard and needs a government program to correct ?
C’mon folks , lighten up !
Try to put some fun back in your lives !
By your own admission you ai n’t gonna be here much longer so you might as well get what little enjoyment you can while you can .
As for me , I live near one of the last remaining drive - in theatres in the country so I know where I ’ll be going tonight .
Of course that ’s if I can find a movie that ’s not about serial killers or pregnant teens or parental abuse or the end of the world or …

Why Not Just Drink It ?
Vodka has been enjoyed since at least the early Middle Ages , and is well known as one of the world 's most popular spirits .
Its versatility in mixing and high alcohol content have made it extremely popular in cocktails , and it is still widely enjoyed ' neat ' ( straight up ) in much of Eastern and Northern Europe .
Vodka also has a long history of use as medicine , having been sold by druggists to cure everything from infertility to colic and the plague .
While some of those historic promoters were half - cocked , it 's true that vodka has a wide range of potential uses beyond serving as a relaxer and social lubricant .
Why would you want to do anything else with vodka but drink it ?
It is widely available , effective and less toxic than many of the chemical alternatives you might use for these tasks .
A FEW years ago , researchers in Montreal produced a disturbing finding .
By the simple act of neglecting her young , a mother rat could permanently change the expression of genes in her offspring .
Dams that licked their pups only infrequently — the rat equivalent of bad maternal care — sent their little ones off into the world with a more anxious disposition than rats with dams that had lavished care on them .
What is more , this lack of attention , the researchers discovered , had chemically altered a gene controlling an important stress hormone .
It was a striking case of how nurture affects nature .
And it made the researchers curious about whether the same could be happening in humans .
Now , by studying the brains of suicide victims , they have begun to explore that question .
The field they are investigating is known as epigenetics .
This is the interface between our genes , which are fixed , and our environment , which is ever - changing .
Although people are born with a complement of genes that they are stuck with for life , those genes can be switched on and off — and this can make a world of difference .
All the more harrowing , then , that simple things like dietary supplements and stress have been shown capable of throwing the switch .
Moshe Szyf and his colleagues at McGill University knew that around a fifth of people who die by their own hand suffered abuse in childhood .
They found 13 such people whose brains had been donated to science , as well as the brains of 11 people who had died in accidents and had had normal happy childhoods .
They compared the two groups .
Dr Szyf and his team looked at a gene that codes for ribosomal RNA , which helps control the manufacture of proteins .
Protein synthesis is essential to the brain if it is going to generate new connections — in the process of learning something , say , or remembering it .
They were especially interested in a part of the brain , the hippocampus , which is known to be influential in mood .
Genes get switched off when a chemical mark , a methyl group , is added to the DNA .
When they examined these genes in the hippocampus , they discovered that , in the suicide group , many more of them had been methylated , or switched off ; “ frozen assets ” , says Dr Szyf .
In another part of the brain , the cerebellum , however , which is not involved in mood , there were no differences in the levels of methylation between the two groups .
This suggests that the hypermethylation in the suicide group was not just a general difference , says Dr Szyf , but rather a response to something specific , such as abuse suffered in childhood .
They published their findings this week in Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) ONE , an open - access scientific journal .
The research raises two big questions .
Can altered methylation patterns be somehow detected in blood samples ?
Dr Szyf thinks so .
He wonders if there may be clues in T cells , which are involved in immunity and which regularly communicate with the brain .
More important , though , if abuse in early life has caused hypermethylation , is whether there is any way to undo it .
An intervention could be social , he says , or nutritional , or with drugs .
Dr Szyf is hopeful : in the rats , at least , they were able to intervene and turn things around .
Here 's a bit of advice for anyone who 's considering starting an x86 processor design shop from scratch : do n't .
The case of secretive chip startup Montalvo is illustrative here : we got wind of the low - power x86 play 's existence in February , and this past Friday brought news that the company is being acquired by Sun Microsystems .
Different reports have the company burning through between $ 73 million and $ 100 million in VC funding in its attempts to bring to market an x86 processor design for portables that features asymmetric cores — complex cores for heavy - duty tasks , and simpler ( and power - hungry ) core for lightweight tasks .
Montalvo faced long odds in its quest to carve out a niche for itself in the Intel - dominated x86 market .
In my earlier coverage of the company 's plans , my take on asymmetric chip multiprocessing as a power - saving " silver bullet " was this : " if someone actually does come up with a way to remix processor microarchitecture and / or the cache hierarchy that gives them , say , a 15 percent or greater performance - per - watt boost over Intel on mainstream consumer workloads , I 'll eat my hat .
And if the company that buys that winning lottery ticket happens to be Montalvo , I 'll eat your hat . "
So the Montalvo sale is good news for me , because it means there is no hat - eating in my immediate future .
Like Apple 's recent PA Semi acquisition , Sun 's purchase of Montalvo is all about engineering talent and intellectual property .
Sun gave a statement to CNet which confirms that any worthwhile ideas and technology that they can wring out of Montalvo will be rolled into future Sun processors .
Part of Sun 's statement to CNET also appears to give credence to a rumor , reported by The Register , that Montalvo was snapped up by Sun for the paltry sum of $ 5 million .
" We are not disclosing the terms of the deal as it is not material with respect to earnings per share , " Sun told CNet .
So the deal was n't big enough to have the kind of impact on the publicly - traded company 's EPS that would force it to announce the purchase price ; of course , this does n't mean that the $ 5 million number is accurate , but it does suggest that the total consideration was quite low .

The Liberation of Karmah , Part II
This is the second in a two - part series .
Read Part I here .
KARMAH , IRAQ --
The small city of Karmah sits between Fallujah and Baghdad , two Iraqi cities that have suffered more insurgent and terrorist violence than most .
Karmah , however , was more hard - hit than either .
It ’s right on the bleeding edge of Anbar Province where the outskirts of Baghdad taper away .
Unlike Fallujah , it has no hard perimeter to defend , nor was it considered a top priority for counterinsurgency operations .
Surge forces in Baghdad drove Al Qaeda in Iraq members out of the capital ’s neighborhoods and straight into Karmah during most of 2007 .
Al Qaeda in Iraq did in Karmah what they have done everywhere else – intimidated and murdered civilians into submission .
They decapitated police officers and placed severed heads all over the city .
They destroyed the homes of anyone who opposed them .
The message was clear :
This is what will happen to you if you work with the Americans .
The story in Karmah should be familiar by now .
Iraqis said no .
We will work with the Americans and drive you out of our country .
So many Stateside Americans still wonder aloud why mainstream Muslims refuse to stand up to terrorists , so apparently the story in Karmah – which is hardly unique to Karmah – is n’t familiar enough .
I joined Lieutenant Casey Alleman on a foot patrol in the city at dawn when the air was still cold and the sun cast long shadows .
Fewer Iraqis were out on the street .
Many were still sleeping or cooking breakfast at home .
Most stores were open , though , and the lieutenant ducked into a hardware store and bought several cans of blue spray paint .
I did n't ask what they were for because I assumed I 'd find out .
Even this city , of all cities , has gone quiet .
Saturation patrolling by Marines who live embedded in the community ’s neighborhoods stanched the terrorist outflow from Baghdad and purged the local insurgency ’s remnants .
The main market area downtown was recently re-opened to much ceremony and fanfare .
Marine veterans who had served in Karmah before can hardly believe their own eyes – a year ago Karmah was thought to be as dark as Mordor .
Our first official stop of the morning was at a grade school .
Children rushed to the windows to smile and wave as we walked up the steps .
A young boy came running out the front door with tears in his eyes and a bruise on his eyebrow .
A soft - faced teacher or administrator in his forties stepped outside to make sure the kid did n't run off too far .
“ He was in a fight , ” he said and opened his palms .
Lieutenant Alleman called out to his unit 's medic .
“ See if you can clean this kid up , ” he said .
Our medic cleaned the boy 's wound and gently applied a band - aid .
I stepped inside the school yard .
Hundreds of children saw me and the Marines , and the whole place erupted in screams of excitement .
It was as if Britney Spears or the guy from Coldplay had shown up .
The volume was just extraordinary and I took a few steps back in surprise .
Wildly screaming children jockeyed for position in front of my camera .
After a few minutes of pandemonium , teachers coaxed most of the kids into classrooms and left a few behind to pick up the trash and sweep the sidewalk around the courtyard .
“ Are they picking up the trash to impress us ? ” I said to Lieutenant Alleman .
It 's hard to say why , exactly , but that 's what it looked like .
“ Yeah , pretty much , ” he said .
“ We can get them to do it , but what we really need to do is get them to do it when we are n't here . ”
The schools are gender segregated by days of the week .
One day each school is for boys , and the next day the same school is for girls .
A few months ago the schools were opened again for the first time in years .
Much hay was made about girls being allowed to return to school in Afghanistan after the Taliban regime was demolished .
Hardly any Americans know that in the rougher cities of Iraq , neither girls nor boys could go to school for years because local rule by Al Qaeda was so oppressive and violent .
“ People just stared at us as recently as August , ” Lieutenant Alleman said .
“ They would n't , or could n't , engage us .
But when we started painting buildings and stuff like that people realized we were trying to help .
None of the schools were open when we got here [ last summer ] .
We helped them open up five .
It 's hard to hate someone who gives your kid candy and helps him get to school . ”
The lieutenant and I quickly popped into a classroom .
The kids cheered the lieutenant again .
I snapped a few pictures .
Lieutenant Casey Alleman in an Iraqi boys ' classroom
Their teacher asked them to remain seated .
Most of them did , but a few could n't restrain themselves .
We left in a hurry so we would n't be too much of a distraction .
Lieutenant Alleman had a brief meeting with the top administrator , and we were off .
The school kids were reluctant to clean up trash when Americans are n't looking , but Karmah 's adults are more grown - up about it , as should be expected .
“ We started a cleanup program a few months ago , ” the lieutenant said .
“ Now they 're doing it on their own .
You see these white buildings ?
We paid for the paint , and the owners went to work . ”
A recently painted building
Then I knew why he picked up cans of blue paint on the way to the school .
We stopped by a shop and said hello to the man who owned it and his sons who helped run it .
“ We have the paint I promised you , ” Lieutenant Alleman said .
He then asked the man to close the garage - style door so his Marines could paint it blue .
Brushed paint would have looked better than sprayed paint , but there was n’t any available that day .
As the Marines spray - painted the door , the Iraqis washed down a second door with a hose so the next round of paint would adhere better .
Two young boys ran up to us .
A Marine asked them how school was going .
“ Fuck school , ” one of them said .
He said it in English .
“ Give me your knife .
I want to kill my teacher . ”
Iraqis exaggerate and think this sort of thing is funny .
Last year in Ramadi I heard a kid ask an Army lieutenant to drive his Humvee over to the adjacent tribal area and kill everybody .
He was n’t serious .
He laughed and thought it was funny .
I did not find it funny , nor did the lieutenant .
It ’s especially not funny since this is Iraq where that kind of thing actually happens , though the violence is usually political or sectarian rather than tribal .
“ Where did you learn English ” I said .
“ From my teacher , ” the boy said .
“ The teacher you want to kill ? ” I said .
“ He taught you English and you want to kill him ? ”
Somebody needed to let this kid know this is no way to talk .
“ Mister , ” his friend said .
“ America good .
Iraq no good . ”
“ Iraq good , ” I said , though I do not believe it .
Iraq is in much better shape than it was a year ago , but it ’s still a terrible and often disturbing place .
I said “ Iraq good ” because I wanted to be polite .
It did n’t feel right to insult his country to his face while I was a guest , even if I would be agreeing with what he had already said .
I understand why Arabs sometimes say “ America good ” just to be nice .
I do n’t hold it against them or dismiss them as patently dishonest , not for this .
I had just done essentially the same thing , and for a similar reason .
The kid knew I was n’t sincere .
Perfunctory going - through - the - motions politeness is detectable across cultures .
I can often tell when I 'm getting that from Iraqis .
This kid knew the drill .
“ Iraq no good , ” he said again , this time with more force .
He would not hear otherwise from me .

Middle Easterners will rarely let you into their homes without feeding you – and if they put food in front of you , you have to eat it .
Abu Jabar Azabi was no different .
He greeted Lieutenant Alleman , the rest of the Marines , and me at the gate to his yard and sat us down on some benches he had put on the front lawn .
Chickens ran around on the grass .
“ I do n’t have food in the house , ” he said .
“ My son and I will go to a restaurant and get some for you . ”
He did not get food for himself or his family .
He only went and bought food for us .
Azabi lives in a new house because Al Qaeda destroyed his old one with a car bomb .
He refused to let them use his house as a sniper nest , so they blew it up .
He is lucky to be alive .
It goes without saying that he ’s no fan of the insurgency .
A photograph on his living room wall shows him posing with a squad of Marines .
He had to sell his farm , and he needed a job .
Lieutenant Alleman gave him a local garbage collection contract so he can make a living .
He is paid 300 dollars a week , which is around four times the average salary in the area .
His home was quite pleasant , as are most homes I ’ve been inside in Iraq .
It ’s strange .
Most Iraqi cities look terrible from the street .
Much of the country looks like a vast slum from the outside .
Private spaces are different .
Expensive carpets , personal computers , televisions , DVD players – all these things are fairly standard .
The Middle East is more communitarian than the West , but Iraq ’s urban design appears to be anti-social .
Most houses are surrounded by walls .
It can be a bit jarring while walking the streets , but it ’s comforting when you ’re inside .
Houses in Iraq are much more like “ castles ” than American houses , which comes in handy at times when terrorists and militiamen roam the streets .
After a half hour or so , Azabi came back with food .
He and his son placed kabobs , vegetables , bread , and French fries in front of us and left us alone while we ate .
None of us thought this was necessary , but Iraqis believe it is .
“ He does good work for us , ” Lieutenant Alleman said as he stuffed vegetables and grilled lamb into his bread .
“ At first he acted like he did n't want to be paid .
But before we hired him he told us he needed the money .
It was very confusing .
Then his son quietly asked us for the money when we were getting ready to leave .
It 's a pride thing , I guess .
This culture can be very confusing at first , but you get used to it . ”
The Marines ate in shifts .
Half sat at the table while the other half kept an eye on the neighborhood .
More than half the food was gone for the second shift , but that was okay .
When Private Jean sat down to eat , he did n’t want any .
“ Eat , Jean , ” Lieutenant Alleman said , “ or you 'll undo five months of work . ”
Everyone laughed .
Private Jean
“ The whole table ? ” Private Jean said .
He eyed the food with tremendous suspicion .
“ No , Jean , just eat a damn piece of meat , ” the lieutenant said .
“ Do I have to ? ”
“ Yes . ”
He settled on a French fry , which looked safer than meat .
You do n’t want to see or even think about the sanitary conditions in Iraq ’s kitchens , but despite what I ’ve seen I ’ve never been sick from the food .
After the food was finished , Azabi joined us at the table .
His sons , his wife , and his mother also came out to say hi .
Many Iraqi women stay in the background even in their own homes , but not every Iraqi family is so conservative .
Lieutenant Alleman could n’t have a proper meeting with Azabi , however , because we did not have an interpreter .
Lance Corporal Crask was designated our unofficial interpreter because he spoke Arabic better than the rest of us .
His accent sounded almost perfect to my ears , but he ’s not fluent yet .
Some topics had to be set aside for a later date .
Abu Jabar Azabi ( lower - left ) and his family
“ Azabi is the most accepting guy we 've met , ” Lieutenant Alleman said to me .
“ Do you get intel from him ? ” I said .
I assumed that ’s what this really was all about .
“ No , ” the lieutenant said .
“ It might put him in danger .
Occasionally we 'll ask if there are any Ali Babas around , and he 'll say no .
But we are going about recruiting him as an agent in the textbook way .
We just have n't actually done it .
It seems like there is always something he wants to tell us , but we have n’t yet figured out what it is . ”

Iraq ’s brief run of pleasant winter weather was ending .
Dark clouds rolled down over Mesopotamia from the mountains of Kurdistan .
The cold air and the dishrag gray sky made Karmah feel like London or Seattle before a storm .
I brought a rain poncho along just in case -- no way will I carry an umbrella around Iraq with Marines – and it looked like I was about to need it .
Sergeant Joseph Perusich brought me along on an evening patrol where he and his men wanted to investigate the “ local atmospherics ” and “ deny enemy activity . ”
Sergeant Joseph Perusich
“ How do you pronounce your name ? ” I said .
“ Per - OO - sitch , ” he said .
“ Where is it from ? ” I said .
I quietly guessed his name was from Russia .
“ It ’s Croatian , ” he said .
I was close .
“ My family is Croatian .
Slavic .
But it ’s also a Serbian name .
Most of the guys here just called me Sergeant P . It 's easier to pronounce and remember . ”
We walked along a nasty - looking canal , away from the city center , toward the outskirts of town and Karmah ’s undefined edge .
The city fades by increments into the countryside and the outskirts of Baghdad .
Our first stop was a blown - up former IED - maker 's house that I had asked to see .
“ It looked like this when we got here , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ It was definitely a bad guy 's house . ”
“ Look on the wall there , ” he said .
“ You can see where he drew a Humvee being hit with an IED . ”
Across the street was another destroyed house .
This one was blown up by Al Qaeda .
“ The Iraqi Police who work the checkpoint across the street used to live here , ” he said .
“ Al Qaeda drove a truck bomb right into it . ”
I believe the Marines who told me the fighting was worse in Karmah than in the more - famous nearby cities of Fallujah and Baghdad .
It is noticeably more ramshackle and battle - scarred than the larger towns that get so much more media coverage .
The Iraqi Police who manned the nearby checkpoint moved into a new house just down the street .
They were n’t about to let this one get taken out with a truck bomb .
The driveway was blockaded with gigantic Hesco barriers , which are basically sofa - sized “ sand bags ” wrapped in cardboard and wire .
Driving through those is impossible from a narrow and winding dirt road without a straight - shot “ runway ” leading up to the target .
Garbage and rubble was strewn about in the yard .
Windows were broken and sand - bagged .
Sergeant Perusich asked the officers on duty if they needed anything .
“ We need ammo , ” they said .
The Iraqi Police always seem to need ammunition .
They rarely pull the trigger anymore except when they shoot into the air , but they always complain of a shortage of bullets .
If the Americans left now and the insurgents returned in force , the insurgents would win for this reason alone .
No one can fight without bullets and a healthy supply line .
“ We ’ll get you some more ammo , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ Thank you , ” said the ranking Iraqi officer .
“ Thank you , and all Marines . ”
We continued down the dirt road , deeper into the ambiguously defined area between the suburbs and the countryside .
We were still in Karmah or not ?
I could n’t tell .
“ This road was terrible , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ There were so many IEDs . ”
“ It ’s easier to hide IEDs under dirt roads , ” he said .
“ Most of them were triggered by pressure plates , but some by command wire . ”
Command wire IEDs are more dangerous .
They ’re detonated manually by a trigger man , and can take out units on foot patrols as well as Marines mounted in Humvees .
An Iraqi man sat on the side of the road with his young son .
“ I love America ! ” he said .
“ I love America , too , ” one Marine said sarcastically .
I suppose he figured the Iraqi man was n’t sincere .
I could n’t tell one way or the other .
Some are sincere about this , and some are n’t .
Someone painted “ I Love You ” in English on a Jersey barrier
Another checkpoint was set up just ahead .
This was run by the Iraqi Civilian Watch .
These guys look like a rag - tag militia or posse , but they are n’t .
They have been deputized by the local authorities , though they ’re paid less than police officers and have limited training and duties .
Iraqi Civilian Watch checkpoint
Civilian watch groups did , however , start out as militias of sorts .
They sprang up spontaneously all over the place when the awakening movement began .
Al Qaeda ’s reign of terror in Iraq was just too much to bear .
Ordinary civilians decided they would rather stand up and face the insurgents with rifles than cower behind their own walls .
There was no real authority in this part of Iraq at the time , but if Al Qaeda were the actual government , the “ awakening ” could be described as an insurrection or revolution .
“ Do you guys need anything ? ” Sergeant Perusich said .
Iraqi Civilian Watch
“ Thank you , no , ” the leader of the civilian watch said .
“ Seen any suspicious people ? ”
“ Not lately , no .
Actually , though , we need more AK - 47s . ”
Iraqis often say they do n’t need anything before they say they need something .
They want to be independent , but they are n’t there yet .
They ’re trying to have it both ways .
“ And we need more lights and generators .
This place is dangerous . ”
Sergeant Perusich took notes and said he would be sure they got what they needed .
The Marines picked a side road at random and walked down it toward a small cluster of houses .
“ Let ’s check in on that one , ” Sergeant Perusich said and pointed toward the house at the end of the street .
“ You mean we ’re going in ? ” I said .
“ Yeah , ” he said .
“ But it ’s not a raid .
We ’ll just check in and see if they have anything they want to tell us . ”
A wild fox darted across the road right in front of me and scrambled into the reeds .
We reached the front door of the selected house and one of the Marines rapped on it hard .
A nervous - looking man answered .
“ Salam aleikum , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
Peace be upon you .
“ Tell him he ’s not in trouble , ” he said to our interpreter .
“ He can relax .
We just want to come in and talk . ”
A dozen pairs of shoes were placed just outside the front door .
The Marines walked in with their boots on .
So did I .
We could n’t go down to our socks – someone might shoot at us .
I took as few steps as possible inside the house , not wanting to track around too much dust .
Dark clouds outside threatened rain .
Soon the Iraqis would worry about tracking mud into the house .
Western Iraq is a sandbox , and the whole place is like a vast plain of chocolate pudding after a rain storm .
All the men and boys in the house were asked to move into a single room where they could be watched .
The Marines were n’t paranoid , but you never know .
The Iraqis understood and did n’t complain .
They still looked a bit nervous , though .
“ It ’s okay , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ Really , no one here is in trouble .
We just want to make sure everything is okay and see if you need anything . ”
“ You are welcome , ” said the man who answered the door .
The house was pleasant inside .
Expensive Turkish carpets covered the floors , as did plush pillows .
An enormous chandelier hung over the dining room table .
A large plasma TV was set up the living room next to a personal computer with surround - sound speakers .
Dainty tea glasses were carefully arranged in built - in cabinets .
“ What did you think of the ceremony yesterday ? ” Sergeant Perusich said .
The day before , Jamaeli tribe leader Sheikh Mishan Abbas held a ceremony downtown heralding the opening of the market after years of closure during the insurgency .
“ It is good , ” said the Iraqi .
“ Karmah is safe now . ”
I smiled at the Iraqis and whispered salam , trying to get them to feel more at ease .
It must be intimidating the first time American Marines – who look like robots of war with their gear on – show up unannounced at your house .
“ Have you seen any suspicious people around ? ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ No , ” the man said .
“ It has been quiet here for some time . ”
It ’s true .
It has been quiet in the area for some time .
There was no reason to doubt the truth of what the man said .
“ Okay , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ We ’ll get out of your way .
Thanks for your time . ”
And that was that .
It was hardly an intelligence gathering meeting .
The purpose was to be seen , not only by the residents in the house , but by everyone else in the neighborhood .
Those who feared the Americans would feel more afraid .
Those who feared the insurgents would feel more at ease .
As we traced our steps back to the main road , the Iraqi Civilian Watch guys we had met earlier walked toward us .
“ Our checkpoint is very important , ” said the team ’s leader .
“ All the checkpoints are important , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ This was an insurgent area , ” the man said .
“ Everywhere was an insurgent area , ” the sergeant said .
“ Do n’t worry .
We ’ll get you guys what you need . ”
War damage on the outskirts of Karmah
We heard gun shots in the distance .
I looked at Sergeant Perusich and wondered what he would say or do .
“ It ’s just the Iraqi Police , ” he said and shrugged .
“ Shooting into the air . ” I do n’t know how he could know that , but I suppose it ’s easy if you ’ve been in a large enough number of fire fights .
We headed back toward the station , but took a different return path on narrow trails through the reeds .
Small kittens darted around and looked for mice .
They seemed healthy and well - fed , though they obviously were not pets .
BOOM .
Somewhere something exploded .
It sounded like a short clap thunder without the roll .
“ What was that ? ” I said .
“ Controlled det , most likely , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams detonate found IEDs and caches of weapons every day .
Karmah is so secure now that even hyper - cautious Marine sergeants are sure there ’s nothing to worry about when they hear gunshots and explosions .
It ’s not even a mop - up in Karmah anymore .
It ’s a clean - up .
The war movie soundtrack in the background was just that – a soundtrack .
Harmless or not , it was a constant reminder that we were not in Kansas .
The sun dropped below the horizon .
Twilight outside the city was as dark as if we were in wilderness .
We came upon a man sweeping his porch with a straw broom .
“ Salam Aleikum , ” Sergeant Perusich said .
“ Have you seen any suspicious people around ? ”
“ No , ” the man said and gave us a sly crooked smile .
“ They all ran away . ”

MADRID  Spanish and French authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested one of the highest - ranking members of ETA , dealing a blow to the Basque separatist group after a series of attacks in northern Spain .
Police detained Francisco Javier López Peña along with three other members of ETA in the southwestern French city of Bordeaux on Tuesday night , Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba , the Spanish interior minister , said .
“ Francisco Javier López Peña is , in all likelihood , at this moment the person with the greatest political and military weight in the terrorist organization ETA , ” Mr. Rubalcaba said at a press conference in Dakar , Senegal .
He cut short a tour of African countries Wednesday to return to Madrid following the arrests .
“ This is not just another operation against ETA , ” Mr. Rubalcaba said .
Mr. López surfaced as key representative of ETA in peace negotiations with the Spanish government which collapsed when the group detonated a car bomb at Madrid airport in December 2006 , killing two people .
According to reports published in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo , he had replaced Josu Ternera , one of ETA ’s chief negotiators , at a meeting with Spanish officials in Switzerland earlier that month .
He was closely identified by Spanish authorities with the decision to end a nine - month cease - fire .

The latest clip buzzing around Youtube and other sites is an embarrassing montage of John McCain 's statements on issues of national security and economic matters .
Just how much is this candidate to be trusted ?
See for yourself ...
What ?

This man is dangerous !
He will say anything , do anything that will get him into the White House .
I believe he is even more dangerous and if possible more stupid than George W. Bush .
How he can even look into the camera with no shame is beyond comprehension .
I truly fear for our country for the next 4yrs .
with any of the candidates we have to choose from .
For the first time in my life , I am seriously considering not voting in a presidential election .
May those who gave their all to provide me that right and privilege forgive me .
THEY ALL ARE LIARS
Posted by littlelisalynnagain on 2008-05 - 20 06:39:30 Each and every canidate is a liar .
It is all politics and a big game .
They say what ever they think the people want to hear at the moment .
Not one of them would know TRUTH if it smacked them on the rear - end ( which is exactly what they are ) .
The world is a scary place and the people who are running for " office " are even scarier .
We need a major overhaul in our government offices and " we the people " need to take back this country and that does include protecting and fencing in OUR borders .
I have had plenty of people make the comment that they too do n't want to vote this year because there is n't even a " lesser than two evils " , they all are .
Posted by Pile on 2008-05- 21 14:21:30
I am so tired of the immigrant issue being played up .
How many of you are threatened by illegal immigrants ?
Is that the scariest thing you can think of ?
Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
If you are any guide , this was a debacle for the network .
One reader :
This debate was disgusting .
But , it only motivated me more and made me realize how very important it is that Obama and the politics that he represents wins this election .
I do n't make much , but ABC just convinced me to make another small donation to Senator Obama .
And , as a side note , it seems like it would 've been better to have had George Will moderate the debate .
I have much more faith in his fairness and concern with policy than what these two just put forward .
Another :
This debate was the biggest sham I 've ever seen .
The first hour was nothing but substance - less nonsense , soft ball questions and prattle .
Another :
The best part of this " debate " ( likely the worst I 've ever seen ) just occurred a few minutes ago when the audience booed Charlie .
I can't believe I just sat through 2 hours of that .
How many debate moderators actually get booed on live television ?
That 's how bad it was .
Another :
You can tell Gibson and Stephanopoulous are out of touch .
They both do n't have to worry about health care .
It 's why not a single question was asked about the issue that I care about so deeply , and instead hours were spent discussing the inane and insane .
As an American who can't find a job because of my health care problems , I 'm ashamed of ABC News .
Stephanopoulos was schooled in Morris - Rove politics .
Under the tutelage of Hillary Clinton and James Carville .
I repeat the obvious :
" No questions on the environment , none on terror , none on interrogation , none on torture , none on education , none on spending , none on healthcare , none on Iran ... but four separate questions in the first hour about a lapel - pin , Bitter - gate , Wright - gate and Ayers .
I 'm all for keeping candidates on their toes .
But this was ridiculous .
And now we have affirmative action ?
Again , it 's not illegitimate as such - but the only reason it is asked is to try and trip these people up and make Gibson and Stephanopoulos look smart . "
Yes , Clinton narrowly bested Obama .
But all you could see was the trainwreck of the network .
Do n't you miss the League Of Women Voters ?

I see from this CIO Magazine article that Cisco is releasing a new client / server messaging system called Etch .
Sigh — those who do n’t know history are indeed doomed to repeat it .
Some choice quotes from the article :
This week Cisco Systems announced a new messaging protocol intended to allow developers to integrate client / server applications without the overhead of traditional protocols such as SOAP .
I was unaware that SOAP had become “ traditional . ”
One of its design goals was to create an inter-application communications technology without SOAP ’s complexity and overhead , explained Marascio .
While SOAP relies on a very complicated WSDL file to define the interface between the client and server , Etch uses a file in Cisco ’s own interface definition language that shares many similarities to a Java interface file .
I bet this new IDL is not only simpler than WSDL , but it probably also avoids all the impedance mismatch problems that invariably occur when mapping IDL to programming languages .
In addition to a simplified configuration , Etch also promises less overhead over the wire , compared to SOAP .
In a testbed environment where SOAP was managing around 900 calls a second , Etch generated more than 50,000 messages in a one - way mode , and 15,000 transactions with a full round - trip , company officials stated .
Oh good , the “ performance presumption . ”
So now we ’re back to where we were a decade ago , at least as far as message transfer rates go .
I wonder if Etch also solves the problem that the bottlenecks usually lie elsewhere ?
The Etch integration into Visual Studio and Eclipse will be very familiar to anyone who has used SOAP integration tools .
After authoring the IDL definition , the developer tells the IDE to generate either a client stub or a server skeleton .
The client stub is usable immediately ; the developer needs only to configure the transport and endpoint , and to code the message calls .
On the server , the developer takes the skeleton and implements the business logic that lives inside the message handlers .
Now that ’s what I call innovation !
Projects implementing their communications using Etch are n’t out of luck if they need to interoperate with SOAP , JSON , REST or other existing protocols .
Cisco has already demonstrated the capability to easily create bridges between Etch and SOAP , according to Marascio .
He said that turnkey bridges to SOAP and REST should be available six to nine months after the release of Etch .
Or , to put it another way : Etch is really just adding more stuff to be developed , tested , deployed , managed , maintained , and integrated , yet it does n’t actually solve any new problems or solve any old problems better than what already exists .
Cisco also is examining the possibility of establishing Etch as a standard .
Marascio pointed out that Cisco is well represented in the IETF , the main standards body for Internet protocols .
Alternatively , Cisco might attempt to promote
Etch as an industry standard , an effort that would be aided by Etch ’s open source nature .
Well of course you want to standardize it — where would any new NIH RPC protocol be without an accompanying standards effort ?
Rather than the IETF , though , perhaps you ought to get those ISO OOXML guys to rubber - stamp it ?
I find it hard to believe that in 2008 people are still inventing stuff like this .
Sheesh .
Color me underwhelmed .
An important realization for any scientist or skeptic is that reality is almost always more complex than our understanding of it .
This is especially true of the common or lay understanding of any topic in science .
( In fact this is likely to be true unless you are on the absolute cutting edge of knowledge in an area . )
Take depth perception .
The common , and correct , belief is that depth perception results from what is called binocular disparity – the brain compares the images from each eye and uses the degree of difference to estimate distance .
From my casual discussions with friends and family it seems that most people think this is the only mechanism by which our brains create the perception of depth .
It is n’t .
Real life is almost always more complex .
Neuroscientists have known for a long time that the brain uses other visual cues to estimate distance .
People who are blind in one eye have impaired depth perception , but they still have functional depth perception .
The world does not look flat to them .
Monocular depth perception functions well enough , for example , to allow for safe driving .
From an evolutionary point of view it makes sense that vertebrate brains would adopt any method of estimating distance that they hit upon .
This is especially true in those animals that do not have binocular vision .
Geese , for example , have opted to have eyes on opposite sides of the head in order to have the broadest field of vision .
Hunting species typically favor binocular vision – taking a smaller field of vision for greater precision of depth perception .
Other mechanisms of depth perception include estimating absolute size from experience ( we know , for example , how big an elephant should be ) and then estimating distance based upon apparent size ( objects get smaller as they get farther away ) .
Nearer objects will also tend to pass in front of objects that are farther away .
Our brains use all of this information to infer a three - dimensional image of the world around us .
Recently a team of researchers from the University of Rochester , led by Greg DeAngelis , have fleshed out yet another mechanism of depth perception independent of binocular disparity ( published this week in the journal Nature ) .
DeAngelis is quoted as saying :
It looks as though in this area of the brain , the neurons are combining visual cues and non-visual cues to come up with a unique way to determine depth .
This newly discovered method is unique in the interesting way it combines non-visual information to create depth perception .
It was previously discovered that the vestibular system may be involved in depth perception .
This new study both confirms this and maps out the actual brain areas involved .
This method of depth perception involves the phenomenon of parallax – objects that are closer move across our visual field more quickly than objects that are farther away when we move or turn our head .
In fact astronomers use parallax produced by the movement of the earth around the sun to estimate the distance to nearby stars .
Based upon vision alone parallax can be used to tell the relative distance of objects – that object A is closer or farther than object B .
But if we want to estimate actual rather than just relative distance we also need information about the amount of movement that produced the parallax ( like knowing how far the earth moves in traveling around the sun .
This is where the vestibular system comes in .
This system in the brain is based upon receptors in the inner ear in what are called the semicircular canals .
These are fluid - filled loops arranged orthogonal to each other so that there is one canal along each of the three axes .
There are also two chambers call the utricle and the saccule .
These are sensory organs designed to respond to rotation ( the semicircular canals ) and linear acceleration ( the utricle and saccule ) based upon the inertial movement of the fluid inside , which flows past hair - like receptors that move triggering a neuron to fire .
The vestibular system therefore provide sensory information to various parts of our brain ( like our balance system ) so that we can sense if we are still or accelerating and in which direction , and what position we are in relative to gravity .
This is the system that produces the sensation of dizziness ( more precisely called vertigo in this context ) – for example when we spin around we accelerate the fluid in the canals ( like spinning a bowl filled with water ) , and then when we stop the fluid will keep flowing for awhile , producing a subjective sensation that we or the world are continuing to spin .
What DeAngelis and his colleagues have discovered is a brain region ( the middle temporal region ) that combines visual information and vestibular information to produce an independent estimate of distance .
The brain is combining parallax from the visual system with an estimate of how much we or our heads or move or rotating from the vestibular system – movement and parallax = distance .
That such a system could evolve is plausible .
Vestibular information projects to the brainstem , the cerebellum , and to various parts of the cortex ( not all of which are currently understood – but this is a nice addition ) .
So vestibular information is widely available and integrated into other sensory systems .
It is specifically integrated with vision – for example in the vestibulo - ocular reflex – a reflex that creates automatic eye movement to exactly compensate for head movements so that we can keep our vision steady and fixed .
When I read research like this I am simultaneously impressed by the cleverness of my fellow humans to figure such things out , and also humbled and inspired by the awesome complexity of the natural world .
Nature almost always is much more complex than it at first seems .
Also we need constant reminding of where our personal knowledge is relative to what is known .
We can reasonably extrapolate from this one example to conclude that our lay understanding of any topic in science is as incomplete and oversimplified as thinking that all depth perception is due to binocular disparity .
Above a “ lay ” understanding is that of an interested and well - read science enthusiast – a description that likely fits most of the readers of this blog .
But we also need to remember that there are layers of understanding above that as well .
I put myself in the category of a generalist neuroscientist ( my area of expertise does not involve the visual system ) .
Above that would be a neuroscientist whose expertise does involve the visual system , and even above that are those few who are actively involved in cutting - edge research on the specific topic at hand .
It is helpful to understand where one ’s knowledge and understanding lies along this spectrum , otherwise we risk falling into the trap of using a naive lay understanding of a topic to challenge the conclusions of the experts in the field .
This is not to make an argument from authority – that the experts are alway right – but to argue that we all need to keep our own knowledge in perspective and have , at the very least , a proper humility .
Otherwise we risk looking foolish like a creationist .

A Nashville woman who waited hours for someone to respond to her call to 911 emergency services did n't hear the worst part of the call .
After Sheila Jones hung up the phone , a local news reporter found that one 911 operator said , " I really just do n't give a shit what happens to you . "
" I think I 'm more hurt than I am mad that my life did n't mean a damn thing to them , " said Jones , after hearing the tape played back to her for the first time .
Jones had called for help after an ex-boyfriend assaulted and threatened her .
911 officials told Nashville 's NewsChannel 5 that the staffer who took the call " was a trainee who was [ later ] fired ... not for the comment , but for flunking his final exam . "

Japan has launched an experimental communications satellite as part of an ambitious space program that could help ensure super high - speed internet access in remote parts of Japan and elsewhere in Asia .
The H - 2A rocket carrying the 2.7 tonne Kizuna communications satellite took off over the tiny island of Tanegashima , about 1,000 km south of Tokyo .
The launch had been briefly delayed after a ship strayed into restricted waters .
The satellite , equipped with three antennas targetting Japan , south - east Asia and the Pacific regions , is referred to as the Wideband InterNetworking engineering test and Demonstration Satellite or WINDS .
The geostationary satellite will be used to conduct experiments on large - volume , high - speed data communications on remote mountains and islands with little internet access .
Japan 's scientists say the launch of WINDS will help the country build one of the world 's most advanced information and telecommunications networks .
The launch comes 12 years after the project started , due mainly to technical glitches involving launch vehicles .
" The WINDS will help develop a society with no digital divide where everyone can enjoy high - speed communications equally no matter where they live , " said an official at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) .

TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
At first glance , the man and woman at the nightclub look like any other couple on a date .
He flirts and pours champagne .
She looks at him and laughs .
Businesswomen in Japan pay up to $ 50,000 a night for male companionship from " hosts " like Yunosuke .
This is n't a date , though .
It 's business .
The woman , a successful executive , has joined a growing number of professional women in Japan are forking out $ 1,000 to $ 50,000 a night for male companionship .
They meet their " hosts " in hundreds of clubs that have sprung up around Tokyo - the industry says only compliments are exchanged .
The women pay for a man to lavish them with undivided attention .
" There 's nothing wrong with a woman paying to be entertained by a man , " one female client says .
" It 's just another step in equality . "
It 's a dizzying reversal of traditional gender roles in a country long known for geishas pampering male clients with conversation , singing and dancing .
Now a new breed of entertainer has cropped up -- think of them as male geishas .
" I give women things that men normally do n't do , like complimenting their appearance , " says one host , 24 - year - old Yunosuke , who only goes by his single host name .
" I make women happy . "
And they make him happy : Yunosuke says he earned more than $ 200,000 last year , enough to let him visit a salon once a day to have his hair dyed and blow - dried .
" Women see us as one of their accessories , " he says .
" They like to wear nice things , so I try to look prettier for them all the time . "
What drives the business boom is an increase in the earning power of Japanese women , according to Air Group , a company that owns a chain of " host " clubs .
" Japanese women are now working hard and making more money , " says Yuko Takeyama , a woman in her early 30s who manages Air Group .
" They see this as a way to de-stress . "
Women love being treated well without the pressures that come with dating , she says .
Yunosuke 's customer from the nightclub agrees .
" This is a gift for myself , " she says .
" It 's the same as spending money on a trip or buying something . "
E-mail to a friend
I smirked but did n't get too excited when he said he was glad to be at " West Virginia , " rather than Wake Forest , when he pronounced the word " relevance " as though it was spelled " revelance , " when he talked about the people in " Warshington , " or even when he laid this little gem on the Wake Forest students :
I 'm the living proof that an undistinguished academic record can be overcome in life -- or at least that 's the hope that has long , long sustained me .
But then he started getting into the substance of his speech -- basically that judges have become too activist .
A few minutes into his discussion of this topic , this is what I thought I heard :
The year 2005 also brought the case of Susette Kelo before the Supreme Court .
Here was a woman whose home was taken from her because the local government and a few big corporations had designs of their own on the land , and she was getting in the way .
There is hardly a clearer principle in all the Constitution than the right of private property .
There is a very clear standard in the Constitution requiring not only just compensation in the use of eminent domain , but also that private property may NOT be taken for " public use . "
But apparently that standard has been " evolving " too .
My head whipped around , and I thought , " HUH ???? ? "
Granted , it 's been 25 years since my Constitutional Law class , but . . . is n't the whole point of eminent domain that the government CAN take private property for public use , as long as the owner is fairly compensated for the taking ?
Quickly went to Wikipedia to make sure that I had n't lost my own bearings and misremembered some relevant nuance of the Fifth Amendment .
Nope , there it is ,
. . . nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation .
OK , I must have mis-heard what he said .
So , off I went to McCain 's website , figuring I would watch it there .
Ah , yes , there it is , right on the front page -- a button that says " Qualified Judges . "
I clicked , and it took me to a page where I found both the written text of the speech and a video .
Oh , happy day .
But wait -- transcript says ,
The year 2005 also brought the case of Susette Kelo before the Supreme Court .
Here was a woman whose home was taken from her because the local government and a few big corporations had designs of their own on the land , and she was getting in the way .
There is hardly a clearer principle in all the Constitution than the right of private property .
There is a very clear standard in the Constitution requiring not only just compensation in the use of eminent domain , but also that private property may be taken only for " public use . "
But apparently that standard has been " evolving " too .
Hmmm .
Maybe I really did mis-hear .
Check out the video .
( Twiddle thumbs , waiting for it to get to the right part . )
Ahh , here we go :
The year 2005 also brought the case of Susette Kelo before the Supreme Court .
Here was a woman whose home was taken from her because the local government and a few big corporations had designs of their own on the land , and she was getting in the way .
There is hardly a clearer principle in all the Constitution than the right of private property .
Then there was the case of the man in California who filed a suit against the entire United States Congress , which I guess made me a defendant too .
This man insisted that the words " Under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance violated his rights under the establishment clause of the First Amendment .
Wait -- WTF ?
Back the video up , listen again , watch carefully .
Oh , how interesting .
Right before the sentence I 'm listening for , there 's this white line across the screen showing that they 're skipping forward to the next segment of the speech .
I guess maybe I DID hear it right ; someone in the campaign who knows more about the Constitution than McCain apparently cleaned up his video for him .
So off to YouTube to review me some video .
Unfortunately , there were only three videos of the speech there .
Two of them were short clips that did n't contain the portion I was interested in .
The third was the official video from the McCain website .
Tapping foot . . . .
OK , how about C - Span ?
Yep , there it is on C - Span.org ..
What ?
I need a newer version of RealPlayer .
Sigh .
OK .
I 'm a concerned American citizen ; I will put off grading my papers even longer to get to the bottom of this .
Downloaded the new version , FINALLY got to watch a real video of what I had seen on my teevee ( he starts talking about the Kelo case at 11:53 ) .
Sure enough , there is McCain , using very emphatic , manly hand motions as he practically shouts ,
There is a very clear standard in the Constitution requiring not only just compensation in the use of eminent domain , but also that private property may NOT be taken for " public use . "
Vindication .
But surely , I thought , others also noticed this ?
A little googling turned up this article in Washington Wire , which mentioned but did n't seem to think it was a big deal .
I think it 's a big deal when a candidate for the Presidency of this country , who starts a speech talking about how the President must swear an oath to protect , preserve and defend the Constitution [ insert emphatic hand motions here ] , just a few minutes later erroneously alters his scripted speech to completely change the meaning of a phrase describing what he says is one of the clearest principles enunciated in the Constitution .
Yes , there is a clear principle in the Consitution , but it is not what he said it is .
Does he really not understand what eminent domain is ?
Did he forget , because he is tired from his hard work on the campaign trail ?
Who knows ?
To those who have been saying that bringing up McCain 's age is " ageism , " or that it is beneath us as the supporters of a man who is seeking to avoid the politics of personal attack , I say , res ipsa loquitor -- one of those fancy Latin legal phrases meaning , " The thing speaks for itself . "
His age is a legitimate issue .
Here 's a rule you software developers out there can take to the bank :
Rambling , ultra - formal specification documents with headings , sub - headings , and dense tracts of text are one of the worst ways to communicate system features , requirements , architecture , design , implementation , or anything else .
Now , do n't take offense just because you happen to have authored more than a few such documents in your lifetime .
Do n't take offense because your organization produces enough throwaway documentation each year to deforest the state of Vermont .
We 've all done it , and we 'll continue to do it , because the next best thing to producing good software is producing a festering sinkhole of documentation just to establish that hey , we 're doing important work here .
But let 's not fool ourselves into thinking that these documents really convey anything meaningful to our readers .
The likelihood of a specification document 's actually being read varies inversely with its length .
The North Carolina Statewide Technical Architecture is a reference architecture with which state - funded IT projects are expected to comply .
Your state or region probably has something similar , as does every major branch of government and the military .
The NCSTA lays out , with impressive verbosity - around 50 separate Adobe PDFs - the best practices for software development in the sunny state of North Carolina .
It 's littered with the language of the software development guru :
User process components coordinate the display of user interface elements .
They are abstracted from the data rendering and acquisition functionality provided in the user interface components .
Design them with globalization in mind , to allow for localization to be implemented in the user interface .
For example , endeavor to use culture - neutral data formats and use Unicode string formats internally to make it easier to consume the user process components from a localized user interface .
And the Table of Contents ( from the NCSTA Security Principles & Practices PDF ) is downright intimidating :
Now , as a civic - minded taxpayer , and a software developer who reads and decrypts this kind of documentation for a living , I do n't even know where to start .
Why does North Carolina need its own proprietary version of a reference architecture ?
Are n't the IT needs of North Carolina very similar to those of Virginia , Kentucky , or Oregon ?
How many millions of dollars did it take to produce the NCSTA ?
And how many other states have produced something similar ?
Do we need to reinvent this particular wheel 50 times , one for each state in the union ?
PDF ?
That 's my only format ?
Even assuming North Carolina needs its own proprietary architecture : why is the documentation so formalistic and difficult to read ?
On this last point .
Take the following paragraph from the NCSTA Microsoft .NET Enterprise Development Guidelines :
Using multiple panes for one activity .
If multiple windows or panes are used in a particular user activity , it is important to keep them synchronized .
In a Web application , a user interface usually displays a set of elements in a same page ( which may include frames ) for a given user activity .
However , in rich client applications , several non-modal windows affecting just one particular process may be necessary .
For example , a product category selector window floating in the application that to specify a particular category , the products in which will be displayed in another window .
User process components help implement this kind of user interface by centralizing the state for all windows in a single location .
Synchronization can be further simplified across multiple user interface elements by using data bindable formats for state data .
It 's trying , admirably enough , to teach you how to synchronize the view of your data across multiple windows .
The problem is that , if you can understand this documentation , you probably do n't need it .
So it 's either irrelevant or hermetically confusing , depending on whether or not you know what things like non-modal windows are .
( And just for the record : the word is modeless , not non-modal . )
So , how much of the information is really necessary ?
Assuming you 're a fairly competent developer , qualified to read this documentation and implement it in practice ?
In other words , how much of this information is necessary and / or valuable to its sole intended audience ?
Well , let 's take out our handy magic marker and make some corrections .
Using multiple panes for one activity .
If multiple windows or panes are used in a particular user activity , it is important to keep them synchronized .
In a Web application , a user interface usually displays a set of elements in a same page ( which may include frames ) for a given user activity .
However , in rich client applications , several non-modal windows affecting just one particular process may be necessary .
For example , a product category selector window floating in the application that to specify a particular category , the products in which will be displayed in another window .
User process components help implement this kind of user interface by centralizing the state for all windows in a single location .
Synchronization can be further simplified across multiple user interface elements by using data bindable formats for state data .
There you go .
Simple .
Every last word can be discarded .
These words add zero value or knowledge to the world that is n't either a ) already known or b ) explicitly stated fourteen other times in the labrynthine NCSTA documentation .
In fact , the presence of these words provides a negative value .
All your reader wanted to do was throw up a side window to display the person 's name .
Now you 've got him off on a tangent , trying to figure out what the hell " synchronization can be further simplified across multiple user interface elements by using data bindable formats for state data " means .
Now the funny thing about all this , is that the NCSTA documentation is a virtuoso piece of technical specification writing if you compare it to the typical specification documents that governments tend to produce , usually under the auspices of " due diligence " .
So my complaints are n't so much geared toward the author(s ) of the NCSTA as they are the entire genre of long - winded technical architecture documents in all their forms , and the institutional malaise that produces them .
In other words , you ca n't PDF your way to good software development .
It 's been tried and tried , without success .
Consider , in your organization , using more fluent and expressive mechanisms to convey system structure or communicate best practices , and your users will thank you for it .
I watched Fitna , the short anti-Islam film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders ’ that ’s been in the news lately .
Wilders was not able to get the film shown on television in The Netherlands and then was unable to show it on at FitnaTheMovie.com due to Network Solutions ’ interference .
Nevertheless , it ’s out in the wild now and has garnered several million viewers by this point .
I believe everyone should watch the film .
It ’s somewhere between PG - 13 and R - rated material , so sparing the youngsters would be best .
But it ’s their world too and they should know , at a less graphic level , the very real threat to their future that Europe is incubating .
In truth , Fitna falls short of telling the whole truth .
Honor rapes and killings , female genital mutilation , and the murder of adulterous women , for instance , are given only the most cursory of coverage .
Par for the course in a 14 minute short , I suppose , but essential information when it comes to understanding on a personal level what life in a world controlled by Islam would be like .
Not good .
Fitna is a must - see not for its completeness nor for its quality .
But it is a reminder of what too many westerners , comfortable in the security of their privileged lifestyles , choose to ignore , whether by conscious decision , ignorance , or information overload .
Islam is a danger to western society that too many refuse to acknowledge because the price of understanding this truth would be too high for them to pay .
As a movement , Islam has no respect for the rule of law , democracy , human rights , or national Constitutions .
While many , many Muslims are peaceful , law - abiding human beings , it must be understood that they are not leading the process of Islamic radicalization that ’s taking place in many countries around the world .
Rather , it ’s the radical , anti-western fringe that is in control , much as radical Germans and Russian agitators moved those nations early in the last century .
Think it ca n’t happen again ?
Better think twice .
In 1900 , who could have imagined Lenin as the ruler of a Soviet Russia ?
The idea was preposterous .
Yet it happened because he was able to generate a core force of true - believers who would stop at nothing in their attempt to force their morality on the rest of the country .
As I ’ve written many times before , Islam is infinitely more dangerous than Communism ever was for one simple reason :
In their hearts of hearts , the Reds never truly believed in their own dogma .
Muslims do .

This note continues an exploration of arrow - friendly formulations of functional reactive programming .
I refine the previous representations into an interactive dance with dynamically interchanging roles of follow and lead .
These two roles correspond to the events and reactive values in the ( non-arrow ) library Reactive described in a few previous posts .
The post ends with some examples .
The code described ( with documentation and examples ) here may be found in the new , experimental library Bot ( which also covers mutant - bots and chatter - bots ) .
Dancing with Mealy machines
As mentioned in a previous post , Mealy - style automata ( “ bots ” ) can be given the following type :
a -> ( b , a -> ( b , a -> ( b , ... ) ) )
where a and b are the types of inputs and outputs , respectively .
The essence of Mealy machines is the alternation of consuming and producing values .
The type ensures that exactly one output is delivered per input .
In recursive form ,
newtype a `MutantBot` b = Mutant ( a -> ( b , a ` MutantBot` b ) )
which is a special case of Ross Paterson ’s Automaton arrow transformer .
These bots do nothing until prompted by an external partner .
What kind of thing is that partner ?
Unlike our bots , it must have the ability to take initiative , i.e. , to produce a value without itself being prompted .
So we might say that the partner is leading , while the bot is following ( or acting and reacting , or generative and receptive ) .
Once the partner has provided a value , the bot can then provide a reponse .
After the bot ’s reponse , there will be another value from the partner .
Once this dance has begun , the roles of lead and follow are no longer static but rather trade back and forth fluidly .
We ’ve seen the type of the bot :
a -> ( b , a -> ( b , a -> ( b , ... ) ) )
What is the type of the partner who can dance Lead to the bot ’s Follow ?
Initially , while the bot waits for a value ( follows ) , the partner provides one ( leads ) .
After that first step , the roles reverse .
( a , b -> ( a , b -> ( a , b -> ... ) ) )
This Lead type matches the range of the Follow type , but with a and b swapped .
We can therefore type our bot friend as a ` Follow` b and its partner as b ` Lead` a , where
type a ` Follow` b = a ->
Lead a b type a ` Lead` b = ( b , Follow a b )
This formulation makes it clear that the bot and the partner are simply different phases of the same kind of process ( though with swapped type parameters ) .
While the bot is a ` Follow` b , the partner is b ` Lead` a ; and while the bot is a ` Lead` b , the partner is b ` Follow` a .
Haskell wo n’t accept these mutually recursive types without at least one newtype or data wrapper .
We ’ll use two .
newtype a ` Follow` b = Follow ( a -> Lead a b ) newtype a ` Lead` b = Lead ( b , Follow a b )
Aside : I studied partner dancing pretty intensively a few years ago , during my mid-life sabbatical .
One of my later teachers rocked my conception of dancing when he said that the roles of “ lead ” and “ follow ” are not rigid , but alternate fluidly between the parters .
For instance the man ( typically ) initiates a movement ( leads ) , which the woman ( typically ) responds to ( follows ) .
The roles then smoothly reverse : the man then follows her as she leads him through completion of the movement , when the roles reverse again .
Class instances
Partially applied , both of these types are functors and applicative functors .
instance Functor ( Follow a ) where fmap f ( Follow h ) = Follow ( fmap f . h ) instance Applicative ( Follow a ) where pure b = Follow ( const ( pure b ) ) Follow h <*>
Follow k = Follow $ a -> h a <*> k a instance Functor ( Lead a ) where fmap f ( Lead ( b , g ) ) = Lead ( f b , fmap f g ) instance Applicative ( Lead a ) where pure b = Lead ( b , pure b) Lead ( f , pf ) <*> Lead ( a , pa ) = Lead ( f a , pf <*> pa )
Since I ’ve been playing with Functor and Applicative and type compositions a lot lately , some patterns in this code jump out at me .
It ’s almost possible to get these four instances automatically , from very simple reformulations of Follow and Lead .
I ’ll address those reformulations in another post .
An Arrow instance for Follow can be adapted easily from the Arrow instance for Automaton .
I do n’t think it ’s possible to define an Arrow instance for Lead , however .
Is it an instance of some other generic notion ?
The type parameter order for Follow and Lead is always received before generated .
That order fits well with the type classes Functor , Applicative , and Arrow , while the reversed parameter order would mesh with contra-variant functors .
However , Control .
Arrow provides its own contravariant map ( and related goodies ) :
-- | Precomposition with a pure function .
( ^ >>) :: Arrow ( ~ > ) => ( b -> c ) -> c ~> d -> b ~> d f ^ >> a = arr f >>> a
By the way , I prefer infix operators over the traditional form ( e.g. , c ~> d vs a c d ) .
Keep in mind that “ -> ” binds less strongly than other infix operators .
Events and varying values
One of the puzzles I ’ve had about arrow - based reactivity is how to distinguish between events and reactive values .
The lead / follow dance provides an answer .
Here are the definitions , from Reactive values from the future .
newtype Event b = Future ( Reactive b ) data Reactive b = Stepper b ( Event b )
An event starts out in waiting mode–a sort of pregnant phase–until it gives birth to a reactive value .
A reactive value initially has a value and then acts like an event .
These two definitions are very like our Follow and Lead .
Where Event and Reactive use futures , the arrow - based formulations have explicit inputs ( of type a ) .
Now that I have this follow / lead perspective , I regret my choice of the name “ Reactive ” for varying values .
Now I see that events are initially reactive ( receptive ) , while varying values are initially active ( generative ) .
Getting chatty
I ’ve found it useful to allow any number of outputs in reaction to a single input .
In particular , filtering eliminates outputs , and mappend can combine outputs .
This flexibility motivated chatter - bots .
The implementation is simple : use a list - valued output type , rewrapping as another abstraction .
newtype a :>- b = Leads ( Lead a [ b ] ) newtype a :-> b = Follows ( Follow a [ b ] )
These types are also functors and applicative functors ( when partially applied ) .
The instances are boilerplate for any composition of applicative functors .
The Arrow instance is a straightforward adaption from the ChatterBot instance given in Functional reactive chatter - bots .
The Lead and Follow types are very similar to Fudgets - style stream processors , which provide output flexibility in a different way .
I will compare these two approaches in an upcoming post .
Examples
The examples from Accumulation for functional reactive chatter - bots all work in the lead / follow setting , with changes to the function names .
Those examples were follows , but are more useful as leads , which we can now do as well , thanks to lead versions of the accumulating combinators .
As another example , let ’s maintain the product of two independently - changing numbers .
In Reactive , we ’d take two reactive ( varying ) values and return one :
Reactive Int ->
Reactive Int ->
Reactive Int
We ’ll have to re-arrange this interface to fit into the Arrow - style interface .
As described earlier , a reactive value is simply a value and an event ( analogous to a lead and a follow ) .
A bit of currying , argument flipping , and uncurrying gives the type
( Int , Int ) -> ( Event Int , Event Int ) ->
Reactive Int
Next use the Event / pairing isomorphism :
( Int , Int ) -> Event ( Either Int Int ) ->
Reactive Int
which converts to a Lead :
prod :: ( Int , Int ) -> Either Int Int :>-
Int
As first step , let ’s decode the Either - valued input into a pair - modifying function
updPair :: Either c d -> ( c , d ) -> ( c , d ) updPair ( Left c ' ) ( _ , d ) = ( c ' , d ) updPair ( Right d ' ) ( c , _ ) = ( c , d ' )
Or , the functionally svelte
updPair = ( first.const ) `either` ( second.const )
Using updPair , we can convert the Either - encoded pair edits to editing functions , and then cumulatively apply those functions .
( The accumF function is like accumC on chatter - bots . )
editPairF :: ( c , d ) -> Either c d :-> ( c , d ) editPairF cd = updPair ^>> accumF cd
We have all we need to make a Lead version of pair editing as well :
editPairL :: ( c , d ) -> Either c d :>- ( c , d ) editPairL cd = leads [ cd ] ( editPairF cd )
Or , with some pointfree - fu ,
editPairL = leads.pure <*> editPairF
where leads is a convenience function :
leads :: [ b ] -> a :-> b -> a :>- b leads bs ( Follows fol ) = Leads ( Lead ( bs , fol ) )
Our prod example is now just a simple application of these generally useful pair editors .
prod = ( fmap.fmap ) ( uncurry ( * ) ) editPairL
The first fmap is for ( ->) ( Int , Int ) , and the second is for ( :>-) ( Either Int Int ) .

Almost exactly two years ago , however , on the eve of Valentine 's Day , Ms. Young used her volunteer status at Lansing Correctional Facility to smuggle out a convicted murderer .
At age 27 , John Manard had convinced the 48 - year - old Ms. Young of his undying love for her .
Before running off with him , she withdrew $ 42,000 from her retirement plan , purchased a getaway vehicle and packed it with her belongings .
Her husband found a pair of pistols missing from their home , a discovery that turned the fugitive lovers into America 's most - wanted couple .
The escape brought a parade of journalists into this blue - collar town across the river from glittering Kansas City , Mo .
But nobody here could or would offer insight into the sudden wild streak of a community pillar who lived down the street from her parents in the only town she 'd ever called home .
Even after federal authorities located the fugitives in a honeymoon cabin in Tennessee , Ms. Young 's friends and loved ones reserved judgment .
Many were convinced she had fallen under the spell of a manipulator at a vulnerable time , when her father was dying and Ms. Young herself was recovering from cancer .
Dear George Jr. ,
First off , I want to say that I am your biggest and Number - 1 total and complete Fan.
Ever .
From the bottom of my heart and wallet , wherever they are , I want to thank you for all you and your family have done for our sacred Cause .
In the hour of our greatest need , your grandfathers helped finance our Party .
They helped us rebuild and re-arm for the coming fight against the Bolsheviks .
We could n't even have imagined starting a war without them .
We also owe your ancestors and their friends an enormous debt for their inspiring work on Eugenics and racial superiority .
The human experimentation was really something , too .
And to think some believe our scientists came up with that one !
Thanks for letting us keep the credit .
1. Write as if you are talking to the reader .
I think that the best advice I have ever received about writing came as a result of attending a writing conference .
A publishing executive said at the beginning of her talk , “ To write easily and well , simply be yourself .
Be natural ; write as if you are talking to your reader on paper . ”
As soon as I returned home from the conference , I started doing what she said and never looked back .
You can do the same with your college application essays .
Remember , the purpose of answering the application questions is to help the college admissions officers get to know you .
What better way of doing that is there than to write as if you are talking to them ?
2 . Offer readers a story .
When I attend college admissions conferences , I almost always attend sessions on application essays , where college admissions officers talk about what they look for .
Inevitably it is revealed that they love reading applicants ’ personal stories and anecdotes .
Frankly , the stories can be about anything ranging from a conversation with a grandparent , to the best or worst day of your life , to a special talent or involvement or something that changed how you think .
Stories help illustrate points that you may be trying to make to your readers and help show more about who you are as a person .
Every child in every family has stories about themselves .
If you have trouble coming up with some , try having a brainstorming session with your parents at dinner some time .
3 . Use the first person .
Many writers tell me that in order to write authentically , they had to unlearn a lot of what they were taught in school .
Among their most important “ unlearnings ” was to limit using third person pronouns ( he , she , they , it ) , and start using the first person , I .
Because college admissions people want to hear about you , you need to write in your own , unique voice .
And that means saying such things as , “ I have loved numbers ever since I was a little kid .
My mother tells me that at the grocery store , I would sit in the cart and add up the item prices she placed next to me to see if I could come up with the same amount as the cash register . ”
This is a lot more personal and interesting than saying , “ Some students have known that they were good with numbers since they were little kids . ”
4 . Show , do n’t tell .
Be specific , descriptive and offer plenty of details .
Skillful writers say that the key to alive , good writing is to “ show , not tell . ”
Rather than saying that you love animals , write something such as , “ Whether a tiny , slithery salamander or a magnificent Arabian horse , I am simply nuts about animals .
Since I was very young , I have spent a lot of my time rescuing , raising , caring for and loving them . ”
Author Natalie Goldberg says , “ … a writer ’s job is to make the ordinary come alive . ”
5. Avoid generalities , clichés and philosophical or psychological babble .
It is so easy to fall into writing something that ends up saying nothing or is trite .
To not do that , keep in mind the following :
Generalities : Rather than saying , “ I ’m very hardworking , ” describe a situation that demonstrates how diligent you are .
For example , “ When it comes to special academic projects , I am the kind of person who both starts way in advance and at the end sometimes stays up all night to make sure that an assignment is the best that it can be . ”
Clichés : Rather than saying , “ I like working with people and want to save the world , ” how about saying , “ I joined the Diversity Club at school because I wanted to get to know students from different cultures , learn about their families , religion , traditions and even their food .
I also wanted to find out how we are alike and unalike .
I believe that when people really get to know one another , they have a better chance of getting along . ”
Psychobabble : Rather than saying , “ I get really ADD when it comes to studying , ” say something such as “ When I do homework in the evenings , I often find it difficult to concentrate , get easily distracted and do n’t seem to be able to focus . ”
By the way , in case you did n’t notice , the quote in the first paragraph about “ being anal , ” is another example of Psychobabble .
6 . Make sure that your essay is free of spelling , grammatical mistakes and improper use of words .
There are few things that negatively stick out more on college applications than errors .
I cannot stress this enough !
Grammar and punctuation errors are like a huge red flag on your application .
Make sure that the final person to read your essay is a great proofreader , and ask them specifically to look for errors .
Careless mistakes are one of the quickest routes to negatively impress application readers and may result in you ’re getting a rejection letter from a college .
College essays can reveal a lot about how you think and who you are , things that college admissions officers want to know .
Students who take the time to pen original , thoughtful , well - written essays truly enhance their college admissions possibilities .
It 's been a long road from being engulfed in flames in an explosion in Israel to leaving dollar bills in dorm refrigerators at MIT .
But in an odd way , it 's all connected .
Unexpected and surprising connections are at the heart of the fascinating research conducted by Dan Ariely , who holds joint appointments in MIT 's Media Lab and Sloan School of Management .
His studies of behavioral economics have demonstrated in a variety of creative ways that people often make decisions that seem to defy logic -- but they do so in very predictable , consistent ways .
Hence the title of Ariely 's new book , " Predictably Irrational " ( HarperCollins ) , which catapulted onto The New York Times ' bestseller list upon its Feb. 19 debut and has stayed there ever since .
Take those dollar bills as an example .
Ariely has been fascinated with the way people rationalize their decisions about what is ethical or not .
The small - scale tests he has carried out , though they involve only a few dollars , reveal patterns of thought that may be relevant to understanding how the leaders of a company such as Enron would engage in criminal activity involving hundreds of millions of dollars .
Here 's how the test worked : Ariely and his students went around and left six - packs of Coke in randomly selected dorm refrigerators all over campus .
When he checked back in a few days , all of the Cokes were gone .
But when he later placed plates of six loose dollar bills in those same refrigerators , not a single bill was missing when he checked back .
Even though the value was comparable -- and thus the situations were supposed to be equivalent -- people responded in opposite ways .
Why is that ?
Ariely says that when he started reading about the Enron case , he was struck by what he calls some bizarre contradictions .
" They did n't seem like career criminals , " he says of the Enron officials .
" They gave money to charity .
This is not the image of people who are purely evil . "
And there were 10,000 people working for the company ; obviously those were not all bad people .
" Could it be that there was something in the structure of the company that allowed normal people to act this way ? "
So Ariely , now the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Behavioral Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management and director of the eRationality Group at the Media Lab , started his small , simple tests of people 's ethical decisions in everyday situations .
The results , as with Cokes and dollars , were often quite striking .
For example , he gave people a test consisting of very easy math questions -- but without giving them nearly enough time to finish .
On average , people got four right out of 20 .
Then he had people take the test , score it themselves , shred the answer sheet and tell him how they did .
Suddenly the average jumped to seven .
He repeated the experiment , paying people according to how many right answers they got .
Same result .
" Everybody cheated , but just a little . "
Even when there was no chance of getting caught -- the evidence was shredded and participants paid themselves from a jar of money with over $ 100 - - nobody claimed 20 right answers .
They just padded their results by a bit .
But then he tried another variation : Before doing the test , he asked one group of subjects to name 10 books they had read in high school .
He asked another group to name as many of the Ten Commandments as they could remember .
The group that listed the books followed the same pattern as the earlier test -- they all cheated a little .
But the group that named the commandments was different : Nobody cheated at all !
" Just the act of contemplating morality eliminated cheating , " Ariely explains .
Though Ariely 's book is often compared to the bestseller " Freakonomics " -- both certainly share a quirky , hands - on approach to questions of everyday behavior -- he says that in fact his research is almost the opposite of that book's .
Those researchers found cases where people 's behavior , even in seemingly irrational contexts , was perfectly rational and followed established economic principles .
Ariely 's work , by contrast , shows the consistently irrational ways people behave in situations where traditional economics predicts they would follow a course of rational self - interest .
Ariely 's fascination with why people behave as they do and how they justify their own actions initially grew out of his own personal experience of suffering .
He grew up in Israel , and at the age of 18 was in a bomb blast that burned 70 percent of his body .
He spent three years in a hospital going through an excruciating recuperation that involved a daily hour - long ordeal of removing bandages from his burned flesh .
He was convinced that there was a better way of doing this process -- starting with the most painful ones first , and taking frequent breaks to rest up .
But the nurses insisted on the opposite -- no breaks , and building up to the worst areas .
After his discharge , Ariely decided to do some research on the question .
The study , in which volunteers were subjected to controlled pain in different ways , confirmed that his approach was better .
" The nurses were wrong , " he says .
" But why were they wrong , when they had lots of experience and good intentions ? "
The question caused him to begin a lifelong exploration of situations " where good intentions and experience are not enough , " and things somehow end up going wrong .
And so he began doing empirical testing of how people make choices .
" MIT as a whole has a very applied perspective to the world , " he says .
Working here , " I fell in love with the experimental method . "
Ariely explains that the ultimate goal of all of his research is a simple and earnest one .
" Behavioral economics can give kind of a depressing view " of how people make decisions , he says , but it can also be used to improve the way people make choices .
Using these principles wisely , he says , " we might be able to design a better world . "
A version of this article appeared in MIT Tech Talk on April 9 , 2008 ( download PDF ) .
Last month , Senator Chuck Grassley asked six notorious preachers of the prosperity gospel to account for some highly questionable expenditures , in light of their ministries ’ non-profit status .
So far , it seems that only one of the six , Joyce Meyer , has complied .
Three others – Benny Hinn , Paula White , and Kenneth Copeland – have yet to respond .
Now the remaining two , Creflo Dollar and Eddie Long , have announced that they will not cooperate .
The letter from Dollar ’s attorney expresses concern about giving documents to the government , explaining such action could trample on the constitutional rights of people to practice religious beliefs without government interference .
… It went on to say , “ … we believe that the religious doctrine and practices of a church should not be held out for the world to evaluate as a result of responding to Congressional inquiries . ”
… A written response from Long ’s attorney says Grassley ’s request … “ clearly disregards the privacy protections of the Church under law and appears to cross the line of Constitutional guarantees for churches . ”
Although the answer to this should already be obvious , notwithstanding these ministries ’ furious attempts to fog the issue , I ’ll say it again : in the United States , tax exemption is not a right , it is a privilege .
The government grants this privilege to certain groups in exchange for them meeting a particular set of rules .
To ensure that these rules are being complied with and that this privilege is not being abused , the government has every right to demand high standards of accountability and transparency from those who receive it .
The First Amendment protects freedom of conscience and belief , but it does not grant blanket exemptions from generally applicable laws to any group that declares itself religious .
It also does not grant any group the right to operate in secrecy , free of scrutiny or accountability .
If these wealthy prosperity preachers continue to defy the Senate , I hope the government seeks all legal means of redress , including subpoenas and IRS investigations .
So far , these individuals have acted very much as if they had something to hide , and were seeking to shield their questionable conduct from scrutiny by pulling a cloak of god - belief over it .
It should be little surprise that corruption always flourishes best in the dark .
In this , Dollar and Long are just the latest in a long line of pious scoundrels who act as if their faith grants them a special exception from the rules everyone else must follow .
The first and foremost recent example is , of course , Kent Hovind – the young - earth creationist , Christian theme - park owner , and tax protestor who claimed that he had no obligation to pay income tax because all his belongings were the property of God .
Needless to say , the government was not impressed by this argument .
After years of stalling and legal buffoonery , Hovind was finally convicted of multiple counts of tax evasion and sentenced to ten years in federal prison .
This same principle has also reared its head in my home state of New York , where the legislature is debating a so - called “ Religious Freedom Restoration Act “ .
This law would exempt believers from following laws that burden their religious exercises unless the state could meet the high standard of showing that the law advances a “ compelling ” state interest and is the least restrictive means possible of doing so .
Governor Eliot Spitzer has supported this bill , while Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has introducted a slightly better version that would not permit religious exceptions to laws preventing discrimination or ensuring access to health care .
Nevertheless , this bill in general is a terrible idea .
( The Institute for Humanist Studies gives a rundown . )
There are already sufficient protections for free exercise ; what we do not need is a law that gives special rights to the religious .
And why should only religious belief get special exceptions ?
What if an atheist ’s freedom is burdened by some law ?
Why do n’t nonbelievers also get a special license to opt out of following laws that place a burden on them ?
In seeking to bend over backwards to accommodate religious voters , politicians have gone too far .
The religious should not enjoy any privileges not available to anyone else ; they must be required to comply with the same laws as all the rest of us .
It ’s to be hoped that the growing “ new atheism ” movement , by challenging the false claim that theistic beliefs deserve any unusual respect as compared to other kinds of beliefs , will strip away the pretense that these beliefs give their holders special rights .
I ’m taking a break from the Rubinius for the Layman series .
I do n’t know why my posts always spiral into multi- thousand words essays :-)
Even worse , when I try to write about Rubinius it ’s so easy to get into ratholes and start fiddling , poking at and exploring this wonderful beast .
All of that instead of writing , of course .
Tonight ’s fiddling led me to playing around with my .irbrc file .
I guess we ’ve all searched for examples of config files for IRB at one time or another .
When you spend a lot of time into your interactive console , you naturally end up wanting to tweak it to your liking .
However you ’ll start having problems as soon as you start fooling around with the different runtimes .
Or when you share your irbrc between different machines .
Maybe even on different OSes .
Either some gems are unsupported or you have n’t installed them yet ( and do n’t necessarily care ) .
So tonight I tried to fix that problem .
My solution is only a small method that I define in my irbrc , so I ’m not sure it ’s worth putting it on github yet :-)
Let me know what you think .
Presenting tramp_require
Usage
When my irbrc requires something just so I do n’t need to do it manually :
tramp_require ' pp ' # => true / false ( same return value as a normal require )
Outcome if the gem is not installed :
** Unable to require ' wirble ' -->
LoadError : Did not find file to load : wirble
And you IRB loads without a problem ( just without the gem pre-loaded ) .
When I require something I actually use in my .irbrc :
tramp_require ( ' wirble ' ) do Wirble.init(:skip_prompt=> true ) Wirble.colorize end
If the gem is loaded successfully , the block is executed .
If the gem is n’t loaded successfully , the block ’s not executed and the same warning message is shown .
Note that the user code passed in the block is not being rescued : if it your code fails , it ’s your problem :-)
Implementation
Here I ’ll paste 2 equivalent implementations .
The first one is a clean and understandable version ( also on pastie ) :
def tramp_require ( what , &block ) loaded , require_result = false , nil begin require_result = require what loaded = true rescue Exception => ex puts " ** Unable to require ' # {what} ' " puts " --> #{ex.class} : # {ex.message} " end yield if loaded and block_given ?
require_result end
This second version is the one I actually use , if I set the debug variable to false the result is the same as the previous implementation .
If I set it to true , I get much more information , including the full backtrace of the exception ( also on pastie ) :
$ debug_irbrc=false def tramp_require ( what , &block ) loaded , require_result = false , nil begin puts ('' , " requiring # {what} " ) if $ debug_irbrc require_result = require what loaded = true puts " successfully required # {what} " if $ debug_irbrc rescue Exception => ex puts " ** Unable to require ' # {what} ' " exception_details = " #{ex.class} : #{ex.message} " if $ debug_irbrc ex.backtrace.reverse.each{|l| exception_details < < "
#{l} " } else exception_details.insert(0 , " --> " ) end puts exception_details end if loaded and block_given ?
puts " executing block for # {what} " if $ debug_irbrc yield end require_result end
Feel free to use these snippets as you see fit :-)
The obligatory full paste of my irbrc is available on pastie , for the curious .
One word of warning , however .
I ’m guessing some of you will rename tramp_require to something more boring .
Just do n’t rename it to irb_require .
IRB already defines a method named this way .

A 370 - page report by the Justice Department Inspector General references an FBI investigation of US torture that accuses the Bush White House , the National Security Council , the Pentagon and the Justice Department with ' ordering and planning ' torture , including ' procedures ' that resulted in death to ' detainees ' .
In other words -- murder !
The report details how the US began torturing captives in 2002 .
' Attempts to stop it ... were systematically suppressed ' , evidence of criminal activity by the Bush administration covered up .
Bush 's cover up of torture is itself a crime for which he should be impeached , tried and prosecuted .
A ' capital crime ' is one for which the penalty is death .
There is enough evidence now to try George W. Bush for various ' capital crimes ' .
Manadel al - Jamadi , dubbed the " Iceman , " is seen in the picture .
He was tortured to death in November 2003 , using techniques that John Yoo approved in his torture memoranda .
According to the official narrative , the Bush Administration turned to the Justice Department for legal guidance on what could be done to give interrogators the latitude they were demanding in dealing with prisoners taken in the war on terror .
However , not a single element of the official narrative is entirely true .
The interrogators were not " pushing for broader authority . "
Indeed , the pushing was all coming out of the White House ( from Vice President Cheney , to be specific ) , and the intelligence professionals were actually pushing back .
Moreover , torture was being used almost from the start of the " war on terror . "
Special operations units operating under the authority of Dr. Stephen Cambone , the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence , had been authorized to use torture techniques from the opening of the war , and they used them with gusto .
At Guant�namo and at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , numerous instances of " highly coercive techniques " had been documented ; indeed , the stories out of Bagram are among the most gruesome to be documented .
In the documentary " Taxi to the Dark Side , " for instance ( for which I consulted and in which I appear ) , we find footage of a senior U.S. officer in Afghanistan talking about the authority for torture , which was issued , and which military personnel were instructed to lie about or deny to keep covered up .
-- Yoo Two , Harpers , Scott Horton
Yoo 's job was that of an ' enabler ' , to figure out a way to make ' murder ' legal .
( a ) Offense .�
Whoever , whether inside or outside the United States , commits a war crime , in any of the circumstances described in subsection ( b ) , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years , or both , and if death results to the victim , shall also be subject to the penalty of death .
-- TITLE 18 > PART I > CHAPTER 118 > � 2441 , � 2441 .
War crimes
It is not surprising that George W. Bush would instruct Alberto Gonzales and / or John
Yoo to find ways to make his orders , his capital crimes legal after he had already committed them .
The legality of his attempts to ' re - write ' the laws is in question and the timeline of events is not on his side .
The facts Bush would prefer hushed up are as stunning and verifiable as they are numerous .
Hundreds of FBI agents witnessed thousands of incidents of torture , murder , and ' wrongful ' death .
Literally hundreds of FBI agents witnessed and reported acts of torture perpetrated by CIA personnel , the US military and private contractors !
All are described carrying out illegal acts of torture , abuse , and , in various cases , murder .
The graphic details are available to the public from the FBI .
Several agents reported beatings .
Thirty agents witnessed and reported ' prolonged shackling of detainees in stress positions ' .
Seventy agents detailed instances in which detainees were subjected to sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures , and periods of extended isolation intended to ' wear down ' resistance .
Four FBI agents described instances in which ' detainees ' were kicked or beaten to death .
Two detainees in Afghanistan were shackled for long periods of time in a standing position .
The report confirms that senior FBI officials knew as early as 2002 that other agencies were using abusive interrogation methods , " " The report shows unequivocally , however , that the FBI�s leadership failed to act aggressively to end the abuse . "
-- Jameel Jaffer , American Civil Liberties Union ( tracks detainee issues ) , Torture Lawsuit News : Dept. of Justice Inspector General Report Details How US Torture of Prisoners Began in 2002
Let 's talk about some specific instances where a man calling himself " President " of the United States has simply thumbed his nose at the law , the rule of law , the international conventions to which the US bound by treaty , US Codes , and convention .
The FBI has opened a ' war crimes file ' documenting torture as it was witnessed at the US torture gulag at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The " War Crimes " file documents torture as it was witnessed before George W. Bush ordered the FBI to stop writing the reports .
A survey of 493 FBI personnel who were asked whether they observed aggressive mistreatment , interrogations or interview techniques of GTMO yielded 26 positive responses and several additional responses that were " not purely negative . "
These responses culminated in a 9/2/04 request through FBI 's OGC to conduct a " GTMO , Counterterrorism Division , Special Inquiry " re 9 of the incidents identified .
The conclusion was that there was no FBI involvement in the target interview techniques -- only outside entities .
-- Federal Bureau of Investigation , Guantanamo Bay Inquiry
As you read some of the following excerpts from the FBIs own report , remember that George W. Bush has repeatedly denied that the United States tortures .
This FBI report is stark reading consisting of verifiable reports of war crimes perpetrated by the United States under under from the ' President ' of the United States .
That there is probable cause now to try George W. Bush for having ordered the torture is bad enough .
But Bush insists that it never happened .
Following are but a very few instances that are found in the FBI report .
W observed women crying near the river , their homes had been destroyed by planes .
Trucks full of people trying to surrender were blown up by planes .
On 2d day after capture , d was put in a ditch by Northern Alliance people .
Next day , he was allowed to jump into a truck and taken to Mazar - e - Sharif where he was forced into a metal " shipping " - type container w/ about 100 men .
The container was then closed and d blacked out due to lack of air .
When he awoke , there were new holes in the container . ,
The man next to him was dead .
He thinks he was in the container 24 hours - only 20 men survived .
... occasionally ds [ detainee ] complained of inappropriate behavior i.e. , incident in which d alleged female guard removed her blouse and , while pressing her body against a shackled and restrained d rom behind , handled his genatalia and wiped menstrual blood on his head and face as punishment for lack of cooperation ... .. on several occasions , witness ( " W " ) saw detainees ( " ds " ) in interrogation rooms chained hand and foot in fetal position to floor w/ no chair / food / water ; most urinated or defecated on selves , and were left there 18 , 24 hrs or more .
Once , the air conditioning was so low that the barefoot d was shaking with cold .
Another time , it was off so the unventilated room was over 100 degrees , d was almost unconscious on floor with a pile of hair next to him ( he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night ) .
Another time , it was sweltering hot and loud rap music played - d's hand and foot was chanined and he was in a fetal position on the floor .
Upon inquiry , W was told that interrogators [ military contractors ] ordered this treatment .
Took place in Delta Camp ... # d was kept in darkened cell in Naval Brig at GTMO , then transferred to Camp Delta where he gave no info .
Then taken to Camp X - Ray and put in plywood hut .
Interrogators yelled and screamed at him .
One interrogator squatted over the Koran .
Another day a German Shepherd was commended to growl , bark and show his teeth to the prisoner .
Subsequently someone laughingly told the W " you have to see this " and took him to an interrogation room where W saw a d with a full beard whose head was wrapped in duct tape # civilian contractor asked W ( an FBI SA ) to come see something .
There was an unknown bearded longhaired d gagged w / duct tape that covered much of his head .
SA asked if he had spit at interrogators , and the contractor laughingly replied that d had been chanting the Koran nonstop .
No answer to how they planned to remove the duct tape .
-- Federal Bureau of Investigation , Guantanamo Bay Inquiry
The war against Iraq was begun upon a pack of lies and is , therefore , unlawful .
Every incident following is therefore a war crime , every Iraqi death a count of murder .
Colin Powell 's address to the United Nation was a criminal fraud in which Powell cited a stolen , plagiarized student paper [ See : Britain 's Intelligence Dossier on Iraq was Plagiarized from a Grad Student ] , presented ten year old satellite photographs and other so - called evidence !
It was upon this ' evidence ' that Bush began a criminal campaign against Iraq , a campaign in which EVERY death is , by US codes , a capital crime .
Earlier , Bush boasted of the the state sanctioned murder of ' those who met a different fate ' , in other words , the ' summary executions ' of some 3,000 people ' deemed ' terrorists .
These acts of state sponsored terrorism by the United States include summary executions , the abduction and detention of civilians without trial and , most repugnant of all , torture related war crimes violating international statutes and treaties to which the United States is a signatory .
Bush 's own words confirming this are admissible evidence against him .
All told , more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries .
Many others have met a different fate .
[ smirking ]
Let 's put it this way -- they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies .
( Applause . )
Bush , State of the Union Address , 2003
It has been the position of this blog that the Bush administration is legally culpable for having launched a war of naked aggression against Iraq .
This blog has insisted that there was sufficient probable cause in the public record to indict George W. Bush for violations of US Codes , Title 18 , Section 2441 -- capital crimes !
Trailer : ' Taxi to the Dark Side " Worth remembering : the wars of naked aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq have , in fact , nothing at all to do with 911 .
Al Qaeda was created by the CIA ; Bin Laden has been dead for years and was , when he was alive , one of Bush 's business partners and a CIA asset .
I have pointed out for years that George W. Bush , his administration , and all those who are willingly complicit are subject to prosecution for capital crimes .
Now -- with the information freely available from the FBIs own website -- there is simply no excuse left NOT to impeach , indict and begin legal proceedings against Bush and his murderous gang !
As this is written , one can be sure that the Bush administration is destroying evidence , covering tracks , rewriting the record of the most criminal regime since Adolph Hitler and Pol Pot .
The time to act is now .
True patriots will !

Report Details Dissent On Gitmo Torture
Global survey reveals growing anger over social inequality
By Bill Van Auken
20 May 2008
The unprecedented accumulation of wealth by a narrow financial elite under conditions of declining real incomes for the vast majority of the world ’s population is creating mounting discontent and anger .
This is the significance of a poll conducted across Europe , Asia and the United States by the Financial Times of London and the Harris polling firm .
“ Income inequality has emerged as a highly contentious political issue in many countries as the latest wave of globalization has created a ‘ superclass ’ of rich people , ” the Financial Times commented in relation to the poll results , which were published Monday .
The FT / Harris poll found overwhelming majorities throughout Europe expressing the view that the social chasm between the financial elite and the rest of the population has grown too large .
In Spain , for example , 76 percent said that social inequality had grown too great , while in Germany the figure was 87 percent .
In China , which has become the low - wage manufacturing center of the world , subjecting millions of workers to exploitation while producing a new class of billionaires and multi-millionaires , 80 percent said that inequality in income was too great .
In the United States , the most socially unequal of the advanced capitalist countries , those who believe the gap has grown too wide are 78 percent .
Substantial majorities of those responding in all eight countries where the poll was conducted expressed the belief that the social chasm will only grow wider over the next five years , while by equally large margins they expressed their support for raising taxes on the wealthy and lowering them on the poor .
Under conditions of deepening crisis wracking the US and global financial system , widespread economic dislocations have rendered the piling up of obscene fortunes by a tiny financial elite all the more intolerable for masses of people confronting declining living standards , the loss of jobs and , over wide areas of the globe , growing hunger .
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , global food prices have risen by 45 percent in the last nine months alone , with the cost of some basic commodities soaring far higher — wheat by 130 percent and rice by 74 percent over the past year .
With 2.5 billion people — 40 percent of the world ’s population — living on less than $ 2 a day , these spiraling food prices confront hundreds of millions with the imminent specter of starvation .
In a statement released last week , FAO Director - General Jacques Diouf cited as a key cause of this looming catastrophe , “ the problem of financial speculation .
Investment funds speculate on futures markets and help push up the price of commodities , including food commodities . ”
The decision by the Financial Times , the authoritative voice of the City of London , to conduct the poll on income was representative of growing unease within the world ’s ruling elites over the threat that unprecedented levels of social polarization combined with economic crisis will trigger a sharp resurgence of class struggle .
Thus , at last week ’s meeting of the 27 European Union finance ministers in Brussels , soaring compensation for corporate executives was described as “ scandalous ” and a “ social scourge . ”
“ The excesses of captains of industry we have seen in several countries and sectors in the euro area are really scandalous , and we continue to examine how something can be done in terms of professional ethics and taxation to combat these excesses , ” commented Jean - Claude Juncker , chairman of the Eurogroup .
A public furor was touched off recently when a Dutch CEO cashed in bonuses and stock options worth $ 124 million .
By American standards , the pay package was hardly unusual , but average CEO compensation in the Netherlands stands at barely one quarter the prevailing level in the US .
Juncker , who is both prime minister and finance minister in Luxembourg , said that the European Commission would require its member countries to report on “ what they are doing to combat this social scourge . ”
Several governments in Europe have drafted legislation that would impose high levels of taxation on oversized executive pay packages .
The real concern of the European bourgeoisie was made clear by Juncker , who warned that average working people “ wo n’t understand if we urge them to moderate their wage demands if we do n’t also say we no longer accept having a situation where certain top managers have executive salaries — and benefit from golden parachutes — that bear no relation to their performance . ”
In other words , given overly flagrant gorging at the top of society , demands for those at the bottom to tighten their belts may light the fuse to a social powder keg .
Along the same lines , the Financial Times last week published an admonishing column by David Rothkopf , author of Superclass : The Global Power Elite and the World They are Making and a former deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade under the Clinton administration .
“ The credit crisis is exacerbating the emerging backlash against corporate excess , ” he wrote .
“ Elites make billions on markets whether they go up or down and their institutions win government support while the little guy loses his home .
Multinational chief executives 30 years ago made 35 times the wages of an average employee ; today it is more than 350 times .
The crisis has focused attention on the obscene inequities of this era — the world ’s 1,100 richest people have almost twice the assets of the poorest 2.5 billion . ”
Rothkopf concluded his piece with a warning that the financial oligarchy must save itself by curbing its excesses .
“ By recognizing that there are public interests to which they must respond , the financial superclass can stall the fate of previous elites , ” he wrote .
“ To succeed at that they must shun their arrogant ‘ leave - it - to - the - market ’ explanations for the inequality they have helped foster . ”
This warning about suffering “ the fate of previous elites , ” is unquestionably severe , particularly in the pages of Britain ’s leading financial newspaper .
Who does the author have in mind : the French aristocracy ?
Russia ’s Romanov dynasty ?
Clearly , within ruling circles , the threat that mass resentment over inequality is creating conditions for social upheavals and even revolution is being taken very seriously .
Rothkopf ’s advice that the ruling elites respond to “ public interests ” and be less arrogant will hardly solve the problem , which is fundamentally rooted not in the undoubted rapaciousness and arrogance of those profiting off forms of financial speculation that threaten to unleash famine over large parts of the globe , but rather in the workings of capitalism itself .
It was Karl Marx , more than 140 years ago , who developed the “ Theory of Increasing Misery ” to explain this inherent feature of capitalist production .
“ Accumulation of wealth at one pole , ” he wrote , “ is , therefore , at the same time accumulation of misery , agony of toil , slavery , ignorance , brutality , mental degradation , at the opposite pole , i.e. , on the side of the class that produces its product in the form of capital . ” [ 1 ]
No single element of Marx ’s analysis of capitalism has been subjected to more intense and sustained criticism by the apologists for the profit system than this thesis .
Expansion of capitalism and the accumulation of wealth , they have argued , would inexorably lead to increased living standards for the broad masses of working people .
The fallacy of this argument and the correctness of Marx ’s analysis is once again being confirmed not only in the cold language of statistics , but in the increasingly explosive struggles of masses of people confronted with the impossibility of obtaining the essential means of survival , which they are being denied by a system of production based on private profit .

Mehdi Army Commander : ' They will see black days like they have never seen before in their life '
Brad Friedman Byon
4/19/2008 , 7:02 pm PT
The " surge is working " surge may not be " working " for much longer , now that al - Sadr is threatening to lift , in the next 24 hours , the 7 - month long Mehdi Army cease - fire which made the surge appear to be working in the first place .
Sure hope Stephanopoulos asks McCain why he does n't wear a flag pin on tomorrow 's This Week .
The latest ominous news , breaking over the past few hours out of Iraq , as culled from Cernig 's round - up at Newshogger follows [ emphasis Cernig's ] ...
Via AP and Fox : [ Muqtada al - Sadr ] says he is giving his final warning to the Iraqi government to stop working with the U.S. military against him or he will " declare an open war until liberation . "
The threat to lift a more than 7 - month - old cease - fire comes amid fighting between al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia and U.S. - Iraqi troops in Baghdad 's Sadr City and the southern city of Basra .
More from AP : I direct my last warning and speech to the Iraqi government to refrain and to take the path of peace and abandon violence against its people , " al - Sadr said in the statement .
" If the government does not refrain and leash the militias that have penetrated it , we will announce an open war until liberation . "
Reuters : A rebellion by Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia --- which has tens of thousands of fighters --- could also reverse overall security gains at a time when U.S. forces are starting to leave Iraq .
... In Sadr 's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City , one Mehdi Army commander said he was " thrilled " about the statement .
" We will wait until tomorrow to see the response of the government .
Otherwise they will see black days like they have never seen before in their life . "
Cernig concludes , " So , a 24 hour ultimatum , " and adds via email : " I 've already seen one military analyst on another private grouplist say that if this breaks wrong we could be talking helicopters from rooftops before too long . "
Diverted for now by Operation Chaos and the Democratic primary , Rush looks ahead to a McCain presidency and says he \ " will thrive . \ "
Limbaugh : ' My impact will increase '
Conservatives are despondent , liberals are as enthused about a presidential candidate as they ’ve been in 40 years , and the candidate he has long loathed won the Republican nomination .
But never mind the pervasive sense of GOP malaise : Entering his 20th year on the national airwaves , Rush Limbaugh is having a dandy 2008 cycle .

Regardless of how many votes Limbaugh actually pushed into Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s column with his mischief - making “ Operation Chaos ” plan to encourage his listeners to keep the Democratic primary going , the endeavor was a success in another important way .
It reminded the mainstream media and others outside the conservative orbit of the following he commands .
And that the “ drive - by media ” he so delights in tweaking would recognize his influence enough to put his stunt on the front page , as The Washington Post did last week , underscored another essential fact about the right - wing talk show host : Limbaugh is one heck of a showman .
Even as the Internet supersedes radio , Limbaugh ’s skills as a political provocateur , as much P.T. Barnum as conservative ideologue , are such that he can fuel buzz in the political - media world like few others .
In other words , Operation Chaos was good box office , and that may well have been the point .
“ In my universe , there is no doubt it worked like a charm , ” Limbaugh wrote to Politico in an interview conducted via e-mail last week .
“ My audience loved it , they participated in it , they had fun with it , as did I . ”
Limbaugh said that the scheme has borne fruit for both him and Clinton going back to the Texas and Ohio contests March 5 and that its impact in Indiana last week was such that even Barack Obama ’s campaign recognized it .
Indeed , an Obama spokesman sent two e-mails noting the “ Limbaugh effect , ” and Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , an Obama surrogate , asserted on a conference call that Clinton had only won the state thanks to Limbaugh ’s legion of Hoosier dittoheads .
Of course it would be in the Obama campaign ’s interest to water down Clinton ’s squeaker of an Indiana victory , but they were n’t the only ones to pick up on “ Operation Chaos . ”
In addition to the Post treatment , Limbaugh was mentioned repeatedly on cable news coverage of the Indiana and North Carolina contests and in Time ’s new cover story by Joe Klein and , for awhile on Election Day , he led Mark Halperin ’s The Page .
Days before the primary , ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Clinton about Limbaugh 's interest in her candidacy and she quipped : " He 's always had a crush on me . "
Limbaugh claims to care little about the surge in attention from the mainstream media .
“ I do n't think my ‘ profile ’ needed elevation because it never waned with my audience and my audience is for whom I do my show , ” Limbaugh wrote .
“ Not the MSM .
So when the MSM decides to acknowledge my existence it does n't mean anything to me . ”
Yet to listen to Limbaugh ’s show is to hear him gleefully seize on any attention he draws from the dreaded drive - bys .
Opening his show Tuesday , he cut to the chase .
Reading from an e-mail he got , Limbaugh said : “ ‘ Rush , you are the lead at Time Magazine.com .
This is madness . ’ ” So I went there , and it ’s Mark Halperin ’s blog , and there is a picture of me in a blue background with all kinds of stars surrounding my beautiful face and head .
And the headline above this graphic is ‘ Chaos ? ! ’ with an exclamation point and a question mark , and it references this story that I ’m holding here in my formerly nicotine - stained fingers .
The Indianapolis Star today on its website is updating turnout and other aspects of the primary vote in Indiana today .
And the headline of their 10:51 a.m. report was ‘ Hardcore Republicans voting Democrat .
And the Time Magazine blog says , ‘ Listen to Limbaugh Crow About This at Noon Eastern . ’
I think they have a link to my website .
For all his professed disinterest , the elite media attention confers a degree of validation on a self - made former disc jockey with no background in journalism or politics .
Further , said one media analyst , dominating the media conversation and being part of the news narrative is an essential element of success in the radio talk fest world .
“ There ’s a lot of self - referential business in the talk show game , ” said Tom Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
“ These guys are n’t covering the news — they ’re a personality interacting with the news .
And they like to be in their own story . ”
Citing the ongoing spat between Keith Olbermann and Bill O’Reilly , Rosenstiel notes that feuding and setting up a nemesis , whether it be a rival figure or the media in general , is a boon for ratings .
“ They have to be provocative to generate listenership , ” he said .
Proving Rosenstiel ’s point , Limbaugh argues that it ’s not he who craves media attention but the other way around .
The real question , Limbaugh said is : " How many of the MSM hope I will mention something they said or wrote ?
Many of these outlets are losing circulation , ad revenue and audience .
I am not .
So , they love me mentioning them so that people know they exist . "
Beyond dispute is that many know Limbaugh exists .
His weekly audience is estimated at about 13.5 million listeners , and his numbers spiked in the first three months of the year when campaign - related interest in politics was intense .
Moreover , his loyal followers have n’t abandoned him despite an at - times troubled personal life in which he ’s battled addiction to painkillers and married three women .
Nor have they minded comments and bits that have approached and at times crossed the thin line between entertaining shtick and offensive insensitivity .
For all his game - playing in the Democratic contest , nowhere is Limbaugh ’s impact felt more than in the conservative political world .
That the emergence and reemergence of Jeremiah Wright has been a gift for the GOP and John McCain is well understood .
Less so is that it ’s been a distraction not only for Obama but also a critically important one for McCain :
It has distracted Limbaugh from his bad - mouthing of the GOP standard - bearer .
Even as McCain has consolidated Republican support since wrapping up the nomination , Limbaugh has continued as a persistent critic of a candidate he does not see as being part of the movement .
Wright , Operation Chaos and the continuing Democratic primary in general have diverted Limbaugh ’s attention from shooting at McCain on a daily basis , and aides to the Arizona senator are glad to be out of the path of fire .
The Republican did draw the wrath of Rushbo , however , when he initially spoke out in strong terms against a North Carolina Republican Party ad that used footage of Wright in a television ad .
But after much carping from Limbaugh and other conservatives and the party ’s insistence on running the spot , McCain backed down , saying he would n’t play “ referee ” on such usage .
McCain once dismissed Limbaugh as an entertainer but , in his effort to unify the party , has taken a more careful tack recently .
“ I respect Rush Limbaugh , ” McCain said of his tormentor in January .
A top McCain aide , recognizing the importance of having Limbaugh inside the tent spitting out than the other way around , goes further .
“ He ’s incredibly influential , ” the aide said of Limbaugh .
“ He has an ability to move a large amount of people to rise to your defense . ”
“ Our first outlet of defense on something like the New York Times story [ suggesting McCain had an affair with a lobbyist ] is through Limbaugh and talk radio .
It ’s the vehicle by which you defend yourself to the Republican base . ”
This aide notes that Limbaugh had said some favorable things about McCain ’s speech on judges last week , but recognizes that he probably wo n’t ever be a reliable ally .
“ There are going to be things he agrees with us on and things he does n’t agree with . ”
Some in McCain ’s wide orbit have a relationship with Limbaugh , however , and these intermediaries try to keep the lines of communication open .
For his part , Limbaugh scoffed at a question about whether his influence would wane should one of his least favorite Republicans win the White House and returned to his other most favored punching bag .
“ If anything , my impact will increase with a McCain presidency , ” Limbaugh said .
“ The question is whether the MSM 's impact will be lessened , which is slowly happening all around us .
I will thrive as always . ”
For now , though , he said he ’s got another trick up his sleeve for the general election .
“ One of my next objectives is to try and convince Republicans to cross over and vote for McCain down the road , ” he quipped .
Spring is said to be the best time to scale Mount Everest
Climbers will be banned from going beyond Everest 's base camp until 10 May , Nepal 's tourism minister said .
Beijing is thought to be concerned that a protest may coincide with plans to take the Olympic torch up the mountain .
Tibetans have stepped up agitation against Chinese rule as Beijing gets ready to host the Olympics in August .
Buddhist monks have been demonstrating in and around Lhasa , the capital of the Tibet region .
Many Tibetans believe their region ought to be independent , though China has long claimed the mountainous territory as its own .
Meanwhile police in the Nepalese capital , Kathmandu , have used force to break up a gathering of Tibetan refugees for the second time this week .
Tibetan eyewitnesses say that nuns were among those beaten with sticks .
Mounting protests
Nepalese Tourism Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung told Reuters news agency that climbers would not be allowed beyond Mount Everest 's base camp until 10 May .
He said the move was in response to a request from China .
" This is to prevent some people who could infiltrate and cause trouble during the time when they take the torch to the top . "
Police and Tibetan exiles clash in Kathmandu on Friday
No exact date has been set for the Olympic torch 's journey to Mount Everest but reports say it is likely to be in late April or early May .
May is widely regarded as the best time of year to climb the peak , the world 's highest at 8,848 metres ( 29,028 ft ) .
Mount Everest straddles the border between Nepal and China and can be scaled by a northern and a southern route .
The more popular southern route passes through Nepal , while the northern ascent goes through China 's Tibet region .
China was reported earlier this week to have restricted access along the northern route , amid fears that pro-Tibetan activists may disrupt the Olympic torch 's journey .
Last year , five US mountaineers , including an ethnic Tibetan , unfurled banners on Everest calling for Tibetan independence .
No Nepal compromise
In the latest violence in the Nepalese capital , a policeman who declined to give his name told the BBC that members of the Tibetan refugee community had staged a candlelit rally at the main Tibetan Buddhist shrine in Kathmandu .
He said they had been chanting slogans such as " Free Tibet " and had sworn at the police and then thrown stones and bottles , so the police charged them with batons in retaliation .
Two Tibetan men , however , told the BBC there had been no rally and that the police had beaten hundreds of people including nuns who had been lighting candles and saying prayers .
One of the men said his hand had been broken in a police beating .
Some of the Tibetans were detained for a few hours .
On Monday the police beat back hundreds of Tibetans who were trying to march to the Chinese embassy .
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu says Nepal has been showing it will not compromise on its support for its huge neighbour , China , on issues including Tibet .
In India , the Tibetans ' spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has expressed concern at China 's response to the protests in Lhasa .
The unrest began last week , as Tibetans marked the 49th anniversary of the Dalai Lama 's journey into exile from Lhasa to India .
Some 100 protesters were detained by Indian police on Thursday in an attempt to halt a planned march to the Chinese border .
The protesters in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh will be held in custody for two weeks , police said .
US - based pressure group Human Rights Watch has criticised the authorities ' response to the protests .

The Cozy Suite manages to stretch legroom by two inches while fitting airplane seats into the standard economy class 32 " pitch .
It does this by offsetting the seats diagonally : they still point forward , but each chair sits behind its neighbor .
This staggered arrangement also means that there is space to put in a padded side section to lean against and get some proper mile - high shuteye .
What 's not to like ?
More legroom ( and at 6 ' 3 " I really appreciate every last inch I can get ) and a comfy place to park my noggin while falling asleep to the Gadget Lab podcast ( it 's your soothing voices , guys , not the content ) .
The only problem might be in holding a conversation with your neighbor .
Ideal for avoiding pesky tech - blog autograph seekers but not so good if you 're traveling with friends .
The best news , though , is that these are not just concept cocoons : Delta is actually installing them in it the economy sections of its Boeing 767s and 777s by 2010 .

Carter hints at Obama backing
The Nigerian paper This Day reports that the former president all but came out for Obama , speaking to reporters in that country :
We are very interested in the primaries .
Do n’t forget that Obama won in my state of Georgia .
My town , which is home to 625 people , is for Obama , my children and their spouses are pro-Obama .
My grandchildren are also pro-Obama .
As a superdelegate , I would not disclose who I am rooting for but I leave you to make that guess .
He was in Abuja , the paper reports , for the Carter Center awards for guinea worm eradication .

Do you freaking SuperDelegates need any more information about this woman ?
She ’s now using you as human shields .
But hey , you just keep sitting on your collective asses , like the DNC , watching Hillary destroy our party .
Because , you know , it would be mean to tell her to take a hike now that she ’s lost .
I mean , she might even cry .
And sure , she ’s a Democrat using racism as a political weapon , possibly pushing millions of blacks out of the Democratic party for good , but that ’s nothing compared to hurting Hillary ’s feelings .
So , yes , let ’s all just sit back and watch Hillary destroy our nominee and our party over the next month , and then when we lose to McCain in November we can all act really surprised .
Never saw that coming .

Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has admitted that Windows Vista is an incomplete product , even though the operating system has been on the market for more than a year .
Speaking at the firm 's annual Most Valuable Professionals event in Seattle yesterday , Big Steve told the gathered crowd that the unloved OS was " a work in progress " .
According to reports , he also promised that Microsoft would learn from the mistakes it has made with Vista .
" It 's a very important piece of work .
We did a lot of things right and have a lot of things we need to learn from , " said Ballmer .
" Certainly , you never want to let five years go between releases . "
He acknowledged that " Vista is bigger than XP " , but he was n't referring to the popularity of the product .
Instead , he was pinpointing one of the major issues many customers saddled with the product have complained about : performance .
" We have to make sure it does n't get bigger still and that the performance and the battery and the compatibility we 're driving on the things that we need to drive hard to improve . "
Yesterday 's admission will be seen by many as poorly timed , coming just weeks after service pack one ( SP1 ) for Vista arrived – well , at least for some customers – in a manual form .
In mid-March Microsoft issued a staggering number of reasons as to why plenty of people would not be able to get their mitts on the service pack .
Issues included a number of security products that wo n't start up or run on updated desktops thanks to " compatibility problems " .
Earlier this week Microsoft spat out Vista SP1 in the remaining 31 languages .
Those versions arrived a full month after the service pack first landed for a select few across the globe .
Meanwhile , the automatic version of the download remains missing in action .
Redmond had chalked mid-April as the date when SP1 would start downloading onto computers across the world .
But it 's reluctantly stepped away from that deadline because it " wants to ensure customers have the best possible experience " .
Ballmer also accepted yesterday that customers are incredibly reluctant to shake off XP in favour of adopting its unruly little brother , Vista .
" We have a lot of customers that are choosing to stay with Windows XP , and as long as those are both important options , we will be sensitive , and we will listen , and we will hear that .
" I got a piece of mail from a customer the other day that talked about not being able to get XP anymore , and we responded : XP is still available .
And I know we 're going to continue to get feedback from people on how long XP should be available .
We 've got some opinions on that . "
Windows XP was given something of a reprieve earlier this month for bargain basement PCs not equipped to run the memory - chugging Vista OS . ®
Ancient whales were not master divers like their modern descendents .
Biologists have discovered signs of decompression syndrome – the bends – in several different whale fossils , a finding that could revise the evolutionary history of deep diving .
A team of paleobiologists surveyed hundreds of modern and ancient whale skeletons for decompression syndrome , which occurs when quick pressure changes force air or fat bubbles out of blood vessels .
Such damage would have been common when whales first began plunging into the depths of the ocean , says Brian Beatty , of New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old Westbury , US , who led the study .
However , whales eventually evolved to cope with frequent visits to their new world .
“ Playing around in the shallows with Flipper is one thing , ” he says .
“ But going out in the open ocean and diving hundreds and thousand of meters to go and get a fish or a squid , is like going up in space in terms of changes in pressure . ”

Dive tactics
Scientists classify whales into two groups , both intrepid explorers of the deep sea .
Baleens , such as the gargantuan blue whale , take huge gulps of sea water , and then filter out their meals .
While toothed whales like orcas and sperm whales prey on sharks and giant squid in the ocean ’s bowels .
The two lineages split apart roughly 45 million years ago .
Modern whales of both branches have evolved exquisite adaptations to fight the bends .
Some exhale before they dive to clear their lungs of nitrogen gas that could form bubbles , and many whales allow ample time between dives .
Some researchers have suggested that military sonarcan startle whales into changing their diving behaviour , causing decompression syndrome .
To determine when the anti-bends adaptations first arose , Beatty and colleague Bruce Rothschild , of University of Kansas Natural History Museum in Lawrence , examined samples of ancient and modern whale vertebrae .
Minor damage
When gas or fat bubbles form in the blood vessels that feed bone cells , the vessels can burst and seal off the oxygen supply to the cells , resulting in tiny lesions that can be detected by X -ray .
“ It ’s a measure of small regular damage and not necessarily something traumatic , ” Beatty says .
None of the 331 modern whale vertebrae showed signs of decompression syndrome , while a handful of the thousand ancient whale bones contained such marks .
Beatty views the damage as flirtations with the deep ocean , before more modern whales overcame decompression syndrome .
But baleen and toothed whales may have evolved such changes independently .
Signs of decompression were found only in very ancient specimens of toothed whales , while more recent baleen whale fossils showed damage , suggesting that baleen whales only evolved their defences much later .
Tagging evidence
“ Maybe baleen whales and toothed whales independently arrived at the same conclusion – that going out into the open water and going deep was a good idea , ” Beatty says .
Most researchers have assumed that the common ancestor of toothed and baleen whales was a deep diver .
“ They have come up with quite a surprising story , ” says Erich Fitzgerald , a palaeontologist at Museum Victoria , in Melbourne , Australia .
Beatty ’s hypothesis is in accord with “ our long - standing understanding of the different diving habits between baleen and toothed whales ” , says Nick Pyenson , a paleontologist at the University of California , Berkeley , US .
Tagging modern whales as they dive will help researchers understand how their ancestors evolved to cope , Pyenson adds .
“ As our sampling of living species gets better , these data will better inform our expectations of what to find in the fossil record , ” he says .

A mother who fell into a coma during labour came back from the brink of death after her husband gave her " a bloody good rollicking " .
Yvonne Sullivan , 28 , suffered blood poisoning and blacked out after being told her newborn son had died during a traumatic birth .
She was taken to intensive care where Dominic , her 37 - year - old husband , kept vigil for two weeks .
Scroll down for more ...
It was Dom 's stern telling - off that gave Yvonne Sullivan the strength to fight for life after she fell into a coma
When doctors told him they might have to switch off her lifesupport machine , he sprang into action .
Holding his wife 's hand , he told her : " You start fighting , do n't you dare give up on me now .
I 've had enough , stop mucking around and start breathing .
Come back to me . "
Two hours later she started breathing on her own .
Within five days Mrs Sullivan 's ventilator was switched off and she regained consciousness .
Yesterday she said she remembered her husband berating her .
" I can't remember exactly what he said but I never liked getting told off by Dom , " she recalled .
" Something inside me just clicked and I began to fight again .
" I had been on 100 per cent life support and I was deteriorating , but within two hours of him ordering me to get better I 'd regained 5 per cent of my breathing .
" When I first came round I 'd thought he'd been gone a few minutes , then he told me I 'd been out for two weeks .
It 's a miracle really .
I owe him so much . "
Mrs Sullivan , from Westonsuper - Mare , Somerset , became pregnant shortly after marrying in September 2006 .
But her unborn child was anaemic and needed regular blood transfusions in the womb .
Last July , Mrs Sullivan gave birth to Clinton at St Michael 's Hospital in Bristol .
Two months premature , he died from a blood infection and her body soon went into septic shock , a condition in which the vital organs shut down .
Mrs Sullivan , who has a son Ryan , eight , from a previous marriage , was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary , where her condition worsened .
Her husband , a lorry driver , stayed by her bed washing and combing her hair and talking about family and friends .
Mr Sullivan said he joked about their Cyprus honeymoon , where she fell ill after catching pneumonia and ended up in a high dependency unit .
" When the doctors told me to think about turning off the life support I got angry , " he added .
" I grabbed her hand and began shouting at her .
I gave her a bloody good rollicking .
" I 'd already had to explain to Ryan that his brother Clinton had died , and that his mummy might not survive .
" He said he'd be cross with the doctors if they let mummy go to heaven .
I kept telling her to pull through .
Then I left the room to get some air .
" I came back two hours later and she had started to breath .
It was incredible .
Sometimes you find powers you just did n't know you had .
" I hope this gives hope to other people in similar situations . "
Mrs Sullivan , who works as a sandwich maker and dance instructor , spent another week in hospital after her coma ended .
Although at first she struggled with basic tasks she has made a full recovery .
" I am fine now , doctors say it must be a miracle , " she said .
Kids do n’t care about robotics anymore .
At least , that ’s what Takayuki Furuta fears .
So , to boost his field ’s appeal , the director of the Future Robotics Technology Center in Chiba , Japan , figured out how to make a real - life , six - story - tall Gundam , the classic battle robot from Japanese anime .
He ran computer models on every aspect of the bot to determine what parts he would need to power and control the beast .
Then he surfed electronics and industry - equipment catalogs to find the components .
The result : a complete blueprint for a $ 742 million bot .
By showing how the anime fixture can actually be built , he hopes to get schoolkids fired up about robotics .
Well , that and he actually intends to build one .
A 60 - foot - tall robot may not be financially feasible , Furuta says , but he ’s going to try making a version that could be as tall as 13 feet .
He aims to have it working by 2011 , when , ideally , someone will have created something for it to fight .

Judge seems wary of opening CIA inquiry ; US denies CIA tapes show Gitmo torture RAW STORY
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007

Print This Email
This A federal judge appeared reluctant Friday to investigate the destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes while the Justice Department is conducting its own inquiry .
US District Judge Henry H. Kennedy is considering whether to delve into the matter and , if so , how deeply .
The Bush administration is urging him to back off while it investigates .
" Why should the court not permit the Department of Justice to do just that ? "
Kennedy asked at a court hearing Friday .
In 2005 , the judge had ordered that evidence " regarding the torture , mistreatment , and abuse of detainees " in the US military base in Guantanamo should be preserved .
Meanwhile , US government lawyers flatly denied Friday that videotapes destroyed by the CIA contained any scenes of the torture of terror suspects in Guantanamo Bay , in the keenly watched court hearing .
" It is inconceivable that the destroyed tapes could have been about abuse , mistreatment or torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay , " lawyer Jody Hunt , representing the White House , told the court .
The hearing marked the first time that administration lawyers have spoken in public and under oath about the matter since the CIA disclosed this month it destroyed the tapes of officers using tough interrogation methods while questioning two al - Qaida suspects .
Lawyers for Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo
Bay argue that the destruction of the tapes may have violated a court order and may indicate that other evidence was also destroyed .
They urged the court not to take a back seat to the executive branch , which destroyed the documents in the first place .
" The Justice Department may have sanctioned the destruction of these videotapes , " David Remes , an attorney for the detainees , said following the hearing .
" Now they are asking the court to stay out on the ground it is investigating the destruction of these videotapes . "
Remes said that he argued that the tapes ' destruction " raised legitimate questions and grave concerns about the government 's handling of evidence generally that is being used in the Guantanamo cases . "
Continued the attorney , " It 's a fundamental matter of trust .
If the government is willing to destroy potentially relevant evidence -- as it has acknowledged doing in this situation -- I do n't believe that it can be trusted when it says it 's preserved all of the other relevant evidence . "
Kennedy , a former prosecutor who was appointed to the bench by President Clinton , did not immediately say what he would do .
In a press conference Thursday , President Bush refused to comment on the CIA 's decision to destroy the tapes .
" I am going to reserve judgment until I find out the full facts , " he said , adding he would not offer any opinion on the issue " until these inquiries are complete , and the oversight is finished . "
The New York Times this week , citing unnamed administration and intelligence officials , said four top White House lawyers took part in discussions with the CIA in 2003 and 2005 on whether to keep the videotapes .
" The accounts indicate that the involvement of White House officials in the discussions before the destruction of the tapes in November 2005 was more extensive than Bush administration officials have acknowledged , " the Times said .

This following video is from CNN.com , broadcast on December 21 , 2007 .
Detainee attorney David Remes speaks on courthouse steps following hearing on destroyed CIA interrogation tapes :
One defining feature of humans is our inability to accept our own mortality .
Our culture , our religions , our big buildings and our fancy toys , are all designed to distract us from catching a glimpse of the fact that we 'll all , individually and collectively , turn into poop .
But what if we met an alien race that did n't share our neurosis about dying ?
What would their society look like ?
Advertisement
The idea I mention above , about all human cultures being a defense mechanism against recognizing our own mortality , is the theory of Freudian psychologist Ernest Becker , in his 1973 Pulitzer Prize - winning book The Denial Of Death .
Becker believes humans create " hero systems , " including religion and science , to try and compensate for , or cover up , our mortality .
All mental illness stems from the failure of our heroic death - defying projects , and the ensuing awareness of our doom .
So how would an alien culture look if it had come to terms with the inevitable ?
My first impulse is to say that they'd be more emotionally healthy , totally zen and Yoda - like .
They 've gotten over their fear of death !
So they would have fewer taboos —
Becker claims our neuroses around human excrement stem from the fact that they remind us our bodies are going to decay — and they would be less crazed in their attempt to create something " heroic " to help them pretend they wo n't flop over and turn into fossils any time now .
Maybe they'd have some nice ritual for marking the transition to the next plane of existence , or maybe they 'd just throw out their dead with the trash ?
Advertisement
But on second thought , maybe aliens who were n't neurotic about their own mortality would be total assholes ?
No fear of death might make them into crazy warriors .
Plus , if it 's true that even glimpsing or beginning to comprehend our own mortality makes humans psychotic or depressive , it 's possible that aliens who had fully comprehended their deaths would just be total psychos ?
The awareness of death would overshadow everything and make them into maniacs ?
Plus if they had no taboos around excrement , they might be living in their own filth ?
Also , who knows what other taboos they might lack ?
( This is assuming they actually excrete , or even have recognizable states of being " dead " or " alive , " as we know them .
And that they recognize single creatures as unique individuals , that can be either alive or dead . )
I guess it all boils down to the extreme difficulty of imagining a truly alien culture , one with a biology and a social structure so different from our own that it probably would seem insane to us .
It takes so little to push a human 's consciousness into a state that most of us consider insane , it 's hard to imagine that aliens might not naturally occupy one of those states of mind .
The main limiting factor , of course , is that any species has to be able to survive in its environment — and have the drive to stay alive and reproduce , or it wo n't be around for long .
So even if our putative aliens did have an easier time reconciling themselves to death , they would have to take reasonable steps to avoid it , or they would n't be around to meet us in the first place .

Aegis69 reviewed v58.0 Beta 5 on Nov 23 , 2017 Pros : fast Cons : still a bit clunky Bottom Line :
Ok I found replacements for all my extensions now , took about a week but I did it .
The browser has finally entered the modern age that Chrome ushered in 5 years ago , it took way too long and cost FF massive market share .
I hope that have learned from that , at least now they have a solid platform to more forward on .. finally .
Hall9000 reviewed v58.0 Beta 4 on Nov 16 , 2017 Pros : Pros :
Yes , faster .
Cons : Cons , : Almost all of the adons are n't working or supported yet .
Plus , who 's the idiot that decided to make it look even worse than Windows 10 ?
Bottom Line : Giving a 1 untill they clean up their mess .
cltx99 reviewed v58.0 Beta 3 on Nov 15 , 2017 Pros : non Cons : just about everything Bottom Line : Junk status .
Used to be great and used it for years .
I quit for good .
Speed does n't replace all the good things that made this browser great .
Not by a long shot .
cyberguy reviewed v57.0 Beta 8 on Oct 14 , 2017 Pros : An updated Firefox Cons : Version 57 broke 90 % of the addons .
Changed the way my favorite replacements work .
They are no better than Chrome addons now .
Opening new tab causes the browser to become non-responsive .
This last is so annoying I stopped using Firefox altogether and went back to chrome .
Bottom Line : Dissappointed with version 57 so far .
I will still give it a 3 because there is some good left in it .
Used to be my favorite browser .
Now there is nothing to really make me want to continue using it .
kstev99 reviewed v57.0 Beta 6 on Oct 8 , 2017 Pros : Faster than previous versions Cons : Web Extension Add-ons are lame .
Bottom Line : OK , I 've been trying this for a couple of weeks now , or since the first Beta .
Just updated to Beta 6 .
It is definitely faster than previous versions of Firefox , bit at what cost ?
The Web Extension addons are PATHETIC in comparison to what can be done with the old XUL system .
( Sorry Developers , but it 's not your fault ) .
The WE addons are very limited in what they can do , and it 's sad to see once great add - ons being reduced to just a shell of what they once were .
They are unable to import / export things like cookies , form history etc , they can't change the interface at all , no scroll bar changes , lame themes .
The list goes on ...
I actually DO like FF57 , but it 's inadequate add - ons and desire to be a clone of google chrome just leaves me wanting to stay with WATERFOX , at least until its author throws in the towel with the rest of them .
Sven123456789 reviewed v57.0 Beta 6 on Oct 7 , 2017 Pros : None Cons :
Where do you begin .
Bottom Line : Finally tried this infamous 57 version .
Its as bad as I thought it would be .
None of my add on 's came over .
or my themes .
So your stuck with that terrible user interface .
Speed , come on , I have n't noticed any big speed increase with any of these updated browsers .
FF will be added to IE , Edge , and Opera as browsers that have jumped the shark .
Aegis69 reviewed v57.0 Beta 6 on Oct 6 , 2017 Pros : 57 is fast , very fast Cons : All plugins are gone Bottom Line :
Yes the browser is now fast , really fast , and its far too late for that to make any difference .
If they had worked on speed 4 years ago they just have had a chance , now it way too late .
And to get the speed by sacrificing all the addons ?
Insanity .
Currently in the addon store there appear to be about 65 addons compatible with 57 .. thats pathetic .
Looks like Firefox is the new IE .
Gawd damn why are tech companies so idiotic ??
kstev99 reviewed v57.0 Beta 3 on Sep 27 , 2017 Pros : Does seem faster with multi-process Cons : Very Limited web extensions are no match for the old add - on system Bottom Line : I am still using WATERFOX as my primary browser , but I am trying to make this FF57 work out .
It DOES seem more responsive than previous versions .
On the down side , Ugly squared off tabs , Can't find replacements for about 80 % of my previous add - ons because the authors say that the webextensions are very LIMITED in what they can do .
Install this and then stroll through the Mozilla Add - ons site .
Page after page with only 1 or 2 compatible .
Gone are Classic Theme Restorer , Findbar Tweak , Cookies Manager +. , Clippings , IMacros and the list goes on .
I am trying to give it a chance .
I 'll bump it up to TWO stars .

It 's trying more every day to be just like Google Chrome .
Bottom Line : @ Monkey_Punch
It 's not I 'm against change if it improves the browser , but web extensions just do not have the same capability as the current XUL system .
So many authors are just throwing in the towel or creating web extension add - ons that just simply can't do what they did with the old system
I 've used Firefox since it rose from the ashes on Netscape long ago .
I 've Preached to others how great it was .
The one thing that made Firefox stand out above the other browsers was the ability to customize it and make it your own browser .
That is becoming a thing of the past and this browser may very well meet the same fate as Netscape .
It 's Waterfox for me , as it's developer has forked off of previous mozilla builds and allows the old extensions .
" All of the other browsers are going in this direction "
That 's just it , why even use FIREFOX if it is no different from chrome .
Go ahead and follow FF off of that cliff .
cltx99 reviewed v56.0 Beta 10 on Sep 9 , 2017 Pros : none Cons : loss of extensions Bottom Line : Happily using Waterfox .
FF has lst its ' way .
Monkey_Punch reviewed v56.0 Beta 10 on Sep 8 , 2017 Pros : Fast , fast , fast on my crappy old hardware .

Bottom Line : Gawd !
Boo hoo , your ancient and no longer supported add - on no longer work .
All other browsers are going in this directon but you do n't see their users complaining .
Tell the author to convert to Webextensions and join the 21st century .
It 's like listening to XP users complaining that web sites and other apps do n't work right anymore .
No * hit !
Get a modern OS and get with the times !
The web and the way browsers interact with it will be * nothing * like it is in a few years .
To keep malicious web sites and other bad guys at bay , the browser world has to change .
Adapt or die .

Everyone tried to tell you MOZILLA , that the ONE thing that made Firefox stand out was the ability to customize it to make it your browser .
That is now a thing of the past and unfortunately Firefox , which I have used since it rose from the ashes of Netscape is soon about to meet the same fate as Netscape .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
A private security company organized and managed by former Secret Service officers spied on Greenpeace and other environmental organizations from the late 1990s through at least 2000 , pilfering documents from trash bins , attempting to plant undercover operatives within groups , casing offices , collecting phone records of activists , and penetrating confidential meetings .
According to company documents provided to Mother Jones by a former investor in the firm , this security outfit collected confidential internal records — donor lists , detailed financial statements , the Social Security numbers of staff members , strategy memos — from these organizations and produced intelligence reports for public relations firms and major corporations involved in environmental controversies .
In addition to focusing on environmentalists , the firm , Beckett Brown International ( later called S2i ) , provided a range of services to a host of clients .
According to its billing records , BBI engaged in “ intelligence collection ” for Allied Waste ; it conducted background checks and performed due diligence for the Carlyle Group , the Washington - based investment firm ; it provided “ protective services ” for the National Rifle Association ; it handled “ crisis management ” for the Gallo wine company and for Pirelli ; it made sure that the Louis Dreyfus Group , the commodities firm , was not being bugged ; it engaged in “ information collection ” for Wal - Mart ; it conducted background checks for Patricia Duff , a Democratic Party fundraiser then involved in a divorce with billionaire Ronald Perelman ; and for Mary Kay , BBI mounted “ surveillance , ” and vetted Gayle Gaston , a top executive at the cosmetics company ( and mother of actress Robin Wright Penn ) , retaining an expert to conduct a psychological assessment of her .
Also listed as clients in BBI records : Halliburton and Monsanto .
BBI , which was headquartered in Easton , Maryland , on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay , worked extensively , according to billing records , for public - relations companies , including Ketchum , Nichols - Dezenhall Communications , and Mongoven , Biscoe & Duchin .
At the time , these PR outfits were servicing corporate clients fighting environmental organizations opposed to their products or actions .
Ketchum , for example , was working for Dow Chemical and Kraft Foods ; Nichols - Dezenhall , according to BBI records , was working with Condea Vista , a chemical manufacturing firm that in 1994 leaked up to 47 million pounds of ethylene dichloride , a suspected carcinogen , into the Calcasieu River in Louisiana .
Like other firms specializing in snooping , Beckett Brown turned to garbage swiping as a key tactic .
BBI officials and contractors routinely conducted what the firm referred to as “ D - line ” operations , in which its operatives would seek access to the trash of a target , with the hope of finding useful documents .
One midnight raid targeted Greenpeace .
One BBI document lists the addresses of several other environmental groups as “ possible sites ” for operations : the National Environmental Trust , the Center for Food Safety , Environmental Media Services , the Environmental Working Group , the U.S. Public Interest Research Group , and the Center for Health , Environment and Justice , an organization run by Lois Gibbs , famous for exposing the toxic dangers of New York ’s Love Canal .
For its rubbish - rifling operations , BBI employed a police officer in the District of Columbia and a former member of the Maryland state police .
Beckett Brown ’s efforts to penetrate environmental groups and other targets came to an end when the business essentially dissolved in 2001 amid infighting between the principals .
But the firm ’s officials went on to work in other security firms that remain active today .
Beckett Brown International began when John C. Dodd III met Richard Beckett at a bar in Easton in 1994 .
Dodd had recently become a millionaire after his father had sold an Anheuser - Busch beer distributorship on Maryland ’s eastern shore .
Beckett ran a local executive recruiting and consulting business .
Soon after they met , according to Dodd , Beckett introduced him to Paul Rakowski , a recently retired Secret Service agent , who had put in two decades protecting presidents and foreign heads of state and had become regional manager of the agency ’s financial crimes division .
Rakowski told Dodd he had an idea for a new security business .
Dodd subsequently received a fax of a business plan for the new company .
The sender ’s address at the top of the fax , according to Dodd , read : “ 11/02/94 USSS Financial Crimes Division / Forgery ” — which suggested it had come from a Secret Service office .
But Dodd was reluctant to put in the start - up money for the enterprise , because he did n’t know who all the partners were .
To impress him , Dodd says , Rakowski and his former Secret Service colleagues began taking him and his friends on special tours of the White House .
“ This was n’t a White House tour conducted by tour guides , ” he says .
“ They would take us …to areas that said ‘ Do not pass this line . ' ”
At one point , Dodd says , a senior Secret Service agent named Joseph Masonis arranged for him to tour a Secret Service facility .
“ To encourage me to invest in this company , ” Dodd notes , “ they all said ‘ why not go up to technical security headquarters [ of the Secret Service ] and you will get an exclusive tour .
’… They showed me everything … .
They were worried about someone flying way up high in a plane , miles from the White House , jumping out of a plane , skydiving , popping the chute and getting on the White House grounds without anybody knowing it .
They were working on the technology to pick that up . ”
Dodd says he was blown away by what he saw .
( Masonis says , “ I have never taken Mr. Dodd to any facility in D.C. ” )
And at a waterfront party , Dodd says , he was introduced to and deeply impressed by George Ferris , a former naval special operations officer and an expert in demolitions .
Eventually , Dodd says , he agreed to be the sole investor of the new firm , and he put up $ 170,000 , the first of what would be several loans at 15 percent interest .
( His investment in the firm , Dodd estimates , would grow to a total of $ 700,000 . )
The company was officially launched in August 1995 , named after Beckett and Sam Brown , a lawyer who helped get it started .
Rakowski , Masonis , and Ferris were officials in the firm .
Business was good .
In early 1997 , Beckett Brown provided security services for Bill Clinton ’s second inauguration , landing a contract worth nearly $ 300,000 .
Early clients also included Phillip Morris , Mary Kay , Browning - Ferris Industries , and Nichols - Dezenhall , a Washington - based firm founded in 1987 by Nick Nichols and Eric Dezenhall that specialized in crisis communications , particularly for corporations involved in biotechnology , product safety , and environmental controversies .
BBI provided protection for retired General Norman Schwarzkopf , Dodd says , and there was talk it might also get a job to guard the Rolling Stones .
By 1998 , BBI had 22 employees working in five different divisions , along with subcontractors that it hired as operatives .
The company also looked abroad for new opportunities and recruited more law enforcement and intelligence veterans .
David Bresett , a former chief of the Secret Service ’s foreign intelligence branch , joined the firm as a vice president .
( A company biography noted that Bresett , while detailed to the CIA , had directed the investigation that identified the terrorists who blew up Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 . )
The firm retained Vincent Cannistraro , a former chief of the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center , and earlier one of the government officials responsible for overseeing U.S. support of the Nicaraguan contras , as a consultant at $ 75,000 a year .
“ I did due diligence on a couple of customers , ” Cannistraro recalls .
On the advice of Cannistraro and Bresett , BBI turned down a $ 1 million job with the Church of Scientology , according to Dodd .
( Bresett did not respond to a message asking for comment . )
At one point , an employee named Tim Ward , who had been a sergeant in the Maryland state police , traveled to Saudi Arabia for the company , according to Dodd .
Phil Giraldi , a former CIA officer , was also on the payroll .
According to Giraldi , there was not a lot of work for him and Cannistraro .
“ We would go to a company like Enron and see if they had any issues if they were looking to acquire a company , ” he recalled .
“ See if the [ company to be acquired ] is connected to the Russia mob .
That ’s what we were selling .
We were not very successful . ”
Giraldi left the firm in 1999 .
By then , he had become aware of the firm ’s more unconventional activities : “ Scooping garbage , trying to get penetrations of companies and environmental groups .
I did n’t know a lot of the details . ”
But , he says , he knew BBI was “ working on Greenpeace . ”
In 2000 , the firm — which had changed its name to S2i after Richard Beckett left the company — was targeting a group of activist organizations opposed to genetically engineered food that had formed a coalition called GE Food Alert .
In the fall of 2000 , with these groups poised to assail Taco Bell , S2i operatives got on the case .
Their thoughts soon turned to garbage .
On September 26 , Jay Bly , a former Secret Service agent working for S2i , sent an email to Tim Ward , the former Maryland state trooper on the payroll :
Received a call from Ketchum yesterday afternoon re three sites in DC .
It seems Taco Bell turned out some product made from bioengineered corn .
The chemicals used on the corn have not been approved for human consumption .
Hence Taco
Bell produced potential glow - in - the - dark tacos .
Taco Bell is owned by Kraft .
The Ketchum Office , New York , has the ball .
They suspect the initiative is being generated from one of three places :
1.Center for Food Safety , 7th & Penn SE
2.Friends of the Earth , 1025 Vermont Ave ( Between K & L Streets )
3.GE Food Alert , 1200 18th St NW ( 18th & M )
# 1 is located on 3rd floor .
Main entrance is key card .
Alley is locked by iron gates .
7 dempsters [ sic ] in alley — take your pick .
# 2 is in the same building as Chile Embassy .
Armed guard in lobby & cameras everywhere .
There is a dumpster in the alley behind the building .
Do n’t know if it is tied to bldg .
or a neighborhood property .
Cameras everywhere .
# 3 is doable but behind locked iron gates at rear of bldg .
In this email , Bly explained the urgency and the goal : “ Apparently there is an article or press release due out next week and [ Ketchum ] would like some pre release information . ”
He then turned practical : “ I want to send Sarah [ another BBI employee ] to site # 1 for a job inquiry .
She can see how big the offices are and get the lay of the land .
Maybe this will narrow the field .
If they have a job opening could she work there for two or three days to find out what ’s going on ? ”
The Friends of the Earth site , he noted , would be tougher to penetrate .
As for the garbage of GE Food Alert , Bly had a plan : “ if we can get some help from our friends who ride the truck .
The alley is tight .
I think the truck can drive down the alley but the container probably is rolled out and dumped .
Looks like one dumpster for the building .
I ’m sitting on the building at 4:00 am tomorrow morning ( if Ketchum gives us a budget ) . ”
And Bly noted that there were other possible opportunities : “ we have found some other affiliates with the above groups .
We are looking for their locations in [ Washington , D.C. ] and hopefully a more S2i friendly site . ”
The following day , Bly emailed Ward about his early morning surveillance :
Re : Dumpster Dive .
I got hold of Jim Daron [ a Washington police officer working for BBI ] yesterday .
He was supposed to do Vermont Ave and Penn Ave SE last night .
I have not heard from him today — what ’s new .
I did 18th St. Weard [ sic ] set up — the dumpster is behind locked gates .
The truck drives down the alley and rings for the night guard to open the gate .
The guard comes out , unlocks and goes back into the building ( probably pissed off because they woke him up ) , the guys walk the bags out to the truck one at a time .
When they finish they locked the gate behind them .
There was so much trash they had to compact the truck two times while they were there .
I did not find anything from the 5th floor , but the good news is it ’s doable .
On September 28 , Ward responded :
Good news !
Think that once Jim [ Daron ] calls you back we will know where we stand .
If he ca n’t get in with the shield , it will be difficult at sight # 1 .
I think # 2 we can do regardless .
The issue is a hot one in general .
I ’ve been following it from here .
Do n’t forget our GP [ Greenpeace ] boy in Baltimore has been handling the work for GP .
It may be worth a check in the city .
Maybe one of our BPD [ Baltimore Police Department ] guys can hit that one .
When you talk with the client push the fact that their client ( the cheese people ) … should put together a trend tracking program for the future .
The anti’s now have found an exposed corporate target and they will be back for more blood .
This email appears to suggests that the Beckett Brown operatives were considering using a Washington police officer ’s badge to gain access to the garbage of the Center for Food Safety .
And Ward was apparently hoping that Beckett Brown could persuade Ketchum to hire the company to monitor the ongoing activity of the activists opposed to genetically - engineered food .
These emails do not indicate whether Beckett Brown succeeded in scooping valuable intelligence from the garbage at these three sites .
But Beckett Brown had already managed to penetrate the anti-GE food network .
In a 1999 report to Ketchum — entitled “ Intelligence Analysis for Dow Global Trends Tracking Team ” — BBI described in detail a strategy session held by 35 representatives of various environmental groups , including the Sierra Club , US PIRG , the Union of Concerned Scientists , and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy .
The report noted the targets the coalition was considering ( Monsanto , DuPont , Dow , the Grocery Manufacturers of America ) and listed various tactics the group had discussed .
Such strategy meetings of this coalition were confidential , according to Dale Wiehoff of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy .
Neither Bly nor Ward would discuss this series of emails or any of the work they did for Beckett Brown or S2i .
“ Legally , I ca n’t tell you anything about what the company did , ” Ward says .
He accuses Dodd of trying to “ besmirch the names of the people involved ” in the company .
Rakowski , Daron , and Beckett did not reply to requests for comments .
Nor did Ketchum .
A spokesman for Kraft says , “ After a review of our historical procurement files , we have no record of work on or about Sept. 26 , 2000 , with either Ketchum , Beckett Brown International or S2i .
In the late ’90s , Ketchum provided some PR services to Kraft for one of our coffee brands .
However , Ketchum does not currently provide PR services to Kraft and has not done so for many years . ”
Time and again , according to Beckett Brown records , the firm looked to trash for intelligence .
These trash runs at one point did raise concern within the company .
In 1998 , David Queen , a senior vice president , sent Rakowski a memo about “ dumpster diving . ”
Queen , a former deputy assistant secretary of the treasury and once a U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania , noted that in certain instances searching trash could raise “ some troublesome issues , ” including possible violation of state trespass laws and “ possible violation of trade secrets laws . ”
He concluded , “ If BBI expects to use this method of information gathering , it would be prudent to get the opinion of outside counsel which could be relied upon by BBI should there be future litigation directed against BBI . ”
Whether or not BBI sought counsel , the dumpster diving continued .
In November 1999 , according to company documents , Jay Bly traveled to St. Augustine , Florida , to meet with a private detective .
He told the investigator that BBI wanted to obtain garbage from the offices of Whetstone Chocolates , a locally based candy manufacturer .
( According to BBI billing records , BBI at the time was working for Nichols - Dezenhall on a “ Nestle Project - Florida . ”
At press time , Nestle had not responded to a request for comment . )
This private investigator and another local gumshoe then tracked the garbage men who made pick - ups at Whetstone and tried to persuade one of the drivers to turn over the trash from Whetstone .
The trash collectors would n’t cooperate .
A month later , another private investigator apparently attempted to grab the garbage himself .
He sent Bly a fax reporting , “ We made a pickup run on December 23,1999 as requested .
We were unable to enter the area where the dumpster is located as there appeared to [ be ] a company party taking place in the break area located in front of the dumpster .
We remained in the area for a short time , however , the party continued and we departed the area . ”
A December 1 , 1999 , BBI briefing paper on a “ Nichols - Dezenhall / St. Augustine Project ” reported on activities within Whetstone and said that “ BBI now has operative in place . ”
Eric Dezenhall says that he cannot identify clients or vendors with which his firm worked .
But he notes in an email that he never saw the briefing paper referring to a BBI operative and Whetstone and that “ we would not have been involved in any infiltration operation . ”
He adds , “ Nichols - Dezenhall Communications never authorized , directed , or was informed of unethical or illegal activities by forensic investigators employed on any project we have worked on .
With regard to our work on matters in which we were teamed with investigators , we are aware only of information - gathering through public records checks and other legitimate means . ”
Dezenhall says that “ any use of an ‘ operative ’ to infiltrate a company … would be counter to our business interests and any information gathered in that manner would be unusable in court . ”
( In 2003 , Dezenhall bought out Nichols and renamed the company Dezenhall Resources .
“ Our client base and employees from the 1990s have turned over almost entirely , ” Dezenhall says .
According to a source familiar with the firm ’s current operations , the company has moved away from handling corporations involved in environmental controversies . )
Another target of BBI ’s trash men was Fenton Communications , the liberal PR firm headed by David Fenton that for years has assisted environmental causes .
On December 8 , 1999 , a BBI operative , according to an internal report , “ sat surveillance ” at Fenton ’s Washington home , beginning at 2:50 am .
In the report , the operative noted the time of the morning garbage pick - up and that he returned to the office to “ sort material ” and “ analyze . ” BBI ran background checks on both Fenton and his then - wife .
The company ’s files contained photographs of their house as well as client lists , billing information , and personnel information from Fenton Communications .
Between July 1998 and February 2001 , Fenton says , his firm experienced several break - ins , during which boxes of files and two laptops were stolen .
The culprits were never caught .
Greenpeace was the target of one of BBI ’s more elaborate — and cinematic — intelligence - gathering efforts , according to company documents and an interview with an eyewitness .
Jennifer Trapnell , who was dating Ward in the late 1990s , recalls an evening when she accompanied Ward on a job in Washington D.C.
“ He said they were trying to get some stuff on Greenpeace , ” she says .
Ward wore black clothes and had told her to dress all in black , too : “ It was Mission Impossible - like . ”
In Washington , Ward parked his truck in an alley , she remembers , and told her to stay in the truck and keep a lookout .
In the alley , he met a couple of other men , whose faces Trapnell did not see clearly .
Ward was talking on a walkie - talkie with others , and they all walked off .
About an hour later , the men came back and placed two trash bags in Ward ’s car .
Trapnell says she did n’t know what they did with the bags — and Ward never explained .
In addition to Ward ’s work , on several occasions in 2000 , Jim Daron , the Washington cop who also worked for BBI , submitted reports to BBI for surveillance of Greenpeace ’s offices .
BBI gathered numerous internal Greenpeace documents , including financial reports .
It also obtained the instructions for using the security system at Greenpeace ’s offices .
And the Greenpeace files at BBI included a handwritten document that appears to record attempts to crack the security codes on entry doors with notations such as “ codes do not match ” and “ open . ”
BBI prepared reports on Greenpeace — based on “ confidential sources ” — for Ketchum .
In at least one case , according to Rick Hind , legislative director for Greenpeace ( who reviewed these reports at Mother Jones ‘ request ) , a BBI report written for Ketchum contained information tightly held within the group about planned upcoming events .
And a December 2 , 1999 BBI report ( which does not mention Ketchum ) noted that Greenpeace had chosen Kellogg ’s , Kraft , and Quaker as “ their main targets in the GE campaign , ” that it was developing a campaign tactic called “ Food - Aid Expose ” ( which would highlight the export of genetically - modified foods to other countries ) , and that it was helping a Wall Street Journal reporter track food companies involved in the debate over genetically - engineered foods .
Over the years , Greenpeace has repeatedly been the target of public relations firms working for industry , and the group has experienced burglaries and caught would - be spies posing as students seeking employment .
But Greenpeace officials say they did not know that their organization was under surveillance during that period of time .
In the late 1990s , Greenpeace was working with environmental groups in the stretch of Louisiana dubbed “ Cancer Alley , ” organizing against various forms of industry pollution .
Its work there and that of its Louisiana partners became another target for BBI .
In 1998 , according to BBI emails , correspondence , and records , BBI retained Mary Lou Sapone , a self - described “ research consultant , ” who recruited a paid operative in Louisiana to infiltrate an environmental group called CLEAN .
Sapone had something of a talent for infiltrating activist groups .
In the late 1980s , working for a security firm called Perceptions International , which was , in turn , working for the U.S. Surgical Corporation , she penetrated a Connecticut - based animal - rights group , gathering evidence on an activist who would later serve jail time for planting a pipe bomb near the parking space of the company ’s CEO .
The activist would eventually accused Sapone of coaxing her into the plot .
Sapone ’s operative in Louisiana relayed to her information on what the local enviros were planning , provided gossip on the internal rivalries , and identified the scientists aiding the groups .
She passed the intelligence to BBI .
In an August 20 , 1998 “ client briefing , ” BBI boasted that “ our operative is being nominated to the citizen action panels for local industries ” and it asked which local industry Condea Vista , the chemical manufacturing firm , would prefer the operative to focus on .
( The previous year , Condea Vista had lost a lawsuit brought by the residents of Lake Charles , Louisiana , against the company for the 1994 ethylene dichloride leak and had been slapped with a $ 7 million judgment . )
Another BBI document noted , “ The operative has been trained to be inquiring , but not participatory .
Operatives are not allowed to offer suggestions or `help ’ targets in any way .
They are trained to seek documents , ID friends and foe legislators and regulators , follow money trails , ID informants , discover future targets . ”
BBI produced detailed confidential reports for Ketchum on the environmental activism underway in Louisiana .
And BBI records indicate that the firm worked for Nichols - Dezenhall on a “ Condea Vista Project . ”
Citing “ strict confidentiality agreements , ” Dezenhall will not say whether his firm worked with Condea Vista ( or any other company ) , but he notes in an email , “ It would be extremely damaging and wrong …to interpret or portray the term ‘ operative , ’ a generic term often used by investigators and former law enforcement types to mean an individual , as implying someone necessarily engaged in illicit actions such as corporate espionage . ”
( Sapone did not respond to a message requesting comment . )
Penetrating a citizens group was not a new endeavor for BBI .
In 1996 and 1997 in northern California , where Browning - Ferris Industries was engaged in a battle over the future of a garbage dump , BBI conducted what its records labeled “ covert monitoring ” and “ intelligence gathering ” on the North Valley Coalition , a citizens group opposed to the Browning - Ferris project .
In September 1997 , BBI received a payment of $ 198,881.05 from BFI .
BBI fell apart in 2001 amid arguments over the company ’s finances .
“ It was not a happy company , ” says Phil Giraldi , the ex-CIA man who had worked there , adding , “ I have worked for a number of security companies .
Some are ethical , some are not .
Beckett Brown was not especially so . ”
When the company was collapsing , Dodd says , he heard that document shredding was underway in its offices , and one weekend he went to the offices and carted off scores of cartons stuffed with records .
BBI ’s demise led to a lawsuit .
Dodd sued Rakowski , Ward , Bly and two others , claiming they had engaged in fraud .
In a pretrial statement , Dodd accused them of having “ dipped into the Company ’s coffers for generous salaries , commissions , bonuses , loans , benefits and unsupported expense reimbursements , all the while presenting false and misleading financial information ” to Dodd .
In 2005 , after a month - long trial in Maryland ’s Talbot County Circuit Court , Dodd lost .
He now was out the $ 700,000 he had invested in the company .
By his own estimate , he had spent over a million dollars in legal fees .
And he was mad .
He claims that he only learned of the firm ’s sleazier actions after the company imploded and that his lawyers encouraged him not to raise that issue as part of his lawsuit .
But after the trial was done , Dodd began contacting some of BBI ’s targets and shared its records with them .
“ I wanted the facts to come out , ” he says .
“ I feel terrible that my money was used to screw these people over . ”
Today , boxes and boxes of BBI records sit in warehouse space Dodd rents .
Dodd has not gone through all of the material .
( The records include internal and confidential financial reports of a local bank that had been the subject of a takeover . )
Much of what BBI did remains a mystery to Dodd .
A law firm representing the Mars candy corporation pored over all the records , according to Dodd and his lawyer , apparently in search of evidence that Mars had been the target of corporate espionage .
( The files contain records indicating that BBI obtained information on the phone calls made by a PR man working with Mars . )
Then Dodd heard nothing further from this law firm .
Dodd says he would be delighted to testify before Congress about BBI — but no one has invited him to do so .
As for BBI ’s principals , they are still operating .
Tim Ward now runs a security firm called Chesapeake Strategies , which bills itself as “ a multinational security and investigative firm comprised of professionals with extensive security experience . ”
Jay Bly works there .
Its website boasts that it maintains affiliated offices in Paris , Beijng , Tokyo , Qatar , and Kuwait and that “ many team members continue to hold Secret and Top Secret government security clearances . ”
The firm has been active in protecting research facilities from animal - rights activists .
In 2002 , it won a contract from the General Services Administration “ for recreational , hospitality , law enforcement , facilities , industrial and environmental services and products . ”
It was listed on a 2005 line - up of Defense Department contractors .
“ I do n’t have any comment about what I am currently doing or what I plan to do , ” Ward says .
Joseph Masonis works for the Annapolis Group , a security firm .
Its website notes that the company ’s managing directors “ have over forty - five years of combined experience with the United States Secret Service . ”
Paul Rakowski married Amy DiGeso , who was CEO of Mary Kay when BBI worked for the cosmetics firm .
( Currently , she is a top executive at Estee Lauder . )
Rakowski ’s current occupation — if he has one — is not publicly known .
Richard Beckett is now CEO of Maryland - based Global Security Services , which , according to its website , offers clients a “ suite of business solutions ” that includes “ intelligence services , ” “ disaster management , ” “ information systems security , ” and “ paramilitary operations . ”
Last year , his firm provided bodyguards to Senator Barack Obama .
The recently dormant topic of CSS frameworks has again spewed a bit of magma last week courtesy of No CSS Reset written by Jonathan Snook .
Naturally , the topic alone is quite a conversation starter , but I ’ve got to admit : I was surprised at the reaction it received .
Jonathan ’s piece was a very down to earth article outlining why he chooses not to use a reset stylesheet .
I , on the other hand , have been using a reset stylesheet for a bit of time , and I do prefer working that way .
Now , I understand I ’ve spoken quite a bit of CSS frameworks over the past year , and even though my sensational headlines have categorized my position to a greater extent than I ’d hoped , I learned quite a bit from both camps during the “ Great CSS Framework Debate of 2007 ” .
Reset CSS causing more work for developers ?
Jonathan ’s post has garnered quite a few comments to the tune of developers not using reset stylesheets simply because it creates more work for them , and they want nothing to do with that .
In all honesty , I fail to relate to something like that .
As I reflect on all the websites I ’ve worked on in the past few years , not once have I used a browser default to style an element .
I always change a number of properties simply because the browser default wo n’t work with the design .
In my case , I ’m consistently writing CSS for elements with browser default styles .
As I browse the Web , I do n’t often examine stylesheets , but from what I can see , there are n’t many websites using browser defaults ( save for strong or em ) .
I have a hard time accepting a conscious choice to pass on a reset stylesheet simply because it causes you more work .
I do ( wholeheartedly ) believe that a reset stylesheet may not save you any significant amount of time , but it will take some persuading to show me it truly creates more work to be done .
I prefer to work with a reset stylesheet if for nothing more than comfort in knowing every element on screen is rendering as such because I told it to .
I do n’t feel additional work was created for me as much as I feel the work is a bit more solid .
The trouble ( I ’ve got ) with browser defaults
One point that has n’t been risen quite yet is the topic of browser defaults in their simplest form .
Who is to say that browser defaults are acceptable to begin with ?
I ’d like to be explicit here in saying that I ’m playing the part of devil ’s advocate .
I often take that stance with issues to put myself in some new shoes .
I completely understand why browser defaults are put in place , it would be silly to try to debate that point , but my question to knowledgeable developers is this : why do you prefer to work with browser default styles ?
We ’ve all come to accept that pixel - perfection is not worth the headache , but using browser defaults will indeed increase the variance of your design .
I can agree that it ’s not a big deal , I ’ve just found it to be a personal preference of mine to avoid .
I ’m completely fine with slight differences in rendering when comparing browser to browser , we ’re not designing print brochures after all .
I do make an effort , though , to keep things to a minimum .
As a follow - up , I ’m curious to hear how many developers found it troublesome working with browser defaults when just learning CSS ?
I ’m self - taught in quite a bit when it comes to what I know about Web development , and I ’m not too embarrassed to admit I was honestly confused when it came to default styles on heading elements in my early days of working with CSS .
In my honest , personal opinion , I do n’t feel that browser defaults truly belong .
That is not to say I feel they ’re inapplicable .
Without browser defaults ,
Web design and development be in a different boat altogether .
It ’s just that after looking at things from a more distant standpoint , browser defaults seem partially counterintuitive to me .
Reset CSS as a framework
The idea behind a framework is to save yourself time and repetition , but in my experience I rarely find myself repeating any significant amount of CSS project to project .
That ’s one of the biggest reasons I have chosen not to use a public - facing CSS framework such as Blueprint or YUI .
There is a significant population who does make use of the frameworks and I think it ’s great .
For them .
While a framework can technically be defined as something which can be consistently reused and applied to any project while working for your benefit , a reset stylesheet , to me , is more unique than that .
I view a reset stylesheet as something to level the ( rocky ) playing field when it comes to writing CSS .
As I write that , I realize that ’s exactly what Blueprint ( or any other CSS framework ) is trying to do .
I think a reset stylesheet changes things in a different way , however .
Instead of working to help you out with browser quirks and retain consistency , a reset stylesheet is more of a big eraser , providing a ‘ clean slate ’ if you will .
A reset stylesheet does inherit an important benefit of a framework : instant implementation .
A reset stylesheet is as easily implemented as keeping a local copy on your hard drive , copying it to your CSS directory , and including it in your document ( s ) .
At the end of the day , I ’m not sure that I can refer to a reset stylesheet as a framework by itself , but instead consider it an optional piece of one .
I ’m sure many will disagree , but a reset stylesheet to me is more a piece you work on as opposed to work with .
To each his ( or her ) own
As with the original CSS framework debate , it comes down to personal preference and what works for you in your workflow .
It ’s been said before and I ’m going to say it again : I ’m glad such a large number of designers and developers are ready ( and more than willing ) to have this conversation .
On top of that , everyone has personal experience to back it up .
As Eric Meyer replied :
Because this is n’t a field of straightforward answers and universal solutions .
We are often faced with problems that have multiple solutions , none of them perfect .
To understand what makes each solution imperfect and to know which of them is the best choice in the situation — that ’s knowing your craft .
That ’s being a craftsman / craftswoman .
It ’s a never - ending process that is all the more critical precisely because it is never - ending .
So it ’s no surprise that we , as a community , keep building and sharing solutions to problems we come across .
Discussions about the merits of those solutions in various situations are also no surprise .
Indeed , they ’re exactly the opposite : the surest and , to me , most hopeful sign that web design or development continues to mature as a profession , a discipline , and a craft .
It ’s evidence that we continue to challenge ourselves and each other to advance our skills , to keep learning better and better how better to do what we love so much .
I would n’t have it any other way .
The rest of Eric ’s entire response is extremely well written , and definitely worth the read .
I do find it a bit troubling , however , that with a number of comments left in response to recent articles written on the subject of reset CSS , zealotry continues to pop up .
Everyone has a reason , good or bad , for how they do things .
It ’s important to have civilized conversation on the subject as opposed to narcissistic comments which do n’t help anybody .
He was a carefree Italian with a recent law degree from a Roman university .
She was “ a totally Virginia girl , ” as she puts it , raised across the road from George Washington ’s home .
Their romance , sparked by a 2006 meeting in a supermarket in Rome , soon brought the Italian , Domenico Salerno , on frequent visits to Alexandria , Va. , where he was welcomed like a favorite son by the parents and neighbors of his girlfriend , Caitlin Cooper .
But on April 29 , when Mr. Salerno , 35 , presented his passport at Washington Dulles International Airport , a Customs and Border Protection agent refused to let him into the United States .
And after hours of questioning , agents would not let him travel back to Rome , either ; over his protests in fractured English , he said , they insisted that he had expressed a fear of returning to Italy and had asked for asylum .
Ms. Cooper , 23 , who had promised to show her boyfriend another side of her country on this visit  meaning Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon  eventually learned that he had been sent in shackles to a rural Virginia jail .
And there he remained for more than 10 days , locked up without charges or legal recourse while Ms. Cooper , her parents and their well - connected neighbors tried everything to get him out .
Mr. Salerno ’s case may be extreme , but it underscores the real but little - known dangers that many travelers from Europe and other first - world nations face when they arrive in the United States  problems that can startle Americans as much as their foreign visitors .
Surprisingly , it was a Catholic museum !
The mind reels :
They knew it would be risky to exhibit a homoerotic version of Christ ’s Last Supper , but curators at museum of Vienna ’s Roman Catholic Cathedral were n’t ready for a barrage of angry messages and calls to be shut down .
The episode is being described as the equivalent of the Mohammad cartoons fiasco , and it is indeed identical in every way , except for the facts that it was the Catholic museum itself , that chose to host these obscene paintings , and the protests have been entirely peaceful and non threatening .
Basically , a lot of people saying , “ Hey !
This ai n’t right ! ”
But other than that …. yeah … just the same !
The Church hastily removed the main picture , “ a homosexual orgy ” of the Apostles as Hrdlicka describes it .
But the protest has continued , much to the surprise of the small Cathedral Museum which is nestled down a narrow street in Vienna ’s historic Gothic quarter .
Surprise ???
“ Huh !
People do n’t like to see obscene depictions of their Lord and savior ?
Gee !
We did .
not . see that coming ! ” …. Puhleeeese !
The museum ’s director defends both Hrdlicka ’s work and his decision to host the artist ’s controversial versions of biblical imagery in a museum tied to the Catholic Church .
“ We think Hrdlicka is entitled to represent people in this carnal , drastic way , ” Bernhard Boehler said in his small museum office , across the street from Vienna ’s imposing St. Stephan ’s Cathedral .
Nobody disputes Hrdlicka ’s right to explore his sick fantasies in art .
Just … how about not displaying them in a CATHOLIC MUSEUM ?????
Did the perverted works of a communist and atheist really seem like a good fit for a Catholic museum ?
He said the museum never intended to offend people but that art should be allowed to provoke a debate .
Here ’s the debate we should be having …
Should the museum ’s director be shit - canned over this obscene garbage , or be demoted to head janitor at the now disgraced museum ?
I ’d vote for the latter , provided he is n’t put in charge of what goes on the bathroom walls .
“ I do n’t see any blasphemy here , ” he said , gesturing at a Crucifixion picture showing a soldier simultaneously beating Jesus and holding his genitals .
“ People can imagine what they want to . ”
Fair enough , fair enough .
So , how about that picture of Jesus and the 12 disciples crawling all over each other at The Last Supper ?
Idiot !
Boehler says that picture drew particular criticism from some visitors , along with a sculpture of Jesus on the cross without a face or loincloth that some Christians found offensive .
But the most disputed work was ‘ Leonardo ’s Last Supper , restored by Pier Paolo Pasolini ’ which showed cavorting Apostles sprawling over the dining table and masturbating each other .
Hrdlicka says he represented the men in this way because there are no women in the Da Vinci painting which inspired it .
Pasolini was a controversial Italian filmmaker and writer who was murdered in the 1970s .
There were no women in the Da Vinci painting .
That explains why he has Jesus and the 12 “ cavorting ” all over each other ?
Dang !
Is that what guys really do when there are no women in the room ?
This whole thing is the result of crass thinking , diseased imaginations , and a total failure to discern logical outcomes .
Of course people would be offended by this .
There is no point to it other than to offend .
Spark debate ?
What debate ?
Did Jesus and his disciples have sex at The Last Supper ?
Shut .
Up .
The point of the Mohammad cartoons , ( and Fitna ) was to spark debate .
Is Islam an inherently violent religion ?
These artists were genuinely brave to present us with these works because their lives are now danger because of them .
Point well made .
The Mohammad cartoon protests escalated into violence resulting in more than 100 deaths .
Protesters set fire to the Danish Embassies in Syria , Lebanon and Iran , stormed European buildings , and desecrated the Danish , Norwegian and German flags in Gaza City .
A number of Muslim leaders issued death threats .
What are the Christian protesters going to do ?
Fast ?
Pray the rosary outside of the museum ?
Forgo bingo at St. Stephan ’s Cathedral until the archbishop of Vienna has the entire display removed from the museum ?
If artists and curators want to feel brave , cutting edge , and relevant , let ’s see them produce something deemed offensive to Islam to spark a debate , and we ’ll talk .
You can view some of the images at Vox Humanae .
Good lord .
Here ’s the museum website .

Fausta says :
That the Catholic hierarchy would allow such display of pornography at a Catholic museum shows that the moral compass of Europe has disintegrated to the point where even religious authorities , who are called to lead in matters of morality , can not distinguish between right and wrong .
Political correctness and moral equivalence have supplanted a moral compass .
Because of that , the EUropeans have become their own worst enemies .
Agreed .
The fact that the Austrian church acquiesced to this abomination is the most disheartening part of this story .
Hi Ace readers .
Behave yourselves , now …

“ Check it out .
It ’s actually a jet engine , ” says Johnathan Goodwin , with a low whistle .
“ This thing is gonna be even cooler than I thought . ”
We ’re hunched on the floor of Goodwin ’s gleaming workshop in Wichita , Kansas , surrounded by the shards of a wooden packing crate .
Inside the wreckage sits his latest toy–a 1985 - issue turbine engine originally designed for the military .
It can spin at a blistering 60,000 rpm and burn almost any fuel .
And Goodwin has some startling plans for this esoteric piece of hardware :
He ’s going to use it to create the most fuel - efficient Hummer in history .
advertisement

Goodwin , a 37 - year - old who looks like Kevin Costner with better hair , is a professional car hacker .
The spic - and - span shop is filled with eight monstrous trucks and cars–Hummers , Yukon XLs , Jeeps–in various states of undress .
His four tattooed , twentysomething grease monkeys crawl all over them with wrenches and welding torches .
Goodwin leads me over to a red 2005 H3 Hummer that ’s up on jacks , its mechanicals removed .
He aims to use the turbine to turn the Hummer into a tricked - out electric hybrid .
Like most hybrids , it ’ll have two engines , including an electric motor .
But in this case , the second will be the turbine , Goodwin ’s secret ingredient .
Whenever the truck ’s juice runs low , the turbine will roar into action for a few seconds , powering a generator with such gusto that it ’ll recharge a set of “ supercapacitor ” batteries in seconds .
This means the H3 ’s electric motor will be able to perform awesome feats of acceleration and power over and over again , like a Prius on steroids .
What ’s more , the turbine will burn biodiesel , a renewable fuel with much lower emissions than normal diesel ; a hydrogen - injection system will then cut those low emissions in half .
And when it ’s time to fill the tank , he ’ll be able to just pull up to the back of a diner and dump in its excess french - fry grease–as he does with his many other Hummers .
Oh , yeah , he adds , the horsepower will double –from 300 to 600 .
“ Conservatively , ” Goodwin muses , scratching his chin , “ it ’ll get 60 miles to the gallon .
With 2,000 foot - pounds of torque .
You ’ll be able to smoke the tires .
And it ’s going to be superefficient . ”
He laughs .
“ Think about it : a 5,000 - pound vehicle that gets 60 miles to the gallon and does zero to 60 in five seconds ! ”
This is the sort of work that ’s making Goodwin famous in the world of underground car modders .
He is a virtuoso of fuel economy .
He takes the hugest American cars on the road and rejiggers them to get up to quadruple their normal mileage and burn low - emission renewable fuels grown on U.S. soil–all while doubling their horsepower .
The result thrills eco-evangelists and red-meat Americans alike : a vehicle that ’s simultaneously green and mean .
And word ’s getting out .
In the corner of his office sits Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s 1987 Jeep Wagoneer , which Goodwin is converting to biodiesel ; soon , Neil Young will be shipping him a 1960 Lincoln Continental to transform into a biodiesel–electric hybrid .
His target for Young ’s car ?
One hundred miles per gallon .
advertisement
This is more than a mere American Chopper–style makeover .
Goodwin ’s experiments point to a radically cleaner and cheaper future for the American car .
The numbers are simple : With a $ 5,000 bolt - on kit he co-engineered –the poor man ’s version of a Goodwin conversion –he can immediately transform any diesel vehicle to burn 50 % less fuel and produce 80 % fewer emissions .
On a full - size gas - guzzler , he figures the kit earns its money back in about a year–or , on a regular car , two–while hitting an emissions target from the outset that ’s more stringent than any regulation we ’re likely to see in our lifetime .
“ Johnathan ’s in a league of his own , ” says Martin Tobias , CEO of Imperium Renewables , the nation ’s largest producer of biodiesel .
“ Nobody out there is doing experiments like he is . ”
Nobody –particularly not Detroit .
Indeed , Goodwin is doing precisely what the big American automakers have always insisted is impossible .
They have long argued that fuel - efficient and alternative - fuel cars are a hard sell because they ’re too cramped and meek for our market .
They ’ve lobbied aggressively against raising fuel - efficiency and emissions standards , insisting that either would doom the domestic industry .
Yet the truth is that Detroit is now getting squeezed from all sides .
This fall , labor unrest is brewing , and after decades of inertia on fuel - economy standards , Congress is jockeying to boost the target for cars to 35 mpg , a 10 mpg jump ( which is either ridiculously large or ridiculously small , depending on whom you ask ) .
More than a dozen states are enacting laws requiring steep reductions in greenhouse - gas emissions .
Meanwhile , gas prices have hovered around $ 3 per gallon for more than a year .
And European and Japanese carmakers are flooding the market with diesel and hybrid machines that get up to 40 % better mileage than the best American cars ; some , such as Mercedes ’s new BlueTec diesel sedans , deliver that kind of efficiency and more horsepower .
General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler , in short , have a choice : Cede still more ground–or mount a technological counterattack .
Goodwin ’s work proves that a counterattack is possible , and maybe easier than many of us imagined .
If the dream is a big , badass ride that ’s also clean , well , he ’s there already .
As he points out , his conversions consist almost entirely of taking stock GM parts and snapping them together in clever new ways .
“ They could do all this stuff if they wanted to , ” he tells me , slapping on a visor and hunching over an arc welder .
“ The technology has been there forever .
They make 90 % of the components I use . ”
He does n’t have an engineering degree ; he did n’t even go to high school : “ I ’ve just been messing around and seeing what I can do . ”
All of which raises an interesting possibility .
Has this guy in a far - off Kansas garage figured out the way to save Detroit ?
America ’s most revolutionary innovations , it has long been said , sprang from the ramshackle dens of amateurs .
Thomas Edison was a home - schooled dropout who got his start tinkering with battery parts ; Chester Carlson invented the photocopier in his cramped Long Island kitchen .
NASA , desperate for breakthroughs to help it return to the moon , has set up million - dollar prizes to encourage private citizens to come forward with any idea , no matter how crazy .
As the theory goes , only those outside big industries can truly reinvent them .

Goodwin is certainly an outsider .
He grew up in a dirt - poor Kansas family with six siblings and by age 13 began taking on piecework in local auto shops to help his mother pay the bills .
He particularly enjoyed jamming oversized engines into places no one believed they ’d fit .
He put truck engines inside Camaros , Grand Nationals , and Super Bees ; he even put a methanol - fueled turbocharger on a tiny Yamaha Banshee four - wheeler .
“ We took that thing from 35 horsepower to 208 , ” he recalls .
“ It was crazy .
We could n’t put enough fins on the back to keep it on the ground . ”
After dropping out of school in the seventh grade , he made a living by buying up totaled cars and making them as good as new .
“ That , ” he says , “ was my school . ”
Along the way , Goodwin also adopted two views common among Americans , but typically thought to be in conflict : a love of big cars and a concern about the environment .
He is an avid , if somewhat nonideological , environmentalist .
He believes global warming is a serious problem , that reliance on foreign oil is a mistake , and that butt - kicking fuel economy is just good for business .
But Goodwin is also guiltlessly addicted to enormous , brawling rides , precisely the sort known to suck down Saudi gasoline .
( I spied one lonely small sports car in the corner of his garage , but he confessed he has no plans to work on it right now . )
When he picked me up from my hotel , he drove a four - door 2008 Cadillac Escalade XL that should have had its own tugboat .
He parallel parked it in one try .
If Goodwin is an artist , though , his canvas has been the Hummer .
His first impression of the thing was inauspicious .
In 1999 , he bought an H1 in Denver and began driving it back to Kansas .
Within 50 miles , the bolts in the transmission shook loose , forcing him to stop to fix it .
“ By the time I made it home , after three roadside repairs , I pretty much knew that the Hummer was not all it should be , ” he told me .
He did n’t think much of the 200 horsepower engine , either , which did “ zero to 60 in two days .
It was a piece of junk . ”
So Goodwin decided to prove that environmentalism and power could go together–by making his new lemon into exhibit A . First , he pulled the gas engine so he could drop in a Duramax V8 , GM ’s core diesel for large trucks .
Diesel technology is crucial to all of Goodwin ’s innovations because it offers several advantages over traditional gasoline engines .
Pound for pound , diesel offers more power and torque ; it ’s also inherently more efficient , offering up to 40 % better mileage and 20 % lower emissions in engines of comparable size .
What ’s more , many diesel engines can easily accept a wide range of biodiesel–from the high - quality stuff produced at refineries to the melted chicken grease siphoned off from the local KFC .
“ Think about it , ” Goodwin laughs .
“ A 5,000 - pound vehicle that gets 60 miles to the gallon and will do zero to 60 in five seconds ! ”
Putting a diesel engine in the Hummer , however , required Goodwin to crack GM ’s antitheft system , which makes it a pain to swap out the engine .
In that system , the engine communicates electronically with the body , fuel supply , and ignition ; if you do n’t have all the original components , the car wo n’t start .
Goodwin jerry - rigged a set of cables to trick the engine into believing the starter system had broken , sending it into “ fail - safe mode ” –a backdoor mechanism installed at the factory .
( At one point in his story , Goodwin wanders over to a battered cardboard box in the corner of the garage and hauls out an octopuslike tangle of wires –“ the MacGyver , ” his hacking device .
“ I could have sold this for a lot of money on eBay , ” he chuckles . )
Once he ’d picked the car ’s lock , Goodwin installed the Duramax and a five - speed Allison – the required transmission for a Duramax , which also helps give it race - car - like control and a rapid take off .
After five days ’ worth of work , the Hummer was getting about 18 mpg–double the factory 9 mpg–and twice the original horsepower .
He drove it over to a local restaurant and mooched some discarded oil from its deep fryer , strained the oil through a pair of jeans , and poured it into the engine .
It ran perfectly .

But Goodwin wanted more .
While researching alternative fuels , he learned about the work of Uli Kruger , a German who has spent decades in Australia exploring techniques for blending fuels that normally do n’t mix .
One of Kruger ’s systems induces hydrogen into the air intake of a diesel engine , producing a cascade of emissions - reducing and mileage - boosting effects .
The hydrogen , ignited by the diesel combustion , burns extremely clean , producing only water as a by - product .
It also displaces up to 50 % of the diesel needed to fuel the car , effectively doubling the diesel ’s mileage and cutting emissions by at least half .
Better yet , the water produced from the hydrogen combustion cools down the engine , so the diesel combustion generates fewer particulates–and thus fewer nitrogen - oxide emissions .
“ You can feed it hydrogen , diesel , biodiesel , corn oil–pretty much anything but water . ”
“ It ’s really a fantastic chain reaction , all these good things happening at once , ” Kruger tells me .
He has also successfully introduced natural gas–a ubiquitous and generally cheap fuel –into a diesel - burning engine , which likewise doubles the mileage while slashing emissions .
In another system , he uses heat from the diesel engine to vaporize ethanol to the point where it can be injected into the diesel combustion chambers as a booster , with similar emissions - cutting effects .
Goodwin began building on Kruger ’s model .
In 2005 , he set to work adapting his own H1 Hummer to burn a combination of hydrogen and biodiesel .
He installed a Duramax in the Hummer and plopped a carbon - fiber tank of supercompressed hydrogen into the bed .
The results were impressive : A single tank of hydrogen lasted for 700 miles and cut the diesel consumption in half .
It also doubled the horsepower .
“ It reduces your carbon footprint by a huge , huge amount , but you still get all the power of the Duramax , ” he says , slapping the H1 on the quarter panel .
“ And you can feed it hydrogen , diesel , biodiesel , corn oil–pretty much anything but water . ”
Two years ago , Goodwin got a rare chance to show off his tricks to some of the car industry ’s most prominent engineers .
He tells me the story :
He was driving a converted H2 to the SEMA show , the nation ’s biggest annual specialty automotive confab , and stopped en route at a Denver hotel .
When he woke up in the morning , there were 20 people standing around his Hummer .
Did I run over somebody ?
he wondered .
As it turned out , they were engineers for GM , the Hummer ’s manufacturer .
They noticed that Goodwin ’s H2 looked modified .
“ Does it have a diesel engine in it ? ” “ Yeah , ” he said .
“ No way , ” they replied .

He opened the hood , “ and they ’re just all in and out and around the valves and checking it out , ” he says .
They asked to hear it run , sending a stab of fear through Goodwin .
He ’d filled it up with grease from a Chinese restaurant the day before and was worried that the cold morning might have solidified the fuel .
But it started up on the first try and ran so quietly that at first they did n’t believe it was really on .
“ When you start a diesel engine up on vegetable oil , ” Goodwin says , “ you turn the key , and you hear nothing .
Because of the lubricating power of the oil , it ’s just so smooth .
Whisper quiet .
And they ’re like , ‘ Is it running ?
Yeah , you can hear the fan going . '”
One engineer turned and said , “ GM said this would n’t work . ”
“ Well , ” Goodwin replied , “ here it is . ”
Goodwin ’s feats of engineering have become gradually more visible over the past year .
Last summer , Imperium Renewables contacted MTV ’s show Pimp My Ride about creating an Earth Day special in which Goodwin would convert a muscle car to run on biodiesel .
The show chose a ’ 65 Chevy Impala , and when the conversion was done , he ’d doubled its mileage to 25 mpg and increased its pull from 250 to 800 horsepower .
As a stunt , MTV drag - raced the Impala against a Lamborghini on California ’s Pomona Raceway .
“ The Impala blew the Lamborghini away , ” says Kevin Kluemper , the lead calibration engineer for GM ’s Allison transmission unit , who ’d flown down to help with the conversion .
Schwarzenegger , who was on the set that day , asked Goodwin on the spot to convert his Wagoneer to biodiesel .
Observers of Goodwin ’s work say his skill lies in an uncanny ability to visualize a mechanical system in precise detail , long before he picks up a wrench .
( Goodwin says he does much of his mental work during long drives . )
“ He has talent unknown to any mortal , ” says Mad Mike , Pimp My Ride ‘s host .
“ He has this ability to see things so exactly , and I still do n’t know how he does it . ”
For his part , Goodwin argues he ’s merely “ a problem solver .
Most people try to make things more complicated than they are . ”
He speaks of the major carmakers with a sort of mild disdain :
If he can piece together cleaner vehicles out of existing GM parts and a bit of hot - rod elbow grease , why ca n’t they bake that kind of ingenuity into their production lines ?
Prod him enough on the subject and his mellowness peels away , revealing a guy fired by an almost manic frustration .
“ Everybody should be driving a plug - in vehicle right now , ” he complains , in one of his laconic engineering lectures , as we wander through the blistering Kansas heat to a nearby Mexican restaurant .
“ I can go next door to Ace Hardware and buy a DC electric motor , go out to my four - wheel - drive truck , remove the transmission and engine , bolt the electric motor onto the back of the transfer case , put a series of lead - acid batteries up to 240 volts in the back of the bed , and we ’re good to go .
I guarantee you I could drive all around town and do whatever I need , go home at night , and hook up a couple of battery chargers , plug one into an outlet , and be good to go the next day .

“ Detroit could do all this stuff overnight if it wanted to , ” he adds .
In reality , Goodwin ’s work has begun to influence some of Detroit ’s top auto designers , but through curious and circuitous routes .
In 2005 , Tom Holm , the founder of EcoTrek , a nonprofit that promotes the use of alternative fuels , heard about Goodwin through the Hummer - junkie grapevine and hired him .
When Holm showed GM the vehicles Goodwin converted , the company was duly impressed .
Internally , Hummer executives had long been looking for a way to blunt criticism of the H2 ’s gas - guzzling tendencies and saw Goodwin ’s vehicles as an object lesson in what was possible .
So GM decided to flip the switch :
It announced the same year that , beginning in 2008 , it would convert its gasoline Hummers to run on ethanol ; by 2010 , it said , Hummers would be biodiesel - compatible .
“ It was an influence , ” concedes Hummer general manager Martin Walsh , of the EcoTrek vehicles .
“ We wanted to be environmentally responsible by having engines in Hummers that run on renewable fuels . ”
But until I contacted Hummer for this story , GM did n’t know that the man behind those machines was none other than Goodwin .
GM ’s commitment is a start , however halting .
Overall , though , Detroit still seems to be all but paralyzed by the challenges of fuel economy , emissions , and alternative fuels .
And it ’s not just about greed or laziness :
Talk to car - industry experts , and they ’ll point out a number of serious barriers to introducing radically new alternative - fuel vehicles on a scale that will make a difference .
One of the highest is that low - emission fuels –biodiesel , ethanol , electricity , hydrogen , all of which account for less than 3 % of the nation ’s fuel supply –just are n’t widely available on American highways .
This creates a chicken - and - egg problem .
People wo n’t buy alternative - fuel cars until it ’s easy to fill them up , but alternative fuel makers wo n’t ramp up production until there ’s a viable market .
Goodwin admits all these things are true but believes the country could be weaned off gasoline in a three - step process .
The first would be for Detroit to aggressively roll out diesel engines , much as Europe has already begun to do ( some 50 % of all European cars run diesel ) .
In a single stroke , that would improve the nation ’s mileage by as much as 40 % , and , because diesel fuel is already widely available , drivers could take that step with a minimum of disruption .
What ’s more , given that many diesel engines can also run homegrown biodiesel , a mass conversion to diesel would help kick - start that market .
( This could have geopolitical implications as well as environmental and economic ones :
The Department of Transportation estimated in 2004 that if we converted merely one - third of America ’s passenger cars and light trucks to diesel , we ’d reduce our oil consumption by up to 1.4 million barrels of oil per day–precisely the amount we import from Saudi Arabia . )
The second step in Goodwin ’s scheme would be to produce diesel - electric hybrid cars .
This would double the mileage on even the biggest diesel vehicles .
The third phase would be to produce electric hybrids that run in “ dual fuel ” mode , burning biodiesel along with hydrogen , ethanol , natural gas , or propane .
This is the concept Goodwin is proving out in his turbine - enhanced H3 Hummer and in Neil Young ’s Lincoln : “ At that point , your mileage just goes really , really high , and your emissions are incredibly low , ” he says .
Since those vehicles can run on regular diesel or biodiesel–and without any alternative fuel at all , if need be–drivers would n’t have to worry about getting stranded on the interstate .
At the same time , as more and more dual - fuel cars hit the road , they would goose demand for genuinely national ethanol , hydrogen , and biodiesel grids .
advertisement
For Goodwin , navigating this process is all about imagination and adaptability .
“ The point is to design cars that are flexible , ” he says .
“ You ’ll see a change in how vehicles are fueled in the future .
Which fuel source will be the exclusive one or the one that ’ll take over the petroleum base is , you know , anybody ’s guess , so it ’s like the wild , wild West of fuel technology right now .
I think it ’ll be a combination between a few different fuels .
I know hydrogen will definitely come around . ”
Imagination and vision , of course , are often rewarded .
As global pressure increases on the United States to reduce our carbon emissions , those rewards are likely to get juicier .
Under some versions of legislation being considered in Congress , for example , companies voluntarily deploying superefficient vehicles in large fleets could be awarded substantial offsets .
Take DHL , the FedEx rival : Goodwin says his company , SAE Energy , is negotiating with the shipper to convert 800 of its vehicles to dual fuel .
“ We could get them an offset of something like 70 cents a gallon , ” Goodwin says , “ and reduce their cost of fuel by 50 % . ”
Industry insiders and observers agree with many of Goodwin ’s prescriptions , particularly his concept of fuel flexibility .
“ We have to have alternatives , ” says Beau Boeckmann , vice president of California ’s Galpin Motors , the largest Ford dealership in the country , who recently partnered with Goodwin to convert a 2008 F450 truck to hydrogen and biodiesel .
“ Only with a combination of things can we get alternative fuels off the ground . ”
Boeckmann believes hydrogen is the true “ silver bullet ” for ending greenhouse gases but thinks it ’ll take more than a decade to figure out how to create and distribute it cheaply .
Mary Beth Stanek , GM ’s director of environment , energy , and safety policy , also agrees with the multifuel approach–and points out that this is precisely how Brazil weaned itself from regular gasoline .
“ They pull up to the pump , and they ’ve got a whole bunch of different choices , ” she notes .
She , too , predicts diesel will make a comeback because of its inherent fuel efficiency : “ You will see more vehicles going back to diesel over a lot of different lines . ”
Yet in reality , American carmakers seem conspicuously slow on the uptake .
Stanek is about as ardent a fan of alternative fuels as you ’re likely to find inside GM , but even she admits no one there is seriously thinking of abandoning the gasoline engine anytime soon .
The 300 - million - gallon U.S. biodiesel business is a fraction of the 12 - billion - gallon ethanol one .
And Detroit is extremely cautious about what the market can bear .
A Detroit carmaker does , of course , have to worry about selling millions of cars at reasonable prices .
But we ’ve been hearing this refrain for a long , long time .
And with European and Japanese carmakers driving ever harder into our market–and with Chrysler having become just another meal for Cerberus Capital –this hardly seems like the time to be overly cautious .
( Those ultralow - emission Mercedes BlueTec diesels , for example , include a four - wheel - drive sedan that gets 37 mpg and goes from zero to 60 in 6.6 seconds . )
Moreover , after decades of consumer apathy , improving fuel economy and reducing carbon output are becoming urgent national priorities .
The green groundswell has arrived , and , given the stakes , anyone who ignores it does so at his peril .
If Detroit ca n’t sell diesel now–especially a clean , high - performance , money - saving diesel–it never will .
With U.S. carmakers being stripped for parts , now is hardly the time for them to play it safe .
Goodwin , perhaps , can afford to be a visionary .
He has the luxury of converting cars for fancy clients who ’ll pay handsomely to drive on higher moral ground .
( He charges $ 28,000 for a “ basic H2 conversion to diesel–custom concept cars cost far more . ” )
The future of the American car will likely be won by an automaker that can split the difference–one that may innovate more slowly than Goodwin would like , but a hell of a lot faster than the Big Three .

Goodwin himself seems more oracle than implementer , slightly unsure of how his ideas could be brought to the masses .
He ’s working on patenting aspects of his and Kruger ’s dual - fuel work and would love to license it to the big carmakers .
But the truth is , he ’s a mechanic ’s mechanic –happiest when he ’s solving some technical puzzle .
He loves getting his hands dirty , “ throwing wrenches around ” in his shop , pioneering some weird new way to fuel a car .
Today , he ’s thinking about taking his wife ’s Infiniti , outfitting it with a tank of ether , and powering the engine via blasts of compressed air in the cylinders .
“ Zero emissions ! ” he crows .
It ’s the visionary inventor ’s curse : constantly distracted by shiny objects .
Goodwin eyes the turbine , which he has dragged out to the center of the floor .
Just for kicks , he says , he ’s thinking of mounting it on a wheelie board and firing it up .
“ I ’d love to see how fast that goes , ” he says .
“ I ’m just not sure how I ’m going to steer it . ”
A Russian television journalist has been found dead in his flat in Moscow only hours after posting a blog entry on his website in which he joked that he had become a dissident .
Ilyas Shurpayev had reported from all the most dangerous parts of Russia , including Chechnya and his native Dagestan , but he was killed in his own apartment in the Russian capital .
Police said he had been strangled to death ; he was found with a belt around his neck and multiple knife wounds .
Neighbours reported a fire at about 2 am yesterday , and on arrival the fire brigade discovered the body .
It is believed a fire had been started in an attempt to cover up the crime .
The police said the murder was most likely linked to " personal issues " , but that they were also considering the possibility that it was linked to Mr Shurpayev 's work .

" It 's difficult to imagine someone working for the First Channel [ state - run television ] would be killed for their work , " said Oleg Panfilov , of the Moscow - based Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations .
" I can't remember any of his material that could have led to this , and I think it 's more likely to be about personal reasons . "
A concierge in Mr Shurpayev 's apartment building told Russian media the journalist had asked her to let in two people to visit him late on Thursday evening , which suggests that he knew his attackers .
Mr Shurpayev had worked out of Dagestan for several years and only moved to Moscow in February .
Mr Panfilov said he had spent the past month finding an apartment and getting used to the capital .
" We spoke quite often and I 'm sure if he'd felt he was under any threat due to his work he would have told me about it , " he said .
More than a dozen journalists have been killed in Russia in contract - style killings since President Vladimir Putin took office in 2000 and cases are rarely brought to court .
The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Russia as the third most dangerous country in the world for journalists to work in .
Those targeted are usually strident opponents of the authorities , such as Anna Politkovskaya , or involved in investigative reporting rooting out corruption or abuses of power .
Mr Shurpayev does not seem to fit into either of these categories .
He had reported from across Russia 's restive North Caucasus and from Georgia 's breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , but his work was not controversial and he was not known for investigative reporting .
His last report to appear on the First Channel 's news was about the restoration of a monastery in Abkhazia .
However , suspicions will be raised by an entry that Mr Shurpayev posted on his personal blog just before 4 pm on Thursday .
He wrote that a newspaper in Dagestan had put him on a blacklist of people that could not be published .
He expressed amazement at the decision , writing that he could not believe he had been labelled a dissident .
Just before 7 pm he logged into Odnoklassniki , a popular social networking site .
Just a few hours later he was found dead .
Was the final blog a fatal move ?
www.shurpayev.livejournal.com posted 20 March at 3.49 pm Moscow time .

Well , I made it !
Now I 'm a dissident !

I already wrote here that at a Dagestani newspaper there 's a battle going on between the journalists and the founders .
But all of this is far too serious and I do n't really understand it .
Here 's what blows me away .

Sci Fi Looks for " Sanctuary "
With the popularity of movies like " 300 " and " Sin City , " it was only a matter of time before their unique visual style was transplanted to television .
That 's where Sci Fi Channel 's new series comes in .
Titled " Sanctuary , " the new program has the distinct honor of becoming TV 's first series to use live actors in an all - green screen environment .
According to MovieWeb , the show plans to use CGI to create 90 percent of its sets , much like last year 's " 300 " did to fashion the Battle of Thermopylae .
The show sounds like it's in good hands , seeing as how it 's being helmed by Damian Kindler and Martin Wood , who have previously worked on " Stargate SG - 1 " and " Stargate Atlantis " respectively .
The show focuses on a doctor ( actress Amanda Tapping ) who believes there are mutant creatures among us , but hidden in the shadows .
Helping to track these creatures down are her daughter , a tech guy and a profiler who 's trained to find the unusual .
Production begins soon and 13 episodes are due this fall .-- Chris Sardelli
Harsh winters , polluted air , crumbling apartment blocks – the residents of many Russian towns might feel that they have cause for complaint .
But in Chapayevsk , a town of about 70,000 inhabitants in European Russia , the mayor himself has suggested a novel way of solving the town 's problems – abandon it .
You can hardly blame him – 96 per cent of all children there are deemed unhealthy .
Chapayevsk , close to the Volga river and the city of Samara , is home to factories that produced chemical weapons for many years , and is blighted by air and soil pollution .
According to the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta , at a round table meeting on the environment in Samara this week , the town 's mayor , Nikolai Malakhov , said that resettling the town 's residents would be an " ideal solution " to Chapayevsk 's problems .
The town was founded about a century ago and was named Chapayevsk in 1929 , after the Bolshevik Civil War hero Vasily Chapayev .
It was the site of a chemical weapons factory that churned out mustard gas and other deadly weapons in industrial quantities .
The factory also made conventional bombs and mines .
According to factory veterans , chemical warheads were made by pouring mustard gas solution from a teapot into the bombs , with the toxic chemicals frequently spilling over into factory drains .
Over time the city 's water became contaminated with dioxins and other poisons .
Today the factory produces herbicides , not chemical weapons , but the pollution in the air and the ground is there to stay .

A study undertaken by American scientists in 2005 found that not only was the air in Chapayevsk contaminated with dioxins , but also locally produced fruit and vegetables , as well as the meat from locally farmed animals .
The more local produce that people ate , the more likely they were to get ill .
The scientists found dioxin levels in the ground as high as in those parts of Vietnam sprayed with the infamous Agent Orange during the US campaign there .
According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta , the fatality rates from throat , liver and kidney cancer in Chapayevsk are three times higher than in nearby cities .
The American study found a whole range of sexual abnormalities in Chapayevsk boys , who typically have a late start to puberty .
With the factories no longer providing work , the town also has a high level of unemployment , and one of the highest levels of heroin use in the country , which is contributing to the start of an HIV epidemic .
So the mayor 's plan sounds like a good one .
But a spokesperson at the local parliament denied that there was any serious talk of relocating the town 's inhabitants .
Some experts believe that abandoning the town might be the most economically viable option , however .
" For 100 years , factories in Chapayevsk have been producing weapons , powders and chemical components , " Oleg Mitvol , deputy head of Russia 's official environmental watchdog , told a Russian agency .
" There are several cities like this in Russia .
But we can spend 50 m roubles ( £ 1 m ) on recultivating the stream that runs through the village that has been contaminated , and nothing will improve .
To do it right , we'd have to dig a new channel , redirect the stream there , and remove all the soil .
Can you imagine how much that would cost ?
The only sensible way to solve this problem is with resettlement . "
But despite all the problems , a representative of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring , said that Chapayevsk was far from being among the worst Russian cities .
" It had an air pollution index of 7.8 in 2007 , " said a spokesperson .
" To be in the league of the dirtiest towns in Russia , it should be 14 . "
The most famous case of abandonment is Pripyat , now in Ukraine , a town of 50,000 that was evacuated in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 .

Early child abuse may forever change the way genes are expressed in the brain , suggests a postmortem study of people who died by suicide .
It is now well established that it is n’t just what genes we inherit , but how they are turned on and off that influences our development .
Most of these control switches are thrown before we are born , but some are set in early life , and to a lesser degree , throughout our lives .
Genes are switched off when methyl groups are added to our DNA .
Studies have shown that diet , stress and even maternal care can influence these “ epigenetic ” changes .
Care factor
In 2004 , for instance , Moshe Szyf and his colleagues at McGill University in Montreal showed that rat pups neglected by their mothers had different levels of methylation and different stress responses from those that were well - cared for .
They also showed that , with careful interventions , this could be reversed .
Advertisement
Could early care in humans also affect methylation levels ?
Szyf knew that a sizable proportion of people who commit suicide were abused or neglected early in life .
So his team examined the brains of 13 suicide victims who had a history of early neglect or abuse , and compared them to 11 age and gender matched controls , who had had normal upbringings but had died in sudden accidents .
The researchers were especially interested in a part of the brain called the hippocampus , which is involved in memory and mood , and is known to be smaller in people who have suffered abuse .
They examined genes in the hippocampus involved in controlling protein - producing RNA , and they found that in the suicide victims , a much higher proportion of these genes had been switched off , suggesting the hippocampus was indeed less active .
This raises the question of whether epigenetic effects influence suicide risk .
Suicide intervention
Szyf thinks that the altered methylation is the result of child abuse and not suicide itself , and is now studying suicide victims who have not suffered abuse to confirm this .
He is ultimately interested in finding a way to undo these epigenetic changes .
“ The question is whether we could design an intervention – dietary , social , pharmacological – that could reverse it , ” says Szyf .
“ I think it ’s very provocative , ” says Arthur Beaudet at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas .
“ There ’s going to be a lot of heterogeneity in people who commit suicide .
The fact that you find anything at all makes it interesting . ”
He would like to see the work replicated , however .
“ It ’s an important piece of work , ” says Craig Cooney at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock .
“ It points the way toward possible diagnosis and intervention . ”

IRS Wage Garnishment – How It Works , How To Prevent It , and How To Get Your Wages Released
Wage Garnishment is a common way for the IRS to collect unpaid taxes .
This forced recovery mechanism imposed by the state or federal tax collectors can be be a major nuisance for individuals .
Wage garnishment does n’t take into consideration that some months you will need more money than others , it just takes what in can until all taxes are recovered .
Understanding how this works and understanding other options available can help you prevent or get a wage garnishment lifted .
There are also companies available that specialize in this type of situation and can work with you to get a more manageable outcome .
How IRS Wage Garnishment Works
Wage Garnishment is one way in which the IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) or State Tax Collection Agency attempts to recover back taxes or taxes you owe by garnishing your salary or wages .
The IRS can garnish a significant part of your paycheck .
The IRS or State Collection Agency can garnish your wages without a court order .
Federal law states that a consumer can exempt up to 75 % of disposable weekly earnings or 30 times the minimum wage which is currently $ 5.85 ( whichever is greater ) .
In other words , the government cannot take more than 25 % of your weekly after - tax income or 30 times the minimum wage .
State tax collectors can also garnish your wages .
Each state has different laws with wage garnishment but typically wage garnishment can result in 25 % of your net income being garnished .
Normally the individual will receive an notice and demand for payment for taxes .
If this notice is ignored a final notice is normally sent 30 days before the garnishment begins .
Sometimes this is not the case , they can still garnish your wages even if you do not physically receive a notice , especially if you have moved and the IRS does n’t have the the most current address .
This garnishment will continue until the entire amount that is owed is paid back or their is another agreement that is made to pay these amounts back .
How to Prevent A Wage Garnishment
Obviously , the best way to prevent a wage garnishment is to stay current on your taxes , however this is not always the case .
If you receive a notice of levy from the IRS , contact the IRS as soon as possible .
The best thing to do is to set up an appointment with them to discuss other options .
Most of the time a wage garnishment or wage levy can be a much harsher financial burden than the other options that are available .
There are many options options out there than wage garnishment .
A few of the most common options are the following :
Setting up an installment agreement with the IRS
The IRS understands that some individuals cannot pay the entire amount owed and they are willing to work with individuals to set up payment plans to ensure that they will collect the money owed by the tax payer .
These installment agreements allow for the tax payer to pay the entire amount of tax in smaller , more manageable payments over a period of time .
Partial payment Installment Option
This method is similar to the prior option , but the tax payer does not pay off the entire amount owed in taxes .
Under this method the tax payer goes under financial review every two years and this could increase the payment owed by the tax payer or the agreement could be terminated if the tax payers condition improves .
Submitting an Offer in Compromise ( OIC )
This method is available for tax payers who have exhausted the previous two options and are not able to make the payment in full or
the payments in installments .
An OIC allows tax payers to settle their tax debts for less than the full amount .
This option will only work if it is in the best interest of both the taxpayer and the government and promotes voluntary compliance with all future payments and filings .
Tax debt on
an individual can be compromised if doubt exists that the tax is correct , there is doubt as to collectibility or collection of the tax would create a financial hardship or would be unfair and inequitable
Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy can seriously hurt a person ’s credit making it very difficult for an individual to obtain any kind of financing in the future and should only be used if all other options are exhausted .
When Bankruptcy is filed tax debts may be eligible for discharge under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 .
Currently not Collectible
When analysis of the IRS indicates that the tax payer is unable and has no ability to pay their tax payments the tax payments maybe waved .
After this all subsequent refunds are withheld and subsequent actions may cause recurring collectibility determinations at later dates .
When that tax payer is determined to be Currently not Collectible the IRS will not currently pursue collection .
How To Get a Wage Garnishment Released
If you believe that the amount you are left with is insufficient for basic necessities like food & shelter you are very likely to be able to get a wage garnishment lifted .
The best place to start is to call the IRS and try to set up an appointment and try to work out a different agreement with them .
It may be difficult dealing with the IRS directly , they will always push for you to pay the total amount owed no matter what your circumstances , but there are ways around this .
There are many companies out there that specialize in these situations and know what is required to get one lifted .
These companies will give you a free consultation with no obligation to find out more about your situation and will give you what your possible outcomes could be based on your situation .
Using one of these companies can give you the quickest results with the best outcome with their experience .
Normally you can find these companies on any search engine .
They will either have a phone number to call or have a from to fill out to get your general contact information and general information about your situation .
After the company receives this information they will have a tax specialist who specializes in yours situation contact you .
To get the best results you can call or contact multiple companies and see who can give you the best solution .
Government hopes of deporting dozens of terror suspects to their home countries suffered a serious setback today with the European court of human rights ruling against one such attempt .
The grand chamber of 17 judges at the Strasbourg court found unanimously that an attempt by Italy to send a man back to Tunisia violated the ban on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment in the European convention on human rights .
The case was brought by Nassim Saadi against the Italian government .
The British government intervened in the hope the court would sanction the return of suspects regardless of their home country 's human rights record .
Ministers argued the right of the public to be protected against terrorism should be balanced against a suspect 's rights not to be ill - treated .
The court ruled that protection against torture is absolute and Saadi cannot be sent back , even though he has been convicted of terror - related offences in both Tunisia and Italy .
" This decision will be welcomed by anti-torture and human rights campaigners everywhere , " said Sonya Sceats , an associate fellow at the international thinktank Chatham House .
" By affirming the absolute nature of the torture ban , the Strasbourg court has proved that basic rules of international human rights law cannot be sacrificed in the name of counter - terrorism . "
But she said it would be " naive " to think the court 's decision would stop the UK trying to deport people to countries with dire human rights records .
" Instead we are likely to see increased reliance on diplomatic assurances as a way of diminishing the torture risk …
These efforts by the UK to water down the torture ban have disappointed many .
" Once considered a leader in the field of human rights , the UK is now seen by some as an innovator of bad practice , as controversies over diplomatic assurances and recent admissions about CIA rendition flights demonstrate . "
The judgment , from which there is no appeal , binds all the countries of the Council of Europe , including Britain .
It throws into question Britain 's terror deportation programme , which relies on diplomatic assurances and memoranda of understanding with Tunisia and other countries .
A Home Office spokeswoman said nine people had been deported in the last two years based on assurances they would not be badly treated , but she would not say which countries were involved .
" We intervened in this case because terrorism undermines fundamental human rights including the right to life .
We 're disappointed at the ruling by the European court and we will consider the judgment , " she said .

CM , or Championship Manager , is one of the most addictive games .
There are millions of people playing this game worldwide .
Many of them are interested in sports like me .
I have been playing CM series for four years and searching over the talented players , youngsters and wonderkids .
This is actually one of the aims of CM game .
I aim to find wonderkids and train them to be a legendary player in their professional football careers as other cm fans do .
This article is about the best players of all CM series .
They are not an ordinary players .
They are legendary players of this game .
Maxim Tsigalko :
To many CM fans , Maxim Tsigalko is the best player of all CM series .
However , he shows his talents especially in CM 01/02 .
He starts to his football career at a Belarussian football club Dinamo Minsk as a striker .
He has a great finishing property .
It is set to 20 after the first season .
Someone should stop him before he kicks the ball , otherwise the result is inevitably goal .
After one year passing in Dinamo Minsk , he transfers to the biggest teams of Europe like Real Madrid , Manchester United , Arsenal , Liverpool .
If are lucky and aware of this player , you can buy this player .
He is not as expansive as most of the people think .
You can get him by very low cash .
He plays as a striker and kicks goals and make assists .
He always gets along with his teammates .
He is loyal to the club .
You can sell him to bigger clubs in your future plans .
If you play this in forward zone as an individual striker , you can get better results .
However , you should put a good attacking midfielder behind him to assist .
Maxim Tsigalko plays at the right of forward region since he uses his deadly right foot .
Even though he is not good at accelerating and dribbling , his goal scoring capability in one - to - one positions are extremely good .
He frustrates the goalkeeper in one - to - one positions .
Did John McCain ’s campaign receive inappropriate financial support from foreign nationals ?
During McCain ’s England trip this may have been the case :
At issue is a fundraising luncheon held in March at London ’s Spencer House , during McCain ’s swing through the United Kingdom .
An invitation to the event lists Lord Rothschild and Nathaniel Rothschild as hosts , and indicates the event was made possible with their “ kind permission ” .
Worth having a look at .
John McCain has lambasted Barack Obama as “ out of touch ” , because Senator Obama did not support his gas tax holiday .
Well , as the rebate would amount to about half a tank filling , I guess , McCain is the one out of touch .
Maybe he uses his wife ’s jets too much .
I would like to ask him when he last filled up his car and when he last drove to work on a daily basis .
Then there ’s the “ Keating Five “ .
This was at least questionable conduct by the straight talker .
But , hey !
He has some experience with bank collapses after risky real estate investments after all !
Read more on McCain ’s lobbying ties , here .
Many of McCain ’s positions have changed through the years , and even dramatically when he started his latest campaign , see for yourself :
Another four years of “ questionable conduct ” , warmongering and incompetence is not what this world needs from America .

A year or two ago a college kid I know started dating a film student .
The first time they had sex , very early into the relationship , he asked if he could come on her face .
Ewww !
I was n't really surprised at this anecdote , since boys her age have , realistically , been watching internet porn since they were nine years old ; that 's probably how this kid got interested in becoming a " filmmaker " in the first place , so I advised her to do away with boys her age ; just like the younger generation apparently does n't believe sex transpired unless they documented it on an easily memory stick - able format , " they do n't think sex is ' good ' unless it 's somehow fetish-y , " explains one of the younger Jezebels .
But then !
The other day a friend of mine brought home some dude from a holiday party and the same thing happened , only he used the terms " shoot " and " load " and this time everyone involved was thirty .
And just for fun , I 'm going to throw in the time a friend of mine went on a first date with a guy she met on the Muslim equivalent of JDate — and after a romantic night of dinner , wine , Ella Fitzgerald and Scrabble , he presented her with a " safety word " ...
Advertisement
She went along with it .
" I really liked him ! "
It involved spanking with a special S&M belt and calling her his dirty little slut and other highly inventive nicknames to indicate that he was " dominating " her .
( " I do that to keep from getting too close to women , " the dude , a psychiatrist , later explained .
Nice job ! )
Anyway , I know I should probably find some news to peg this to , like a story a few British Cosmos back about how the proliferation of porn is forcing women to do " things they do n't want to do " in bed , but what 's better than my own anecdotal evidence ?
We all know it is true : porn is doing to sex what scotch is doing to your liver .
And I mean , it makes sense !
It 's so easy to get , and so perfect for the beaten - down and emotionally unavailable !
But seriously , it has to stop .
That 's all .
For the first time , the leadership of Russia ’s judicial system has admitted that courts in the country receive direct pressure from the Kremlin .
As the Kommersant newspaper reported on May 13th , such was the testimony given by Yelena Valyavina , the first deputy chair of the Supreme Arbitration Court .
Valyavina testified as a witness in Moscow ’s Dorogomilovsky court during a libel trial regarding the defense of honor of Valery Boyev , an aide in the administration of former President Vladimir Putin .
Boyev has sought the retraction of statements made by journalist and anchorman Vladimir Solovyev , who spoke of the Kremlin ’s interference in the work of Russian courts .
Valyavina described before the court how Boyev contacted her with instructions regarding a high - profile case of the Tolyattiazot joint - stock company .
After Valyavina refused to comply , Boyev allegedly threatened that she would be not be reappointed to her post .
Valyavina went on to describe the role Boyev plays in appointing judges : “ As a representative of the presidential administration , he sits in on sessions of the Supreme Judges Qualification Board , where he can make public certain information .
The speed with which judges are appointed to their positions also depends on him . ”
Furthermore , Valyavina added that judges may fear losing deserved government decorations if they stand by their principled positions .
Valery Boyev , a personnel and state decorations assistant working in the Kremlin , filed a civil libel suit to defend his honor and dignity in April .
He demanded the retraction of assertions made by Vladimir Solovyev during a broadcast on the Severny Dozhd ( Northern Rain ) radio station , which were also later printed on the treli .ru website .
The statements in question are as follows : “ That same Boyev , who commands the Supreme Arbitration Court . ”
“ There are no independent courts in Russia .
There are only courts , dependent on Boyev . ”
And finally , “ This is what ’s called Russian justice , which is supervised by … Boyev ”
A new session of the court will meet on May 26th .
The defense plans to bring three witnesses : the chairman of the Moscow Oblast Arbitration Court , Yevgeny Ilyin ; the chairman of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Arbitration Court , Boris Kanevsky ; and the chairman of the Tenth Arbitration Appeals Court , Artur Absalyamov .
In the meantime , the process continued .
Valery Boyev ’s attorney commented that his client merely prepares documents on the appointment of judges , and cannot show interest in the millions of cases under consideration in Russia ’s courts .
The defense has asked that Boyev himself appear in the court , and said that according to their information Boyev serves as a colonel in Russian Federal Security Service ( FSB ) .
“ If Yelena Valyavina ’s facts prove true , then this will now be a criminal case , and not a civil one , ” Solovyev said .
Experts said this was the first time a highly - ranked official publicly has accused Kremlin staff of pressuring Russia ’s highest court .
U.S. streets could soon be over - run with cats if communities fail to get a handle on growing feline populations , a veterinary medicine researcher says .
The problem is growing numbers of not just strays , but also other free - roaming pet cats .
The strays are likely to go unneutered or unspayed , and therefore to reproduce like mad .
On top of that though , more than 38 million households own an estimated 88 million cats — that 's about one cat for every 3.5 Americans .
Those that are n't " fixed " often can and do still wander freely outdoors or get lost and make kittens .
Fertile female cats produce an average of two litters of four to six kittens per year .
As a result , up to 5 million U.S. cats are euthanized in shelters each year , according to estimates by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
A coordinated action on the part of policymakers , shelter organizations and cat owners is needed to try to control cat overpopulation , said researcher Linda K. Lord , assistant professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University .
" If we do n't change something , we 're going to continue to lose this battle , " Lord said .
" We 're going to have more and more cats reproducing , and we need to think about collective community approaches to prevent that . "
One city is taking strong measures .
A mandatory pet sterilization ordinance goes into effect this month in Los Angeles .
Cats and dogs must be spayed or neutered by the time the animal is 4 months old .
Service and breeder dogs are exempt .
Cats have surpassed dogs as the most popular pet in the United States , according to a 2007 – 2008 National Pet Owners survey conducted by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association .
Feeding stray cats
To figure out what people want to do to prevent a profusion of street cats , Lord analyzed data from a telephone survey done last year of 703 households of Ohio , a state where more people say they tend to feed roaming cats and the population of cats entering shelters is on the rise .
The number of cats euthanized also is increasing , despite a stable human population .
The study results showed that about a third of those surveyed see cats roaming the streets daily ( which could include cats belonging to a neighbor , lost cats and strays ) .
About a quarter of respondents feed roaming cats and about a quarter of those folks feed the cats daily .
About a quarter of the stray - cat feeders took the animals to the vet for some kind of care , including spaying or neutering .
The same percentage reported knowing the cats they fed had delivered at least one litter of kittens in the past year .
" I was surprised by how many households were feeding cats , " Lord said .
" In an ideal world , if you 're going to take the responsibility to feed a cat , which is going to make it viable longer , then it would be best to at least try to get the cat altered , so it 's not adding to the numbers . "
The spay / neuter rate for cats among the surveyed owners ranged from an average of 75 percent in rural areas to 90 percent in urban areas , but " there is a huge population of cats that people provide some care for but do n't consider their own , " Lord said .
The spay / neuter rate for those cats is much lower .
The survey , detailed in the April 15 issue of the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association , also found that perceptions about the need to regulate the cat population in Ohio differs among rural and urban dwellers and among cat owners and people who do not own pets .
It is reasonable to suggest that attitudes toward cat populations among those surveyed in Ohio might resemble those of people elsewhere in the country , she wrote in the journal , since Ohio is ranked seventh among states in human population and includes two of the 50 largest cities in the country .
Who herds cats ?
The perception is that the government provides funding for the control of cats , but " by and large , that is not the case in Ohio , " Lord said .
" Government has tended to not want to be involved with cats .
And I do n't know if they can avoid it anymore . "
Most survey subjects approved of a " trap - neuter - return " approach , which relies on volunteers to trap colonies of wild cats , oversee spaying or neutering at a veterinary clinic , usually at low cost , and then returning the cats to their outdoor haunts with some mark that indicates they 've been " fixed " ( often a tiny tip of one of the cat 's ears is clipped off ) .
Trap - neuter - return programs are one piece of the puzzle and work for the wild or feral cats , Lord said , but they do n't deal with the other free - roamers .
In the past , much of the cat overpopulation burden has fallen onto humane societies , and " I do n't know if they have resources by themselves to do it , " she said .
" I think that it is going to take a partnering . "
It 's important also to make sure all owned cats have tags or implanted microchip IDs , so neighbors can tell that free - roaming cats " are somebody 's , " Lord said .
More about cats
Other cat stats in Ohio : - 60 percent of subjects owned pets , and 31 percent owned cats .
-
Two out of three subjects said they like or love cats .
- About 40 percent of owners allow their cats to go outdoors .
-
Half of survey respondents think laws should prohibit owners from letting cats roam outdoors ( only one third of cat owners agree with this ) .
- 60 percent support spay - neuter laws for cats .
- 48 percent support using tax dollars to subsidize spay - neuter programs .
-
Three quarters supported mandatory identification for all owned cats .
- 88 percent supported laws requiring rabies vaccines for cats .
Here are Lord 's tips for owners nationwide :
Make sure pet cats , along with those you feed but do n't own , are spayed and neutered .
Be willing to support ways to work with local government , veterinary groups and shelters to figure out how to address the problem of free - roaming cats .
" It gets very emotional but I think groups have to work together to recognize there is not one solution that is going to work in every community , " Lord told LiveScience .
" Some of it is elevating the status of cats , " she said .
They are less likely to be tagged or carry other ID markers .
They are hardly ever reunified with owners , if lost , and " they get less veterinary care , according to the American Veterinary Medical Association , " she said .
" Vet visits for cats is lower than that for dogs , the frequency of going .
Is that because they are healthier ?
I 'm not sure we can make that assumption . "
Abstract Background Socioeconomic inequalities in death rates from all causes combined widened from 1960 until 1990 in the U.S. , largely because cardiovascular death rates decreased more slowly in lower than in higher socioeconomic groups .
However , no studies have examined trends in inequalities using recent US national data .
Methodology / Principal Findings
We calculated annual age - standardized death rates from 1993 –2001 for 25 – 64 year old non-Hispanic whites and blacks by level of education for all causes and for the seven most common causes of death using death certificate information from 43 states and Washington , D.C. Regression analysis was used to estimate annual percent change .
The inequalities in all cause death rates between Americans with less than high school education and college graduates increased rapidly from 1993 to 2001 due to both significant decreases in mortality from all causes , heart disease , cancer , stroke , and other conditions in the most educated and lack of change or increases among the least educated .
For white women , the all cause death rate increased significantly by 3.2 percent per year in the least educated and by 0.7 percent per year in high school graduates .
The rate ratio ( RR ) comparing the least versus most educated increased from 2.9 ( 95 % CI , 2.8 –3.1 ) in 1993 to 4.4 ( 4.1 –4.6 ) in 2001 among white men , from 2.1 ( 1.8 –2.5 ) to 3.4 ( 2.9–3 –9 ) in black men , and from 2.6 ( 2.4 –2.7 ) to 3.8 ( 3.6 –4.0 ) in white women .
Conclusion Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality are increasing rapidly due to continued progress by educated white and black men and white women , and stable or worsening trends among the least educated .

Introduction Socioeconomic inequalities in death rates from all causes combined have widened in the U.S. [ 1 ] – [ 7 ] since the early 1960s , largely because heart disease mortality has decreased more rapidly in higher than lower socioeconomic groups . [ 1 ] , [ 3 ]
However , most of the studies that used individual - level socioeconomic measures have been based on relatively small representative samples of the U.S. population rather than on national data , precluding simultaneous stratification by race , sex , and education in examining cause - specific trends .
Further , no studies published in the peer - review literature have examined the trends since 1990 using national vital statistics .
Such studies are important in measuring progress towards achieving the Healthy People 2010 objective of eliminating health disparities among subgroups of the population .
In this study , we examined mortality trends for all - causes and seven leading causes of death ( cancer , heart disease , stroke , accidents , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] infection , diabetes , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] ) in relation to educational attainment from 1993 through 2001 .
These seven categories account for 70 % of the total deaths .
Mortality trends for several conditions decreased markedly over the past 10 – 15 years ( cancer , heart disease , stroke , HIV infection ) while others increased ( accidents , diabetes , COPD ) , in part due to changes in risk factors and , for the former , advances in treatment . [ 8 ] , [ 9 ]
We restricted the analysis to white and black men and women , ages 25 – 64 years , an age range in which education is usually complete and provides a better index of socioeconomic position than at older ages . [ 10 ] , [ 11 ]
Methods
We obtained mortality data from 1993 through 2001 from the National Vital Statistics System ( NVSS ) administered by the National Center for Health Statistics .
Underlying causes of death were classified according to the selection and coding rules of the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 9 ) [ 12 ] for deaths recorded between 1993 and 1998 , and according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 10 ) [ 13 ] for those recorded between 1999 and 2001 .
The ICD - 9 and ICD - 10 codes for all causes and 15 leading causes included in this analysis are given on the web ( Table S1 ) .
Information on educational attainment ( number of years of schooling ) as a marker of socioeconomic position was obtained from death certificates .
Although this information has been included on the standard death certificate since 1989 , we restricted our analyses to the time interval 1993 to 2001 for three reasons : most states did not collect death certificate information on education systematically until 1993 : race / ethnicity information collected by the Current Population Survey is not consistent with that of death certificates beginning with the 2002 survey ( see below ) : and the question about educational attainment on the death certificate changed beginning with the 2003 mortality data from a highest grade of school completed to collegiate track education , i.e. , the ability to identify degree status . [ 14 ]
We classified educational attainment into four categories according to total years of schooling : less than high school graduate ( < 12 years of education ) , high school graduate ( 12 years ) , some college ( 13 – 15 years ) , and college graduate or post graduate ( ≥16 years ) .
We restricted the analyses to deaths among non-Hispanic whites and blacks ( 4,257,269 ) , because of problems with reporting other racial and ethnic subgroups . [ 15 ]
We excluded 609,093 deaths that occurred in seven states ( Georgia , Kentucky , New York , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , South Dakota , and West Virginia ) because completeness of education on death certificate in these states was less than 80 % in at least one of the nine calendar years considered in this study .
Another 126,238 deaths that occurred in the remaining 43 states and the District of Colombia were excluded due to missing data on education on the death certificates .
The final analysis was based on 3,521,938 deaths recorded from 1993 to 2001 ; these comprised 97 % of the total deaths among non-Hispanic whites and blacks in the 43 states and District of Colombia .
We obtained population data ( the denominators for rate calculations ) for the corresponding age , sex , race / ethnicity , education , state and time intervals from the U.S. Bureau of Census based on the Current Population Survey , a nationally representative sample of U.S. households .
Death rates ( per 100,000 ) from all causes combined and from 15 leading causes were calculated by sex , race / ethnicity , educational attainment , and calendar year .
Rates within the age range 25 – 64 years were age - standardized using the 2000 U.S. population standard .
Temporal trends from all causes and seven selected cancer sites by educational attainment were assessed by fitting a weighted least squares regression models to the log- transformed annual age - standardized rates , weighted by the inverse of the variance , using joinpoint regression program , Version 3.0 software . [ 16 ]
The annual percentage change or slope of the line segment was considered statistically significant if two - sided , P< 0.05 .
Similarly , we also assessed the linearity of the annual percent changes across education levels within each race - , sex - , disease - specific category by fitting a weighted least square regression model to the log- transformed coefficients of the slopes , weighted by the inverse of the variance . [ 16 ]
The educational disparity was assessed by calculating the ratio of the death rate for all causes combined in the least educated group ( < 12 years of education ) to the most educated group ( college degree or more ) for 1993 and 2001 .
We also calculated the contribution of specific conditions to the overall decrease ( in the case of heart disease , cancer , stroke , and HIV infection ) or increase ( diabetes , COPD , accidents ) in mortality rates in the general population . [ 8 ] , [ 17 ]
This calculation was expressed as a percentage of the total change .
Discussion
Our principal finding is that socioeconomic inequalities in mortality continue to increase in the U.S. due to reductions in death rates among the most educated combined with lack of progress or worsening trends in the least educated .
As noted , the ratio of the all cause death rate in persons with < 12 years versus ≥ 16 years of education increased from 2.9 ( 95 % CI , 2.8 –3.1 ) to 4.4 ( 4.1 –4.6 ) in white men , from 2.1 ( 1.8 –2.5 ) to 3.4 ( 2.9–3 –9 ) in black men , and from 2.6 ( 2.4 –2.7 ) to 3.8 ( 3.6 –4.0 ) in white women .
Contributing to the inequality is the unprecedented decrease in the all - cause death rate among the most educated men ( totaling 36 % in black men and 25 % in white men over the nine - year interval ) largely due to decreases in death rates from HIV infection , cancer , and heart disease .
Lower educational attainment , a marker of socioeconomic position , is associated with a host of environmental , social and economic factors that detrimentally affect health over a life time .
People with less education have fewer financial resources , less access to health insurance or stable employment , and less health literacy .
Social and economic factors increase the vulnerability of low socioeconomic communities to risk factors such as smoking , obesity , physical inactivity , hypertension , and HIV infection . [ 18 ] – [ 22 ]
People without health insurance are less likely to receive basic preventive services or standard timely treatment . [ 23 ] , [ 24 ]
Those with lower health literacy are less likely to seek medical attention for asymptomatic conditions or to navigate the health care system effectively . [ 25 ] , [ 26 ]
The prevalence of most major risk factors remains much higher among persons with lower than high socioeconomic position . [ 27 ] – [ 29 ]
Progress in reducing smoking has been slowest among the least educated . [ 27 ] , [ 30 ]
The prevalence of obesity , hypertension , and diabetes has increased in all socioeconomic position groups in recent years . [ 27 ] , [ 30 ] – [ 33 ]
These environmental and socioeconomic factors may also have contributed to the differences in inequalities in all - cause and cause - specific mortality by race and sex .
For example , the increases in death rates for cancer and heart disease among white women with < 12 years of education but not among white men with < 12 years of education partly reflects the later uptake of cigarette smoking among women than men .
Smoking prevalence in women peaked about 20 years after it peaked in men . [ 34 ] , [ 35 ]
The large inequality in HIV infection mortality rates between blacks and whites may reflect an increased risk of HIV infection from sexual behavior and drug use as well as lower receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy in blacks than in whites [ 36 ] , [ 37 ]
Our findings are qualitatively similar to those of previous studies that analyzed temporal trends in US mortality by socioeconomic position in earlier time periods . [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 6 ]
Using the 1960 National Mortality Follow Back Survey and 1986 National Health Interview Survey , Pappas et al documented that the disparity in mortality rates according to education increased from 1960 to 1986 among white and black , men and women , age 25 – 64 years , although the increase in disparity was less for women than men . [ 3 ]
Feldman et al. reported widening of the educational disparity in death rates from 1960 to the time period 1971 – 1984 among white men 55 years or above , but not white women .
[ 1 ]
Similarly , using the National Occupational Mortality Surveillance , Steenland and colleagues reported that the differential in mortality by socioeconomic position increased from 1984 to 1997 among men age 35 – 64 , but not in women . [ 6 ]
In all of these studies , the disparity in death rates increased over time due to slower progress among those with lower than higher socioeconomic position .
Our study , in contrast , finds no decrease in all cause mortality rates in the lowest educational group between 1993 and 2001 .
Furthermore , all - cause mortality rates among lower educated white women increased rather than decreased , with accidents , cancer , COPD , and heart disease accounting for about half of the total increase in white women with < 12 years of education .
Mortality data collected after 2001 could not be analyzed using the same category of race / ethnicity .
However , analysis of the 2005 mortality data by education for all races combined showed that the educational inequalities in all - cause mortality continued to be substantial . [ 38 ]
Among 25 – 64 year olds , the all - cause mortality rate for those with < 12 years of education was 3.2 times higher than that for persons with ≥ 13 years of education .
The results of these studies illustrate the difficulty of achieving the goal of eliminating health disparities among disadvantaged subgroups of the population by 2010 .
Socioeconomic factors that contribute to poor nutrition , tobacco use , and physical inactivity often establish these patterns early in life [ 39 ] .
Lower socioeconomic groups also have less access to preventive resources and health care .
The elimination of health disparities will require addressing a broad spectrum of factors in the social and physical environment that contribute to poor health .
Strengths of our study include the use of national data that encompass 83 % of the non-Hispanic white and black population in the U.S. from 1993 through 2001 .
The large number of deaths allows more precise statistical estimates of death rates by race and sex for specific causes of death .
By limiting our analysis to broad disease categories for which death certificate data are more accurate , [ 40 ] we minimize inaccuracies in the cause of death .
Our major findings are not affected by coding changes implemented in ICD - 10 , beginning with the 1999 mortality data .
These slightly accelerated the decline in death rates from heart disease and the increase from accidents , diabetes , and COPD ( in women ) , and it may also have attenuated the decrease from cancer , [ 41 ] stroke , HIV infection , [ 42 ] and COPD ( in men ) .
ICD - 10 allocated fewer deaths ( 1.5 % of total ) to heart disease as the underlying cause of death than ICD - 9 , but more deaths to the other causes .
Increases in other causes in ICD - 10 compared to ICD - 9 ranged from 0.7 % for cancer to 6.4 % for HIV infection . [ 43 ]
However , adjustments of rates using ICD comparability ratios for two of the leading causes most affected by the ICD changes ( heart disease and HIV infection ) had little effect on our findings .
The annual percent decreases in heart disease death rates among white men with ≥ 16 years of education with and without adjustment for the change in ICD coding rules were , respectively , − 4.0 % ( −4.5 % : − 3.5 % ) and − 4.2 % ( 95 % CI , − 4.7 % : − 3.7 % ) .
The corresponding annual percent decreases in HIV infection mortality rates among black men with < 12 years of education were − 3.9 % ( −9,9 % : 2.4 % ) and − 3.1 % ( −9.2 % : 3.4 % ) .
Furthermore , the unfavorable mortality trends among less - educated men and women was observed for all causes of death combined , a category that is not affected by the change in disease classification , as well as for most of the seven specific causes described here .
A limitation of our study is that death certificates capture only one indicator of socioeconomic position , educational attainment .
Socioeconomic position is a multi- factorial construct that reflects a combination of individual - and geographic area - level influences .
Although it is optimal to consider multiple indices of socioeconomic position in examining relationships with health outcomes , [ 39 ] , [ 44 ] educational attainment alone is frequently used as an indicator because of its availability , stability , and close association with other indicators of socioeconomic position for which data are not routinely available . [ 45 ]
Another limitation of our study is its reliance on years of education as reported on death certificates by next of kin .
This variable has been included on the standard death certificate since 1989 .
Sorlie and Johnson evaluated this information in relation to self reported data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study ( NLMS ) and found that education reported by proxies on the death certificate was higher than self - reported education in NLMS ; 39 % of adults who did not complete high school according to self - reported data were listed as high school graduates on their death certificates . [ 46 ]
Although the extent of this misclassification may have varied over the study period ( 1993 –2001 ) , this particular source of error would have little impact on overall conclusions of our paper because the mortality trends are unfavorable in both groups of lower educated categories : 12 and fewer than 12 years of education .
Changes in autopsy rates over time could also potentially affect trends in cause - specific mortality rates because of the importance of the autopsy to the information on death certificates . [ 47 ]
We cannot examine changes in autopsy rates by educational attainment for our study period ( 1993 –2001 ) because NCHS stopped collecting information on whether an autopsy was performed or not in 1995 and resumed in 2003 .
We examined data for 1993 and 1994 and found that the percentage of deaths with autopsies were low in all groups and did not differ substantially by educational attainment .
This percentage was 7 % –8 % among the lowest educated and 9 % – 10 % among the most educated .
In between , the rates range from 9 % – 11 % with no discernable gradient .
Data for 2003 –2005 generally showed similar pattern , although the rates were slightly lower .
Based on these data , changes in autopsy rates over time are unlikely to affect the all - cause mortality trend by educational attainment .
Finally , the generalizability of our findings to all age groups within the U.S. may be limited in that the educational gradient at ages 65 and above may be narrowed by universal access to health care through Medicare .
However , deaths in ages 25 – 64 are of societal importance because they affect individuals and families most likely in the workforce , raising children and / or supporting other family members .
The generalizability of our findings may also be affected slightly by exclusion of data from seven states with incomplete reporting of education on death certificates .
The 3.5 % of decedents with missing education information on their death certificates were excluded from the numerator , but not the denominator , of the study population ( remaining 43 states and District of Colombia ) .
The percentage of decedents with missing information on education was slightly higher in 1993 ( 4.7 % ) than in 2001 ( 2.8 % ) .
We assessed whether this might affect the interpretation of our trends .
Analyses that measured the temporal trends without exclusion of deaths with missing education information slightly strengthened the decreasing trends for some causes and weakened the increasing mortality trends for others .
However , none of these differences affected our main findings .
In conclusion , socioeconomic inequalities in mortality rates are increasing in the U.S. due to continuing reductions in death rates among the most educated white and black men and white women , but lack of progress or worsening trends in the least educated persons .

The X - Files , the cult 1990s television show that made conspiracy theories respectable and gave serious consideration to the influence of aliens on planet Earth , is to make a comeback .
Six years after the series ended on the small screen , the show 's creator , Chris Carter , is to release a feature film , the second spawned by the show in the wake of 1998 's The X - File : Fight the Future .
But , true to the spirit of a show that was always as much about mystery as it was about revelation , the film does not yet have a title , and the film - makers are saying little or nothing about its plotline .
The film finished shooting less than two weeks ago and is due out in US cinemas in late July .
That much we know .
We also know the film will deal with the six - year period since the television series ended , and offer answers about the mysterious child carried and delivered by Agent Dana Scully , the FBI investigator played by Gillian Anderson , who started out the series as the sceptic assigned to keep an eye on her true - believer partner , Fox Mulder , played by David Duchovny .

Carter and his co-writer Frank Spotnitz offered these and other clues at a television festival forum in Los Angeles this week , hinting , among other things , that the bitter litigation that pitted them against their paymasters at Rupert Murdoch 's
Fox empire has spilt over into this project .
Carter said
Fox told him the movie had to happen " now or never " .
A second film was originally supposed to have been made in 2005 ( in fact a script was ready from the moment the television show reached the end of its nine - season run ) but was scuppered by a lawsuit that Carter filed over syndication rights to the show .
That has been settled .
The Fox executives have also clashed with the film - makers over the title .
" I know what I want it to be , " Carter told the television forum .
" But Fox has some ideas of their own . "
Asked whether the film would give more information about William , the baby mothered by Agent Scully after an apparent close encounter with an alien , Carter said : " It will not go unconsidered in the movie . "
The X - Files won 16 Emmys and a Peabody Award .
But perhaps more important was the cult status it enjoyed with television audiences across the planet , playing on the age - old American obsession with conspiracies and the paranormal stretching back at least as far as the mysterious 1947 crash in Roswell , New Mexico , which millions of people believe was a botched alien landing .
One of the eeriest scenarios was in the pilot episode of a spin - off entitled The Lone Gunmen , named for three characters in The X - Files obsessed with the assassination of John F Kennedy .
In the episode , aired in March 2001 , six months before al - Qa'ida struck , the characters try to stop a shady government plot to fly a plane into the the World Trade Centre in New York , although the Bush administration still claims those attacks were unforeseeable .
In the episode , the attack was planned to ratchet up military spending and provide an excuse to bomb dictators that the US was itching to topple .
Just thirty - five Senators in office are strongly pro-choice .
But this November , when a third of the Senate seats will be up for grabs , voters have a chance to increase that score .
Exhausted and stultified by the endless Democratic primary ?
Gagging a little bit every time you hear that John McCain is a " maverick ? "
With all the attention paid to the presidential slugfest , it ’s easy to forget that this November , over a third of the United States Senate will also be up for grabs .
While supporters of reproductive rights fervently hope to see the White House back in pro-choice hands , the Senate would act as the crucial check on presidential power should that effort be thwarted .
That ’s because with veto power over federal judicial appointments , only Senators have the ability to stymie a conservative president ’s attempts to place another anti-Roe justice on the Supreme Court .
Today ’s Senate Democrats enjoy only a razor - thin 51 - 49 majority , meaning they ca n’t prevent conservative filibusters or override a presidential veto .
And according to NARAL Pro-Choice America classifications , there are currently just 35 strongly " pro-choice " senators and 17 " mixed choice " senators ( including majority leader Harry Reid ) , but a full 48 " anti-choice " senators .
That means when it comes to protecting reproductive health and rights , every open seat can make a difference , whether Republican or Democratic .
Here are some of the key races to look out for :
Maine
One might think that two - term Republican Senator Susan Collins would be facing a tougher than usual reelection battle this year because of her constituents ’ frustrations with the conservative excesses of the Bush years .
Still , polls show Collins leading her Democratic competitor , Rep. Tom Allen , by over 20 points .
" Independent Democrat " Sen .
Joe Lieberman has said he will campaign for her .
Collins has always enjoyed support from some pro-choice advocates , and has an 83 percent rating from NARAL .
She was one of just three Republican senators to oppose the so - called " Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act " of 2003 .
Collins has also opposed parental notification laws and the ban on abortions on military bases , which Harry Reid supported .
Yet she also voted for a dog - whistle anti-choice bill that would have increased penalties for committing a crime against a pregnant woman , under the rationale that the fetus is a second victim .
Collins ’ opponent Allen , on the other hand , enjoys a 100 percent pro-choice voting record .

New Hampshire
At age 43 , Republican John Sununu is the youngest member of the Senate .
This fall he faces his first reelection battle , but against the same woman he just narrowly defeated in 2002 : former Governor Jeanne Shaheen .
Sununu has been an ally of President Bush when it comes to restricting abortion access and stem cell research lines , while Shaheen is a pro-choice , Emily ’s List candidate .
Their race is considered one of the tightest in the nation , and Sen. Chuck Schumer , chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee , has sworn to flood resources into New Hampshire to support Shaheen .
Louisiana
Two - term Democrat Mary Landrieu has a decidedly mixed record on abortion .
She supports stem cell research and would n’t pull Health and Human Services funding from medical service providers who perform abortion .
She also wants to lift the ban on performing abortions on military bases .
But Landrieu has voted to ban certain late - term abortion procedures .
In her first Senate campaign , she was recommended by Emily ’s List , but the group cut her off in 2002 .
Landrieu ’s opponent is the anti-choice John N. Kennedy , who joined the GOP only last year , after losing a 2004 Senate run as a Democrat .
He is currently the state ’s treasurer .
Landrieu is leading Kennedy by comfortable margins in recent polls , but Louisiana has become more Republican in recent years , so the seat is considered up for grabs .
New Mexico
Thirty - six year Senate veteran Pete Dominici , a Republican , is retiring , and every single one of New Mexico ’s Congressional representatives has announced their decision to resign office in order to run for his seat .
That ’s only three candidates in a small state like New Mexico , but it will still open up a sizable power vacuum .
Representing the Democrats is Rep. Tom Udall , who currently represents the northern and eastern parts of the state , including Santa Fe .
He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record .
Republicans Heather Wilson and Steve Pearce will face - off in a June 3 Senate primary .
Wilson won reelection to the House in 2006 by just 875 votes , so her central - New Mexico district could be a Democratic pick - up .
While she has supported stem cell research and funding for the United Nations Population Fund , she has consistently voted to roll - back girls ’ and women ’s access to abortion .
Pearce is further to her right , with a 0 percent voting record on all reproductive health issues .
Due to his anti-choice record , he has won the endorsement of the Susan B. Anthony List Candidate Fund , which usually endorses anti-abortion rights female Republicans .
Wilson , though , is not radical enough for the group ’s tastes .
Virginia
After serving since 1979 , Republican Senator John Warner is retiring this year .
Two former governors are competing for the seat ; Republican Jim Gilmore and Democrat Mark Warner , the cell phone mogul who transitioned to a career in politics and flirted with a 2008 presidential run .
Warner describes himself as a " radical centrist " who respects " responsible choice . "
As governor , he opposed a 24 - hour waiting period for women requesting abortions and said he would fight efforts to chip away at Roe .
Polls show him leading Gilmore by a 15 to 20 point margin .
Minnesota
Democratic comedian and professional conservative - basher Al Franken was leading sitting Republican Sen. Norm Coleman in this race — but that was before it was revealed that Franken failed to pay over $ 50,000 in work - related taxes to 17 states .
Franken ’s defense is that he overpaid his taxes in Minnesota and New York , his states of residence , during the years in question , but polls show voters are n’t buying it .
Coleman is a by - the - book anti-choicer , while Franken is pro-choice and situates his support for abortion rights within his platform for universal health care .
Colorado
Remember Tom Udall , the Democrat running for Senate from New Mexico ?
His first cousin , Colorado Congressman Mark Udall , is competing to fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Wayne Allard .
Udall ’s likely opponent is Republican Congressman Bob Schaffler , who has been implicated in the Jack Abramoff ethics scandal .
Scaffler is a committed anti-choicer , while Udall has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record .
Polling from April showed Udall and Schaffler locked in a dead heat , so this is one to keep to an eye on .
Alaska
Although currently under investigation for corruption and 85 years old , Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens will be seeking another term in November .
Stevens calls himself " pro-choice , " although he has voted to ban certain abortion procedures and supports parental notification .
Stevens opposes comprehensive sex education in favor of abstinence - only .
He does , however , support stem cell research and the right of abortion providers to receive grants from the Department of Health and Human Services .
Stevens ’ opponent is Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , the son of a former U.S. Congressman .
They are running neck - in - neck .
So there you have it , eight Senate races to watch in ’ 08 , some of them with fascinating implications for pro-choice politics .

Barriers and journaling filesystems
LWN .net needs you !

Journaling filesystems come with a big promise : they free system administrators from the need to worry about disk corruption resulting from system crashes .
It is , in fact , not even necessary to run a filesystem integrity checker in such situations .
The real world , of course , is a little messier than that .
As a recent discussion shows , it may be even messier than many of us thought , with the integrity promises of journaling filesystems being traded off against performance .
A filesystem like ext3 works by maintaining a journal on a dedicated portion of the disk .
Whenever a set of filesystem metadata changes are to be made , they are first written to the journal - without changing the rest of the filesystem .
Once all of those changes have been journaled , a " commit record " is added to the journal to indicate that everything else there is valid .
Only after the journal transaction has been committed in this fashion can the kernel do the real metadata writes at its leisure ; should the system crash in the middle , the information needed to safely finish the job can be found in the journal .
There will be no filesystem corruption caused by a partial metadata update .
There is a hitch , though : the filesystem code must , before writing the commit record , be absolutely sure that all of the transaction 's information has made it to the journal .
Just doing the writes in the proper order is insufficient ; contemporary drives maintain large internal caches and will reorder operations for better performance .
So the filesystem must explicitly instruct the disk to get all of the journal data onto the media before writing the commit record ; if the commit record gets written first , the journal may be corrupted .
The kernel 's block I/O subsystem makes this capability available through the use of barriers ; in essence , a barrier forbids the writing of any blocks after the barrier until all blocks written before the barrier are committed to the media .
By using barriers , filesystems can make sure that their on - disk structures remain consistent at all times .
There is another hitch : the ext3 and ext4 filesystems , by default , do not use barriers .
The option is there , but , unless the administrator has explicitly requested the use of barriers , these filesystems operate without them - though some distributions ( notably SUSE ) change that default .
Eric Sandeen recently decided that this was not the best situation , so he submitted a patch changing the default for ext3 and ext4 .
That 's when the discussion started .
Andrew Morton 's response tells a lot about why this default is set the way it is :
Last time this came up lots of workloads slowed down by 30 % so I dropped the patches in horror .
I just do n't think we can quietly go and slow everyone 's machines down by this much ...
There are no happy solutions here , and I 'm inclined to let this dog remain asleep and continue to leave it up to distributors to decide what their default should be .
So barriers are disabled by default because they have a serious impact on performance .
And , beyond that , the fact is that people get away with running their filesystems without using barriers .
Reports of ext3 filesystem corruption are few and far between .
It turns out that the " getting away with it " factor is not just luck .
Ted Ts'o explains what 's going on : the journal on ext3 / ext4 filesystems is normally contiguous on the physical media .
The filesystem code tries to create it that way , and , since the journal is normally created at the same time as the filesystem itself , contiguous space is easy to come by .
Keeping the journal together will be good for performance , but it also helps to prevent reordering .
In normal usage , the commit record will land on the block just after the rest of the journal data , so there is no reason for the drive to reorder things .
The commit record will naturally be written just after all of the other journal log data has made it to the media .
That said , nobody is foolish enough to claim that things will always happen that way .
Disk drives have a certain well - documented tendency to stop cooperating at inopportune times .
Beyond that , the journal is essentially a circular buffer ; when a transaction wraps off the end , the commit record may be on an earlier block than some of the journal data .
And so on .
So the potential for corruption is always there ; in fact , Chris Mason has a torture - test program which can make it happen fairly reliably .
There can be no doubt that running without barriers is less safe than using them .
Anybody can turn on barriers if they are willing to take the performance hit .
Unless , of course , their filesystem is based on an LVM volume ( as certain distributions do by default ) ; it turns out that the device mapper code does not pass through or honor barriers .
But , for everybody else , it would be nice if that performance cost could be reduced somewhat .
And it seems that might be possible .
The current ext3 code - when barriers are enabled - performs a sequence of operations like this for each transaction :
The log blocks are written to the journal .
A barrier operation is performed .
The commit record is written .
Another barrier is executed .
Metadata writes begin at some later point .
On ext4 , the first barrier ( step 2 ) can be omitted because the ext4 filesystem supports checksums on the journal .
If the journal log data and the commit record are reordered , and if the operation is interrupted by a crash , the journal 's checksum will not match the one stored in the commit record and the transaction will be discarded .
Chris Mason suggests that it would be " mostly safe " to omit that barrier with ext3 as well , with a possible exception when the journal wraps around .
Another idea for making things faster is to defer barrier operations when possible .
If there is no pressing need to flush things out , a few transactions can be built up in the journal and all shoved out with a single barrier .
There is also some potential for improvement by carefully ordering operations so that barriers ( which are normally implemented as " flush all outstanding operations to media " requests ) do not force the writing of blocks which do not have specific ordering requirements .
In summary : it looks like the time has come to figure out how to make the cost of barriers palatable .
Ted Ts'o seems to feel that way :
I think we have to enable barriers for ext3/4 , and then work to improve the overhead in ext4 / jbd2 .
It 's probably true that the vast majority of systems do n't run under conditions similar to what Chris used to demonstrate the problem , but the default has to be filesystem safety .
Your editor 's sense is that this particular dog is now wide awake and is likely to bark for some time .
That may disturb some of the neighbors , but it 's better than letting somebody get bitten later on .
Ickes :
We want the Michigan uncommitted to stay uncommitted
In a conference call with reporters , Clinton Senior Adviser Harold Ickes clarified their position on Michigan -- they do n't want the 55 " uncommitted " delegates to go to Obama ( his name did not appear on the ballot in Michigan ) .
There have been reports that some of the uncommitted delegates in Michigan already selected are union supporters of Clinton .
This solution , unsurprisingly , would make it much harder for Obama to clinch a pledged delegate majority .
Last week , the Clinton campaign was agnostic on the issue -- but they seem to ratcheting up the noise , or at least their negotiating position .
Ickes also mentions that the co-chairs of the Rules and Bylaws Committee -- which will rule on Florida and Michigan on May 31 -- have been holding " informal meetings " with leaders of both of the campaigns .
UPDATE : Wolfson says that most -- if not -- all of the uncommitted delegates would likely go for Obama .
We 're calling this right now : ASUS ' Eee PC is the new MP3 player .

Better hurry -- the deal expires on June 15th .
About the author

The new Monsanto has clearly come to dominate the American food chain with its genetically modified ( GM ) seeds .
It 's a master at enforcing its 674 biotechnology patents , using tyrannical and ruthless tactics against small farmers .
This new Monsanto has also moved into the production of milk with it artificial growth hormones , seeking to dominate the dairy industry as effectively as it has the seed business .
Has this new corporate image made us forget about the old Monsanto 's decades long history of scorched earth and toxic contamination ?
An article in the May , 2008 edition ofchronicles the history of Monsanto from its beginnings to its efforts to shed itself of the image of toxic environmental and human threat .
Monsanto was founded in 1901 by John Francis Queeny who had an idea to make money manufacturing saccharin , an artificial sweetener then imported from Germany .
He called his company Monsanto Chemical Works .
The German cartel then controlling the market for saccharin tried to force Queeny out of business , but his persistence and the loyalty of one steady customer , Coca - Cola , kept the company going .
Vanillin , caffeine , sedative drugs , laxatives and aspirin had been added to the arsenal of products when supplies were cut off from Europe during World War I , forcing Monsanto to manufacture its own , and positioning it as a leading force in the American chemical industry .
In the 1920's , Queeny 's son took over and built Monsanto into a global powerhouse , extending into the production of an astounding array of plastic , rubber and vinyl goods , fertilizers , herbicides and pesticides .
In the 1970 's Monsanto moved into biotechnology .
By 1982 it had become the first to genetically modify a plant cell , making it possible to introduce virtually any gene into plant cells to improve crop productivity .
According to Vanity Fair writers Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele , Monsanto sought to portray GM seeds as a panacea for alleviating poverty and feeding the hungry .
During the late 1990's , Monsanto spun off its chemical and fibers businesses into a new company called Solutia .
It then reincorporated itself and emerged as an agricultural company .
Company literature refers to Monsanto as a " relatively new company " with the primary goal of helping " farmers around the world in their mission to feed , clothe and fuel " the planet .
The listed corporate milestones are from the recent era .
There is no mention of the old Monsanto 's potential responsibility for more than 50 Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites .
And it does not mention that the reason for the formation of Solutia was to channel the bulk of the mounting chemical lawsuits and liabilities into the spun off company , keeping the new Monsanto name tarnish - free .
But keeping the new corporate image polished may be a tough task .
For many years Monsanto produced two of the most toxic substances ever known - polychlorinated biphenyls , known as PCBs , and dioxin .
Several court proceedings regarding these substances remain unresolved .
In the town of Nitro , West Virginia , Monsanto operated a chemical plant from 1929 to 1995 , making an herbicide that had dioxin as a by - product .
The name dioxin refers to a group of highly toxic chemicals that have been linked to heart and liver disease , human reproductive disorders , and developmental problems .
Dioxin persists in the environment and accumulates in the body , even in small amounts .
In 2001 , the U.S. government listed dioxin as a " known human carcinogen " .
In 1949 , at the Nitro plant , a pressure valve blew on a container of this herbicide , producing a plume of vapor and white smoke that drifted out over the town .
Residue coated the interior of buildings and those inside them with a fine black powder .
Within days , workers experienced skin eruptions , and many were diagnosed with chloracne , a long lasting and disfiguring condition .
Others felt intense pains in their chest , legs and trunk .
A medical report from the time said the explosion " caused a systemic intoxication in the workers involving most major organ systems . "
Doctors detected a strong odor coming from the patients they described as men " excreting a foreign chemical through their skins " .
Monsanto downplayed the incident , saying that the contaminant was " fairly slow acting " and only an irritant to the skin .
Meanwhile , the Nitro plant continued to produce herbicides ,
In the 1960's it manufactured Agent Orange , the powerful herbicide used by the U.S. military to defoliate jungles during the Vietnam War , and which became the focus of lawsuits by veterans contending they had been harmed by exposure to the chemical .
Agent Orange also created dioxin as a by - product .
At the Nitro plant , dioxin waste went into landfills , storm drains , streams , sewers , into bags with the herbicide , and then the waste was burned out into the air .
Dioxin from the plant can still be found in nearby streams , rivers , and fish .
Residents have sued Monsanto and Solutia for damages , but Monsanto claims " the allegations are without merit " and promises to vigorously defend itself .
The suit may drag on for years .
Monsanto has the resources to wait ; plaintiffs usually do n't .
From 1929 to 1971 , the Anniston , Alabama plant produced PCBs as industrial coolants and insulating fluids for transformers and other electrical equipment .
PCBs became central to American industries as lubricants , hydraulic fluids , and sealants .
PCBs are highly toxic members of a family of chemicals that mimic hormones , and have been linked to damage in the liver and nervous system , as well as immune , endocrine and reproductive disorders .
The Environmental Protective Agency ( EPA ) , and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry , part of Health and Human Services , classify PCBs as " probably carcinogens " .
Today , after tons of contaminated soil have been removed in an effort to reclaim the Anniston site , the area around the old Monsanto plant continues to be one of the most polluted spots in the U.S.
While the plant was in production , excess PCBs were dumped in a nearby open - pit landfill or allowed to flow off the property with storm water .
Some were poured directly into a creek running alongside the plant and emptying into a larger stream .
PCBs are contained in private lawns fertilized with soil from the plant .
The people of Anniston have breathed air , planted gardens , drunk from wells , fished in rivers , and swum in creeks contaminated with PCBs without knowing the danger .
As public awareness grew in the 1990's , health authorities found elevated levels of PCBs in houses , yards , streams , fields , fish - and people .
The cleanup is now underway , and will take years , but once PCB is absorbed into human tissue , it is there forever .
Monsanto closed its PBC plant in Wales in 1977 .
In recent years , residents of Groesfaen , in southern Wales , have noticed vile odors emanating from an old quarry outside their village .
As it turns out , Monsanto dumped thousands of tons of waste from its nearby PCB plant into the quarry .
British authorities have identified the site as one of the most contaminated places in Britain .
What did Monsanto know about the potential dangers of the chemicals it manufactured ?
Information from court records indicates Monsanto knew quite a lot .
The evidence that Monsanto refused to face questions about the toxicity of PBCs is clear .
In 1956 , the company tried to sell its PCB containing hydraulic fluid , Pydraul 150 , to the navy .
Monsanto supplied the navy with test results from the product , but the navy decided to do its own testing .
As a result , navy officials informed Monsanto that they would not buy the product , saying that " application of Pydraul 150 caused death in all of the rabbits tested " and indicated " definite liver damage " .
According to an internal Monsanto memo divulged during a court proceeding , " no matter how we discussed the situation , it was impossible to change their thinking that Pydraul 150 is just too toxic for use in submarines " , stated Monsanto 's medical director .
In 1966 , a biologist conducting studies for Monsanto in streams near the Anniston plant submerged test fish .
He reported to Monsanto that , " All 25 fish lost equilibrium and turned on their sides in 10 seconds and all were dead in 3 ½ minutes .
"
The company swung into action to limit the PR damage when the Food and Drug Administration found high levels of PCBs in fish near the Anniston plant in 1970 .
An internal memo entitled " Confidential - F.Y.I. and Destroy " from a Monsanto official , reviewed steps to limit disclosure of the information .
One aspect of the strategy was to get public officials to fight Monsanto 's battle : " Joe Crockett , Secretary of the Alabama Water Improvement Commission will try to handle the problem quietly without release of the information to the public at this time , " according to the memo .
The plant manager of Monsanto 's Anniston site " convinced " a reporter for The Anniston Star that there was nothing to worry about .
An internal memo from Monsanto 's headquarters in St. Louis , summarized the story that subsequently appeared in the newspaper : " Quoting both plant management and the Alabama Water Improvement Commissions , the feature emphasized the PCB problem was relatively new , was being solved by Monsanto and , at this point , was no cause for public alarm .
"
The real truth is that there was huge cause for public alarm for the harm done to the public by Monsanto .
But that was the old Monsanto , not today 's shiny new Monsanto .
Today 's Monsanto says it can be trusted - that its biotech crops are " as wholesome , nutritious and safe as conventional crop " , and that the milk produced from cows injected with its artificial growth hormones is identical to the milk from untreated cows .

While you may have some sort of IT department in your company , there are many benefits that come with outsourcing your IT support .
Perhaps you ’ve assessed these benefits yourself recently , and you ’re interested in getting an IT consultant for your business .
But you should n’t just go with the first one you find ; you need to get a good picture of what certain consultants offer , how much they charge , what their experience is like , and more .
To help you out , here are the top questions you should ask when hiring a reliable IT consultant .
Why Should I Choose You ?
This is a pretty loaded question , but how the IT consultant answers can tell you a lot about them , such as how confident they are in their skills .
There are so many IT consultants out there , so whoever you ’re considering , they should have a good argument as to why you should go with them and not someone else .
A reliable IT consultant should be able to confidently answer this question with evidence .
For example , they might point you to some of their case studies , which prove that they ’ve not only gotten results but have also gained the trust of several companies .
The IT consultant should also be confident in recalling any stellar examples of how they ’ve handled difficult clients or situations .
You can gauge how their reaction is to this question and see if they feel confident and comfortable in responding .
If they get defensive or clam up with no answers , then this may be a bad sign .
How Much Experience Do You Have ?
Obviously , you ’ll want to work with someone who knows what they ’re doing .
If you choose poorly , not only will you put your network at risk , but you ’ll also be getting a poor return on investment ( ROI ) .
The ideal IT consultant should have years of experience in the industry .
However , just because they have a lot of years under their belt does n’t necessarily mean they ’re good at what they do .
And the opposite does n’t mean they ’re terrible either .
Instead , you have to delve deeper .
If they have decades of experience , have they actually worked with clients in your industry ?
Or have they worked with clients with your company size ?
If they do n’t have that many years of experience , find out what they have worked on .
What were the results ?
Were they what the clients expected ?
By digging deeper , you might unexpectedly find a gem , so do n’t be afraid to keep asking questions .
Do You Have Any Areas You Specialize In ?
Of course , you want an IT consultant who has experience working with clients in your industry , as well as your company size .
But you also want someone who has certain areas of specialization to better fit the needs of your company .
For example , in IT consulting , there are specializations like remote support desk and network security .
A good IT consultant can handle multiple areas of IT , but they ’ll also shine in certain things .
If your main concern is , say , network security , then it goes without saying that you want to choose an IT consultant that specializes in that , rather than remote support .
How Would You Approach Certain Situations ?
Shopping around for an IT consultant is kind of like conducting job interviews .
You want to make sure they ’re not only good at their jobs , but that their values align with yours .
Otherwise , you risk clashing heads .
Think of some challenges you ’ve faced while doing business and pose these scenarios to the IT consultant .
Ask them how they would approach the issues and find solutions .
Not only does this show they can think on their toes , but it can reveal their personal approach to things .
You can then assess their answers to see if it fits with your company culture .
What ’s Your Availability ?
You want someone who can dedicate an appropriate amount of time to their services .
As a result , you need to know what exactly they ’re working on now and if they ’re capable of dedicating enough of themselves to you .
A reliable and trustworthy IT consultant should be completely transparent .
They should be able to tell you directly how many clients they ’re currently helping , or at least how much time they ’re devoting to those clients .
You want to choose someone who does n’t have too full of a plate .
This is especially true if you ’re being charged by the hour .
If they ’re trying to juggle multiple clients , then you might get a consultant who ’s not as productive but still charges you a hefty rate .
How Do You Charge For Your Services ?
One of the most important questions you should ask is how much an IT consultant charges for their services .
Most small businesses will have a limited budget , so you do n’t want to stretch yours too much and risk excess overhead .
Figure out if they charge per hour or on a subscription basis ( such as charging a certain amount per month ) .
The optimal type of service will depend on your needs .
For instance , if you need remote support 24/ 7 for your clients , then a subscription would probably be more worth it than an hourly rate .
But if you just need someone to manage an IT project from time to time , you might want to look into hourly rates .
Use These Tips To Hire A Reliable IT Consultant
Hiring a reliable IT consultant is crucial for not only growing your business but also keeping it secure .
This is why it ’s incredibly important for you to vet candidates and take your time .
By investing some care and thought into the process instead of rushing it , you can ensure your business will flourish for years to come .

The fearsome Komodo dragon is the world 's largest living lizard and can take very large animal prey : now a new international study has revealed how it can be such an efficient killing machine despite having a wimpy bite and a featherweight skull .
A member of the goanna family with ancestors dating back more than 100 million years , the dragon ( Varanus komodoensis ) uses a combination of 60 razor - sharp serrated teeth , powerful neck muscles and what researchers are calling a " space - frame " skull to butcher prey with awesome efficiency , the study found .
They note that the dragon -- inhabiting the central Indonesian islands of Komodo , Rinca , Flores , Gili Motang and Gili Dasami -- shares the feeding and dental characteristics of extinct dinosaurs , sharks and sabre - toothed cats .
Scientists Karen Moreno and Stephen Wroe from the University of New South Wales have used a computer - based technique called Finite Element Analysis ( FEA ) to test the bite force and feeding mechanics of the predator .
Their findings are to be published in the latest issue of the Journal of Anatomy .
Normally used in the analysis of trains , planes and cars , the technique allowed the team to " reverse engineer " nature 's design to assess the mechanical forces that a Komodo skull can handle .
" The Komodo has a featherweight , space - frame skull and bites like a wimp , " according to Wroe , " but a combination of very clever engineering , and wickedly sharp teeth , allow it to do serious damage to even buffalo - sized prey .
" The Komodo displays a unique hold and pull - feeding technique , " says Dr Wroe .
" Its delicate skull differs greatly from most living terrestrial large prey specialists , but it 's a precision instrument , beautifully optimised to make the most of its natural cranial and dental properties .
" Unlike most modern predators , Varanus komodoensis applies minimal input from the jaw muscles when killing and butchering prey .
But it compensates using a series of actions controlled by its postcranial muscles .
A particularly interesting feature of the skull 's performance is that it reveals considerably lower overall stress when these additional forces driven by the neck are added to those of the jaw - closing muscles .
" This remarkable reduction in stress in response to additional force is facilitated partly by the shape of the bones , but also by the way bone of different strengths are arranged within the skull . "
The Komodo dragon grows to an average length of two to three metres and weighing around 70 kilograms .
The reptile 's unusual size is attributed to island gigantism , since there are no other carnivorous mammals to fill the niche on the islands where they live .
As a result of their size , these lizards are apex predators , dominating the ecosystems in which they live .
Although Komodo dragons eat mostly carrion , they will also hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates , birds , and mammals .
Its saliva is frequently blood - tinged , because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding .
Discovered by Western scientists in 1910 , the Komodo dragon 's large size and fearsome reputation makes it a popular zoo exhibit .
In the wild its total population is estimated at 4,000 - 5,000 : its range has contracted due to human activities and it is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN .
Robert Mugabe has been unable to win back control of Zimbabwe 's parliament after a partial recount of the 29 March election results failed to overturn any of the original results that gave the opposition the majority of seats .
It means the first defeat in 28 years for Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party after Zimbabwe 's electoral commission ( ZEC ) yesterday released seven more results from the recount , changing none .
It brings to 13 the number of seats recounted , with 10 remaining to be declared - all in strong opposition - held areas .
Zanu - PF would need to win nine to regain control .
Results have still not been released from the parallel presidential poll which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai won , beating Mugabe outright .
Independent monitors estimate that Tsvangirai won , but fell just short of the 50 per cent threshold to avoid a run-off .
The MDC accuses Mugabe of delaying results to rig his victory and has rejected any run-off .
The failure to announce the results , four weeks on from the vote , is causing mounting concern internationally .
But late yesterday afternoon the electoral commission said it would invite presidential candidates to verify the results from Monday , before they are released .
' We trust that by Monday this process will have been concluded , ' said ZEC chairman George Chiweshe .
' I can't say exactly when the results will come . '
Reporters in Zimbabwe say the electoral commission is making the process extremely difficult to follow , and results are being issued in a haphazard manner .
The announcements came after a week of escalating attacks on opposition supporters - Tsvangirai is staying out of the country at the moment because of fears about his safety .
On Friday , armed riot police raided the MDC headquarters and detained scores of people in the toughest measures against the opposition since the elections .
Computers and documents were seized in the raid .
The MDC says its activists have been attacked around the country - with at least 10 killed .
The police claim that no one has died .
Gordon Brown yesterday called for a United Nations mission to inspect human rights abuses .
Brown , who is seeking an arms embargo on Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , said Britain would step up diplomatic efforts ahead of this week 's Security Council meeting on the former British colony .
' The coming days will be critical .
We will intensify international action around a Security Council discussion on Tuesday .
We will press for a UN mission to investigate the violence and human rights abuses , ' he said in a statement .
' The whole international community must speak up against the climate of fear in Zimbabwe . '
Zimbabweans are enduring severe shortages of basic goods and an inflation rate of 165,000 per cent - the world 's highest .
The state - run Herald newspaper called African leaders ' myopic stooges ' for joining western criticism of Zimbabwe 's handling of the election .
Mugabe is beginning to lose regional diplomatic support over the delay in announcing the results and his attempts to retain power through force .
His former allies in the Southern African Development Community last week united in condemning him and barred an arms shipment from being unloaded , causing the ship to be recalled to China .
Defiant Zanu - PF officials claimed there was no shortage of arms already in or reaching the country .
' I think for the first time , at a very crucial moment , Mugabe is losing diplomatic support in the region and without that support his ability to survive politically is diminished , ' said Eldred Masunungure , a professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe .
Results so far
MDC and allies : 110 seats before recount
Zanu - PF : 97 seats before recount
23 seats subject to recount
13 of these unchanged
10 seats still being recounted
Zanu - PF would need to gain nine of these 10 to be sure of a majority .

Wherein another antagonist goes penguin hunting
by Jeremy Hooper
Earlier this morning we heard how a pair of Concerned Women For America were misrepresenting the pro-acceptance children 's book And Tango Makes
Three so that it sounded like a " sexually explicit " piece of work .
But then , after being called out on their misrepresentative nonsense , CWA proceed to pull their deceptive piece .
We thought we were done with the book for the day .
Unfortunately , however , Peter LaBarbera has decided to keep the off - base , fallacious " it 's all about sex " meme going .
The Americans For Truth leader describes the very same kiddie book to One News Now as follows :
" One of the more insidious aspects of the homosexual agenda has been its willingness to manipulate young people 's minds to promote homosexual behavior , " ... "
We should n't be talking about homosexuality to kids who are years away from understanding ... what normal sex is .... "
...
" The homosexual activists know that they have to change minds very young and equate homosexuality with love before the parents can inculcate their own values , " he continues . "
So that 's why these books are insidious , because they 're ... trying to change these kids ' minds and their moral framework .... "
And again , we have a " pro-family " spokesperson representing a book about love and companionship as if it 's one about hardcore banging .
Whereas Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel create in their minds ' eyes the notion that every lady can find herself a man , tales like Tango are made to sound as if they 're filled with graphic instructions on things like condom usage and proper teeth placement .
This double standard in terms of classification is as wrong - headed as their overall heterosexist , homo - hostile tone .
Pete 's right by saying that we gays are trying to change hearts and minds .
We are trying to show society that despite attempts by folks like Pete to bastardize actual truth , homo - geared people are , have always been , and always will be part of the fabric of society .
Also , we are quite unapologetic about trying to stop anti-gay attitudes from plaguing yet another generation .
And we are trying to change the conversation from one in which gays are automatically branded as " insidious " for refusing to be bullied into living out someone else 's ideal .
We make no bones about this .
We are n't fans of bias .
Why should we be ?!?!
If parents like Peter want to " inculcate " their own children with discriminatory outlooks towards a viable population sect , then they have every right to do so .
They will NOT , however , foist their society - weakening , regressive , hostile , biased baggage on those of us who choose to guide our own children with reasoned , humane outlooks .

The ocean 's " deserts , " where it is difficult for marine organisms to survive , are expanding faster than predicted and have been linked to warming ocean waters , a new study shows .
These barren areas are found in roughly 20 percent of the world 's oceans and are within what are called subtropical gyres , or the permanent swirling expanses of water in the middle of the ocean on either side of the equator .
But between 1998 and 2007 , these expanses of saltwater with low surface plant life in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans grew by 15 percent , or 2.5 million square miles ( 6.6 million square kilometers ) , according to the new study , detailed in a recent issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The expansion is occurring at the same time that sea surface temperatures are warming about 1 percent or 0.02 to 0.04 degrees Celsius a year .
The warming imposes tougher barriers between different layers of the ocean waters , preventing deep ocean nutrients from rising to the surface and feeding plant life .
" The fact that we are seeing an expansion of the ocean ’s least productive areas as the subtropical gyres warm is consistent with our understanding of the impact of global warming , " said study co-author Jeffrey J. Polovina , an oceanographer with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service in Honolulu .
" But with a nine - year time series , it is difficult to rule out decadal variation . "
Polovina and his colleagues used data from NASA 's SeaStar satellite , which maps ocean biological productivity ( or the amount of chlorophyll produced by phytoplankton , the microscopic plants that form the base of the ocean food chain ) around the world .
These maps showed areas of low productivity in the Pacific Ocean expanding outwards from the center toward Hawaii .
In the Atlantic Ocean , these low - productivity areas are expanding even faster eastward from the Caribbean toward Africa .
These areas now cover roughly 20 million square miles ( 51 million square kilometers ) in the two major oceans .
Top 10 Surprising Results of Global Warming
Timeline : The Frightening Future of Earth
Images : Under the Pacific
Computer analyses of global climate have consistently overstated warming in Antarctica , concludes new research by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) and Ohio State University .
The study can help scientists improve computer models and determine if Earth 's southernmost continent will warm significantly this century , a major research question because of Antarctica 's potential impact on global sea - level rise .
" We can now compare computer simulations with observations of actual climate trends in Antarctica , " says NCAR scientist Andrew Monaghan , the lead author of the study .
" This is showing us that , over the past century , most of Antarctica has not undergone the fairly dramatic warming that has affected the rest of the globe .
The challenges of studying climate in this remote environment make it difficult to say what the future holds for Antarctica 's climate . "
The study marks the first time that scientists have been able to compare records of the past 50 to 100 years of Antarctic climate with simulations run on computer models .
Researchers have used atmospheric observations to confirm that computer models are accurately simulating climate for the other six continents .
The models , which are mathematical representations of Earth 's climate system , are a primary method for scientists to project future climate .
Antarctica 's climate is of worldwide interest , in part because of the enormous water locked up in its ice sheets .
If those vast ice sheets were to begin to melt , sea level could rise across the globe and inundate low - lying coastal areas .
Yet , whereas climate models accurately simulate the last century of warming for the rest of the world , they have unique challenges simulating Antarctic climate because of limited information about the continent 's harsh weather patterns .
The study was published on April 5 in Geophysical Research Letters .
It was funded by the National Science Foundation , NCAR 's primary sponsor , and the Department of Energy .
The authors compared recently constructed temperature data sets from Antarctica , based on data from ice cores and ground weather stations , to 20th century simulations from computer models used by scientists to simulate global climate .
While the observed Antarctic temperatures rose by about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.2 degrees Celsius ) over the past century , the climate models simulated increases in Antarctic temperatures during the same period of 1.4 degrees F ( 0.75 degrees C ) .

The error appeared to be caused by models overestimating the amount of water vapor in the Antarctic atmosphere , the new study concludes .
The reason may have to do with the cold Antarctic atmosphere handling moisture differently than the atmosphere over warmer regions .
A chilling ozone hole
Part of the reason that Antarctica has barely warmed has to do with the ozone hole over the continent .
The lack of ozone is chilling the middle and upper atmosphere , altering wind patterns in a way that keeps comparatively warm air from reaching the surface .
Unlike the rest of the continent , the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by several degrees , in part because the winds there are drawing in warmer air from the north .
The models generally capture these wind changes , although sometimes incompletely .
The study delivered a mixed verdict on Antarctica 's potential impact on sea - level rise .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which operates under the auspices of the United Nations , has estimated that sea - level rise could amount to 7 to 23 inches ( 18 - 59 centimeters ) this century , in part because of melting glaciers worldwide .
The Geophysical Research Letters paper suggests that warming in Antarctica over the next century could offset that by about 2 inches if the continent warms by 5.4 degrees F ( 3 degrees C ) , as computer models have indicated .
The reason is that the warmer air over Antarctica would hold more moisture and generate more snowfall , thereby locking up additional water in the continent 's ice sheets .
But the authors caution that model projections of future Antarctic climate may be unreliable .
" The research clearly shows that you can actually slow down sea - level rise when you increase temperatures over Antarctica because snowfall increases , but warmer temperatures also have the potential to speed up sea - level rise due to enhanced melting along the edges of Antarctica , " says Monaghan , who did some of his research at Ohio State University before coming to NCAR .
" Over the next century , whether the ice sheet grows from increased snowfall or shrinks due to more melt will depend on how much temperatures increase in Antarctica , and potentially on erosion at the ice sheet edge by the warmer ocean and rising sea level . "
" The current generation of climate models has improved over previous generations , but still leaves Antarctic surface temperature projections for the 21st century with a high degree of uncertainty , " adds co-author and NCAR scientist David Schneider .
" On a positive note , this study points out that water vapor appears to be the key cause of the problematic Antarctic temperature trends in the models , which will guide scientists as they work to improve the climate simulations . "

Fridays are notorious as a dumping ground of bad news , Fridays before US holiday weekends being even more attractive for that purpose .
So when Microsoft dropped the news that it was canceling Live Book Search and pulling out of the Open Content Alliance , the timing of the announcement suggested that the company did n't necessarily see this as good corporate PR .
But Brewster Kahle , who heads the Internet Archive and is taking a lead role with the OCA , says that it 's the right move for Microsoft .
Despite coming to the end of $ 10 million in book scanning funds from the company , and despite getting only a couple days notice about the decision , Kahle says that his bottom line response to Microsoft 's involvement in the digitization process is , " Thank you . "
Satya Nadella , a Microsoft senior vice president , issued the bad news in a blog post on Friday morning .
Live Book Search provided access to the huge collection of material scanned by the OCA , but Microsoft decided that this was not a sustainable long - term business .
Instead , the idea was to dismantle Live Book Search and integrate all book search queries directly into the main Live search engine .
While this would expose book search results to more users , it would also mean that Microsoft realized that its search team needed to focus its expertise on search , not content acquisition and storage .
In other words , the Microsoft search team was moving back to becoming a navigation system rather than a content host .
" Based on our experience , " wrote Nadella , " we foresee that the best way for a search engine to make book content available will be by crawling content repositories created by book publishers and libraries . "
One of the biggest of these repositories , apart from Google 's book search project , is the OCA , where Microsoft has been a member for several years and has helped to fund the scanning of 1,000 books a day at thirteen major libraries .
The Internet Archive is taking the lead on the project and provides hosting for the resulting texts , but Kahle is n't upset that a company like Microsoft has chosen to leave the work of scanning to libraries and foundations now .
Quoth the Raven , " Nevermore . "
The loss of resources is " significant , " he tells Ars , but " if we ca n't pick it up from here , " then the OCA deserves to falter .
Microsoft and other corporations like Yahoo have gotten the project off the ground by providing the initial scanning stations and developing the expertise needed to do the project right .
While Microsoft is taking its cash with it , the company is leaving in place all the equipment that it paid for and is releasing all scans of public domain works for any use , not just education and research .
According to Kahle , Microsoft has done more than it is contractually obligated to do as it ramps down its involvement with OCA .
In a way , Kahle sees the retreat of the corporations from OCA as a necessary step , perhaps even a good one .
He 's a firm believer in the idea that corporations should not be the entities we trust to provide access to important cultural data stores .
If people think that corporations are the right way to access the history of human discourse , Kahle says they 're in for " a series of very rude shocks . "
( The University of Michiagn , which has thrown in its lot with Google , does not agree . )
Libraries , foundations , and groups like the Internet Archive are arguably more interested in offering truly open access to resources , but without major funding from companies like Microsoft , will such projects remain viable in the long term ?
Kahle acknowledges that he needs to " scurry " to keep the library scanning centers operational ; after all , several hundred people currently spend their days scanning books in these thirteen locations and they need to be " treated right . "
But several months remain to figure out the financial details .
For now , Kahle just wants to say thanks .
" In the long term , " he says , " it makes more sense this way . "
Sharapova is seeded fifth for the Rome tournament Maria Sharapova has launched a stinging attack on the governing body of women 's tennis over their publicity demands .
The world number three says the WTA is " forcing " her to do a publicity shoot in Rome , ahead of the Italian Open , after flying in from Los Angeles .
" The WTA is telling me if I do n't do this shoot they will fine me over US $ 300,000 , " said the Russian .
In a statement the WTA insisted , " what is being asked of players in Rome is in the rules . "
The tournament begins on 12 May and features a host of leading players , including Justine Henin , Ana Ivanovic , Serena and Venus Williams .
" I want all my fans to know that the WTA Tour is forcing me and several of the other top players to do a four - hour commercial shoot for WTA Tour marketing materials , " Sharapova told her website .
606 : DEBATE
" They want me to do this shoot on Sunday , Monday or Tuesday of the Rome tournament after flying 12 hours from LA .
" I have set my own personal rules when it comes to doing shoots and I never do shoots before tournaments because they are mentally draining and I want to just focus on my tennis .
" Now the WTA is telling me if I do n't do this shoot they will fine me over US $ 300,000 .
As you can see the WTA Tour loves to fine players .
" To be honest , I would love to do this and help promote the tour as much as possible , but to force me to do this shoot the day before a Tier I tournament is just not right . "
The WTA insisted players were aware of their obligations .
" Players have many obligations both on and off the court , and what is being asked of players in Rome is in the rules , " a spokesman said .
Sharapova is running a poll on her website asking the question , " What Should Maria Do ? "

We go back a long way with herpesviruses .
Our evolutionary line has been living with these genomic parasites for more than 100 million years , and today herpesviruses infect nearly all humans , as well as all other mammals , birds and reptiles that scientists have checked .
We are n't born with these viruses , but most of us acquire multiple infections of various types of herpesviruses during childhood .
Unlike our relationship with many other , more notorious viruses , we 've learned to peacefully coexist with herpesviruses for the most part .
They set up shop in our cells , they use our molecular machinery to replicate themselves , and they take advantage of the influx of energy we provide from our diet .
Sometimes the relationship goes sour , with the unfortunate results ranging from chickenpox to mononucleosis , genital herpes , and Burkitt 's lymphoma , but by and large , most humans , and mammals in general , are never seriously harmed by these house guests .
But do we get anything out of this relationship ?
Remarkably , recent research suggests that this 100 million - year coexistence may have been good for us too , helping our immune system to ward off even more serious pathogens .
Photo Credit : US Centers for Disease Control , courtesy of the Wikipedia Commons
When we first become infected by a herpesvirus , we often feel the effects as we come down with shingles or mono .
But after our immune system fights off this acute infection , the virus hunkers down and enters a subdued , latent phase .
During latency , the virus does n't do much more than get its genome replicated by our cells , and the preferred herpes hangout during this time is inside a type of immune cell called a macrophage .
Macrophages make up our microscopic version of the US Marine Corps : they are merciless killing machines that go after the bacterial pathogens that threaten us .
But macrophages are n't primed to fight all the time .
They need to be stimulated by immune system hormones , such as one called interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) .
When we become infected with a pathogen , we produce these macrophage - stimulating hormones , which leads the macrophages to gear up and take on the infection .
So what do latent herpesviruses have to do with any of this ?
Latent viruses are not entirely peaceful ; they do have a nasty habit of reactivation , especially under times of stress , and then the human host is faced with an acute infection that can produce symptoms .
This acute infection has to be suppressed all over again , and obviously our immune systems would prefer to just keep the viruses latent forever .
To do this , it appears that our bodies produce the macrophage - stimulating IFN - gamma in response to latent infections .
Much like the US Department of Homeland Security Threat Level , which never seems to dip below the yellow " Elevated " , our levels of IFN - gamma remain elevated in the presence latent herpesvirus infections , which keeps the macrophages primed to suppress the virus when it gets uppity .
Dr. Herbert Virgin , at the Washington University School of Medicine , has discovered that this persistently elevated level of IFN - gamma is actually helpful in warding off some serious diseases .
He took two sets of mice , one set which was latently infected with a herpesvirus , and another set that had never been exposed to these viruses , and he injected them with some nasty pathogens : listeria and Yersinia pestis , the bacteria that causes plague .
The mice without the latent herpesvirus generally died off quickly , but amazingly , the mice which did have herpesviruses hanging out in their macrophages frequently survived these nasty infections .
It appears that latent viruses cause us to produce IFN - gamma , which in turn helps us ( or at least mice ) survive bacterial infections .
Dr. Virgin has taken this even further , just to show how key IFN - gamma is in this whole scenario .
As we just saw , mice which have latent viral infections can fight off the plague .
But the herpesvirus fails to have any protective effect in mutant mice that can't produce IFN - gamma , demonstrating that IFN - gamma is the key component .
It all boils down to this :
1 . Mice with latent viral infections produce more IFN - gamma than mice that have n't been exposed to the virus .
2 . Mice with latent viral infections can fight off nasty bacteria better than mice without the virus .
3 . But even mice with the virus are n't helped if they do n't make IFN - gamma , showing conclusively that IFN - gamma is the key player .
While these experiments have only been done in lab mice , the immune system components are vert similar to what exists in humans , so it 's likely that this protective effect exists in us .
In fact , it is likely to be found in most mammals , because , as Dr. Virgin argues , this effect is a response that evolved a long time ago - we 've been living with herpesviruses since before we were mammals .
So when your chickenpox - infected kid is keeping you up with complaints in the middle of the night , or you 're wiped out with mono , remind yourself that our relationship with herpesviruses , while it has its ups and downs , is worth the long - term committment .

A week ago , Joshua Hager was despondent .
Laid off by a mortgage company , he has looked for jobs ranging from bank teller to risk analyst .
He was sending out as many as 10 resumes a day but was getting barely a nibble from employers or recruiters .
This week , things are are looking up .
Hager , a Jersey City , N.J. , resident , went on one interview for a fraud investigator job at a mortgage insurance company and another for a position underwriting employee dishonesty insurance .
Executives at the latter told him they 'd make a decision within 10 days .
He does n't know what next week will bring .
" It 's always flowed for me , " said Hager , 29 , who discovered his love of math and finance in high school in Proctorville , Ohio , about three hours southeast of Columbus .
" I 've always had a job and every time I changed jobs , it was for advancement .
Now , it 's like ' What do I do with myself because I can't wait for that next step . ' "
Hager has joined nearly 125,000 others on Wall Street and at mortgage firms and other financial companies who received pink slips since the start of 2007 .
It seems that nearly every week another financial firm lets go of thousands of workers at all levels .
With the market flooded , it 's hard for the unemployed to land a job , experts said .
Every time he turns on the television , Hager worries that he 'll hear of more layoffs .
He shuddered when he learned that JPMorgan Chase would acquire Bear Stearns , which employs 14,000 staffers .
" How many people will be swamping the job market ? " he said .
" Everybody in finance will be looking for a job . "
It used to be easy
Not too long ago , it was easy to land work in real estate or finance .
After spending three years in the Navy , Hager joined the booming mortgage industry in 2003 , signing on with Countrywide Financial Corp . ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) in Tampa , Fla. , as a junior loan processor .
Within a year , he was promoted to underwriter , a job he loved because it allowed him to analyze borrowers ' applications and determine how risky it would be to lend to them .
For instance , during the mortgage frenzy 's height , when stated - income loans became all the rage , one applicant he reviewed said that he was a school engineer making $ 5,000 a month .
A quick call revealed he was actually the janitor making about $ 1,600 .
Hager said he did not approve the application , the same decision he made on about half those that crossed his desk .
Last February , Hager transferred to a Countrywide office in New Jersey to be closer to New York City and to relatives .
He moved in with a friend , who owned an apartment in downtown Jersey City , a suburb of the Big Apple .
Two months later , he switched to Aurora Loan Services , a subsidiary of Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) .
In addition to a salary boost , he took on increased responsibility , getting more involved with investigating fraud and doing second reviews on loans .
By the fall , it was clear to Hager that his job was in trouble .
Lehman had shuttered its subprime mortgage unit and he figured that his division , which handled so - called Alt - A loans that required little or no income documentation , was next .
As someone who always plans his next step , Hager did n't want to wait until he was laid off to start looking for another job .
So he began sending out resumes in November , staying clear of the mortgage and real estate industries .
Instead , he focused on insurance underwriting positions .
After applying for more than 100 jobs and getting only two interviews , he realized he had to broaden his search .
By that time , he was out of a job , one of 1,300 people at Aurora that were let go in late February .
Starting to get more desperate , he branched out to consumer credit analysis at companies such as American Express or Mastercard .
Just trying to find a way in
With the job fairs , networking events and resume blasts yielding little , Hager found he had to set his sights lower and lower .
In mid-March , he began exploring bank teller postings .
" The strategy is continually changing , " Hager said .
" You are trying to think of a way to get your foot in the door . "
For now , Hager has enough money to get by , though he 's starting to worry .
The $ 1,900 he collects every month in unemployment is a far cry from the $ 4,600 he took home while he was working , but his expenses are relatively low .
He pays $ 600 a month for his share of the apartment , though the maintenance is going up .
He 's signing up for veterans benefits so he can get health insurance since he can't afford COBRA .
Also , his parents have said they would help him out .
If the economy were n't on the rocks , Hager feels he'd be able to land a job more easily .
Companies are posting jobs , but they do n't seem to be hiring , he said .
He still sees notices from September that have gone unfilled .
And it takes weeks for executives to respond , if they do at all .
" The consumer dictates what employers do and no one is spending money , " Hager said .
" Employers do n't want anybody right now because no one wants products or services . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A leading U.S. doctors group has endorsed using marijuana for medical purposes , urging the government to roll back a prohibition on using it to treat patients and supporting studies into its medical applications .

The American College of Physicians , the second - largest doctors group in the United States , issued a policy statement on medical marijuana this week after it was approved by its governing body , the group said on Friday .
The group cited evidence that marijuana is valuable in treating severe weight loss associated with AIDS , and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients .
“ Additional research is needed to clarify marijuana ’s therapeutic properties and determine standard and optimal doses and routes of delivery .
Unfortunately , research expansion has been hindered by a complicated federal approval process , limited availability of research - grade marijuana and the debate over legalization , ” the group said .
The Philadelphia - based group , founded in 1915 , is made up of 124,000 doctors who treat adults .
“ The richness of modern medicine is to carefully evaluate new treatments .
Marijuana has been in a special category because of , I suppose , its abuses and other concerns , ” Dr. David Dale , the group ’s president and a University of Washington professor of medicine , said in a phone interview .
‘ SCIENCE SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN ’
David Murray , the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy ’s chief scientist , said , “ The science should be kept open .
There should be more research .
We should continue to investigate . ”
The policy statement said , “ ACP encourages the use of nonsmoked forms of THC ( the main psychoactive element in marijuana ) that have proven therapeutic value . ”
It also backed research into additional therapeutic uses of marijuana .
The government should review marijuana ’s status as a so - called schedule I controlled substance , alongside such drugs as LSD and heroin , given scientific evidence of its safety and efficacy for some medical conditions , the doctors group said .
It called for exempting doctors who prescribe or dispense medical marijuana in accordance with state law from federal criminal prosecution and other actions .
It also urged protection from criminal penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws .
A dozen states have laws allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes .
But supporters of medical marijuana accuse the federal government of undermining those state laws by having Drug Enforcement Administration agents raid medical marijuana providers .
Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project , which urges legal and regulated sales of marijuana , said , “ This statement by America ’s second - largest doctors group demolishes the myth that the medical community does n’t support medical marijuana . ”
“ The ACP ’s statement smashes a number of other myths , including the claims that adequate substitutes are available or that marijuana is unsafe for medical use , ” Kampia added .
President Trump and Joe Biden are facing off in the first presidential debate .

Google , Asked About Censorship at the UN , Moved to Censor the Questioner , Sources Say , Blaming UNDP Byline : Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press at the UN : News Analysis UNITED NATIONS , February 14 -- Google , after being publicly questioned at the UN about not signing on to the human rights and anti-censorship principles of the Global Compact , responded not by joining the Compact and foreswearing from censorship but by moving to de-list from its Google News service the media organization which raised the question .
More than two years after Inner City Press was included into Google News , in a February 8 message referring to the receipt of a complaint , Google said it would be removing Inner City Press from the news database .
In late 2007 , Google 's chief technologist Michael T. Jones took questions at a UN press conference with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN Development Program chief Kemal Dervis promoting Google 's involvement in mapping the UN 's anti-poverty Millennium Development Goals .
Inner City Press , accredited media at the UN , asked Mr. Jones if Google was a member of the UN Global Compact , through which corporations sign up to principles of human rights including non-censorship .
Video here , from Minute 30:21 .
Google 's Jones at first delayed answering the questions , noting that Google was the third of Inner City Press ' three questions -- the first two were to the UN Development Program 's Kemal Dervis about the absence of North Korea from the data base , the second to Cisco about censorship .
Then , on camera , Jones said he did not know of Google was a member of the UN Global Compact , that he would reply later .
Video here , from Minute 32:37 .
While Google is said to have a contract with UNDP , Google was not a member of the Global Compact then , and is not one as of this writing .
Rather , Inner City Press was notified by " Google Team , " with no further attribution , that it would be de-listed from the Google News service , in which it had been included since 2005 .
Google 's notification referred to " user complaints . "
Inner City Press immediately asked to be informed of the identity of any institutional complainant , including Google itself .
Beyond that , certainly , there are others with complaints about Inner City Press ' investigative coverage , at the UN , in Myanmar , UNDP and elsewhere .
In fact , UNDP sources describe communications from the UN system to Google executives , asking that Inner City Press be de-listed from Google News , and that a well - read blog , UNDP - Watch , be striken from that data base .
Recently a whistleblower in UNDP 's legal department had his office computer impounded and was told , you have visited InnerCity Press.com multiple times .
While the interrogation reflected contempt for the freedom to read and freedom of the press , the issue goes far beyond the corporate culture at UNDP , to that of Google .
Google 's Michael Jones , UNDP 's Kemal Dervis , Ban Ki-moon and CISCO : censorship not shown Google 's Sergey Brin and Larry Page have each been quoted dodging the question of Google 's participation in the Chinese government 's censorship of the Internet , saying only that Google contacted Beijing and came to an understanding .
It now appears that after getting a taste of censorship in China -- and in Egypt , by some accounts -- Google has in this case brought the practice home to the United States .
Inner City Press , alongside requesting the name of institutional complainants and to be maintained in Google News , sought comment by e-mail from press@google.com and from Google 's Michael T. Jones , whom it questioned at the UN .
The latter has not responded .
From press@google.com came a series of questions , which once answered , resulted in a vague assurance that indexing would continue .
But Inner City Press ' two stories datelined Wednesday night , about a lack of transparency at the UN and its soft approach to Myanmar 's military regime , were not included in Google News .
Thursday afternoon , Nancy Ngo of Google 's office of Global Communications stated that Inner City Press would be included " in a few weeks . "
But why was it removed ?
Developing -- Inner City Press remains included in Lexis - Nexis , ProQuest and other non-conflicted news data bases .

The Steampunk Home
I believe that Steampunk is more than just brass and watchparts .
It 's finding a way to combine the past and the future in an aesthetic pleasing yet still punkish way .
It 's living a life that looks old - fashioned , yet speaks to the future .
It 's taking the detritus of our modern technological society and remaking it into useful things .
Join me as I search for items for my house that combine the scientific romanticism of the Victorians with our real present and imagined future .
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul is one of those rare politicians who seems to be in office for reasons other than ego or personal gain .
Closer to being a Libertarian than a contemporary Republican , he has served more than 10 years representing Texans in the House of Representatives since 1976 ( he ’s been in office since 1997 , but served two other times ) .
He believes the government should stay as far out of Americans ’ lives as possible and sees the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) as a dangerous precedent in the battle to regulate the Internet .
Paul is an outspoken opponent of the UIGEA and is a co-signer of Congressman Barney Frank ’s bill that would prevent Federal employees from implementing the rules of the UIGEA , which would essentially kill it .
He has been critical of the UIGEA during committee hearings about the bill .
His testimony at last month ’s hearing on the rules and regulations of the UIGEA sums up his position : “ The ban on Internet gambling infringes upon two freedoms that are important to many Americans : the ability to do with their money as they see fit , and the freedom from government interference with the Internet . ”
Earlier this week , he took time from his schedule to talk with CardPlayer.com about the UIGEA .
Card Player :
You are known as a man who is fighting the erosions of personal freedoms in America .
Tell me your thoughts on the UIGEA and how it impedes personal freedoms .
Ron Paul :
Well , I object to regulating the Internet in any way .
I want the Internet to be free of government regulation and free of taxation , so that principal is very important for me .
I think the whole idea of the UIGEA is to intrude upon that using government regulations .
Of course , I also defend the right of individuals to spend their money as they choose .
I personally do n’t engage in gambling , but I recognize that some people enjoy and like it and can handle it , and they ought to have the right to do it .
If they take risks , it should be their own risks and nobody else ’s .
So , for those two reasons I strongly object to the way the law is written now , that this is to be regulated .
I ’ve taken the position that the federal government ought to have their hands off , completely .
CP : What kind of precedent does the UIGEA set as far as government regulation , Internet , and beyond ?
RP : I think it opens up the door , because the motivation there , they claim , is to keep people from gambling .
They do n’t like the personal activities that people engage in , but who knows , there may be different factions who do n’t like competition or other motivations that are involved .
Anyway , they gather up coalitions ; there may be some groups who want protection and other groups want to tell us how to spend our money .
Other groups like the idea that the government has more control over the Internet because the more control they have , the more likely it is that they ’re going to start taxing the Internet .
CP : What groups do you think would like to see more control of the Internet ?
RP : I think the conservatives who are careless about protecting civil liberties and liberals who might say that they want more control of it for tax purposes .
Just as coalitions are built for other reasons , I think you ’ll get those types who will argue the case that the government needs to manage the Internet .
CP : Why have you taken up the fight against the UIGEA ?
Is it mainly because of the personal freedom issue ?
RP : To me , it ’s been more the personal freedom issue .
The Internet , to me , is too valuable .
It ’s such an opportunity to compete with other sources of spreading information around the world .
When you look at what major media can do to control political thoughts , the Internet is a tremendous asset .
I think that is a really important issue .
It just happens that this is the issue that is being discussed right now , and they have chosen to use it to open the doors for further regulation .
If they could use that principle now , it will be used for other reasons .
It might be for some religious beliefs that may come across as rather bizarre and they might start regulating that , or political beliefs .
I think it just opens up Pandora ’s Box .
CP : How could a law so sweeping like this find its way on a completely unrelated “ must pass ” bill and make it through without any significant debate ?
RP : Well , I think that ’s the way this whole system works .
We ’ve fought that for a long time , but it finally got stuck on .
Of course , right now , we have on our side of the fight the chairman of the financial services committee , Barney Frank , and he and I have been working together , so hopefully we can reverse some of this , but I think we have to be constantly vigilant , because if you win one fight , they ’ll come back again and try to get you in a different way .
CP : How does the system need to change in order for this not to happen again ?
RP : You probably would have to change the Congress .
You would have to change the attitudes about the majority of American people .
Right now , the people in Congress understand only power and reelection and lobbying and special interest groups , and if they get lobbied for certain reasons and think it ’s in their interests to vote a certain way for reelection , they do .
We would have to change attitudes around the country and have people agitating for the right thing to do , and that ’s a big job , and it involves a lot of education and spreading of information .
CP : What should be done about Internet gambling in America ?
RP : I think we should just take a hands - off position .
I do n’t think the government should be involved in any way at all .
If I take a personal viewpoint that gambling is bad and I do n’t like it , the way I should attack that is that I personally should avoid doing it and teach my kids the way I think they should act .
But I do n’t want the government coming in and doing this .
CP : Not even at a state level ?
RP : Well , at a state level there are no prohibitions to [ regulate ] it .
If I were a state legislator , I would probably argue against just about all that regulation , and taxing , as well .
But as a federal official , I have to no authority to prohibit states from being involved .
CP : Where do you think the issue of online gambling and the UIGEA falls as far as Congressional priorities for your colleagues ?
RP : I think pretty low .
I do n’t hear too much talk about it .
I think right now they ’re more interested in figuring out how many hundreds of billions of dollars they ’re going to send over to fight the war in Iraq .
CP : You have n’t co-signed onto Rep. Robert Wexler ’s bill that would define certain games , including poker , as games of skill , which would essentially remove them from the “ gambling ” category .
What do you think of Mr. Wexler ’s bill , and why have n’t you singed onto it ?
RP : I have to admit , I do n’t know enough about it to discuss it and whether there ’s something minor in there that I object to and that ’s why my staff has n’t brought it to me .
I really do n’t know , but if it would improve the situation , I am probably a supporter of it .
But I have n’t taken a position on it .
CP : What ’s the status for your candidacy for president ?
RP : Well , technically it still exists and we still campaign and we still go around the counties where the primaries have n’t yet occurred , and we still get a lot of support and a lot of enthusiasm .
We ’ve gotten a lot of enthusiasm because of the book that just came out , The Revolution : A Manifesto , and wherever we go , we get a lot of attention because American people are still very frustrated with the attack on economic liberties and our personal liberties and what ’s going on with foreign policy with this perpetual war we have in the Middle East .
CP : If asked , would you accept the VP nomination ?
RP : Probably not , but I ’m quite certain I wo n’t be asked .
That ’s not going to happen , because [ John ] McCain ’s views and mine coincide hardly at all .
He ’s taken positions that are much closer to the Democratic party ’s , and he ’s certainly not a stickler for the Constitution like I am .
Republicans can see how John McCain ’s 100 years comments ( remember , he said it repeatedly ) can be made into an albatross around his neck .
So they ’re going for the full court press .
Here ’s a press release just out from the head of the NRCC , the Republican House campaign committee ( one among many over the last couple days ) …
Chairman Cole Comments on Issuance of False Democratic Talking Points Despite Being Widely Discredited , Democrats Level False â 100 Yearsâ Accusation at Senator John McCain in Desperate Election Year Ploy Washingtonâ  Today , Chairman Tom Cole made the following statement in regards to the dissemination of talking points issued by the House Democratic Caucus in advance of Gen.
Petraeusâ report before Congress , which included a statement falsely accusing Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) of âpromisingâ  100 years of war in Iraq : â With a long and protracted primary battle brewing in the presidential contest , Democrats are justifiably worried that a John McCain candidacy could hurt their chances from the top of the ticket on down .
Unfortunately for the American people , when the facts donât meet the political goals of some Democratic leaders in the House , they resort to desperate tactics such as undermining the testimony of a widely regarded military General or distorting the words of the Republican presidential nominee .
Intentionally disseminating falsehoods as âtalking pointsâ in order to stem the perceived political fallout of positive news coming out of Iraq , just goes show how worried Democrats are about the upcoming elections.â 
Note what he says below at .20 seconds .
And then again at 1:20 when he says 1000 or 10,000 years is okay .
Here ’s why Republicans are scared to death of this .
No one wants to be in Iraq 100 years from now , even if McCain stipulates to the fantasy that Iraqis will be happy having us occupy their country forever and that the place will become like Finland .
And none of our soldiers will ever get killed there and it wo n’t cost any money .
If that ’s the explanation for why we should n’t be concerned that he ’s happy to stay in Iraq for a century , that just tells people that McCain is living in a fantasy world .
They need to stop people from talking about it at all because their explanation for what he meant is at least as bad as what he really said .

The rhetoric surrounding George W. Bush ’s economic stimulus package , as boastfully “ bi-partisan ” as it is ( we are , after all , in an election year ) , indicates a complete lack of comprehension of the difference between this ‘ national ’ economy and the ‘ people ’s ’ economy , and the extent of the gap between the two .
The unveiling of his plan was classic Bush : state something ambiguous about a $ 140 billion adrenaline shot , then have your cronies act as wingmen .
Hence , at last Friday ’s press conference , Treasury Secretary and former Goldman Sachs CEO , Hank Paulson was left fending off uncomfortable questions like : would the plan help “ elderly people on fixed incomes ? ”
His answer : “ The Christmas season has come and gone . ”
The national economy , as measured by large scale figures simply does not represent individual citizens ’ economic circumstances .
That ’s why debate over whether we are in a recession or not misses the point of everyday financial realities for most of the population .
According to the standard definition of recession ( two quarters or more of a decline in GDP ) , we ’re not there .
In which case , Bush and Paulson are technically right in saying the economy is simply ‘ slow ’ .
But , that ’s been far from the case if we consider the people ’s economy ( the people – as in all the American citizens who do n’t fall into that upper percent of the nation ’s wealth bracket ) .
And very little in the President ’s , or in most of the presidential candidates ’ plans , will change this .

JOEL TICKNER is trying to build a greener future one molecule at a time .
Dr. Tickner directs the chemicals science and policy program at the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production at the University of Massachusetts , Lowell .
The center researches and promotes environmentally sound chemicals policy and production .
When he ’s not teaching , Dr. Tickner may be darting off to Washington , New York , Montreal and cities in Europe to speak with legislators , regulators and executives about making safer , more competitive products .
He also works with chemists in the industry and at Lowell to help them think about designing environmentally benign chemicals .
“ We ’re at a turning point , ” Dr. Tickner said .
“ Companies and states are taking leadership where the federal government is n’t . ”
He spoke to a reporter before flying to Pittsburgh to speak to executives at Bayer ’s United States headquarters about European and American chemicals policies .
“ It ’s not about banning chemicals one by one , but about thinking more holistically about how we use chemicals in the design process itself . ”
This approach is the core of green chemistry , which tries to eliminate waste , use renewable or environmentally benign materials and avoid relying on toxic reagents and solvents when designing chemical products .
WINSTON - SALEM , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , trying to quell a political firestorm that has roiled his presidential campaign , strongly denounced his former pastor on Tuesday and called his racially charged comments “ appalling . ”
The controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright has been a major stumbling block for the Illinois senator , who is leading New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton in the state - by - state contest for the party ’s nomination for the November election .
Obama was forced to address the issue after Wright spoke on Monday at the National Press Club in Washington , where he repeated earlier suggestions that the United States deserved some blame for the September 11 attacks and that the government had had a hand in spreading AIDS to blacks .
“ I want to be very clear that , moving forward , Rev . Wright does not speak for me , he does not speak for our campaign , ” Obama told reporters as he campaigned for the North Carolina vote against Clinton next Tuesday .
“ I cannot prevent him from continuing to make these outrageous remarks , but what I do want him to be very clear about ... is that when I say I find these comments appalling , I mean it .
It contradicts everything that I ’m about and who I am . ”
Wright ’s comments have undercut the campaign of Obama , the son of a white mother and a black father who has based his presidential candidacy on a promise to unite the country after years of sharp political and racial divisions .
Wright had also questioned Obama ’s honesty , saying he had been pandering to voters when he earlier denounced the pastor ’s words .
“ If Senator Obama did not say what he said , he would never get elected , ” Wright said .
ENOUGH
Obama , unsmiling and choosing his words carefully , said : “ At a certain point if what somebody says contradicts what you believe so fundamentally and then he questions whether or not you believe it -- in front of the National Press Club -- then that ’s enough .

“ That ’s a show of disrespect to me .
It is also , I think , an insult to what we ’ve been trying to do in this campaign , ” he added .
“ Whatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed as a consequence of this . ”
Wright , asked on Monday about a speech in which he asserted the September 11 attacks were retaliation for U.S. foreign policy , said : “ You can not do terrorism on other people and not expect it to come back to you . ”
Slideshow ( 11 images )
Asked about another sermon in which he suggested the U.S. government created the AIDS virus to kill black people , Wright said : “ Based on what has happened to Africans in this country , I believe our government is capable of doing anything . ”
Wright , who presided over Obama ’s wedding and baptized his children , is now semi-retired from Chicago ’s Trinity United Church of Christ .
“ The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago , ” Obama said .
“ His comments were not only divisive and destructive but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate . ”
Obama said he liked the church ’s new pastor and was still a member .
Obama has denounced Wright before and is now adapting his campaign to reintroduce himself to working - class voters who handed wins to Clinton in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Matthew Wilson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas said the strong comments came late .
“ A denunciation at this stage appears to be politically motivated because Rev. Wright did n’t say anything yesterday that he has n’t been saying for 30 years , ” Wilson said .
Of course , memories are short .
In 1997 President Bill Clinton announced , with great fanfare , that he intended “ to lead the American people in a great and unprecedented [ if he did say so himself ] conversation about race . ”
That conversation quickly went nowhere .
And just as well .
The last thing we need now is a heated national conversation about race .
What we need instead are sober , results - oriented debates about economics , social mobility , education , family policy and the like  focused especially on how to help those who are struggling .
Such policy debates can lead to real change  even “ change we can believe in . ”
“ National conversations ” tend to be pointless and result - less .
Or worse .
Especially when they ’re about race .
In 1969 , Pat Moynihan , then serving on Richard Nixon ’s White House staff , wrote Nixon a memo explaining that “ the issue of race could benefit from a period of ‘ benign neglect . ’
The subject has been too much talked about .
...
We may need a period in which Negro progress continues and racial rhetoric fades . ”
Moynihan , who was reacting against the wild escalation of racial rhetoric on all sides , was unfairly pilloried when the memo was leaked in 1970 .
But he was right then , and his argument is right now .
Racial progress has in fact continued in America .
A new national conversation about race is n’t necessary to end what Obama calls the “ racial stalemate we ’ve been stuck in for years ”  because we ’re not stuck in such a stalemate .
In fact , as Obama himself suggests in the same speech , younger Americans are n’t stalemated .
They come far closer than their grandparents and parents to routinely obeying Martin Luther King ’s injunction to judge one another by the content of our character , not the color of our skin .
Over the last several decades , we ’ve done pretty well in overcoming racial barriers and prejudice .
Problems remain .
But we wo n’t make progress if we now have to endure a din of race talk that will do more to divide us than to unite us , and more to confuse than to clarify .
Luckily , Obama is n’t really interested in getting enmeshed in a national conversation on race .
He had avoided race talk before the Reverend Wright controversy erupted .
And despite the speech ’s catnip of a promised conversation on race tossed to eager commentators , it ’s clear he ’s more than willing to avoid it from now on .
This is all for the best .
With respect to having a national conversation on race , my recommendation is : Let ’s not , and say we did .

In last week ’s column , I cited a report that Senator Obama had attended services at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago on July 22 , 2007 .
The Obama campaign has provided information showing that Senator Obama did not attend Trinity that day .
I regret the error .
In an ambitious move , a Californian utility plans to create a massive , distributed “ powerplant ” by installing a total of 2 square miles of solar cells on the roofs of businesses .
Southern California Edison plans to install 250 megawatts ’ worth of solar power , generating enough electricity to power 162,000 homes .
Green Wombat reports :
It ’s a potentially game - changing move , one that could lower the cost of solar cells as manufacturers ramp up production to meet the utility ’s schedule of installing a megawatt - a- week of arrays until it reaches the 250 - megawatt target .
That alone is more than United States ’ entire production of solar cells in 2006 and will generate as much electricity as a small coal - fired power plant , albeit with no greenhouse gas emissions .
The $ 875 million initiative also marks the first big foray into so - called distributed energy by a major utility .
Instead of building a centralized power station and the expensive transmission system needed to transmit electricity to the power grid , Edison will connect clusters of solar arrays into existing neighborhood circuits .
A significant hurdle for the massive megawatt solar power plants planned for California ’s Mojave Desert is the need in some cases to build multi billion - dollar transmission systems through environmentally sensitive lands to bring the electricity to coastal metropolises .
The initiative will work like this : Edison will lease the warehouse rooftop space from building owners in Riverside and San Bernardino counties .
The utility will outsource the installation , and retain ownership of the solar cells .
This plan will be exciting if it is achieved , and it will become a model for other utilities to follow .

LOS ANGELES , May 11 , 2008 -- Record prices are prompting oil prospectors to renew interest in drilling in Los Angeles , where urban sprawl , environmental opponents and decades of production make for one of the world 's toughest oil fields .
" We 're more active than ever , " says Tim Marquez , CEO and founder of Venoco , which is running wells and reviving old ones in the city and elsewhere in California .
" That increase in oil prices has caused expansion of exploration and production throughout the country and especially in California , " says Steve Rusch , vice president of a Texas oil company that does extensive drilling in and around Los Angeles .
" There 's a huge incentive . "
Oil has been produced in Los Angeles since the early 1900s , directly offshore as well as along city streets .
To meet the demands of environmental opponents and gain needed permits , oil drillers have come up with a variety of methods to disguise oil wells so that most passersby do n't even know oil drilling is going on .
Among the sites : on the campus of Beverly Hills High School , where students have decorated the panels that hide drilling from public view , and along Pico Street in one of L.A. 's busiest areas , where Rusch 's company has hidden its rigs and drills behind facades that appear to be 14 - story buildings .
At Long Beach , whose harbor adjoins Los Angeles ' harbor , more than 2,000 wells are working on a small island immediately offshore , the production all hidden behind what looks like a condominium building .
The wells are drilled diagonally for miles out to sea .
" It 's built to resemble a resort island ( and ) blend in with the surroundings , " says Richard Kline , vice president of Occidental Petroleum Corp. , one of the big operators in Southern California and owner of the disguised harbor site .
California is the nation 's biggest consumer of gasoline and is fourth among oil - producing states behind Texas , Alaska and Louisiana , according to the state 's division of oil , gas and geothermal resources .
Higher prices have prompted oil companies to seek permits to reopen wells where drilling had been halted when lower prices made the expensive and difficult drilling not worth pursuing , says Hal Bopp , California 's oil and gas supervisor .
Most of the new activity involves old abandoned or capped wells because it is so difficult to obtain permits to start new wells in dense urban areas , he said .
That difficulty , he says , means California has n't seen the major oil boom that Texas and Rocky Mountain states are seeing as world oil prices top $ 120 a barrel .
Other factors limiting California production , he said , are the lower - grade nature of the crude found here , and the fact the oil operations here are mature and , frequently , under concrete .
After decades of producing the easy - to - obtain oil , Bopp said , drillers now must inject water or steam into the wells to bring up remaining oil .
Still , he says , " There 's still a lot of oil in the L.A. Basin — there 's a lot of oil . "
There are 3,164 wells in production in Los Angeles County , according to the state .
Annual production has been around 27 million barrels for several years , down from the peak in 1969 of more than 133 million barrels .
Production showed a slight increase in 2007 , Bopp said .
And in the first four months of 2008 , state applications to renew work on existing wells in the Los Angeles area total 129 , compared with 50 at the same point in 2007 , according to documents published by the state oil office .
High prices make drilling economical where it was n't before , and that is attracting new players .
In the L.A. area , Bopp says , there are at least a couple thousand wells still plugged with cement that have the potential to be reopened without much difficulty .
Rusch 's company , Plains Exploration & Production , known as PXP , hopes to tap a new oil field under Culver City , which is surrounded by Los Angeles , with slant drilling from nearby Baldwin Hills .
It is seeking government approval .
PXP agreed last month to set a date to prematurely end drilling off the coast at Santa Barbara in exchange for approval to drill new undersea reserves with sophisticated slanted drilling operations farther offshore .
The company is donating nearly 4,000 acres of coastal property for public parkland in a deal with environmentalists who agreed to drop opposition to the company 's exploration .
" We 've been able to double our production in the last 15 years , " Rusch says .
" As prices go higher , we drill deeper .
The play over Culver City becomes accessible .
I think we 're all hopeful there 's potential .
And there 's more out there we do n't know about today . "
You ’ve heard all the arguments about why you should ride your bike :
It reduces auto traffic , shrinks your carbon footprint , decreases your transportation costs , and gives you killer calves .
But there ’s one niggling problem : theft .
It seems no matter how many locks , cables , and snakes you use , at one point or another , you ’re likely to return to your bike , to find one lone orphaned tire , the rest long gone .
Whether or not this has been your experience , it ’s a perception that many people hold , and it ’s a factor in holding back bike riding from being more widely used mode of transport .
What to do ?
Enter the Bike Tree .
These devices address several issues at once , but let me start with the primary : it stores your bikes high up in the air , for all the world to see , and thieves to be foiled , looking like , yes , a tree made of bikes .
How does it work ?
Simply .
You use a smart card that identifies you , and a bike hook glides down .
Place your front tire in there , and up the bike rolls until it ’s securely stored above , with a dome over the top to keep it dry .
What if you need an indoor location , and the ceiling is too short for such a device ?
They also have another one , that has a more elaborate locking system .
Who would use this ?
Individual commuters , bike sharing services and people who are already good about using trains rather then their car , but there ’s the few miles between their house and the station .
Looking at the site , an additional use comes to mind : festivals .
Bike
Tree claims they can be assembled and moved in 3 - 6 hours , making them great temporary storage facilities .
And , without a cluster of bikes on the ground , they take up less space , and the base could , for those inclined , serve as a place to sit .
My one question is , they do n’t show it full of bikes , what happens if the handlebars of adjacent bikes get ensnared ?
That said , the site says it has n’t been updated since 2004 , and as of press time , I was n’t able to find out if they are a functional company at this point .
Why do n’t you drop them a line and find out for yourself ?
And if they do n’t , let this be an inspiration for other creative solutions to life in the modern world .
What other solutions like this do you see to positively affecting urban life ?

Free our Bills !
The Nice Polite Campaign to Gently Encourage Parliament to Publish Bills in a 21st Century Way , Please .
Now .
What the… ?
Writing , discussing and voting on bills is what we employ our MPs to do .
If enough MPs vote on bills they become the law , meaning you or I can get locked up if they pass a bad one .
What a Bill contains is hugely more important than what an MP says , how they look , or what expenses they claim .
The problem , to put it simply , is that the way in which Bills are currently published out is completely incompatible with the Internet era .
As a consequence few people ever get to find out what a Bill says before it becomes law and binds us all .
Bills are currently buried within the Parliamentary website , published in a hopelessly old fashioned way that makes them difficult to find , difficult to read and impossible to do anything clever with .
Update !
Our supporters have been asking MPs to sign an Early Day Motion to support the campaign , and over 100 MPs have signed up so far .
Sign up to our campaign and we 'll tell you whether your MP has signed .
We need you !
This campaign can only succeed if normal internet users like you lend a hand .
Please sign up and we 'll send you easy tasks ( like emailing your MP , or coming up with some ideas ) .

Why ?
Being the people who run TheyWorkForYou we spend lots of our time taking rubbish , broken information from Parliament and fixing it up so that it makes a nice , usable site so you can find out whether your MP is actually working for you or not .
Lots of people seem to like it , nearly 2 million came to visit last year .
It ’s time for Parliament to improve its act and start publishing these vital documents properly in the first place .
Quite apart from the fact that we ’re a tiny charity without many resources to fix this information , you ’re paying for them to produce it in a uselessly old fashioned way .
Unless Parliament produces better bills :
You ca n’t get an email alert to tell you when a bill mentions something you might be interested in .
to tell you when a bill mentions something you might be interested in .
You ca n’t find out what amendments your own MP is asking for , or voting on .
is asking for , or voting on .
You ca n’t learn , or help other people learn , about the process by annotating them to explain what they ’re really going on about for everyone else .
to explain what they ’re really going on about for everyone else .
MPs and their staff can’t receive services that would help them notice when they were being asked to vote on dumb or dubious things .
.
You ca n’t get a rounded view of how useful your MP is if you ca n’t see their involvement with the bill making process .
of how useful your MP is if you ca n’t see their involvement with the bill making process .
And about 12 zillion other things that we ’re not even bright enough to think of yet .
Read our details of the technical changes we want Parliament to make to the way it publishes bills for more .
Wo n’t this disrupt the delicate process of writing bills ?
Nope , the improved publication we ’re talking about has nothing to do with the actual legal contents of bills .
It ’s about how it gets translated into an electronic format once they ’ve finished .
What are your real motives ?
Who does this benefit politically ?
Dammit , we hoped you would n't ask that , and now our secret is blown .
Obviously this campaign benefits Gordon Brown at the expense of Tony Blair .
No , wait a minute , that was last year .
It definitely gives Hillary the edge over Obama though .
No , hang on , that 's over too .
Actually , it is n't partisan at all - that 's what I was trying to say .
mySociety is based on a charity , you see , so even if we wanted to be partisan , it'd be against the law .
And if you 're still suspicious you 'll see that MPs from almost all parties have signed our EDM .
Is n’t this an embarrassingly obscure thing to be campaigning about ?
Ca n’t you campaign about saving puppies or something ?
Hey – you ’re the one who just read all the way down to this point .
Suck it up and sign up , soldier .

They say that he stalled on the project while nurturing his own related idea , which ultimately became a site called Thefacebook.com .
They sued Mr. Zuckerberg in Federal District Court in Boston .
Facebook countersued in California , accusing ConnectU of unfair business practices .
A federal judge in California ordered the parties into mediation last year .
The person briefed on the settlement negotiations , who declined to be identified because the deal was not yet completed , said motions to dismiss the case against Facebook were expected “ within weeks . ”
The case has caused public - relations problems for Facebook , one of the most popular social networking sites with 69 million users .
It threatened to cause financial problems as well .
Outside investments have valued the company at $ 15 billion , and it is expected to sell shares to the public , perhaps as soon as next year .
“ You ca n’t do that sort of thing if you have major liability hanging over your head , ” said Paul Kedrosky , a technology venture capitalist and author of the blog Infectious Greed .
Mr. Kedrosky said that regardless of which side was right in the legal dispute , Facebook needed to get the situation resolved sooner rather than later .
In part , he said , that is because Facebook does not want to miss the chance at a lucrative payday in the public markets or through an acquisition .
DNC leader Howard Dean : John McCain is a ' flawed ' candidate

Former Vermont governor and current Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean sits down with CNN's Wolf Blitzer to discuss the current pool of presidential candidates .
While Dean does n't express his personal preference for a particular Democratic candidate , leaving the decision in the hands of the voting public , he does assail Senator John McCain .
" John McCain is a flawed candidate , " Dean says of the presumptive GOP nominee .
" Here 's a guy who is a typical situational ethicist .
He runs on his integrity , but he does n't seem to have any . "
Dean 's accusations against McCain include getting on the Ohio ballot under false pretenses ( his expected acceptance of public campaign funds over private contributions ) and a connection with , and refusal to " denounce and reject , " right - wing televangelist John Hagee .
" I do n't think , " Dean continues , " people want four more years of what essentially is George Bush . "
More of the exchange , available to view below , was broadcast on CNN's Late Edition on March 2 , 2008 .
This is an example of when it is good to not listen to critics .

Following last week ’s study suggesting that new generation antidepressants are n’t all they ’re cracked up to be , a special report in this week ’s BMJ asks do we really know the truth about antidepressants ?
Or statins ?
Or any other drug on the market ?
Lack of access to data is an ongoing problem in the United States , despite passage of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act ( FDAAA ) of 2007 , which requires clinical trials to be registered in a public database , write Jeanne Lenzer and Shannon Brownlee .
Although it ’s a positive step towards greater transparency , the act may not reduce the likelihood of dangerous or ineffective drugs remaining on the market as much as some people might have hoped , they warn .
For example , not all trials have to be registered and access to full data is also constrained by trade secrecy laws .
To overcome this , researchers often request data under the Freedom of Information Act , but various rules can still prevent full access to underlying results .
Trade secrecy laws , for example , permit companies to withhold all information about drugs that do not win approval for a new indication , even when the drug is already on the market for other indications .
Such data are protected as trade secrets so that drug companies are n’t put at a “ competitive disadvantage ” when other companies , learning of the initial studies , are n’t forced to expend the same “ wasted efforts . ”
This was the case with valdecoxib , a COX 2 inhibitor that failed to gain FDA approval to treat acute pain in 2001 .
As a result , some of the trial information was withdrawn from the FDA website , leaving researchers and the public in the dark about possible side effects .
But it is precisely these failed trials that should be made public , argue the authors .
One suggestion is to make the FDA database available to researchers .
The FDA says that it is far too onerous to put all its material online .
But , as a number of experts have pointed out , the burden on the FDA from future Freedom of Information requests would be lessened if it posted all its data .
Ultimately , redacting clinical information from studies , forcing companies to expend “ wasted efforts , ” and failing to insist that data derived from trial participants be placed in the public domain simply cannot be reconciled with what is in the public interest , write the authors .
Trial participants , as well as patients who take drugs and doctors who prescribe them , deserve nothing less than the assurance that all the news – not just the good news – has been carefully assessed , they conclude .
An editorial , also published in this week ’s BMJ , suggests that before we embrace any treatment as first line , it is prudent to ask whether its efficacy is beyond question .
It also calls for drug regulatory authorities such as the FDA to make their reviews publicly and retrospectively available on the world wide web .

Researchers now have a better view of where carbon dioxide is being emitted thanks to Vulcan , a research project led by Kevin Gurney , an assistant professor at Purdue .
This map shows where CO2 is being emitted in the continental United States in 10 - kilometer grids and combines data from sources including factories , automobiles on highways and power plants .
The map offers more than 100 times the detail of previous inventories of carbon dioxide .
The image displays metric tons of carbon per year per grid in a logarithmic base - 10 scale .
( Purdue University image / Kevin Gurney )
A new , high - resolution , interactive map of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels has found that the emissions are n't all where we thought .
" For example , we 've been attributing too many emissions to the northeastern United States , and it 's looking like the southeastern U.S. is a much larger source than we had estimated previously , " says Kevin Gurney , an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric science at Purdue University and leader of the project .
The maps and system , called Vulcan , show CO2 emissions at more than 100 times more detail than was available before .
Until now , data on carbon dioxide emissions were reported , in the best cases , monthly at the level of an entire state .
The Vulcan model examines CO2 emissions at local levels on an hourly basis .
Researchers say the maps also are more accurate than previous data because they are based on greenhouse gas emissions instead of estimates based on population in areas of the United States .
To create the Vulcan maps , the research team developed a method to extract the CO2 information by transforming data on local air pollution , such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide emissions , which are tracked by the Environmental Protection Agency , the U.S. Department of Energy and other governmental agencies .
" These pollutants are important to determine the ozone levels and air quality in major cities , and they are tracked on an hourly basis , " Gurney says .
" We 've been able to leverage that data to determine the levels of CO2 being produced . "
Carbon dioxide is the most important human - produced gas contributing to global climate change .
The United States accounts for about 25 percent of global CO2 emissions .
The increased detail and accuracy of Vulcan will help lawmakers create policies to reduce CO2 emissions while also increasing scientists ' understanding of the sources and fate of carbon dioxide , researchers say .
" Before now the only thing policy - makers could do was take a big blunt tool and bang the U.S. economy with it , " Gurney says .
" Now we have more quantifiable information about what is happening in neighborhoods , on roads and in industrial areas , and track the CO2 by the hour .
This offers policy - makers something akin to a scalpel instead . "
Gurney says the inventory system , which is named for the Roman god of fire , quantifies all of the CO2 that results from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline .
It also tracks the hourly outputs at the level of factories , power plants , roadways , neighborhoods and commercial districts .
A preliminary analysis of the Vulcan data suggests that previous maps of U.S. fossil fuel emissions were inadequate for current scientific and policy - making needs , Gurney says .
" When you compare the old inventories to Vulcan , the new data show atmospheric CO2 differences that are as large as five parts per million in some U.S. regions in the late winter , " he says .
" The levels in the global atmosphere only rise one and a half part per million every year , so this is the equivalent of three years of global emissions in the atmosphere that is n't where we thought it was .
This will be important for policy - makers and is enormous from a scientific point of view .
It 's shocking . "
Gurney says this change is n't only due to people moving to the southeast , but also because of the approximations of previous estimates .
James Hansen , director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , says Vulcan provides a " check " to judge the accuracy of existing satellite data .
" The high - resolution map from Vulcan also provides a picture of emission sources in a way that the public and policy - makers can understand , which may be helpful in discussing what we will do about the climate problem , " Hansen says .
The three - year project , which was funded by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy under the North American Carbon Program , involved researchers from Purdue University , Colorado State University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Robert Andres , a senior researcher with the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory who is not affiliated with the project , says Vulcan will provide scientists with many insights into the global carbon cycle and climate change .
" Vulcan will be revolutionary in carbon cycle research , " he says .
" It is the next generation in our understanding of fossil fuel emissions .
The implications for climate science , carbon trading and climate change mitigation work are tremendous . "
To extract the CO2 information from the data on other pollutants , research scientists in the Office of Information Technology at Purdue developed a computational system to apply Gurney 's methods to existing information .
Once the data was converted to determine the CO2 emissions , it was combined with geographic information systems ( GIS ) data to layer the emissions onto roads and other infrastructure at the Earth 's surface .
The current emissions are based on information from 2002 , but the Vulcan system will soon expand to more recent years .
Gerry McCartney , vice president for information technology and chief information officer at Purdue , says the digital data conversion developed by Gurney and IT research scientists at Purdue will advance both climate science and information technology .
" This was an important project that required a massive amount of data and a large number of people with highly technical skills , " McCartney says .
" Vulcan is a part of a larger vision for tracking greenhouse gas emissions around the world , eventually even in real time , and we are pleased that Purdue possesses the resources and technical ability to take on a project of this scale . "
Vulcan is expected to complement NASA 's planned December 2008 launch of the Orbital Carbon Observatory satellite , which will measure the concentration of CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere .
" Our understanding of atmospheric CO2 we gain from Vulcan and from NASA 's satellite will be enhanced tremendously by combining them , " Gurney says .
" It 's like the old photographs found in stereoscopes or View - Masters .
Each image is nice , but when you put them together you achieve a 3 - D view that gives you much more information . "
The Vulcan data is available for anyone to download from the Web site at www.eas.purdue.edu/carbon/vulcan .
Smaller summary data sets that offer a slice of the data and are easier to download also are available for non-scientists on the Vulcan Web site .
These can be broken down into emission categories , such as industrial , residential , transportation , power producers , by fuel type , and are available by state , county , or cells as small as six miles ( 10 kilometers ) across .
A video of the maps and simulations of the atmospheric fate of fossil fuel CO2 also can be viewed on YouTube at www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJpj8UUMTaI .
The animation was created by Bedrich Benes , assistant professor of computer graphics technology and a research scientist in Purdue 's Envision Center for Data Perceptualization , and computer science graduate student Nathan Andrysco .
The animation required a year to produce , and the rendering of the animation ( the video equivalent of printing ) required nine hours to produce the 2,000 images that make up the 60 - second video .
" To do this , we built from scratch a software program that is specifically tailored to visualize greenhouse gases , " Benes says .
Although Vulcan can be used to pinpoint CO2 emissions down to the levels previously unseen , Gurney says the tool should not be used to affix blame .
" Ten years ago there might have been resistance to the notion of examining who is responsible for the CO2 emissions in such a visually detailed way , " Gurney says .
" However , what Vulcan makes utterly clear is that CO2 emissions cannot be exclusively affixed to SUV drivers , manufacturers or large power producers ; everybody is responsible .
We need to look for real solutions , and have a deeper discussion about energy use .
It 's not about politics .
It 's about doing good science and solving the problem , and we can all be a part of that . "

President Bush on Friday defended his emphasis on ethanol to help the nation meet its energy needs even though increased production of the corn - based biofuel has been blamed for contributing to sharp increases in food prices .
“ As you know , I ’m a ethanol person , ” he said , explaining his belief that it can help reduce U.S. dependence on oil .
“ It makes sense for America to be growing energy . ”
The president made his comments during a 20 - minute speech and a rare , lengthy question - and - answer session with employees of a high - tech manufacturer .
On the day the government announced the loss of 20,000 payroll jobs in April , Bush said he recognized the nation was in a difficult period , “ but this economy is going to come on . ”

He also chastised Congress for blocking his initiatives , including a stalled free trade agreement with Colombia , his plan to open Alaska lands and coastal waters to oil and gas exploration , and his proposal to overhaul the government ’s mortgage program .
He also shifted into a reflective mien , saying to a worker in Dallas with whom he was conversing in a demonstration of a videoconferencing system :
“ Tell everybody down there , in about 10 months , I ’m coming home . ”
With that end of his administration in sight , the president ’s remarks brought into focus the flaring issues he faces : the economy , energy costs and , now , food prices .
The president for several years has been promoting the use of ethanol -- which is largely made from corn -- to alleviate the nation ’s shortage of domestically produced energy .

Critics have focused on the new demand for corn as a factor in driving up food prices .
Bush acknowledged that ethanol has contributed to higher food prices , but said it was not the main reason .
He also listed increased energy costs , which affect transportation and fertilizer prices ; drought and other weather - related problems ; and increased demand stemming from greater prosperity in once - poor nations .
He noted that the middle class in India has grown to 350 million -- more than the population of the United States .
Citing the four - month downward employment trend after 52 months of growth , Bush said Friday ’s report was “ a sign that this economy is not as robust as any of us would like it . ”
But , he said , the economic stimulus program , which is just now sending rebates to taxpayers , “ has n’t really kicked in yet . ”
The president , who appeared to be surprised two months ago when told gasoline appeared headed for $ 4 a gallon , said , “ I know you ’re having to pay more at the fuel pump than you want . ”

Blaming Congress for blocking efforts to allow Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling , for example , he said the nation needed to move away from “ an energy policy that basically prohibits America from finding oil in our own land . ”
“ If Congress is truly interested in helping relieve the price of gasoline , ” it would recognize that the country needed to drill for oil and gas in areas that have been off - limits largely for environmental reasons , and would encourage the construction of oil refineries .
Bush spoke at World Wide Technology Inc. , which he had planned to visit in October .
He postponed the visit when he flew instead to Southern California to view wildfire damage .
The company , on the outskirts of St. Louis , provides information technology to the government and private industry , particularly in the telecommunications field .
In 2006 , according to the White House , World Wide became the first minority - owned company with more than $ 2 billion in sales , and it reported sales of more than $ 2.5 billion last year .
In seven years it has added more than 500 employees .

From Missouri , Bush headed to a weekend at his home in Crawford , Texas , where next weekend his daughter Jenna is getting married .
“ I ’ve got a lot on my mind , by the way , ” he said as he finished the speech and invited questions .
“ Getting ready to march down the aisle . ”
As for the approaching end of his presidency , he said that , having lived in the White House 7 1/ 2 years , he found “ the furniture is interesting , but it is like a museum . ”
“ It ’s been a fabulous experience , ” he said -- and singled out welcoming Pope Benedict XVI to the White House last month -- but , he added : “ I guess I ’ll go home and mow the lawn . ”

The F.D.A. sent a warning letter on Monday to Changzhou SPL , the Chinese plant identified as the source of contaminated heparin made by Baxter International in the United States .
It warned that the plant used unclean tanks to make heparin , that it accepted raw materials from an unacceptable vendor and that it had no adequate way to remove impurities .
Heparin is made from the mucous membranes of the intestines of slaughtered pigs that , in China , are often cooked in unregulated family workshops .
The contaminant , identified as oversulfated chondroitin sulfate , a cheaper substance , slipped through the usual testing and was recognized only after more sophisticated tests were used .
The F.D.A. has identified 12 Chinese companies that have supplied contaminated heparin to 11 countries 
Australia , Canada , China , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , New Zealand and the United States .
Deborah Autor , director of compliance at the F.D.A. ’s drug center , said the agency did not know the original source of all the contamination or the points in the supply chain at which it was added .
Officials have discovered heparin lots that included the cheap fake additive manufactured as early as early as 2006 , although a spike in illnesses associated with contaminated heparin began in November and persisted through February , officials said .
Separately , the Government Accountability Office will release a report on Tuesday showing that the F.D.A. would need to spend at least $ 56 million more next year to begin full inspections of foreign plants .
It would need to spend at least $ 15 million annually to inspect China ’s drug plants every two years , which is the domestic standard .
Bush administration officials have acknowledged problems associated with poor inspection of overseas plants and have plans to improve the situation .
But President Bush ’s budget does not provide the F.D.A. with funds to hire more inspectors .
At its present inspection pace , the F.D.A. would need at least 27 years to inspect every foreign medical device plant that exports to the United States , 13 years to check every foreign drug plant and 1,900 years to examine every foreign food plant .
New government statistics prove that allowing advocacy groups and private individuals to challenge existing patents is a remarkably effective means of weeding out the worst of them and pruning back the overly broad .
So , naturally enough , there are corporate and political interests at work in Washington trying to muzzle patent watchdogs before they can do even more good in the public 's behalf .
How 's that for your tax dollars at work ?
From the Electronic Frontier Foundations ' blog :
Since the start of ex parte reexamination in 1981 , there have been over 9,000 requests that the ( Patent and Trademark Office ) revisit issued patents , averaging over 500 annually in recent years .
From 1981 through the end of 2007 , the Office of the Patent Commissioner has granted over 90 percent of these ex parte reexamination requests .
Out of the 8,000 requests that have been granted since the start of ex parte reexamination , 6,060 resulted in a narrowing of claims .
In other words , the PTO grants 92 % of the reexamination requests it receives , and in 3 out of 4 of those cases , the requests are having a substantial effect on the claims .
If only every arcane mechanism within the vast federal bureaucracy operated so efficiently .

Just last week , the EFF 's Patent Busting Project demonstrated anew the value of third - party reexamination opportunities by spearheading an effort that will result in the holder of a questionable gaming patent having to defend it against newfound evidence that plenty of " prior art " predated its issuance , which if true means it never should have seen the light of day .
EFF writes :
Sheldon F. Goldberg was awarded the illegitimate patent for online gaming systems that use tournament - style play , advertising , and real - time updates of ladder - rankings in multi-player games .
Goldberg has used this bogus patent to coerce licensing fees from numerous small businesses .
In the reexamination request , EFF along with Paul Grewal and Brad Waugh of Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder show that the technology covered by the Goldberg patent had been widely disseminated in the public domain for years before Goldberg made his claim .
The Patent Office took quick action on the request , recognizing this substantial new question of patentability less than a month after the request was filed .
Such victories and sterling statistical support aside , groups such as the EFF face being largely written out of the game if patent - reform legislation pending before the Senate passes without amendment .
This " reform " as it stands will protect frivolous patents from the EFF and similar watchdogs by limiting to one year after a patent 's granting the time in which it could be challenged by anyone other than those suffering direct financial harm .
Granted , such a provision would n't stop major gaming companies with their vast resources from challenges a patent such as the one just targeted by EFF .
However , it would strip an important layer of protection from smaller business .
More to the point , however , it would reward the holders of bogus patents and siphon more coin from the pockets of consumers .
Message to lawmakers : Resist the temptation to fix what is n't broken here .

A Look Back at Asian Porn
In 2016 , “ Japanese ” and “ Asian ” were the most searched for categories in adult .
Those with an interest in this genre have been labeled as " Asiaphiles " and the category has a rich history .
What is now considered Asian pornography first emerged in the form of erotic art ( shunga in Japanese ) that was painted on woodblocks .
These hand - drawn paintings were popular among the upper classes and depicted exaggerated genitalia and sexual acts .
Consider it medieval porn magazines for the elite !
A discreet sexual lifestyle is something that 's common among the Asian culture , but they ’re actually quite kinky behind closed doors .
This aspect presents itself in Asian movies with the performers often acting like they are n’t interested in sex , but once things get started they come out of their shell and show how horny they really are !
When it comes to Japanese porn most fans know that it 's usually censored .
This is due to a law in Japan that states that any sex - based adult content must censor the performers ’ genitals , and up until the mid-1990s , this included the depiction of pubic hair and any anal penetration .
This type of censoring also applies to animated porn , like hentai and manga .
However , there are exceptions and we ’ll always point out sites that provide uncensored content so you can enjoy your Asian flicks without the pixels .
Some sub - niches include bukkake , kinbaku - bi ( a Japanese form of bondage ) , gokkun ( cum swallowing ) and omorashi ( pissing ) .

Building off contemporary folk wisdom , Englishman Edward Jenner tested vaccination against smallpox on various patients .
Note the bovine observer at the door .
Courtesy Science Photo Library __1796 : __Edward Jenner inoculates a boy with cowpox .
After the lad recovers from the infection , Jenner inoculates him with smallpox , but the boy remains healthy .
Vaccination is born .
Before Jenner , smallpox was a massive scourge and a leading cause of death , especially among children .
Those whom it did n't kill it disfigured with pockmarked faces .
Some European families adopted the Turkish practice of inoculating their children with low doses of smallpox in hopes of building up their immunity to the disease .
This was popularized in England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , who had her own child inoculated .
The Royal family , freshly arrived from the Kingdom of Hanover in Germany , inoculated two of the Princess of Wales ' children in 1723 to secure the succession .
( Ironically , the Hanovers had come to the throne of Great Britain because so many Stuart and Orange heirs had succumbed to smallpox . )
But the process was risky .
Jenner had heard the folk wisdom that milkmaids and others who contracted the mild and harmless cowpox through their proximity to cattle did not fall victim to the deadly smallpox .
He inoculated his year - and - a - half - old son in 1789 with swine pox ( a related pig disease ) and then smallpox .
The boy did not contract smallpox .
The dramatic 1796 experiment used fluid taken from a cowpox sore on milkmaid Sarah Nelmes .
The experimental subject was 8 - year - old James Phipps , who did not get smallpox despite Jenner 's repeated attempts to infect him starting July 1 .
Ethicists debate whether such an experiment would be at all possible today .
Jenner carried out further experiments on patients and was likewise unable to infect them with smallpox if he had vaccinated them or they had contracted cowpox naturally .
He published the results of 23 cases in a 1798 monograph , An inquiry into the causes and effects of the Variolae Vaccinae , a disease discovered in some of the western counties of England , particularly Gloucestershire , and known by the name of the cow - pox .
Jenner wrote several revisions of this work as he added cases , and other researchers soon replicated his work .
He called the process vaccination after the Latin word for cow , vacca .
He also introduced the word virus .
Vaccination caught on quickly , but more than a century passed before scientists isolated and understood the viruses involved .
After a global vaccination campaign , the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1979 .

CINCINNATI - A man ordered by a judge to make sure his daughter hit the books has found himself in jail because she failed to earn a high school equivalency diploma .
Brian Gegner , of Fairfield , was sentenced last week to 180 days in jail for contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor .
He was ordered months ago to make sure his 18 - year - old daughter Brittany Gegner , who has a history of truancy , received her GED - something that has n't happened yet .
Brittany Gegner , who said Monday that she plans to take a required GED test this month , said her father should n't be blamed for her failure because she has been living with her mother .
" It was my wrongdoing , not his , " said Brittany Gegner , whose fiance and 18 - month - old daughter also live at her mother 's home in nearby Hamilton .
" He should n't have to go to jail for something I did . "
Her mother agrees .
" Brittany is almost 19 years old now and I think it 's unfair to put her father in jail , " said Shana Roach .
" She 's an adult now , and it 's not right to rip an innocent man from his home . "
Butler County Juvenile Court administrator Rob Clevenger Jr. said Monday that the court still has jurisdiction in the case because Brittany Gegner was a juvenile when the truancy problems began and when the charge against Brian Gegner was filed in 2007 .
A hearing on a motion filed by Brian Gegner 's attorney to reconsider the sentence is scheduled for Friday .
Messages seeking comment were not returned Monday at the offices of defense attorney Tamara Sack and the Butler County prosecutor .
Brian Gegner 's wife , Stephanie Gegner , said she and her husband are afraid he will lose his job if he remains in jail .
She said they tried to keep his daughter in school .
" You 'd take her to school and she 'd go out the other door , " Stephanie Gegner said .

Ayo claims that all blacks have been “ rented ” at some time , placed in the role of token at work or in a social setting , or drafted to represent the entire race with an opinion on a current race - related topic .
Whites tend to be the renters , employing blacks in particular social situations to demonstrate their awareness of race issues or to deflect charges of racism .
Ayo ’s pseudo - guidebook for renters and rentals offers a range of social issues and contact , from touching a black person ’s skin or hair to racial profiling from police or coworkers .
She offers quizzes for readers to determine if they have inadvertently been in the position of renter or rental .

8. How - To Become a Schizophrenic
The author has been diagnosed as schizophrenic , and part of the book is his own story , written in the form of a spellbinding novelette similar to I Never Promised You a Rose Garden .
But more than that , the author also utilizes the ideas of Harry Stack Sullivan , Theodore Lidz , Gregory Bateson , R.D. Scott and P.L. Ashworth , W. Ronald D. Fairbairn , Anton Boisen and others — as well as his own experiences — to construct a solid theory which explains how and why he and many other people enter a state of mind called “ schizophrenic . ”
Finally , Modrow tackles the entire medical model with its genetic and biochemical theories , its drugs , and various brain scan studies purporting to prove that schizophrenia is a brain disease , explaining why this is such a popular explanation for emotional distress , but why the theory is very likely false .

Well tough shit , i am the poor vurnable female that can get away with anything i do , and you are the big strong manly man that 's supposed to take all the shit i throw at you whitout blinking , because that 's what guys are for , it 's not like you have feelings or anything . "
Yes , EVERY female has a choice !
That 's as obvious that the sky is blue !
If a female meets a guy and then later simply looses interest in him , fine !
Things like that happens all the time !
only a sad ant pathetic guy refuses to let his ex go , what 's the meaning of a relationship if not both of them are happy ?
What i DESPISE about this girl , is she 's " atleast in the way i see this comic " is just taking a good nice and considerate guy and undermine his confidence and using him !
Yes i said it , SHE'S using him !
It 's one thing if a couple parts because of things they did not forsee or if they simply grew apart , this wench frikking PLANS and she frikking admits it to dump this guy the very microsecond her " destined bad boy " appears !
In short , do n't start a relationship with a guy if you are 100 % certain that you will dump him later and by doing that it will break his heart !
NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Entering Nairobi ’s fetid slums the senses are first assaulted by a gagging stench and the sight of garbage everywhere , some even hanging from trees or smoldering in acrid fires .
The city government does not recognize the “ informal settlements ” where more than 60 percent of the population live , so no services are provided and no garbage collected .
The result is frighteningly unsanitary conditions .
Rubbish , “ flying toilets ” -- excrement in plastic bags -- and even aborted fetuses pile up in dumps along the muddy tracks or find their way into the rivers , where children play along the banks .
Garbage pollutes the air and seeps into ground water , or is picked over by pigs and other farm animals , its toxins entering the food chain and causing intestinal diseases .
Now a “ community cooker ” project in Africa ’s biggest slum , Kibera , offers a way not only of getting rid of garbage , but of creating work for unemployed youths , and providing hot water and cooking facilities .
The people developing the project , a Nairobi architectural practice , the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) and a Kenyan non-governmental organization , hope it can be a prototype for cookers all over Africa .
The cooker , dreamed up by Kenyan architect Jim Archer , has taken eight years to develop and is still overcoming design problems .
“ My thinking was how do we get rid of the rubbish and ... how can we induce people to pick it up .
Then I thought , well if we can convert it to heat on which people can cook ... ”
Industrial incinerators from Europe would cost $ 50 million .
“ This was way out of the realms of reality ... and it would n’t give anything back , ” Archer said .
He set out to design and find financing for a simple , labor intensive device with a minimum of moving parts that would be easy to repair and require no imported technology .
Archer consulted engineering companies in Britain .
“ They just could n’t understand simplicity .
They could computer control it .
They could mechanically handle the rubbish .
But we want this to be labor intensive because there are so many people with no jobs . ”
FIREBOX FRANCIS
Then Archer found brass foundry worker Francis Gwehonah , nicknamed “ Firebox ” because of his remarkable self - taught skill at furnace building .
“ It is a talent in me .
I have n’t gone through any kind of training , ” says Gwehonah .
First attempts to burn the rubbish produced choking smoke and soot that brought complaints from Kibera residents that the cooker caused more pollution than it eliminated .
By trial and error Gwehonah found that if he superheated a steel plate in the cooker he could ignite discarded sump oil , another pollutant .
By vaporizing droplets of water to split off the oxygen and mixing it with the burning oil , he has pushed up the temperature to more than 600 degrees centigrade and is working to get it even higher to destroy all the toxins in the smoke .
The scheme , run by a community group in Kibera ’s Laini Saba area , where 50,000 people live , has more benefits than burning garbage .
Local youth workers who go door to door collecting rubbish -- for which they are paid a small fee by slum dwellers -- can exchange it for cooking time or hot washing water .
John Githinji , from the 40 - strong youth group that collects the rubbish , stoked the furnace with sweat pouring from his face .
“ People throw rubbish on the ground and it causes sickness , ” he grunted through the smoke .
Water will also be boiled for drinking and eventually the cooker will be used for baking bread and cakes to sell .
“ The trash has started to help us a bit after the cooker came .
There are less diseases like diarrhea and the environment has improved .
... I think burning the rubbish will bring good health to this community , ” said Patricia Ndunge as she fried onions on the cooker .
About 60 percent of the slum rubbish can be burned if the temperature is high enough .
Much of the rest can be sold to recycling companies .
The project , funded by Archer and his business partner , UNEP and a local paints company , has cost around $ 150,000 to develop , but once the prototype is perfected , future cookers should cost less than $ 10,000 .
Kenya ’s big supermarket chain Nakumatt has pledged to fund at least 20 more slum cookers and Archer believes they can eventually be adapted to distil dirty water , fire pottery kilns and operate scrap metal foundries .
“ Most people dump in rivers and roadsides , on top of roofs , or on railway sidings .
Finally there is somewhere we can take our waste , ” said Celine Achieng of the Umande Trust NGO working in Kibera , where more than 800,000 people live .
“ This will solve a lot of problems .
We are trying to change perceptions to persuade people not to take their waste to the river . ”
Soy shakes , golden retrievers , squat thrusts .
These are n't the makings of a week - long bender in Vegas , unless you happen to be Marquis de Sade .
However , the human brain is a mysterious lump of meat , and under rare circumstances the mind can become hooked on all sorts of things that are usually completely innocent or even commendable .

The horrifying reality :
The most prominent modern bibiliomaniac was Stephen Carrie Blumberg .
From 1974 to 1990 , this bookish chap raided the archives of about 185 North American universities .
When the FBI finally raided his Ottumwa , Iowa home , the feds discovered 28,000 stolen books and manuscripts he had been compulsively hoarding .
Bibliomaniacs like him do n't necessarily read their books or even collect valuable ones .
They just collect them out of a compulsive need to have a fuckload of books .
So you could be a bibliomaniac while remaining completely illiterate , though you could build a kick - ass fort .

By the way , after Blumberg spent 4.5 years in prison for stealing all those books , he was rearrested in July 2003 for stealing , um , doorknobs .
Figure that one out .
Warning Signs :
Technology has obviously made books unnecessary , so the sight of even one book in a friend 's home should be cause for concern .
If the person has gone as far as to purchase an entire special shelf to hold all of his books , it 's probably time for an intervention .
This first post is composed of 2 pieces .
First is an introduction and an explanation by Dr Hall why EROI analysis is important .
The second part lays out a request to theoildrum.com readership for helping contribute to this net energy data effort .
This post will be followed every Tuesday in April with Dr. Halls students preliminary analysis on four energy sectors : 1 ) conventional fossil fuels , 2 ) Nuclear fuels 3 ) solar fuels and 4 ) geologic sources .
Please try and help Dr. Hall with this meta- analysis with suggestions , criticism , and sourced comments .
This first post has no data , so there will be an opportunity for readers to discuss any theoretical issues regarding EROI and net energy analysis before starting into the actual numbers next week .
This is the first of a six part series of guest posts by Professor Charles Hall of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and his students and collaborative researchers .
Professor
Hall previously posted on TOD , " At $ 100 Oil , What Can the Scientist Say to the Investor ? "
Professor
Hall has endeavored to update and improve the state of net energy analysis as he believes ( as do I ) , that future energy policy decisions should at least be guided , if not directly steered using biophysical principles .
The opinions on the importance of net energy analysis as a tool for addressing our looming energy crisis are quite disparate , but without some science grounded in physical principles , we are left to rely on the market .
The unfolding international credit crisis highlights the dangers of relying on strictly fiat monetary measures for biophysical planning – credit and debt can be created with no underlying physical foundation .
Why EROI matters

Making investment decisions
Society usually makes its economic decisions , at least those not predicated by personal greed at the expense of others or strictly political considerations , on economic analysis and most explicitly via either non government market decisions or governmentally - administered cost - benefit analysis .
Probably most decisions are made by people in the financial markets who seek to gain the best economic return on their economic investment .
Probably most of these people believe that their own best judgments , while of course subject to the vagaries of the market , are the best way that we can prepare for the future .
There is an implicit assumption , probably believed by most market analysts , that if they ( collectively ) make good financial decisions , based on market information , market projections and good hunches , then we collectively ( i.e. society ) will make the best investments possible .
Although there are certainly good rationales that such analyses make considerable sense , in many cases it is not so clear to me that they are an effective guide to the future of energy supplies .
This is because 1 ) few understand the degree to which most technologies today are principally a means of subsidizing whatever it is we do with still - cheap petroleum 2 ) today ’s price signals are unlikely to be especially influenced by future conditions when today ’s most abundant and cheapest fuels are likely to be much less available , for either geological ( depletion ) or political reasons 3 ) current prices of energy in the U.S. are greatly influenced by various subsidies 4 ) there is painfully little transfer of information from the ( rather limited ) scientific community that has examined the large picture of energy to the financial communities .
We propose to improve the information flow on these issues from the scientific community to the general financial community as well as to the policy world more generally .
Why peak oil matters
Our society is overwhelmingly dependent upon oil , which supplied about 40 percent of US energy use in 2007 , and natural gas , which supplied another 25 or so percent .
Global values are similar .
It has also been dependent upon their growth in supply to support additional economic growth , even with some efficiency improvements .
As of this writing there is considerable concern about whether “ peak oil ” ( meaning the point for a region , a nation or the world at which oil production no longer increases year by year but enters a plateau or decline ) has occurred for the world or might soon .
If this is true then the “ end of cheap oil ” might be , or might soon be , upon us .
Natural gas might not be too far behind , especially in North America .
Because of the critical importance of this petroleum for essentially everything we do economically there are major concerns as to what the financial implications might be .
A thoughtful although possibly extreme view of the implications of peak oil on the American Economy has been presented by Gail Tverberg at : http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3382#more .
An assumption of some who examine this issue is that since all that we do economically in the US is based on cheap oil and gas then the absence of that cheap oil and gas will have enormous economic implications .
Do conventional economics and conventional economic models and tools work only when it was possible to readily expand the petroleum supply ?
There is a strong view held by myself and others ( see references at end ) that because our main economic concepts were derived during a period of our expanding ability to do everything – i.e. that more or less regardless of policy we were able to pump more oil out of the ground readily to implement whatever we were trying to do , that conventional economic approaches may have much less relevance during times of contracting supplies .
In other words , are finances beholden to the laws of physics ?
I think yes .
Thus the question becomes : can we supplement or improve upon our ability to do economics and financial analysis by using procedures that focus more on the energy available ( or not ) to undertake the activity in question ?
I next attempt to make that case .
Predicting energy supplies and the importance of EROI
There are many , notably those associated with TheOilDrum and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil ( ASPO ) , who believe that they can predict the amount of oil and gas that will be available in the future .
This can be readily gleaned from their web sites .
The news is not good , especially over the next few decades .
Other , different views are available of course , both from the US Energy Information Agency and Cambridge Energy Research Associates , but even their probably inflated estimates would only extend the time until peak , not cause it to disappear .
In addition their predictions seem to have lost a lot of credibility due to the recent analysis of Morton , who showed that all of their price predictions in the past 8 years have failed miserably .
Most economists are not too concerned about peak oil ( if they think about it at all ) because they believe that markets will generate substitutes from which markets will choose .
But today ’s markets often give very misleading signals about the potential of various fuels .
The boom and bust of ethanol is an obvious example .
I have been working on this issue for 40 years and have no idea what might be an adequate qualitative and quantitative substitute for petroleum except possibly and with enormous difficulty something based on electricity .
One potentially useful alternative or supplement to conventional economic analysis is net energy analysis , which is the analysis of how much energy is required to make a unit of the energy in question .
Net energy is sometimes called energy surplus , energy balance , or , as I prefer , energy return on investment ( EROI ) ( Hall 1972 , Hall and Cleveland 1981 , Cleveland et al.1985 , Hall , Cleveland and Kaufmann 1986 ) .
Its advocates , including me , believe that net energy analysis offers the possibility of a very useful approach for looking at the advantages and disadvantages of a given fuel and offers the possibility of looking into the future in a way that markets seem unable to do .
Its advocates also believe that in time real market prices must approximately reflect comprehensive EROIs , at least if corrections for quality are made and subsidies removed .
Thus can we make market decisions based on biophysical , rather than market , economic analysis ?
At a minimum I believe that biophysical analysis can add a great deal of insight to traditional market analysis .
The current literature on net energy analysis , such as it is , tends to be mostly about whether a given project is or is not a net surplus , that is whether there is a gain or a loss in energy from e.g. making ethanol from corn ( see June 23 , 2006 issue of Science Magazine for a fairly thorough discussion of this issue ) .
The general criteria used by much of the current debate is focused on the “ energy break even ” issue , that is whether the energy returned as fuel is greater than the energy invested in growing or otherwise obtaining it .
If so then the general argument seems to be that the fuel or project “ should be done ” , and if not then it should not .
Obviously this issue is clearest when one might be discussing whether the fuel requires more energy for its production than is delivered in the product , a claim held by several of the participants ( most notably Pimentel and Patzek 2005 discussed in the above issue of Science ) in the current debate about corn-derived ethanol .
Others ( summarized in e.g. Farrell et al. , 2006 ) argue that ethanol from corn has a clear energy surplus , with from 1.2 to 1.6 units of energy delivered for each unit invested .
Further aspects of this argument center around whether one should include co-products ( such as residual animal feed ) , the quality of the fuels used and produced ( liquid – presumably more valuable -- vs. solid and gaseous , for example ) and whether or not to consider the energy required to compensate for environmental impacts in the future e.g. for the significant soil erosion occasioned by corn production .
Such arguments are likely to be much more important in the future as other relatively low quality fuels are increasingly considered or developed to replace oil and gas , both of which are likely to be more expensive and probably less available in the not so distant future .
If , of course , the alternatives require much oil and or gas for their production , which is usually the case , then an increase in the price of petroleum will not necessarily make the alternatives cheap and more available as a fuel .
And , as we have seen , the use of biomass fuels an have enormous and generally adverse ripple effects though the world ’s food and environmental systems that were completely unpredicted by narrow market analysis .
Why EROI matters — what information can it give about the future
I believe that EROI can give the investor or the publics a great deal of information that markets cannot .
These are summarized below :
1 ) Markets can give you information only about the cost of exploiting a fuel , which usually today has nothing to do with making or even necessarily finding it in the future .
Case in point is petroleum : today globally we find only one barrel for each 4 or 5 that we extract , so that we are basically pumping out known reservoirs .
Hence we are not paying , assuming that we could , the cost of finding the replacement or of making some substitute .
We are just emptying our tanks .
Time trends and predictions of EROI can give you a much better insight into what the costs relative to the gains are likely to be in the future .
2 ) Nevertheless energy investments on the whole probably cannot fail to give the investor a profit .
If costs go up , so will prices .
If depletion of high quality fuels occurs whatever energy is left is likely to be worth more .
Society as it has existed for 100 years simply cannot operate without energy , probably more or less as much as it can get .
But while the investor might be satisfied the general economy will suffer , and indeed that is beginning to happen .
I believe that even the sub - prime mess is about increasing oil prices increasingly removing once - discretionary income that had allowed the speculation .
3 ) Essentially all information that we have indicates that the EROI for our major fuels ( solar may be an exception ) are declining over time , so that in the future society will be having to invest much more money and energy into getting the necessary fuel to run the economy than we do now ( e.g. Hall et al. in press ) .
Thus we can tell investors that this is not a good time to invest in additional Caribbean hotels , new restaurants and so on .
Both society and individual people will be spending far more of their income on just getting the energy to make the economy work , , resulting in a serious diminution of discretionary income and everything dependent upon it ( e.g .
Hall et al. in press , http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3412 )
4 ) EROI can be used to help evaluate which alternative fuels are likely to be the most viable economically in the future ( See the “ balloon ” graph in the above post ) ) .
Those investors who had used EROI information to guide investments in the last few years avoided being burned in the corn - based ethanol boom and bust .
Similarly , science can tell you now that we have not yet broken down cellulose on a commercial scale , and that to maintain the conditions where this has been done in the laboratory on a large scale is extremely difficult .
So much for the present - day advocates of switchgrass and other cellulosic alcohol .
Maybe we can do it , but should we bet the house on a maybe ?
5 ) EROI can be combined with estimates of the total magnitude of resources to indicate which fuels are likely to be able to make significant additions to US energy resources .
For example , rapeseed is an attractive potential for biodiesel but the entire area in which rapeseed can be grown with a significant net energy gain probably is not enough to make a substantial contribution to the US liquid fuels budget .
6 ) Environmental issues can be included in EROI analyses , allowing a more comprehensive analysis of EROI .
For example if growing a biofuel causes soil erosion the energy cost of making fertilizer to restore the fertilizer can be readily factored in .
Thus there are many reasons that good energy and EROI analysis can help guide the policymakers , investors and interested members of the public .
Part II
REQUEST FOR HELP TO READERS OF THE OIL DRUM
I have been involved in attempting to examine the relation of energy costs and gains of various living creatures ( e.g. migrating fish , trees growing at different places on a mountain ) and of energy used by humans ( e.g. petroleum , coal , nuclear , biomass ) for most of my professional career , that is since 1968 .
Various publications on this issue are available at my website ( http://www.esf.edu/efb/faculty/hall.htm).
It is my opinion that such energy return on investment ( EROI ) analyses are critical for how we understand our future energy possibilities and also about how we should make investment decisions about energy now .
For example , from the perspective of society ( but not necessarily the individual investor ) it might appear to make a lot of sense to invest in oil at the present time , when substantial amounts of oil might be forthcoming and prices are good , but if in fact what we are doing is simply accelerating the depletion of existing reserves , rather than finding new reserves , then the net effect is simply robbing tomorrow ’s Paul to pay for today ’s Peter .
i.e. accelerating the negative effects of oil depletion at some future time .
What we really need to do is to decide what might be optimum investments based on ( for our purposes ) the EROI for the present and as projected to the future .
EROI is of course not by itself a sufficient criterion to make decisions about which energy resources should or should not be developed , encouraged , subsidized or whatever , but it is an important criterion .
Obviously if an energy resource requires more fuel , or nearly the same amount of fuel of a higher quality , to create as is gained from its development then that is probably by itself sufficient reason to recommend against its production .
In addition , other things being equal , it makes sense to develop that fuel which has the highest EROI .
Of course it is rare that other things are equal .
The most important additional criteria is the potential magnitude of the resource .
In the United States , for example , really high quality geothermal sites ( such as the Geysers in California ) are rare , although low quality sites , with much lower or essentially negative EROIs , are abundant .
The second most important additional issue is probably environmental issues , and our analyses attempt to assess each of these .
Other issues that might also need to be addressed include : availability of , and impact upon , labor , land requirements , financial issues and so on .
“ Balloon graph ” representing quality ( y graph ) and quantity ( x graph ) of the United States economy for various fuels at various times .
Arrows connect fuels from various times ( i.e. domestic oil in 1930 , 1970 , 2005 ) , and the size of the “ balloon ” represents part of the uncertainty associated with EROI estimates .
( Source : US EIA , Cutler Cleveland and C. Hall ’s own EROI work in preparation ) Click to Enlarge .
The results of our long term and recent analyses have been published recently on TOD ( http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3412) as “ The balloon graph ” , a graph indicating the quantity ( amount used in the U.S. per year for various years ) and quality ( EROI ) of the main and possible fuels used in the U.S.
What we want to do next is to utilize the considerable experience of the readers of the oil drum to criticize and , especially , expand upon our recent efforts to summarize what is known about the EROI , potential magnitude and environmental impact of various fuels .
If you are interested I have prepared a preliminary summary of what we were able to summarize about existing studies of these issues for many different fuels .
This summary was prepared by a month long study of about a dozen Graduate and undergraduate students at my College ( The College of Environmental Science and Forestry of The State University of New York – i.e. SUNY ESF ) in May and June of 2007 .
While I felt that the study was fairly exhaustive our preliminary results have been criticized in various ways , especially from the perspective that “ There must be more studies than you have found ” .
I agree , and seek your help in this endeavor .
So we will present in TOD our summary in four sections in four successive postings of TOD and we seek your input .
The rules of engagement are simple : if you know of additional studies that would reinforce or refute ( or anything else ) our basic analyses then post them to TOD .
We seek especially objective results that are published in peer reviewed journals ( the normal gold standard of science ) and we seek to avoid self aggrandizing reports by interested parties – i.e. someone with something to sell -- or the opposite .
We are also seeking actual measured analyses vs. hypothetical assessments of where the technology might be headed .
We also would welcome the responder ’s opinion of the piece put forth .
We are also attempting to develop at this time , independently , a more explicit protocol for deriving EROI and associated criteria .
We recognize that a lot of the difference amongst different estimates for the same fuels at this time are definitional and especially relate to the boundaries used , an issue that we are attempting to deal with independently .
An example of the confusion we face relates to the messages that came in to the earlier posting on TOD of our “ balloon graph ” where as one responder ( mkwin ) states that there was a new study indicating that the EROI of the Forsmark nuclear power in Europe was some 93 returned for one invested .
But the next responder ( Chris ) stated that since the enriched fuel had been provided by France , where some 3 of 21 or so nuclear plants were required to enrich the fuel used by the 21 plants then the maximum EROI would be about 7 to 1 , something , more in line with our own earlier conclusions .
Or is it ?
So we will see how this goes , filter the responses and try to get a more substantive basis for our various EROI estimates from the results .
So if you are interested in this issue read on .
The four sections that will be posted are : 1 ) conventional fossil fuels 2 ) Nuclear fuels 3 ) geological sources and 4 ) biomass fuels .

A House subcommittee held a hearing today to consider legislation that would codify broad principles intended to prevent Internet service providers ( ISPs ) from slowing or degrading the delivery of certain content over their networks .
Once again , all sides of the Net Neutrality debate lined up to stake their positions while the House debated the latest bill addressing how traffic on ISPs should be treated .
At this morning 's hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's subcommittee on telecommunications and the Internet , ISPs warned that Net neutrality legislation could slow broadband deployment by imposing heavy regulations that would create uncertainties in the business model .
" The weak state of the economy is front page news , " said Walter McCormick , president and CEO of the U.S. Telecom Association .
" But one of the bright spots is broadband , " he added , warning that the law could put a " chill " on further investment in the sector .
Both McCormick and Kyle McSlarrow , president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , argued that the absence of regulation had allowed the Internet to prosper , and that supporters of the bill still had not demonstrated that a real problem exists .
Ed Markey , the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the subcommittee , introduced the bill in February with Chip Pickering , a Republican from Mississippi .
Called the Internet Freedom Preservation
Act , the bill would write into law the four baseline principles that the Federal Communications Commission drafted in 2005 about fairness in how Internet traffic is treated by ISPs , and charge the agency with holding a series of summits around the country to investigate the matter .
[ cob:Special_Report ]
Supporters of Net Neutrality legislation , which include groups as far - ranging as the Christian Coalition and the Writers Guild of America , commonly cite broadband provider Comcast 's throttling of traffic over the peer - to - peer ( P2P ) site BitTorrent as an example of why Net Neutrality legislation is necessary .
The practice came to light last fall and prompted an FCC investigation into ISP 's practices regarding network management that is still ongoing .
In general , the debate over the issue often splits along the party lines as well as debates about free markets vs. regulation , and whether excessive regulation of broadband providers will hinder innovation and providers ' ability to invest in high speed networks .
Markey 's previous attempt to push through Net neutrality legislation was shot down by a Republican majority in June 2006 .
During introductory remarks today on the hearing , the first since Markey 's bill was introduced , members of the subcommittee expressed mixed opinions , again split largely on party lines .
The bill under discussion would impose less stringent requirements on the ISPs , however , and the change in the partisan complexion of Congress in the last two years could give it a better chance in a floor vote .

The Stephen Colbert Pennsylvania Straw Poll That Makes A Difference
( NewsTarget ) A mass of plastic debris twice the size of Texas is still growing in the Pacific Ocean , fueled primarily by plastic trash generated on the land .
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch consists of 3.5 million tons of trash , 80 percent of it plastic , floating in a rarely - traveled portion of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and San Francisco .
"
With the winds blowing in and the currents in the gyre going circular , it 's the perfect environment for trapping , " said Marcus Eriksen , director of research and education at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation in Long Beach , Calif .
" There 's nothing we can do about it now , except do no more harm .
" According to Chris Parry , public education program manager for the California Coastal Commission in San Francisco , the garbage patch has been growing tenfold every decade since the 1950s .
This corresponds with an equivalent increase in worldwide ocean debris .
The debris is highly dangerous to ocean life .
Birds and marine animals may injure themselves by swallowing hard , indigestible shards of plastic .
Animals like sea turtles , which mistake plastic bags for jellyfish , may also eat plastic that is less immediately harmful but just as fatal in the long term .
" These animals die because the plastic eventually fills their stomachs , " said Warner Chabot , vice president of the Ocean Conservancy .
" It does n't pass , and they literally starve to death .
" Plastic , which is synthesized from petroleum , can persist for decades before beginning to degrade , making it nearly impossible to get rid of once it is produced .
Parry and Chabot agree that the best way to keep the Great Pacific Garbage Patch from growing is to reduce production of plastic waste and use fewer plastic products at the consumer level as well .
" What we can do is ban plastic fast food packaging , " Chabot said , " or require the substitution of biodegradable materials , increase recycling programs and improve enforcement of litter laws . "
Earlier this month , the German news magazine Der Spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a German source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in Iraq under Saddam Hussein .
The information , famously used by Colin Powell in his 2003 speech to the UN laying out the Bush administration 's case for war with Iraq , came from an Iraqi refugee to Germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " Curveball . "
The source , an Iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories
Curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
Nonetheless the German Intelligence Service , the BND , passed on what he said to Washington .
Was this a case of Germany publicly opposing the war while placating the US behind - the - scenes by providing the Bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ?
The vice - chairman of the Bundestag 's Supervisory Committee for the BND , Free Democrat Max Stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
But , as he told DW - WORLD .DE , answers and possible action are a long way off .
DW - WORLD.DE : Who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ?
Stadler : No one .
The way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the German Intelligence Service .
The Curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
We are n't having witnesses testify .
That right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee .
The Spiegel report gives the impression that the BND gave Washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
Is that your impression as well ?
That 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
This impression has in fact been made in the press .
On the other hand , the reports also state that the BND under the previous German government sent a letter to the effect that the information from Curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
The letter said , insofar as I understand it , that [ the German government ] could not guarantee the information was reliable .
The committee is going to take another look at that .
But what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct .
Lawrence Wilkerson , the chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell , has accused the BND of hindering CIA attempts to question Curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the Iraq War .
That 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ?
Colin Powell cited the bogus info in urging for war
I do n't know precisely how things developed .
I 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before I can say anything about that .
But I would say , generally speaking , that the Iraq War was a long time coming .
Much of the opinion in the US had been formed before the Curveball testimony .
I personally cannot imagine that one intelligence report from Germany would have been the all - decisive factor for the American government back then .
German officially refused to join the US - led coalition in Iraq .
But reports repeatedly surface about Germany sharing intelligence with the US and thereby helping America in that conflict .
Does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ?
That 's precisely what the BND investigations committee is looking into .
The issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two BND officials were active in Baghdad .
The government said they were acting in the national interest .
But the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the Americans .
The government says that 's perfectly normal .
My personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the Iraq War -- and it certainly contrasts with what the previous SPD - Green government was telling the public at the time .
And precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
Germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing - on of information .
But when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up .
Some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people
What can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the BND or the government acted improperly ?
In principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
Even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
But there is an exception .
If two - thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
Members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
We think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
But we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two - thirds majority for making such a public statement .
Stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman
So the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government .
Yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
But recently the committee has made more and more use of the two - thirds option .
And that could well be the case again .
Generally speaking , intelligence services -- and especially US intelligence services -- did n't do a very good job getting quality information about Iraq .
How can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ?
I think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
They 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
But the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
And maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism -- instead of using them as excuse by saying " We had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
Ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds .

Matt Reed was 1,500 meters into the last segment of the triathlon when he found himself gasping for oxygen .
His legs were still pounding away at the pavement , his body pumped up after cruising through the swimming and cycling contests , but his lungs were shutting down .
The 32 - year - old triathlete from Boulder , Colo. , blames air pollution for triggering his asthma attack during the September track meet .
If he returns to Beijing for the Olympics , he says , he will wear a mask except while competing .
And he ’ll try to avoid showing up here until the second week of the Games , when the triathlon is held , even though that would mean missing the Aug. 8 opening ceremonies .
An increasing number of athletes are threatening to skip part or all of the Olympics because they believe the air is unsafe .

Belgian tennis champion Justine Henin said she probably would skip Beijing entirely because of fears the air would aggravate her asthma .
The world - record holder in the marathon , Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia , broke something of an unofficial taboo on complaining about the air when he announced Monday that he would not run the marathon in Beijing , opting instead for the 10,000 - meter run , which is easier on the lungs .
Training offshore
Many teams have set up offshore training camps in South Korea or Japan , murmuring polite but shallow excuses to their Chinese hosts that they are avoiding the pre-Olympics media hype or trying to save money .
“ There is no other reason but to stay out of the pollution .
It ’s definitely to avoid the air , ” said Reed , who if he qualifies will be training with the other U.S. triathletes on South Korea ’s Cheju island .
“ This air [ in Beijing ] is just so terrible for your body . ”

The British Olympic Assn. commissioned scientists to develop a high - tech breathing mask for its athletes to wear while competing .
U.S. Olympic officials say their athletes will not wear masks in competition , but might at other times during their stay in Beijing .
For the Chinese , for whom saving face is crucial , it would be a nightmare to have athletes parade on camera wearing masks , or for there to be a raft of no -shows at the opening ceremony .
The country says it has invested more than $ 16 billion in cleaning up Beijing ’s air for the Olympics .
The Chinese pride themselves on mastering nature ; in this case , they have literally tried to move heaven and earth .
Working under the auspices of the futuristic - sounding Bureau of Weather Modification , scientists have been practicing techniques to induce rain showers before the Games that would wash away pollutants .
Beijing ’s planners have created almost overnight a forest twice the size of New York ’s Central Park on a 1,750 - acre site just north of the Olympic village in order to raise oxygen levels .
Nearly a dozen factories are in the process of closing or relocating outside Beijing , including a massive steelworks with 120,000 employees .
Factories hundreds of miles away in the Inner Mongolia region and Shanxi , Hebei and Shandong provinces will suspend operations during the Olympic period .
About 1.5 million cars -- half of those in the city -- will be banned from the streets during the same period .
Beijing recently improved emission standards for automobiles and opened new subway lines .

Zhang Lijun , deputy director of China ’s State Environmental Protection Agency , told reporters at a news conference Tuesday in Beijing that China would keep a commitment to improve air quality that it made in 2001 when it submitted its Olympic bid .
“ After we fully implement all of the Olympic measures , it will be no problem for the air quality to meet acceptable standards .
We can deliver on our commitment , ” Zhang said .
Beijing occupies an unfortunate location in an inland basin that is frequently swept by sandstorms from the Gobi Desert .
Mountains on three sides of the city trap the emissions of a booming capital of 17 million people .
The average amount of airborne particulate matter , known as PM10 in environmental jargon , is six times the standard recommended by the World Health Organization .
( By comparison , Los Angeles ’ rating is about twice the WHO standard . )
‘ Deep breath and relax ’

Jeff Ruffolo , a public relations consultant to the Beijing Olympics who grew up in the San Fernando Valley , says the concerns about air quality are similar to what he heard in the run-up to the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles .
“ At the end it was fine , and it will be in Beijing too , ” he said .
“ Everybody should take a proverbial deep breath and relax . ”
The Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee announced last month that major pollutants -- particulate matter , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide -- in the city ’s air had dropped 13.8 % since Beijing won the Olympic bid .
But one American expert , Steven Q. Andrews , recently produced a study that said many of the statistical gains were achieved by moving air quality monitors to less polluted areas of Beijing .
Many athletes are also skeptical of the claim .

“ We race all around the world , but I ’ve never noticed pollution so badly as in Beijing .
Sometimes we ’d go for a bike ride before the race , then you ’d get back and blow your nose and it ’s all black , ” said Reed , the triathlete who suffered an asthma attack last year in Beijing .
To prepare for the Olympics , athletes customarily train for extraordinary conditions such as high altitude or heat .
But to train for pollution would not be possible , short of racing behind a bus -- something athletes have actually joked about in the run-up to Beijing .
Jarrod Shoemaker , a 25 - year - old triathlete from Sudbury , Mass. , said that after racing in Beijing he noticed that “ I was so out of breath that I could n’t carry on a conversation , and if I tried to laugh , I ’d be doubled up with pain . ”
He intends to wear a face mask most of his time in Beijing , even if he risks offending the Chinese .
“ I know it ’s probably not the best statement to make , but I have to protect my lungs and body . ”

Jos Hermens , a Dutch sports agent who represents Gebrselassie , says that marathon runners who compete in hot , polluted environments can suffer permanent damage to their health .
“ You have to decide how much you want to risk for a particular event .
Will you put it all at stake for an Olympic medal ? ”
Hermens said in a telephone interview Tuesday that he advised Gebrselassie , who still must qualify for the 10,000 - meter race , not to run the marathon in Beijing because he already has two gold medals and wants to compete again in 2012 .
“ I suspect other people might follow his example . ”
Chinese broadcasts of the BBC and CNN on Tuesday night blacked out reports of Gebrselassie ’s statements .

U.S. official optimistic
In an e-mailed response to questions , U.S. Olympic committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said he did not know of any U.S. athletes who were considering dropping out because of air pollution .
He also said the United States would discourage athletes from missing the opening ceremonies .
“ We have confidence the air quality during the Games will be at a level that is safe and suitable for elite - level athletic competition , ” Seibel wrote in the response .
In addition to the triathlon team training in South Korea , American rowers will prepare on the west coast of Japan .

Not every athlete , however , is worried .
Donny Robinson , a 24 - year - old cyclist from the Napa Valley , says that some of his fellow athletes are getting hysterical .
“ It ’s all mental with everybody .
If they worry so much , it will affect their performance , ” Robinson said .
“ I know the Chinese are going to do everything in their power to make the air amazing . ”
And at least some Beijing residents appreciate all the fuss about the athletes ’ lungs .
After all , they will be breathing the same air .

“ We Chinese are too tolerant .
We do n’t complain a lot like the Australians or the Japanese or the Americans , ” said Bing Xing , a 63 - year - old retiree who lives a few blocks from the new Olympic stadium .
Gesturing toward the construction site on a particularly murky afternoon , he said , “ As you can see , the situation is not good .
Whatever they do to fix it for the Olympics will benefit all of us . ”

Some of the torturers themselves
( see also
; see also
,
,
, and finally
) .
Of course , the U.S. has now admitted waterboarding , and admitted that it is illegal .
The War Crimes Act of 1996 , a federal statute set forth at 18 U.S.C. § 2441 , makes it a federal crime for any U.S. national , whether military or civilian , to violate the Geneva Convention by engaging in murder , torture , or inhuman treatment .
The statute applies not only to those who carry out the acts , but also to those who ORDER IT , know about it , or fail to take steps to stop it .
The statute applies to everyone , no matter how high and mighty 18 U.S.C. § 2441 has no statute of limitations , which means that a war crimes complaint can be filed at any time .
The penalty may be life imprisonment or -- ifprisoner dies due to torture -- death .
Given that there are numerous , documented cases of prisoners being tortured to death by U.S. soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan ( see for example this report ) , that means that the death penalty would be appropriate for anyone found guilty of carrying out , ordering , or sanctioning such conduct .
The general in charge of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq stated this week that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other top administration officials ORDERED that inhuman treatment and torture be conducted as part of a deliberate strategy .
This confirms what the Pullitzer prize - winning reporter who uncovered the Iraq prison torture scandal and the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam previously wrote Indeed , an FBI email declassified in December 2004 states that Bush signed an Executive Order authorizing torture here is the list of documents obtained through a freedom of information act request , and take a close look , for example , at this one , which mentions the " executive order " ) .
An expert on Constitutional law said that only Bush could have authorized the torture which has occurred .
It has also recently come out that , even after the torture at Abu Ghraib hit the news , torture still continues at that prison and , indeed , the U.S. is still torturing people worldwide .
Even to the casual observer , it is obvious that the administration has no plans to stop , but has instead been working tirelessly to make it easier to carry out torture in the future .
Let 's recap .
We now know that torture in Iraq was ordered by top officials , and that torture is continuing , notwithstanding the administration 's claims that it was only " a couple of bad apples " that were responsible for Abu Ghraib .
Making a potential prosecutor 's job easier , U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales wrote a memo in January 2002 to President Bush saying that America should opt out of the Geneva Convention because top officials have to worry about prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. § 2441 .
By attempting to sidestep the Geneva Convention , Gonzales created a document trail that can be used to prove that top administration officialscreated a policy of torturing prisoners , and that such a policy could reasonably have been expected to result in the death of some prisoners .
The U.S. did opt out of the Geneva Convention for the Afghanistan war , but .
Indeed , President Bush has repeatedly stated that Geneva applies in Iraq ( although he has since claimed that foreign fighters captured in Iraq are not covered ) .
Thus , there would be very little room for fancy footwork by defense lawyers in a prosecution against top officials concerning torture in Iraq .
And to the extent that claims that the U.S. has sent prisoners to other countries for the express purpose of being tortured are true , violation of the war crimes act by the highest officials of our country would be even clearer .
For who else but Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and other top officials would have the ability to authorize such flights ?
How could such a program be undertaken without their knowledge ?
And how could such a program be anything but the " ordering " of torture , or at least " knowing about it " and " failing to take steps to stop it " ?
The Abu Ghraib general 's recent statements about torture coming from the top and the existence of the " ghost flights " are important pieces of evidence for convicting Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Gonzales , and a host of other top administration officials for violation of the War Crimes Act of 1996 .
Upon conviction , they could be sentenced to life in prison , or even death .
Additionally , violation of the war crimes act almost certainly constitutes a " high crime or misdemeanor " which would allow impeachment of such officials .
